Video: Dont judge us: Mangala tells intl community
	
	Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera today requested those in the international community who are skeptical of the accountability measures due to be implemented in Sri Lanka, to not judge the new government by the broken promises, experiences and u-turns of the past.
	Let us design, define and create our future by our hopes and aspirations, and not be held back by the fears and prejudices of the past. Let us not be afraid to dream. Let us not be afraid to engage in meaningful dialogue aimed at finding solutions to problems as opposed to pointing fingers, heaping blame and scoring political points at the expense of future generations, he said as he addressed the 30th UNHRC session in at the Palais Des Nations in Geneva a short while ago.
	He also asked the international community to maintain their confidence on the fact that a process of accountability would be observed with due processes to ensure impartiality.
	Minister Samaraweera asked the international community to shed their doubts on the success of an accountability process in Sri Lanka, while assuring the newly elected government is one that acknowledges the suffering of victims across the countrys communities and one that recognizes the mistakes of the past.
	He said the appointments of the TNA Leader as the Leader of the Opposition, as well as the appointment of the 44th Chief Justice in January were clear messages that indicate the dawn of a new era in Sri Lanka where every individual irrelevant of their ethnicity, religion, class or gender would be granted their rightful place.
	The Minister said the government has already planned for the establishment of the following independent and credible mechanisms for truth seeking, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence and the mechanisms are as follows:
	For truth seeking, the establishment by statute, of two mechanisms:
	(i) A Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence to be evolved in consultation with the relevant authorities of South Africa. This mechanism is envisaged as having a dual structure: a Compassionate Council composed of religious dignitaries from all major religions in the country and a structure composed of Commissioners that would allow the victims to discover the truth
	(ii) An Office on Missing Persons based on the principle of the families right to know, set up by Statute with expertise from the ICRC, and in line with internationally accepted standards.
	-On the Right to Justice - a Judicial Mechanism with a Special Counsel to be set up by Statute that accounts the right of victims to a fair remedy and aims to address the problem of impunity for human rights violations suffered by all communities. 
	-On the Right to Reparation - an Office for Reparations to be set up by Statute to facilitate the implementation of recommendations relating to reparations made by the proposed Commission on Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence, the Office of the Missing Persons, the LLRC and any other entity.
	- In order to guarantee non-recurrence - a series of measures are to be undertaken including administrative and judicial reform that includes amendments to the penal code to criminalize hate speech and enforced disappearances, the adoption of a new Constitution to address grievances of the Tamil community which would be carried out through a Constituent Assembly of Parliament that would be set up shortly. . .
	He went on to state that this accountability process will help restore the good name of the armed forces and it would thereby further contribute to peace and stability in the world through significantly greater engagement in peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.
	This journey may not be as fast as some may want it to be. And for some, we may have already gone too far, he said while adding however that the government led by President Sirisena and PM Wickremesinghe has the political will and the courage of their convictions to ensure that the country moves forward while breaking barriers of ignorance, fear, prejudice and hate. 
	Meanwhile, he also thanked the UNHRC members for placing their trust in Sri Lanka at the 28th session and agreeing to the deferral of the release of the international investigation on Sri Lanka carried out by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the alleged abuses that occurred during the final stages of the war.
	The Minister noted that it granted the government much needed space to implement its engagement with the international community including the High Commissioner for Human Rights and his office and to execute meaningful measures aimed at achieving reconciliation, strengthening democratic institutions and building confidence among communities affected by conflict for many years.

Drop charges for showing No Fire Zone": Malaysia
	
	The Malaysian authorities should end their prosecution of a local activist for her role in showing a documentary film without censorship board approval, Human Rights Watch said today.
	Malaysias Federal Court will hear Lena Hendrys challenge to the constitutionality of the Film Censorship Act on September 14, 2015.
	Hendry, a staff member of the human rights group Pusat KOMAS, was charged under the act for organizing a private screening of the award-winning documentary, No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka, on July 3, 2013, in Kuala Lumpur. If convicted, she faces up to three years in prison and a fine of up to RM30,000 (US$7,000).
	Prosecuting someone for the private showing of an award-winning film shows how determined Malaysian authorities are to stomp on the right to free expression, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director. The government should call off its intensifying assault on free expression and promptly amend the Film Censorship Act.
	Section 6 of Malaysias Film Censorship Act, under which Hendry is being prosecuted, prohibits the circulation, distribution, display, production, sale, hire or possession of any film, whether imported or domestically produced, without first obtaining approval from the government-appointed Board of Censors. The law defines film very broadly  and could potentially be applied to home videos or videos taken on a smartphone. Should the Federal Court, Malaysias highest, rule against Hendry, her case will proceed to trial.
	To date, the Film Censorship Act has been seldom invoked and Pusat KOMAS regularly screens films on politics, human rights, culture, and other issues without censorship board approval, with admission by pre-registration only. The charges against Hendry appear to have been primarily motivated by the Malaysian governments desire to appease Sri Lankan embassy officials, who had publicly demanded that the film not be shown and visited the venue, the Kuala Lumpur Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall, on the day of the films showing to urge the venues managers to cancel the event. No Fire Zone concerns war crimes committed in the last months of Sri Lankas civil war, including Sri Lankan army artillery attacks that indiscriminately killed thousands of civilians and the extrajudicial executions of captured fighters and supporters of the secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
	The authorities politically motivated prosecution of Hendry is contrary to internationally recognized standards for the protection of freedom of expression. The imposition of criminal penalties for choosing to possess or show a film that the government has not previously approved is not necessary to protect national security, public order, public morals, or the rights and reputations of others, and imposes a disproportionate burden on a fundamental right.
	Rather than acting like a big brother to censor films Malaysians have a right to see, the government should change the law that allows this misuse of power, Robertson said. Malaysians should never have to fear arrest for organizing a film festival or going to watch a movie.

Fitch affirms Citibank N.A.-Colombo branch at AAA(lka)
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Citibank N.A.- Colombo Branchs (CitiSL) National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka).The Outlookis Stable.
CitiSLs rating is the highest on the National Rating scale and reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Citibank, N.A. (A+/Stable). Citibank, N.A.s rating is higher than Sri Lankas Long-Term Local and Foreign Currency Issue Default Ratings (IDRs) of BB-/Stable, and as a result CitiSLs rating on the National Rating scale is mapped to AAA(lka).
The rating is linked with Citibank, N.A.s IDR because of CitiSLs legal status as a branch of Citibank, N.A., which makes it a part of the same legal entity. Fitch believes that support from Citibank, N.A. would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka.
CitiSLs strategic objectives are aligned with that of Citigroup. The branch is integrated into global operations through utilisation of common systems, such as groups core banking and anti-money laundering systems, and through regular reporting, including periodic internal audits.
CitiSLs loan book contracted by 3.3 percent in 1H15, in line with the declines recorded by other Fitch-rated foreign bank branches in Sri Lanka. Loans accounted for 24% of its total assets at end-1H15 (2014: 24 percent), lower than the ratio of its peers. CitiSL has consistently maintained sound asset quality with no non-performing loans since 2009.
The branch remains focused on its narrowly defined corporate customer base, reflecting CitiSLs focus on exposures that meet the groups return parameters. As a result, its loan book is significantly concentrated, with the five largest loans accounting for 50 percent of total lending
at end-1H15.
Operations are largely funded through deposits (89 percent of total funding at end-1H15), although the branch has access to intergroup funding, if needed. CitiSLs Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio increased to 54.9 percent at end-1H15 and 45.7 percent at end-2014 from 33 percent at end-2013 due to retention of profits and a decline in risk-weighted assets. The branchs FCC ratio is much higher than its domestic peers.
CitiSL was established in 1979 and operates as a single branch. It accounted for 0.49 percent of the Sri Lankan banking sectors assets at end-2014. It is the smallest of the Fitch-rated foreign bank branches operating in Sri Lanka.
A downgrade of CitiSL rating could result from Citibank, N.A.s rating falling below Sri Lankas IDR. Any changes to Fitchs expectation of support from head office could also have a negative impact on the rating.

Hinting at the contents of the report on the international investigation on Sri Lanka carried out by the UNHRC, which set for public release on Wednesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein notes the findings of the OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) are of the most serious nature.
In the opening statement, which High Commissioner Zeid is due to deliver at the opening session of the 30th UNHRC session this afternoon he states that while the vision and commitment shown by President Maithripala Sirisena and the new government is welcome, the UNHRC owes Sri Lankans to ensure an accountability process that produces results and moves beyond the failures of the past.
I welcome the vision shown by President Sirisena since his election in January 2015, and the commitments made by the new Government under his leadership. But this Council owes it to Sri Lankans - and to its own credibility - to ensure an accountability process that produces results, decisively moves beyond the failures of the past, and brings the deep institutional changes needed to guarantee non-recurrence, the High Commissioner will note in his statement.
The report on the international investigation which came to be known as OISL (OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka), which was mandated through a US sponsored resolution in March 2014, was due to be released at the last UNHRC session but was granted a one-time only deferral. It is set to be released to the public on Wednesday (16) along with the high Commissioners recommendations and would be officially presented before the Council on September 30.

In keeping with Seylan Banks intention of promoting savings among children, a Creative till Competition is launched aiming children below 10 years of age. This is the first competition of its kind organized by any Bank in the island, and will reward the main winners with a package tour to visit Dreamworld theme park in Thailand. 
The competition consists of two aspects. First, children are expected to design and create a till (within the dimensions of length 8 inches x width 8 inches x height 8 inches) and make it as creative and innovative as they wish.
Secondly, the competition will reward the entrant who managed to save the most amount of money within the given period of time. The competition also offers many more attractive prizes toits participants.
Due to numerous requests, especially from schools where the bank maintains student savings centres, the deadline for the competition has been extended to 25th September to accommodate more entries. Seylan Bank branches would be accepting completed tills from 1st September onwards. Completed tills should be handed over to the branch where the Tikiri account is maintained. You could also enter the competition by opening a new account in the event you are a not an account holder.
Seylan Banks minor savings scheme, Seylan Tikiri, with a history of 23 years is one of the most favoured childrens savings accounts in Sri Lanka. The Seylan Student Savings Centres located in schools across the island play a vital role in acting as channel extensions in reaching out to the children to promote the savings habit.
While rewarding the child depositors with novel and innovative gifts, Tikiri also imparts and encourages the savings habit from a tender age. Seylan banks belief is if children get involved in banking practices from their early childhood, they will learn about finance, fund management and practice savings throughout their adult lives. 
Tilan Wijeyesekera DGM Marketing and personal banking, Seylan Bank said, The savings you make today becomes a wonderful gift for a childs future. The Seylan Student Savings Centers are run by the senior students of the school to whom the bank provides training.

The Finance Company improves performance in FY 2014/2015
	
		 		 
		 
			
By Shabiya Ali Ahlam
Good times have returned for The Finance Company (TFC), Sri Lankas first Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI), as for the first time after several years of unhealthy performance the entity has finally being able to steer its key performance indicator to thecorrect path. Despite having recorded a loss of Rs.1.84 billion for the financial year 2014/2015,1.7 percent higher against the Rs.1.78 billion recorded 2013/2014, the latest annual report of TFC shows that it has made progress in the area of loan disbursement, interest income, deposit mobilisation and recovery of non-performing loans.
The report highlights that the loss for the year under review was due to the impairment of some legacy balancesof Rs.158 million of the previous financial year.
Loan disbursement has increased from Rs.5.7 billion in 2013/14 to Rs.9.7 billion in 2014/15, while interest income recorded a considerable increase during thesame period.
Deposit mobilization increased from Rs.9.2 billion to Rs.12.2 billion, an increase of 33 percent. Furthermore, loan recoveries have also increased to a record level of Rs.10.3 billion when compared with the previous years collection of Rs.8.6 billion.
TFC noted that these comprehensive developments have contributed to drop the gross NPL ratio of the post 2009 portfolio from 8.3 percent to 5.2 percent during the periodunder review.
The company stated that as a result of this positive trend, TFCs cash flow has strengthened allowing the management to increase the monthly loan disbursement volume with a better outreach to get a steady flow of interest income to the institution intime to come.
Continuous new strategies implemented by the management throughout the period, havebeen instrumental in reducing the monthly operational losses which are mainly associated with non-yielding assets inherited from the pastsix years.
The new management was able to align TFCs overall business challenges in such a way that turned around some of the non-yielding assets to yielding assets making the Companys future more stable, stated TFC Chairman Dr. S. H. A. M. Abeyratne.
He stressed that to maintain the momentum; a vital task has tobe fulfilled by the senior managementby way of investing in human resources development, introduction of new processes with new technology,and enhancement of professionalism among the employees, giventhe highly complex andcompetitive financingbusiness environment in the country.

The delegation of the US to the UN in Geneva today stated it would engage with the government of Sri Lanka to develop a resolution on the accountability process of Sri Lanka that would gain the consensus and support of the Council.
These remarks were delivered by the head of the US delegation a short while ago at the 30th session of the UNHRC that commenced this afternoon.
Last month, United States said it intends to sponsor a resolution at this UNHRC session that supports the governments own investigation in alleged war crimes. This was announced by the Assistant Secretary of State Nisha Biswal during her visit to the island a few weeks ago, reflecting a major shift in USs policy towards Sri Lanka. 
Meanwhile, the EU delegation to the UN in Geneva said it would continue to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. (Lakna Paranamanna)
