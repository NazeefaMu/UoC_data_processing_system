Chathura wants senior Ministers removed
	
Gampaha District Parliamentarian Chathura Senaratne has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake and the Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa from their portfolios.
Because of these two Ministers the Government, which came to power promising to punish those engaged in corruption and bribery, had failed to fulfill the peoples aspirations during the past two and half year period during which it was in office.
There are 82 investigations reports on Frauds and Corruption alleged to have taken place during the last Government but yet no investigations have been finalised properly, he said.
These circumstances have led to loss of confidence of people. MP Senaratne, along with several civil organisations had requested the President to remove these two Ministers from their portfolios.
They have demanded for the change of these portfolios in the recent Cabinet reshuffle but those changes were not made.
However, he said that the issue would be taken up with the President again at a suitable time.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)

Kim Jong Un guides test of new anti-aircraft weapon
	
REUTERS, 28th MAY, 2017-North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has supervised the test of a new anti-aircraft weapon system and ordered its mass production and deployment throughout the country, the state news agency reported on Sunday, after weeks of defiant ballistic missile tests.
The Norths KCNA news agency did not report the exact nature of the weapon or the time of the test but said it was organized by the Academy of National Defence Science, a blacklisted agency that is believed to be developing missiles and nuclear weapons.
The North has been pushing to develop a wide range of weapon systems since early last year at an unprecedented pace including a long-range missile capable of striking the mainland United States and has in recent weeks tested its intermediate-range ballistic missile, making some technical advances.
The reclusive state rejects U.N. and unilateral sanctions by other states against its weapons program as an infringement of its right to self defense and says the program is necessary to counter U.S. aggression.

Sounds of silence as Russia probe pierces Trumps inner circle
	

WASHINGTON  AFP 
May28, 2017-- Donald Trump, just back from his first international trip as US president, geared up to combat concerns Sunday over aides ties to Russia including explosive reports that his son-in-law sought a secret communications line with Moscow. 
The latest furor was stirred up after The Washington Post reported late Friday that Jared Kushner -- arguably Trumps closest White House aide, and husband to the presidents eldest daughter Ivanka -- made a pre-inauguration proposal to the Russian ambassador to set up a secret, bug-proof link with the Kremlin.  Kushner, 36, even suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States to protect such a channel from monitoring, The Post said, quoting US officials briefed on intelligence reports. 
The report, if confirmed, would raise new questions about the Trump teams relationship with the Russians, who US intelligence agencies say tried to sway the November election in Trumps favour.

The versatile exponent:Prof. Siri Gunasinghe
	

The passing away of this colossal literary figure caused a sudden thud in my heart as I didnt expect such sad news so soon. Yet, the demise of a nonagenarian doesnt arouse many a feeling in people in general. It was a shock to me for many a reason. 
My academic career began at Sri Rathnasara Maha Vidyalaya in Baddegama, a few kilometres away from the southern capital, the city of Galle. There, my Sinhala teacher was the famous doctor-turned-writer Gunadasa Amarasekaras eldest brother Edward Amarasekara. He was one of the finest teachers I have ever had who helped me sharpen my literary enthusiasm. He left no stone unturned to kindle our imagination and unlock our potential to serve the prodigy in the rising generation. He always reminded us to read free verse, novels, critical essays and many a writing by Siri Gunasinghe, Gunadasa Amarasekara, G.B. Senanayake, Madawala S. Rathnayake, Mahagama Sekara et al. Siri Gunasinghes free verse style went very deep into my heart, revolutionizing my affective domain not in uncertain terms. At that time I wondered what would happen when these literary giants left us some day. It has happened to a great extent. How could a literary follower of this great veteran silence his pen Many an appreciation on his fruitful life would follow but I quickened my pen to top the list. 
Much water has flown under the bridge since Mother Lanka gained independence in 1948. In the tapestry of Sinhala literature, Siri Gunasinghe was one of the most prominent pioneers who made a clear boundary between pre-colonial writing and post-colonial modern writing in tandem with the above mentioned all-time veterans. 

"If my memory proves me correct, once he sat in the big chair of the Professor of Buddhism in a reputed university in the United States. In his numerous writings here, it was quite palpable to me that he possessed a profound knowledge of Buddhist philosophy. "

This great doyen of literary reawakening was born in the hill country. Panapitiya is a rural hamlet in Ruwanwella in the administrative district of Kegalle. Circumstances brought him to Kotagoda, Akmeemana in Galle where the Sinhala alphabet was introduced to him by his parents. He had his primary education at Kotagoda Sinhala School. His upcountry birth and southern upbringing seem to have put him on a sound footing. Mahinda College in Galle was the firestone that sharpened his literary prowess. He was able to secure a seat at the University of Peradeniya, then Ceylon University, under Sir Ivor Jennings. He read for oriental languages there with English literature.
ubsequently, upon the successful completion of his studies, he was absorbed to the academic staff in 1949. The Department of Sanskrit gained a new lease of life under his stewardship and in 1951 he left the shores for his doctoral studies at the University College of London. He earned his doctorate from Sorbonne and returned with new vigour to serve his native land. He might have been driven by the well-known Sanskrit proverb, Mother and the native land are more excellent than swarga. 
Professor Siri Gunasinghe was an intellectual of high calibre. It was quite evident in his writings on numerous topics. Metaphors and similes came flying to him when he took his pen for writing free verse and in my view, it was his forte. This great writer deserves to be credited for having inspiration from the west in this regard and giving an indigenous fervour to cater to the literary needs of amateur writers in particular and the connoisseur. He sowed the fertile field to reap the harvest later. Sri Lanka was able to reap a bountiful harvest in the subsequent years. He was a man of letters par excellence.
Sath Samudura, his maiden attempt at cinematography, took him to dizzy heights in filmdom. He could bag the film award of the year without any contender due to its artistic value that took the film industry down a new path. His pioneering efforts in the film industry paved the way for others to follow suit. His only documentary film Ranwan Karal attracted film lovers and left another footstep in the sands of time, indelibly. Almost all genres he touched illuminated with his wisdom and genius. His wisdom unfurled when he took the pen to versify his thoughts. Among his versification Abhinikmana stirred me to a great extent as I was passing my formative years of self-learning. Mas Le Nethi Eta and Rathu Kekulu didnt play second fiddle to any literary work of that period. Sinhala fiction after independence was detoured by Siri Gunasighe to take the literary path of Sri Lanka to a new dimension. The Sinhala novel was induced with ultra-active intelligence and imagination for amateurs to find new paths for its advancement. That is the quintessential quality stemming from his Miringuwa Elleema, Hewanwella and Mandarama. The Sinhala novel had just cut the umbilical cord at the western labour room when he brought succour for her rearing. 

"Professor Siri Gunasinghe was an intellectual of high calibre. It was quite evident in his writings on numerous topics. Metaphors and similes came flying to him when he took his pen for writing free verse and in my view, it was his forte."

Siri Gunasinghe is not another name associated with Sinhala literary world; it is a name that stands tall and will live evergreen in our memory. 
If my memory proves me correct, once he sat in the big chair of the Professor of Buddhism in a reputed university in the United States. In his numerous writings here, it was quite palpable to me that he possessed a profound knowledge of Buddhist philosophy. In the evening of his life he had domiciled in Canada where he breathed his last. He died a nonagenarian. 
The late maestro W.D. Amaradewa made his debut as a playback singer in his film Sath Samudura. Dear Sir, it is very poignant to imagine that you left us in a foreign clime. Yet, I withdraw some savings from my memory bank to pay humble homage to your yeoman service to enable us to stand on our feet in the arena of literature. 
SININDU SUDUMUDU THALAWE THARAKA PIPI WELAWE 
May you enjoy the supreme bliss of nibbana at the end of your journey in the cycle of sansara.

Third Globalisation (Glob III): Chinas One Belt, One Road (OBOR) Initiative
	
City-Hinterland Continuum: Europe as City, 65 Afro-Asia States as Hinterland
After such knowledge what forgiveness 
-T. S. Eliot Gerontion 
History is the purveyor of the future. All great changes till they occur, remain fantasies and lunacies as Suez, Panama and Mahaveli were once. After they took place, they were considered oh so inevitable. 
Karl Marxs humanitarian heart beats in a tangible world. Others too, vended humanitarian products but delights in their consumption needed to be postponed, to be harvested in unseen and unseeable worlds. Marx wanted these humanitarian benefits to be relished in this world itself. Workers of the world, unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains, he hectored value generators of the world, who saw a disproportionate share of the surplus value created by their labours, transferred as profits to private owners of the instruments of production and exchange and rentiers of wealth assets. Marx predicted, one and a half centuries ago, that inequality would increase and a greater portion of the worlds assets would be owned by a smaller and smaller proportion of the world. He has been vindicated. 

"Five hundred years of subservience to the West in different guises is part of Sri Lankas history. Post-independence offered the possibility of change: Sri Lankan rulers botched the opportunity"

Two globalisation eras created by private owners of wealth took place in the past 500-600 years. The first globalisation (Glob I) was through territorial expansion of almost every country in the European sub-continent (Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Britain, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden and even the city state of Venice) which took place in a burst of imperial assertion. Glob I was labelled the British period and lasted from the 1700s-1900s. The second Globalisation (Glob II) was the discovery of America by Europe, which led to the eventual dominance of the world by the United States (USA). It would have been far better for the world if Plymouth Rock had fallen on the Pilgrim Fathers instead of the Pilgrim Fathers falling on Plymouth Rock. Glob II, labelled the American period, is supposed to last from 1900 to 2100. These British and American-induced globalisations were step-by-step, bottom-up processes, not drawing from an overall model, except to declare open season on Mother Nature, permitting her bounty to be converted to profits, irrespective of environmental consequences. Globs I and II worshipped crosses of sterling and dollars. 
Both these periods of globalisation have now run their course, being sapped of energy and the world paying for their environmental depredations. The recently inaugurated OBOR by President Xi Jinping of China could be considered Globalisation III (Glob III), built on new principles and scaffolded with 21st century technology. It is a game changer. Glob III has come home, implementing Marxs humanitarianism, through a Marxian political party-the Communist Party of China. Glob III is an inclusive, outward looking, top-down process, taking place at a time when Globs I and II of inward-looking Britain through Brexit and the US with Trump wishing a nativist America to be great again. President Xi scoffed at these reversions of Britain and the US as locking oneself in a dark room. 
OBOR deals with the development of infrastructure public goods. These have long gestation periods which dont appeal to the private sector. OBOR has two vertebral rows, one the maritime silk road, coursing down the South China Sea, cutting across the Malacca Straits into the Indian Ocean and proceeding to East Africa, eventually moving onward to Europe. The second is the Genghis Khan route, the land silk road originating from China, cutting through Central Asia and into Europe. The demand market of both routes is Europe, providing her goods and services, originating from the hinterland of a 65 Afro-Asian supply side. 
To enable an unhindered supply of goods and services to Europe, public goods have to be produced in the hinterland, taking advantage of the economics of comparative advantage and delivery, benefiting from the infrastructure of roads, high-speed railways, canals, telecommunications, deep water ports, water supply, gas pipelines and airports. This hinterland of 65 countries has 60% of the worlds population and contributes to 1/3rd of the worlds economic output. The Asian Development Bank has calculated that to maintain growth, tackle poverty, fight climate change and serve the infrastructural needs of this hinterland, a continuous annual investment of US$1.7 trillion is required for ten years. OBOR investment is only US$1Trillion. To meet hinterland needs, there should at least be 15 more OBORs. It is said that OBOR is a new Marshall Plan. This is not fully valid. The Marshall Plan lasted four years and spent in todays dollars, US$160 billion. The vision of the Marshall Plan was to rebuild Old Europe: the vision of OBOR is to provide hope for 60% of the worlds population, in a sustainable manner. Glob III is an interrelationship, facilitating the new globalisation. Glob III is making history before our eyes. 

"Hambantota with its associated Mattala airport, would become a major competitor to Singapores air and seaports, the only economic assets Singapore has. Gawador, in Pakistan is a purpose-built warm water port in the Indian Ocean. It is terminus of the railway and road line starting 3,000 kilometres north, linking landlocked Sinjian in western and Central Asia. "

The Two Vertebral Rows (Crab Claws) of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) Initiative 
In the 1400s, China was an advanced civilisation under the Ming dynasty but a mysterious entity to the West, which was just recovering from its dark ages. During this period, China sent seven commercial expeditions to Asia by sea through the Malacca Straits under Admiral Zhang He, each reaching as far as the coast of East Africa. Each expedition was huge, composed of a fleet of 150 to 300 ships. The size of the Admirals flag ship, a nine-masted colossus 400 feet long, was not equalled until World War II. (For comparison, Columbus Santa Maria was 85 feet in length). The Admiral had 16 of these colossi. The flagship could easily have accommodated three of Vasco da Gamas command ships within it. (On one of his return journeys, Admiral He made landfall in Ruhunu of Sri Lanka and white-vanned a king, abducting him to China.) Suddenly, for no particular reason, these Chinese expeditions ceased, leaving the Indian Ocean. European countries rushed in where China had refused to tread. Political economy, like nature, hates a vacuum. Eventually, the European countries outlived their welcome and by the 1950s, Vasco da Gamas successors made their way back home. Glob I was over, only its obsequies remain. 
China is one of the longest continuous civilisations in the world. Apart from the last two or three centuries, China had one of the highest GDPs in the world. The last three centuries were a period of abject humiliation for China. European countries even compelled her to open her borders to import opium. On January 10, 1949, China gained her independence through battle. On this day on a podium on Tienanmen square, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China, Mao tse Tung, declared China has stood up. With its independence, China re-imagined the role State and determined what it should do both internally and in its relations with foreign countries. In 1949 her GDP per capita using 1990 constant dollars at PPP parity was $448, the lowest in the world. Thenceforth, it was a spectacular progress for China, one example being the humanistic elevation of 400 million Chinese from poverty, the greatest such advance in the history of humanity. Poverty is the most corrosive of polluters in the world. 

"Sri Lanka gained her independence one and a half years prior to China, inheriting a higher economic base. She was the richest country in Asia next to Japan. While China stood up, Sri Lanka stood down. At the time of independence, her two main export crops were tea and rubber."
Sri Lanka gained her independence one and a half years prior to China, inheriting a higher economic base. She was the richest country in Asia next to Japan. While China stood up, Sri Lanka stood down. At the time of independence, her two main export crops were tea and rubber. Their surplus value, which was used to finance Sri Lankas commended free education and free health, was extracted from the fingers of heavily exploited young women. Sixty years after independence, her two highest earning foreign exchange earners have diversified but to housemaids and garment workers, the surplus value of both are continuing to be extracted through exploited young women. Sri Lanka refused to re-imagine the state taking advantage of her newly-acquired independence but only muttered about constitutional reform, document production as an alternative to development.
Sri Lankas democratically selected rulers drawn from all national parties in the post-independence period have failed the country. 
Five hundred years of subservience to the West in different guises is part of Sri Lankas history. Post-independence offered the possibility of change: Sri Lankan rulers botched the opportunity. Her temporary colonial history seemed to have become her permanent destiny.
The OBOR initiative offers one more chance to Sri Lanka to take her history by the neck and make a difference to engage in unheard of levels of development.
As seen in the map, OBOR has two vertebral rows, the Southern and Central Asian arms. The Southern Arm of the OBOR initiative is the resurrection of Admiral Zhang Hes routes but there are significant alterations.

"Both these periods of globalisation have now run their course, being sapped of energy and the world paying for their environmental depredations. The recently inaugurated OBOR by President Xi Jinping of China could be considered Globalisation III (Glob III), built on new principles and scaffolded with 21st century technology"

Two deep water ports have been built-one in Hambantota, Sri Lanka and the other in Gwador, Pakistan. Hambantota with its associated Mattala airport, would become a major competitor to Singapores air and seaports, the only economic assets Singapore has. Gawador, in Pakistan is a purpose-built warm water port in the Indian Ocean. It is terminus of the railway and road line starting 3,000 kilometres north, linking landlocked Sinjian in western and Central Asia. Sinjian in China lies on the northern land silk route. This cross-link between land and maritime arms costing US$ 60billion, is named the Pakistan-China Economic Corridor (PCEC), although an alternative name may be the Indus Valley Economic Corridor (IVEC). The projects have such enormous potential that Sri Lanka would be most unwise not to take advantage of them to lever her economy. But to do so, Sri Lanka should be serious about it. As a matter of urgency, Sri Lanka should set up at least at State Ministry level, a dedicated full-time body as think tank to study all aspects of OBOR and make recommendations to the Cabinet.

Golf legend Tiger Woods was arrested this morning on suspicion of driving under the influence in Jupiter, Florida, Jupiter police spokeswoman Kristin Rightler said.
Woods was booked into a local jail and released on his own recognizance with no bond a few hours later, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office's online records.
It's unclear whether Woods tested positive for alcohol or drugs. It's also unknown at this time whether Woods was the only person in the vehicle.
CNN has reached out to Woods' representative but has not heard back. The PGA Tour told CNN it would not comment on the arrest.
Woods has won 14 major tournaments -- second only to Jack Nicklaus -- and has recently expressed a desire to continue to play golf professionally despite a recent history of injuries. The 41-year-old Woods has undergone multiple back surgeries and hasn't played competitive golf since he was forced to pull out of the Dubai Desert Classic in February.
His most recent operation was just more than a month ago when he underwent fusion surgery on his back. Woods said in a blog post published Wednesday that "it was instant nerve relief."
"I haven't felt this good in years," he said.
Woods also said in the post that his long-term prognosis for returning to professional golf is positive, but that he won't be able to twist his back for another two to three months.
"Right now, my sole focus is rehab and doing what the doctors tell me," he wrote. "I am concentrating on short-term goals.
"I want to thank my doctors for their great work and support throughout this process. I also want to thank the fans for your phenomenal support. It means more than you know. There's a long way to go, but as I said, words cannot convey how good it feels to be pain-free."
This is not Woods' first high-profile mishap. In November 2009, the golfer was taken to a hospital after he was injured in a car accident in front of his Orlando, Florida, home. The episode mushroomed into a scandal in the days afterward when it became public that Woods had been unfaithful to his then-wife, Elin Nordegren.
Woods took a break from professional golf and later apologized for having extramarital affairs and for letting down both his fans and his family. Woods and Nordegren were divorced in 2010. (CNN)
