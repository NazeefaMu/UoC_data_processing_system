## Title: Ceylinco Life stronger at end of challenging 2015

Ceylinco Life stronger at end of challenging 2015
	
Life insurance market leader Ceylinco Life ended 2015, a year it describes as one of the unusual challenges, with a characteristically strong performance that kept it at the top for the 12th successive year. In this interview, Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan elaborates on the companys performance. 
Ceylinco Life is now a standalone life insurance company following the segregation of life and general insurance by law. How has this affected your business
Our business is as strong as ever! We have the same products, the same sales team, the same senior executive team and above all, the same passion, commitment and professionalism that made us the number one life insurer in Sri Lanka in 2004, a position we have defended and strengthened for the past 12 years. Ceylinco Life is one of Sri Lankas most powerful and trusted brands and will remain so. The segregation of life and general insurance has no adverse impact on how we operate as a business. In fact, we were always in favour of the segregation.
Does your financial performance in the last year support this assertion
The figures speak for themselves. Ceylinco Life ended 2015 with a total income of Rs.19.89 billion, a growth of 7 percent. Of this, the premium income accounted for Rs.13.4 billion, making the company the largest life insurer in the market for the 12th consecutive year. The growth in the premium income was more than 12 percent, which is very satisfactory. We recorded a net profit of Rs.2.060 billion for the year and transferred Rs.1.8 billion to shareholders.
How did the companys investment income grow in the last financial year
The investment and other income remained flat at Rs.6.74 billion, which is not surprising in the context of the interest rates in effect. However, Ceylinco Lifes investment portfolio increased by a solid 17.35 percent in value to Rs.67.1 billion, while the total assets grew by a noteworthy Rs.9.1 billion or 12.9 percent to Rs.80.2 billion. We pay a lot of attention to the prudent management of our investment portfolio, which is one of the strengths of the company.
What sectors are your funds invested in
At the end of 2015, we had invested more than half of our funds, 53 percent to be precise, in government securities. The rest of the investment portfolio comprised of licensed private banks 18 percent, state banks  2 percent, real estate  7 percent, corporate debt  19 percent and others (1 percent). These investments are made in conformity with the investment guidelines stipulated under the Regulation of the Insurance Industry Act No 43 of 2000 and are subject to regular monitoring by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka.
How did your Life Fund grow in 2015
Our Life Fund posted a net growth of Rs.7.99 billion to reach Rs.68.01 billion at the end of 2015. This represents a growth of 13.31 percent. Ceylinco Life was, in fact, the fastest company in the local life insurance industry to reach a Life Fund of Rs.60 billion, a feat we achieved in 2014.
What kind of growth did the company achieve in new business in the last year
We sold 170,007 new policies in 2015 averaging 14,166 a month, which is quite satisfactory in the context of the conditions that prevailed. Sales of retirement plans grew by a noteworthy 30 percent in 2015, which is something we are most pleased about. Overall, 2015 was a tough but memorable year for the company, particularly because we achieved our results in the face of unusual challenges, including an attempt to take over the company, which we were able to overcome without losing our focus on operational performance. Our 2015 results can therefore be viewed as a measure of the companys strength and resilience and its unwavering attention to business fundamentals.
How did policyholders benefit from the companys success
Benefits to policyholders totalled Rs.5.9 billion in 2015, which was a 21.7 percent improvement over the previous year. This included Avurudu cash bonuses to more than 14,000 policyholders apart from the Rs.2.9 billion in annual bonuses declared. The annual bonus pay-out in 2015 was the highest in Ceylinco Lifes history and surpassed the previous years by Rs.500 million.
So it would appear that Ceylinco Life emerged stronger in many aspects at the end of 2015
There is a lot of truth in the saying That which does not kill us, makes us stronger. The challenges we faced did not deter our performance and we certainly did end the year stronger than when we began it. One indicator of the strength of an insurance company is its solvency ratio, which is computed on the basis of admissible assets over total liabilities. Ceylinco Life maintained its solvency ratio at eight times the legal requirement in 2015. The solvency margin is one of the most important key performance indicators for a life insurance business because it represents a companys ability to meet the obligations arising from its life insurance contracts. The prevailing insurance regulations require insurance companies to maintain a solvency margin of not less than 5 percent of their statutory liabilities at all times.
Any other memorable achievements in 2015
There were several. One of them was the reaffirmation by World Finance, the respected UK-based magazine, of Ceylinco Life as the Best Life Insurance Company in Sri Lanka for a second consecutive year. This followed an in-depth assessment of key performance indicators. This prestigious award is based on scores accorded to the company on multiple parameters pertaining to long-term insurance. These include underwriting process/process efficiency; policy maintenance  the process of reviewing clients policies, appropriateness of coverage and cost per policy; exposure to risk; customer retention rate; time taken to settle claims; new customer acquisition rate and financial stability  premium income, life fund and market share.

Don't offer boats, fishing gear to SL: Karunanidhi
	
CHENNAI: Opposing the Centres decision to offer boats and fishing equipment to Sri Lankan fishermen, DMK president M Karunanidhi, on Monday, said that the move has pained the people of Tamil Nadu.
Citing reports on a Memorandum of Understanding regarding supply of boats and fishing equipments to the fishermen of Mullaitivu in Sri Lanka, he said, as per the agreement 150 fishing boats and 300 fishing equipment would be provided to the Lankan fishermen.
The decision has pained the people of Tamil Nadu and fishermen in particular, as the Union Government could not find a permanent solution for the problems faced by the Tamil Nadu fishermen, but it has come forward to provide assistance for the Lankan fishermen, he said in a statement here.
The Centre, he said, must take steps for releasing Tamil Nadu fishermen languishing in Lankan jails, release their boats seized, ensure that our fishermen are not attacked by the Lankan Navy at sea and rescue 63 fishermen from TN stranded in Saudi Arabia. The demand of Tamil Nadu people is that the Indian Government should not extend the assistance till these issues have been resolved, he sought
Meanwhile, the National Fishworkers Forum has welcomed the Centres move to distribute fishermen boats and fishing equipment. The Indian High Commission should ensure that the benefits reach appropriate beneficiaries, forums Chairperson, M Illango said. (newindianexpress)

Some Diyawanna members owning liquor outlets are highly irked by the ongoing debate over the propriety of issuing bar licences to their tribe. What they cannot really stomach is the holier-than-thou attitude of their own colleagues, they say.

Meanwhile, a certain Diyawanna member, an owner of several liquor outlets, hailing from an area known for its cool clime has railed at his party bigwigs over their duplicity regarding the question of issuing liquor licences to Diyawanna members. He had claimed that he had been using part of the income from his liquor outlets to meet the monthly pay of the employees of the party headquarters.
Liquor bars were welcome for them when these bars were generating money to pay the employees of the party headquarters. They have discovered that it is wrong for us to own them only now this Diyawanna member had told a colleague.

Govt. to focus on reviving film industry
	
The government will focus on reviving the local film industry from its present state, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Speaking at a function held to mark the 97th birthday of popular film personality Dr. Lester James Peiris at his residence, the Prime Minister said what had become of the local film industry today is an issue that should be looked into.
 Dr Peiris pioneered the development of the local film industry through his great work such as Rekava and Gam Peraliya but the issue today is to determine what had become of the local film industry, the Prime Minister said while assuring that the government will work towards reviving the industry.
 I still remember my mother advising me to go and see Rekawa which was shown at the Regal Cinema in Colombo in order to look at my aunty Ms. Irangani Serasinghes acting. Today she has stopped acting and I am continuing it, he said in a lighter vein.
Paying a glowing tribute to Dr. Peiris he said the latter had rendered a yeomen service to the local arts just like number of others such as Ediriweera Sarathchandra and George Keyt and many others.
He said the film Rekawa completes 60 years since its screening this year and a grand function will be held to mark the event.
Dr. Peiris in his very brief address thanked everyone who wished him well.
A book titled Lester Sri Lanka and Cinema written by Ajith Gallapaththi was launched to mark the occasion. (Yohan Perera)

Icelands embattled prime minister, Sigmundur Dav Gunnlaugsson, has tendered his resignation in the wake of a mounting political crisis over his familys offshore investments, local media have reported, but his departure has yet to be agreed by either his coalition partners of the countrys president.
The agriculture and fisheries minister, Sigurur Ingi Jhannsson, told state broadcaster RUV that Gunnlaugsson had resigned.
Local media said the move needed approval of both the rightwing Independence party and the president, lafur Ragnar Grmsson, before it could be official.
Reports said Gunnlaugsson would stay on as chairperson of his Progressive party, and Jhannsson would take his place as prime minister.
The leader of the Independence party, finance minister Bjarni Benediktsson, was reportedly in talks with Grmsson on Tuesday afternoon. (theguardian)

Lankans among migrants deported to Turkey under EU deal
	
Three boats carrying 202 people including four Sri Lankan migrants had been sent to Turkey from Greece on Monday under a controversial deal signed between the EU and Turkey, the CNN reported.
Greek authorities said there were 136 migrants on board the two boats from Lesbos -- the majority of them from Pakistan with others from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India as well as two Syrians who had returned voluntarily.
They said 66 migrants on board the boat from Chios included 42 Afghans.
According to Greek officials, the migrants had not applied for asylum. A Turkish official said Turkey has agreed to accept up to 500 migrants per day.
These migrants are the first to be deported under the auspices of a controversial "one in, one out" deal struck between the European Union (EU) and Turkey last month.
Under the terms of the deal, anyone who crosses into Greece illegally after March 20 will be sent back to Turkey.
For every Syrian sent back to Turkey, a vetted Syrian refugee will go from Turkey to Europe to be resettled, although the maximum number is capped at 72,000 people.
In return, the EU will give Turkey billions in funding to help it provide for the migrants within its borders, and grant various political concessions.
The plan was agreed upon last month as Europe struggles to respond to the largest migration crisis since World War II. More than 1 million people made "irregular arrivals" inside Europe's borders in 2015 alone, many of them displaced by the Syrian civil war.
The new rules may divert the thousands fleeing their home countries farther west to nations such as Italy.

MasterCards latest services deliver greater peace of  mind across Asia Pacific
	
MasterCard announced the launch of two new services that raise the bar on consumer experience and everyday peace of mind for cardholders across Asia Pacific: MasterCard IQ series, pioneering solutions designed to reduce the rising number of card transactions being falsely declined and Automatic Billing Updater service (ABU), which securely communicates account changes from banks and merchants to ensure a seamless experience for cardholders recurring payments.
In todays digital world, consumers are increasingly concerned about safety and convenience. Balancing the growing desire for greater security while maintaining the ease of making payments, these new offerings add to the recent expansion of our global Zero Liability promise and underscores our commitment to providing cardholders with greater confidence when paying with their MasterCard, said MasterCard Senior Vice President Network, Processing and Security Solutions Asia/Pacific Rama Sridhar.
MasterCard IQ series - Make informed authorization decisions
Delivering greater convenience through real-time intelligence, the MasterCard IQ series is a suite of pioneering solutions that help empower issuers and merchants to make more informed authorization decisions.
According to Javelin research, the value of false declines per year has hit US $ 118 billion  more than 13 times the total amount lost annually to actual card fraud (US $ 9 billion). The new MasterCard IQ series  the latest tier in the companys multi-layered approach to tackling safety and security  is available to issuers and merchants globally and supports all MasterCard brands and products  to deliver a convenient and uninterrupted payment experience for consumers.
The MasterCard IQ series includes two core products that provide insights into cardholder spending habits in a split-second:
 Authorization IQ  provides issuers with segmented account spending insights to help them make more informed authorization decisions. Unique and historical behaviour of the card is used to predict and assess risk against a current transaction, decreasing false declines.
 Assurance IQ  enables the exchange of vital eCommerce information from the merchant about the circumstances of a transaction. This enables MasterCard provide a blended risk score about the transaction to the issuer, enhancing confidence in the approval.
ABU - Seamless service for recurring charges
Each payment account maintains specific details to help ensure issuers can manage accounts using the latest technologies and security protections. However, when accounts expire or new accounts are issued, this process requires cardholders to communicate updated account information to retailers with whom they store their accounts in digital wallets or have recurring bill payments such as monthly subscriptions. To eliminate this inconvenience  and the potential to interrupt service  MasterCard now offers its global ABU service in Asia Pacific. Using ABU, MasterCard securely systematizes communication of account changes from banks to merchants, enabling merchants to provide cardholders with a seamless experience month-after-month and retain their valuable business.
At MasterCard, safety comes first, as demonstrated by a long history of leading the industry through investment and innovation that delivers multiple layers of technology  like EMV, tokenization, biometrics, location alerts, MasterCard Safety Net  to protect each and every transaction. As a result, MasterCard has become the safest, simplest and smartest way to pay.

Private hospitals under scrutiny from Health Ministry
	
Surgeons at private hospitals are mandatory required to monitor the recovery of a patient after a surgery and stay with the patient a minimum of one hour according to a new circular issued by the Health Ministry.
In the wake of widespread medical negligence, mishaps and kidney transplant scams at private medical institutions, the Health Ministry has introduced far reaching amendments to the Private Health Services Regulatory Council (PHSRC) Act of 2008 including the introduction of fixed price formula for medical care, drugs, medical equipment and tests.
In a circular to directors of all private health care institutions on the instruction of Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Secretary General, Health Services Dr. Palitha Mahipala says that the Ministry would monitor from April 1st onward all health related activities of private hospitals and take punitive actions against those who violate the provisions of the Act.
Accordingly, medical services, surgeries, diagnosing and prescriptions, issuance of drugs and their quality and effectiveness, medical equipment and laboratory services, blood transfusion, the time a doctor spends to check a patient and any other function related to health care delivery will be closely monitored by the PHSRC.
The Health Ministry has also decided to be strict on doctors and health ministry employees who play truant and serve at private hospitals during their working hours to earn an extra buck illegally. Punitive actions would be taken against both parties. The private hospital for obtaining the services of a health employee during his or her duty hours and the employee for betraying duty.
It is mandatory to issue a detailed receipt to the recipient of any service, drugs or medical equipment by the private hospital. A Flying Squad will conduct raids as necessary on private hospitals to ensure they do not charge exorbitant prices for their services, Minister Senaratne said.
Under the new amendments introduced to the PHSRC a special medical report will be prepared and submitted to the court by the PHSRC if and when a family decides to take legal action in the event of medical negligence at a private hospital.
The PHSRC will be empowered to visit any private medical institution at any time of the day and conduct investigations on any issue or complain.
It is a known fact that some medical specialists charge patients extremely high fees. It varies from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 5,000 a patient. Private hospitals sell drugs for normally five times of the price at Osu Sala. Surgeries are normally beyond the reach of middle class and cost millions of rupees. In short, private hospitals do not provide a service to the people because it is a business, he added. The amendments to the PHSRC Act will bring the prices charged for drugs, medical equipment, inward patient care, surgeries and medical tests to an affordable levels. The amendments are expected to give more legal teeth to the PHSCR enabling the Director General of Health Services or his deputy to entertain public complaints against private hospitals, nursing homes and private medical practitioners / specialists by the public and take legal action against them.
In Sri Lanka 50% of the population seeks state medical assistance and 10% seek private hospital treatment. There are about 250 private hospitals and nursing homes and about 1,000 private laboratories, channel services and ambulance services. The number of private medical practitioners spread in the country is about 10,000.

He said the Urban Development Authority (UDA) had begun the reconstruction of the walking path and claimed that this was unacceptable because the path was not removed by the UDA.
The reconstruction of the walking path should be carried out by the minister or others who are responsible for removing it. Rs. 80 million had been used to construct the road by the Government. These are public funds. People shouldnt pay another Rs. 80 million through the UDA so that the miscreants may get away with their wrongdoings, he told journalists outside the Human Rights Commission (HRC).
Mr. Watagala, accompanied by the Evergreen Environmental and Welfare Association members lodged a complaint with the HRC against the minister, the Land Reclamation & Development Corporation Chairman and Wattala Police OIC in connection with the removal of the walking path. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

A story doing the rounds in political circles these days tells how a young purohita who was having a tryst with the comely better half of a senior one of his tribe at the latters residence had escaped from being caught red-handed in the nick of time.

As soon as the senior purohita left his residence in his home town for Colombo, his wife had informed her lover that the coast was clear for him to visit her. And the young purohita had lost no time in rushing into the arms of his ladylove. The couple making love did not feel the passage of time and they had suddenly come down to earth from their ecstatic state when the young purohita got a telephone call warning that the senior one was on his way home.
The senior purohita had reached home just as his junior slipped away making a hair-breath escape. Soon after arrival, he had made inquiries from the domestic aides whether there were visitors during his absence and they had all replied in the negative.
However, the suspicious purohita had given his wife a tongue lashing, they say.

This political heavyweight very often emphasizes, from public platforms, the need for a righteous society with a high standard of morality.

And his daughter had recently obtained a bar license for the tourist hotel she owns thanks to the influence of this sanctimonious father.
Observers say that they see no wrong in issuing a license to run a bar catering to foreign tourists, but it is nothing but sheer hypocrisy on the part of the purohita to intervene to facilitate the issue of a bar license for his daughters hotel.

Too early for Sanga to be selector- Arjuna
	
Former Sri Lanka captain and Minister Arjuna Ranatunga today said he was dissatisfied with the Sports Ministers decision to appoint Veteran Sri Lankan batsman and former cricket captain Kumar Sangakkara as a member to the National Selection Committee, so early after his retirement.
Instead, Sangakkara should have been appointed to the administration of Sri Lanka Cricket, Minister Ranatunga said in a discussion held with regard to the current scenario of Sri Lanka Cricket.
He said a former cricketer should be appointed to a National Selection Committee at least five years after his retirement.
Since those who played with Sangakkara are still in the team, his appointment to the Selection Committee was not a wise decision, he said.
I also received an offer to be appointed to the Selection Committee just one year after my retirement. But, I rejected it because I felt that I might do some mistakes in the post with lack of experience. Those who played with Sangakkara are still in the team. Such decisions should not be taken by the authority, he said.
He went on to say that former cricketers like Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene could be appointed for the posts to develop Cricket techniques of the current SL national team players and new comers.
He also said that the Sports Minister should have a backbone to remove the current Chairman of the Cricket Board, due to problems after the new appointment.
The Board of Control should be dissolved and an interim committee should be appointed soon to save Sri Lanka Cricket from businessmen. Those administrators are responsible for the fiasco which has disturbed the team's World Cup preparations as well. We have good players, but they should be backed properly. The administrators should not leave room for the players to lose their hope and confidence at any cost, he said.
The President of the newly appointed National Selection Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket Aravinda de Silva said he would work in the post until April 30 as he informed the Minister prior to assuming duties.
He also said that a five-year future plan should be prepared to uplift Sri Lanka Cricket which is now undergoing a setback following continuous defeats in the recent matches and matters such as coaching, tournaments, players, umpires and officials should be covered by this plan that should not be changed at any time, regardless of changes in the Cricket administration.
He said investments should be made not for the infrastructure of Cricket but for Human Resource Development and attention should also be paid for the development of school Cricket System where future Cricket legends are born.
Speaking on the recently concluded T20 World Cup where the SL team embarrassingly failed, former cricketer Aravinda de Silva took responsibility as the President of the National Selection Committee for the setback.
He said even though they expected the combination of the team would be a success it was not so. However, he said Cricketers like Lahiru Thirimanne and Dinesh Chandimal need backing to encourage them in the future.
With regard to Lasith Malingas allegations that he was named for the T20 WC against his will, Aravinda de Silva refuted the allegations and reiterated that Malinga had expressed his willingness to play for the T20 via an email message.
He also said even though Malinga called off the T20 WC citing his physical fitness problem, everyone would be able to see in the future how Malinga would be fit for which sort of matches and when. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Tough action against those who violate party discipline
	
The SLFP Central Committee will sack the parliamentarians who attend the proposed rival May Day rally to be organized by the joint opposition on May, a senior SLFPer said today.
When asked about the reported preparation by the joint opposition to hold a separate May Day rally at Kirula Grounds in Kirillapone, th said he believed that no SLFP parliamentarian would participate in that rally by violating party instructions and discipline, but assured that the Central Committee would definitely take punitive action against any MP who participates in that rally.
It is true that the SLFP CC was lenient and did not take any disciplinary action against those who participated in the joint opposition rally at Hyde Park on March 17 despite strict instructions by the SLFP hierarchy not to do so. As a political party which gives a prominent place to discipline, we have decided to take tough action against those who participate in a rival May Day rally, he said and added that those who violate party discipline might probably be expelled.
Meanwhile, UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the main SLFP May Day rally would be held in Galle under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
"We have invited all constituent parties of the UPFA for the May Day rally in Galle and expect them to attend, he said.
The minister said he would not give up his efforts to unite the SLFP, as divisions in the party would diminish the chances of returning to power in 2020.
No one I spoke to was agreeable to the forming of a separate political party. I have already spoken to Communist Party leader DEW Gunasekara, MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardana, Deshavimukthi Party Leader Appuhami, parliamentarians Keheliya Rambukwella, Kumara Welgama and Udaya Gammanpila,who had earlier refused to talk to me. They all want to contest the forthcoming local government poll under the UPFA, he said.
The minister said the SLFP CC last week decided to suspend the party membership of 10 local government heads who failed to respond to the letters of explanation and failed to appear before the CC when summoned. They are, former Maharagama mayor Kanthi Kodikara, former Moratuwa mayor Saman Lal Fernando, former Walallawita PS chairman Udeni Athukorala, former Gampaha PS chairman Ranjith Gunawardana, former Attanagalla PS chairman Priyantha Pushpakumara, former Mirigama PS chairman Sarath Nandasiri, former Matale PS chairman Kapila Bandara, former Ukuwela PS chairman W.Somasiri, former Dambulla PS chairman K.G. Somatilaka and former Boralesgamuwa Urban Council chairman Aruna Priyashantha.
The minister said the local government polls would be held in six months, after the issues pertaining to delimitation were addressed and the necessary ground work was in place. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
