12 Chinese men with forged e-tickets deported
	
A dozen Chinese men who had obtained tourist visas to enter the country by producing forged return electronic tickets were nabbed by officers of the Department of Immigration and Emigration on Monday.
The men who were staying at a lodge on the Marine Drive in Kollupitiya were taken into custody by the Monitoring, Intelligence and Investigation Unit of the Department.
The foreigners had arrived in Colombo on June 3rd and 6th and stayed at the lodge in a discreet manner.
Upon being questioned they had told the Immigration officers that they were waiting for an agent to find them jobs at a construction site.
A Chinese national who already works at a construction site in Colombo had promised to find them jobs. They had had no intention of returning to China after the expiration of their 30-day tourist visa.
According to sources, the foreigners had violated Immigration law by entering the country with the help of forged documents.
The forged return e-tickets proved that they never intended to return after the tourist visas expired, the sources said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

STF nabs Peliyagoda constable for selling heroin
	
	In a shocking detection, the Police Special Task Force yesterday arrested a Police Constable attached to the Peliyagoda Crime Division for selling heroin, with 120 sachets.
	Amidst the Rs.30 million narcotics detection in Wattala on Sunday, a special STF team in a decoy apprehended the Constable on the road outside the Peliyagoda Police Headquarters yesterday morning while he had come to sell the sachets, STF sources said.
	The STF on a tip off took a middle aged woman and her young son into custody from Kandana, Ganemulla area for selling heroin a couple of days ago.
	Upon questioning the two suspects, the STF made a startling discovery as the duo claimed that they were supplied with the narcotics by a Constable attached to Peliyagoda Police.
	With this information the STF set up a decoy to purchase more heroin from the policeman who responded to several phone calls and agreed to meet outside the station to deliver the drugs.
	Upon meeting him, the Constable received money for the 120 sachets of heroin he was about to deliver to an STF sleuth in civvies and while the OIC Wattala Police who joined the raid was in close range.
	According to sources the Constable from Kurunegala had been serving the Peliyagoda Crime Division for over two years, which directly operates under the Divisional Senior Superintendent of Police.
	He had delivered 152 sachets of heroin to the mother and son on a previous occasion and was believed to have engaged in the illicit trade for sometime under the blessing of his uniform.
	It was suspected that the PC had sold heroin which were being seized by his police unit during various raids. Investigations are being carried out to ascertain whether any senior officials were backing him.
	He had sold a sachet for Rs.500 to his buyers and the mother and son had sold it for Rs.1000.
	The constable was handed over to the Wattala Police to be produced in courts. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

MS should have cracked down on pro-MR rallies: Hirunika
	
	Western Provincial Councillor Hirunika Premachandra said yesterday that if President Maithripala Sirisena had taken disciplinary action against those who had participated in the Nugegoda Rally which was held to promote former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Prime Ministerial candidature, similar rallies would not have been held elsewhere later.
	Ms. Premachandra said at a news conference in Battaramulla that senior politicians in the party were setting a bad example to junior politicians like her by promoting someone who had been defeated at an election and was attempting to conspire against the one who had won the election. She said that it should be stopped.
	She said if Mahinda Rajapaksa actually loved the party, he would not go to temples and hold meetings with politicians of other political parties but would instead join the party as a patron and advise the juniors to rectify their errors.
	We request those who engaged in activities that would harm the party to give up such agendas and work towards the unity of the party. We should protect the party because we have no place to go other than this, she said.
	The news conference was held in support of President Maithripala Sirisena on the grounds that a conspiracy was being hatched against him in the Western Provincial Council. It was attended by a group of council members, including provincial Ministers Gamini Thilakasiri, Hector Bethmage and Councilors Isuru Devapriya, Hirunika Premachandra and Malsha Kumaratunge.
	Western Provincial Councillor Malsha Kumaratunge said attempts were being made to force them to join the campaign to promote Mahinda Rajapaksa, and added that they would never leave the party for any reason.
	It is looters, fraudsters and rapists who are involved in the plot to shatter the unity of the party by holding meetings throughout the country. We should not allow them to continue to do that, she said.
	Ms. Kumaratunge said one of Mr. Rajapaksa's sons had threatened, during the presidential election campaign, that he would destroy the houses of those who took part in Maithripala Sirisenas campaign once his father won the election on January 8. We should have the freedom to do politics as we wish, she said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)

	UNPs calls for house dissolution mean that they cant retain in power. The current government was appointed to fulfil a set of promises including the 20A. Now, the UNP is keen on house dissolution instead of 20A. Therefore, a new government should be formed right away to pass the 20A and to deliver the promises given during the Presidential Election, the Thera told a news conference.(Darshana Sanjeewa and Lahiru Pothmulla)

Wijeyadasa: Domestic inquiry will be credible
	
	Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday vowed that the domestic inquiry, the Sri Lankan government would launch to investigate the excesses allegedly took place at the final phase of the war, would for surely be a credible mechanism for the global as well as the local community.
	Commenting on the statement that has been made by the New York based INGO, Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Geneva on Monday night that Sri Lanka should include a majority of international judges or prosecutors in the domestic mechanism it intends to establish to address the accountability issue, Minister Rajapakshe said the International Community must keep confidence in Sri Lanka.
	"I must say that our domestic inquiry would definitely be a credible mechanism acceptable to the international community. We are in constant touch with the relevant global agencies and organizations in constituting this panel for a credible investigation.
	Sri Lanka has also sought the advice of eminent persons like Sir Desmond De Silva of UK who has a thorough knowledge on International Humanitarian Law. The term of reference, formation and the composition of the inquiry panel would be known by before the UNHRC report releases in September," Minister Rajapakshe told the Daily Mirror.
	The global community has been much flexible and cooperative with the new government, he said.
	The global community has expressed its agreement and satisfaction over the style of the new government runs affairs - the maintaining of Judicial Independence in particular and the appointment of a Chief Justice adhering to the accepted norms and traditions, he stressed.
	He added the global community looked at Sri Lanka with suspicion during the office of the previous government.
	"Sri Lanka has given a pledge in May 23, 2009 to the Secretary General of the UN Ban-ki Moon that we would initiate credible mechanism to probe and follow up action on incidences of human rights violations allegedly occurred at the tail end of the war against terrorism.
	We cannot over-ride that pledge and we would definitely launch a domestic inquiry acceptable to the international and local community in our own way," Minister Rajapakshe emphasised.
	The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in establishing a credible and transparent justice and accountability process, the new government in Sri Lanka should ensure that any mechanism be either international, or at a minimum, include a majority of international judges and prosecutors.
	The rights group, delivering a statement at the 29th session of the United Nations Human rights Council (UNHRC) on Monday in Geneva, said the session marked a midway point in the time given to the Sri Lankan government to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate on human rights issues.
	According to the HRW the UN Special Rapporteur on Transitional Justice has noted that "it is imperative for Sri Lanka to take some immediate action to demonstrate its commitment to redressing past violations," including: Clarifying the fate of the disappeared; Addressing land issues; and the ending of continuing forms of harassment, violence and unjustified surveillance of civil society and victims of rights abuses.
	The HRW further said that in establishing a domestic mechanism, Sri Lanka should ensure genuine consultations with those affected by the violations and take immediate steps towards resolving key outstanding issues.
	The rights group also emphasised that Sri Lanka should keep its promise to the UN to fully cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and allow it full access to any new or additional information it may require. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
