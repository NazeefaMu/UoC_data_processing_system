Need final approval by Sangha, people: Gayantha
	
The new Constitution would finally need to be approved by the Venerable Mahanayake Theras and the people, the United National Party (UNP) said today.
Co Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka at a media briefing yesterday morning was speaking on the possible courses of action, which the Government intended to follow with regard to the new Constitution.
"Certain Opposition forces are trying to get political mileage by trying to show a non-existing monster. However, the new Constitution would be one that would be approved by the Mahanayake Theras and the common masses at the end of the day," Karunathilaka said.
He assured that no one would take away the status given to Buddhism by the Constitution.
He said both the President and the Prime Minister would meet Mahanayake Theras shortly and explain the real situation with regard to the Constitution.

New Constitution: New clause to safeguard Buddhism
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Saturday he would come up with a new proposal shortly to include provisions in the Constitution that would prohibit Governments from interfering with internal matters of three main Buddhist Chapters.
The Prime Minister said this at the opening of the Weli Maluwa at Ruwan Weliseya in Anuradhapura over the weekend.
I will come up with proposal to include a clause in the Constitution that the Government cannot get involved in deciding on the matters relating to the three Nikayas, followed by Sri Lankan Buddhists."
He added that Therawada Buddhism had suffered during the reign of King Mahasen, where the Maha Vihara in Anuradhapura was destroyed by the Vaithullayas, while killing some monks. The Vaithulayas were controlling Abhayagiriya and Jethawanarama temples at that time. It was these monks of Maha Vihara, who spread the Therawada Buddhism to several countries such as Laos and Thailand.
The Premier pointed out that after the division another generation of monks had to be brought down from Thailand and set up the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters. Later those who ruled this country decided to safeguard all the Chapters and made the Government bound by the Constitution to safeguard Buddhism.
However, this tradition was broken by the rulers of this country around five years ago. The Mahanayake was threatened by them as he allowed one of their opponents to hold a Pooja at Dalada Maligawa. They threatened to divide the Malwatte Chapter and set up another Chapter.
They went on to the extent of constructing a Stupa taller than Ruwan Weliseya in Anuradhapura, which is not possible as per the traditions, norms and beliefs. These rulers are bound by the tradition to tender an apology to the Mahanayake of Malwatte Chapter and to sweep the premises of Ruwan Weliseya and other sacred places of worship in repentance, he added.
He said he would bring in a clause to the new Constitution under which government intervention in deciding on the composition of the three chapters would be prohibited. (Yohan Perera)

Sealing of tills not new, says Prelate
	
Sealing the tills of temples was nothing new as it had happened to sacred temples in Anuradhapura as well in the 1970s, the chief incumbent of the Atamastana, Venerable Pallegama Sirinivasa Thera said over the weekend.
The Venerable Thera came out with this statement when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called on him on Saturday.
"Tills in the Anuradhapura was sealed by the then Minister of Finance late Dr. N. M. Perera," the Thera said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who replied, said that tradition was carried out in the 1960s as well. He recalled that tills of Kelaniya Temple were sealed in 1960.
It was mentioned at this discussion that the public trustee handled the finances of temples at that time until that responsibility was given to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs after 1977 during the time of late President J. R. Jayewardene.
Meanwhile, Ven. Sirinivasa Thera said that development of historical Ruwanweliseya should be expedited. He specifically stressed the need for restoring a historical circular pond at the sacred city of Anuradhapura.
The Prime Minister, who responded, said he would instruct the Minister of Education and National Heritage Akila Viral Kariyawasam to carry out a detailed study on the sacred city and draw up a plan to develop it. (Yohan Perera)

TN CM Palaniswami calls new Lankan law a set back
	
Expressing Shock at the Sri Lankan Parliament passing a new Bill to prevent Tamil Nadu fishermen from fishing in their traditional waters in Palk Bay, the chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said the new legislation was a severe setback to the diplomatic efforts being taken to resolve the issue amicably.
He urged the prime minister Narendra Modi to direct the External Affairs Ministry and the Indian Mission in Sri Lanka to lodge Indias strong protest against the move.
Under the provisions of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill of Sri Lanka, the fishing trawlers, as well as fishing gear used in the Lankan territorial waters, would be confiscated, fishermen imprisoned for two years and huge fines up to 50,000 Lankan Rupees will be imposed.
The chief minister urged the prime minister to direct the authorities concerned to immediately, appropriately and effectively respond to this latest move by Lanka which would permanently hit the livelihood of our fishermen in the Palk Bay, both by registering our strong protest against the move and ensuring that necessary provisions were made in the new legislation to exempt the traditional waters of Palk Bay from its purview.
Stating that the new legislation of Lanka would deny the fundamental rights of Tamil Nadu fishermen under the Constitution of India, he said moving such a Bill at this crucial juncture of transition towards a permanent solution it was nothing but a harsh step to undermine the diplomatic efforts of the Centre to sort out the sensitive issue.
Palaniswami further said a livelihood issue of this nature should be better resolved through promotional and development measures to introduce alternative modes and technologies, and not through such abrupt bans and punitive measures.
He also said that Palk Bay was the historic and traditional fishing area of Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu and the historical rights of the Indian fishermen were simply signed away as part of the ill-advised Indo-Lankan agreements of 1974 and 1976 which also unilaterally ceded Katchatheevu to Lanka without having any foresight or concern on the plight of our innocent fishermen.
It may be recalled that already 50 fishermen from TN and 143 fishing boats had been under Lankan custody and the state government had, during the joint working group meetings and the ministerial level meeting in Colombo on February 2, raised the issue of release of fishing boats.(Indian Express)
