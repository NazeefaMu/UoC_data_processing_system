Champika wants Sinhala, Tamil National School in Colombo
	
Megapolis and western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka today made a request to President Maithripala Sirisena to establish a Sinhala and Tamil medium National School with all facilities at the heart of Colombo.
Attending a ceremony to publicize the Laksetha Sewana housing complex he said a population around 0.2 million resides in the Colombo Central and even though many schools are located in the Colombo city, these residents are unable to enroll their children to a school in the close vicinity.
He also said that he believe the President would fulfill his request on a priority basis.
We believe that the president will implement our request as the ministry of education is carrying out a programme to provide at least one National School per electorate these days. We have agreed to build knowledge based economy, as such we should create an environment to improve the quality of education in par with international standards. he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Children of SL, other countries traded as sex slaves: Saudi Princess
	
Saudi Princess Amira Bint Aidan Bin Nayef has revealed that children, especially the orphans, from countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Djibouti, Somalia, Nigeria, Romania and Bulgariahad been boughtand rented as sex slaves in Saudi, Dhaka Tribune reported on Sunday. 
Giving exclusive statements to the French Newspaper Le Monde, she has said slavery in Saudi Arabia haddifferent forms, but it was done in secrecy and permitted only among the primary beneficiaries of the princes of the House of Saud.
Princes Aidanis the ex-wife of the Saudi Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, who was recently arrested in scope of the anti-corruption purges in the country.
She said those who accuse others of corruption and money laundering are in fact highly corrupted themselves.
Russian online newsportal Fort Russ has reportedquoting Aidans interview on Le Mondethat the corrupted had turned the city of Jeddah into a slave market where underage girls are being exploited for sex parties involving drug and alcohol abuse.
Princes Aidansaid that one of the main reasons why this keeps going on was that the members of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Sharia police) tend to keep away from the matter, fearing they might lose their jobs, should they intervene.
The newspaper quoted the princess as saying that a Hallowen event was recently held in Jeddah, and which was attended by 150 people, including employees of the consulates.
The scene had beenlike a typical nightclub anywhere outside the Kingdom, with available wines, dancing couples in fancy costumes and a DJ.
Bint Aidan said the children become the property of those who buy them and are not allowed to leave without permission.
Even the Asian maids who come to work often find themselves in a kind of slave-like position. Young girls are divided into smaller groups and exploited for immoral acts.
Trafficking of white women and exploiting them for sexual practices is also relatively common, the article said.

Collecting funds through Facebook page for kids in Matara
	
Helping Hands Project at work

Over the past five years choir mates Andreas Palbrand and Franz Lundberg Palbrand of Gothenburg Sweden have collected funds through their Fb page Andras&Franz Helping Hands Project to help the children and the differently-abled community of Matara. 
Since 2012 Helping Hands has provided financial assistance and equipment to many orphanages in Matara. They have established the Music for Youth (MFY) programme which provides free training on vocals as well as instruments to music-oriented youth. It is Helping hands that has provided all the instruments as well as pays the teachers wages said Conrad Francis Director of the Institute for Development of community Strengths (INDECOS) who assist Andreas and Franz in Matara. The Matara Childrens Center (MCC) was the first institution that Helping Hands assisted financially in 2012. A few days ago over 170 grade ten students were awarded Child Development Scholarships and also provided assistance for disabled persons he added.
We have been able to collect more than ten million rupees during the past five years from friends of our Facebook page Andras & Franz Helping Hands Project said the duo when I met them on the eve of their departure at hotel in Mirissa. Franz and I were members of Oscar Fredriks choir in our home town in Sweden. Franz was born in Kandy, Sri Lanka and adopted by Swedish parents when he was three months old. He is a musician while I work as a cabin crew member of a domestic airline in Sweden said Andreas explaining how Helping Hands was formed. 
In 2012 we were contemplating on helping children with HIV in South Africa as Franz was in charge of music at a large concert held for African children and Swedish children in two Swedish cities. It was at this concert we met Dasun, who was working with the Matara Childrens Center which helped us decide to help orphaned children of Matara. We were invited for MCCs fifth anniversary celebration which we were happy to accept. We wanted to give the children something substantial so we went on Facebook and asked our friends for contributions towards these gifts. In less than a month we were able to collect Rs 850,000 which we donated to MCC. That was the start and for the past five years we have been able to collect more money from Swedish donors through our Facebook page. We were lucky to make contact with INDICOS and have been able to channel every cent we receive for deserving welfare projects in Matara. We are very proud to see the achievements of those who have benefited from our projects said Andreas. 
Each year we invite our donors to join with us to come to Sri Lanka and join us in distributing their donations said Franz. Last year 32 friends joined us and this year it was a group of 50. I was amazed to see the accomplishments of the children who attend the MFY classes and so were our friends who were generous to fund the project. We hope to be back again next year.

e-NIC project to come into operation amidst concerns
	
Human Rights lawyer warns database can be hacked and abused by interested parties for personal or political gain

A fundamental rights petition has been filed with regards to the Regulations that give effect to the provisions of the Registration of Persons Act which was amended recently to facilitate the e-NIC Project. Skeptics point out that the e-NIC card is a red herring and that the real concern is the database. The database will contain wide-ranging information that is requested from an individual to register through the application forms. Further, the database can be used to collect information about a person from any Government authority. The Petitioner claims that the database can be hacked and abused by interested parties for personal or political gain, and thus citizens are at a risk. 

"You dont have to be a suspect for your information to be disclosed to the police"
The Government has planned to re-register all citizens and create a database called the National Persons Registry (NPR). The Smart ID, which was launched on October 27, is merely an interim solution until the Department issues the e-National Identity Card (e-NIC) by 2018 or early 2019 once the data is collected. The Smart ID will contain the name, place of birth, address and gender in all three languages. There will be a personalized barcode and a photograph of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) standard. Thesmart ID will be issued to those who apply for new NICs or for renewals from October 27 onwards. 



The e-NIC Project, initiated by the previous Government, is envisaged to identify persons for the purpose of facilitating the general public to obtain their day-to-day services, to facilitate national security and to accelerate the economic development of the country. 
A human rights lawyer speaking on conditions of anonymity, pointed out that the project could lead to efficiency only if there was a completely incorruptible government of politicians and public officers who are averse to abuse. If you start abusing it-and am fairly certain you will- then you lose all the efficiency gained. Then it can be used for all matters of corruption, for intimidation and can retard economic growth by driving fear into businessmen. The consequences can be quite dire, he said. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Commissioner-General of the Department of Registration of Persons, P. Viyani Gunathilake, said that since 1972 there has been a database with basic details of those who have obtained the NIC. But our purpose is to re-capture the data of the entire citizenry of the country who are more than 15 years old. This is still to be done. So far we have amended the law. We have the legal authority to obtain peoples bio data, biometrics (fingerprints), and a standard photograph, he said. 
The regulations, which were issued after the amendment to the Act, were approved by Parliament in August this year and they came into effect in September through a gazette notification. These Regulations have been challenged by M.R.Ratnasabapathy, (the petitioner) who is an accountant by profession. The case will be taken up before the Supreme Court on November 23. The Minister of Internal Affairs, S. B. Navinna, the Commissioner General, V. Gunathilake and the Atorney General have been cited as respondents. 

Family details and privacy 
The Daily Mirror learns that the anticipated database will be very expansive. The applications to register or re-register persons require basic details of the applicant, and information about his family (parents, siblings, spouse, children) including their NIC numbers and their civil status. The HR lawyer, Daily Mirror spoke to, said that this was an intrusive search. 
Further this application contains a clause stating that applicants are required to submit another application in the event of a child birth, change of civil status such as marriage, divorce, separation or ordaining of any person in the family. In the event of a divorce the applicant is required to fill the case number, date of issuance of the decree and the court that issued the decree. 
Divorce is a serious problem because we have a fault-based system of divorce. Any Government authority will be able to go to court and pick up your divorce case where all sorts of nasty things would have been said about the individual. So if the person is a politician, dissenter or someone who is unpopular with the Government it will be a problem, said the Attorney-at-Law. 
Regulation 19 states that every District Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths should provide to the Commissioner General or an officer designated by him, a report of the births, marriages and deaths that occur in his area. The names, NIC numbers and certificate numbers relevant to the purpose of updating the National Register of Persons, should be furnished as well. 
All this leads to the creation of an updated family tree.
The petitioner states in the FR petition that the collection of a full family tree of all citizens has little, or no benefit. He apprehends that this would enable to target family members of opponents for personal or political gain. 
The petitioner further claims that the Commissioner General and the State would have access to the information concerning the total life history of every individual. He asserts that confidential and personal information required in terms of the Regulations arent adequately protected from being disclosed to a third party. 
When asked about the necessity of establishing a family tree the Commissioner-General noted that there could be occasions where the family details of a particular person is needed for identification purposes. 
Information not prescribed 
The Amended Act allows the Commissioner General to establish and maintain a database called the National Register of Persons. There will be a record of the name, date of birth, place of birth, gender, the address, family details and any other information as may be prescribed. However the FR petition points out that the regulations do not prescribe the information that can be requested, leaving it open to the Commissioner General or an authorized officer to request any information he or she wishes to obtain. 
Meanwhile the Human Rights Lawyer pointed out that the Regulations havent specified a public authority. Without for instance saying that we can ask for the address from the Grama Niladhari, they have said we can ask for the information from any head of any public institution. There is an open ended ability to ask for information from any public authority, the HR lawyer said. 
Centralization of citizens information 
Further the petition states that since the Regulations envisage the centralization of citizens information, separate databases can be linked together to obtain a complete profile of any citizen or their family. For example, the vehicle number can be entered and the owner can be discovered, and a complete profile of the owner and his family can be obtained. Similarly it is foreseen that if the phone number or the e-mail address of a person is entered his full profile and that of his family can be obtained. 
Information could be leaked 
In the absence of laws for data protection and privacy the database is vulnerable to be hacked. There is also a huge scope for abuse. A lot of this information could be leaked or hacked. Someone can be bribed and the information can be handed over to your enemy; for instance, to your neighbour with whom youre having a land dispute, pointed out the Human Rights lawyer. 
The Commissioner General of the Department of Registration of Persons assured that the database and the software will be secure. We will include as much security features as possible, so that nobody can obtain data illegally, he asserted. 
According to the Registration of Persons Act the Commissioner General can disclose any information relating to a registered person, to a public officer or authority, in the interest of national security upon a direction issued by the secretary of the Defence Minister; for the purpose of prevention or detection of crimes; or under the direction of a competent court. 
The Lawyer questioned the rationality of disclosing information for the prevention of crime. What is a prevention of crime The police can say they need a particular piece of information for the prevention of crime. The crime hasnt been committed. All they have to say is that we have information that there is concern regarding a person, in the commission, regarding a future crime. They dont even need to say that there is a witness and a victim. You dont have to be a suspect for your information to be disclosed, he pointed out. 
He added that there were no sanctions imposed if information was requested for in other instances. 

"There could have been a requirement long ago for every citizen to be finger printed. We didnt do that because we consider it to be an intrusion on peoples autonomy"
The police can say we want to prevent people from making false declaration to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and request information concerning all vehicle holders and their tax numbers. Why not 
Tax information can be obtained from the IRD and vehicle details from the Department of Motor Vehicles. So the scope for abuse is huge, he explained. 
The Department of Registration of Persons exists only to have a database and issue a card. Now they can collect all sorts of information for no sensible purpose, other than to share with other people, he stressed. 
There could have been a requirement long ago for every citizen to be finger printed. We didnt do that because we consider it to be an intrusion on peoples autonomy. The moment the police gets a fingerprint from a house, they know whose fingerprints those are. But the flip side is that if theyre trying to fix someone they know how that persons fingerprints look like, he pointed out. 
Meanwhile, Commissioner General Viyani Gunathilake said that apart from the exceptions mentioned if the applicant consented the information can be released. He added that other than those instances he could only certify to the authenticity of the particulars of an NIC of a person. If a public officer queries whether a particular NIC number corresponds with a person, I can only say Yes or No, he explained.

Gamage could get back Sevenagala Sugar
	
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had proposed to rescind the Expropriation Act introduced by the previous government to take over some private ventures, including the Sevanagala Sugar Factory that belonged to Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage. The then government acquired the properties of 36 companies categorized as underutilized assets in terms of this Act.
Once the Act is annulled, it is learnt that the government intends to give the Sevanagala Sugar Company back to Minister Daya Gamage.
Asked about this proposal to rescind the Act Minister Samaraweera said, "It has to be done".
Asked whether the company would be given back to Mr. Daya Gamage, Mr. Samaraweera replied, "It is the way it should be. Let's see what will happen!
Speaking on the subject Minister Daya Gamage said,  The Mahinda Rajapaksa government tried to lure me onto his side. After it failed, he (Rajapaksa) tried to destroy my businesses. He introduced this Act to take over the Sewanagala Sugar company. This company was run at a profit. Other enterprises that were taken over were at a loss. The government paid money to them. However, there is a case filed in an international court as well. I will get the compensation whether the Act is abolished or not. He said that assets amounting to millions of rupees had been taken over by force by the previous government including 360 vehicles.(Ranjan Kasthuri)

In a Facebook post, Dr. Harsha De Silva, who is also the Head of the Presidential Committee on SAITM said he was informed by AG Department that ASG Rajaratnam filed the proposed final solution of the Government by motion in the Supreme Court yesterday.
It is unfortunate that the GMOA has accused the Government of not informing Court of the same, as per a report filed in the Daily Mirror online website.

Govt. loses billions due to exporters under-valuing vehicles: Eran
	
The government loses billions of rupees in terms of revenue to its exchequer due to tax evasion by some vehicle importers who import luxury vehicles under the used vehicles category, a minister said yesterday.
State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne told Daily Mirror the government had identified the loss of revenue that had taken place and taken precautions to avoid such losses from recurring through the budget for 2018 by the introduction of taxation based on the engine capacity of vehicles to avoid tax dodging by importers.
Taxation is calculated according to the declared value of imported vehicles currently. Which means if it is valued at a lower rate, the amount of tax payable also becomes less, he said.
The State Minister said the government had estimated the loss of revenue as a result of this to be running into billions of rupees.
Meanwhile, industry sources said even vehicles such as a Range Rover, Mercedez Benz, Audi, and BMW are imported in this manner. Industry sources said these unauthorized importers bring down Brand New cars hiding behind the used car qualification, completely manipulating the tax provisions allocated for a genuine used car by the government.
According to sources, the current used car declaration by Sri Lanka customs saying a vehicle has to be registered in the country of export does not outline the period, mileage etc. The source said this loophole created room for some importers to bring down brand new cars in the guise of them being used cars and enjoy the benefits provided for importers of used vehicles.
It is learnt that a loss of Rs.9 billion was reported during 2015- 2017 period as a result of such practises. These unauthorized importers claim a 20 per cent VAT refund from the UK government at the time of exportation. They are also able to claim an electric/ hybrid subsidy which is offered by the UK government when purchasing environmentally friendly cars. They also get a tax concession of 15
per cent from the local customs for importing a used vehicle whereas these vehicles are not used vehicles but brand new, the source said.

Her feelings of love cost her Rs. 100,000
	
A 43-year-old married woman, hailing from a remote village located in an area known for its tea estates in the Galle district, recently had a very bitter experience. She had gone to the Galle town for some purpose and had got into a bus to return home.
There was an empty seat next next to her and a man who appeared to be the same age as her got into the bus and sat down beside her. He smiled at her but she did not reciprocate. As the bus travelled through a mountainous area the bus swayed causing the man sitted next to her to brush against her often. She thought nothing of it and ignored it.
He then attempted to get into a conversation with her but she still ignored him. She did not notice the fact that he kept looking at the chain she had around her neck. When he was approaching the halt at which he was supposed to get off he attempted to write his phone number on a piece of paper and give it to her.
She rejected it as she was a married woman. However, just when he was about to get off he kept the piece of paper containing his phone number on her lap and disembarked.
Although she did not want to make it look obvious, she slowly put the piece of paper into her handbag when no one was looking. She went home and called him and a clandestine affair by phone began between the two. He awakened feelings within her that she had not felt in a long time. After several days he called her and told her he was at the Karapitiya hospital and asked her if she could meet him there. They met up at the appointed time.
I brought you a beautiful pendant for your necklace. Give me your necklace and I will fix it for you, he said to her. She was surprised at how quickly he was moving, but without a second thought and because she was smitten by him she did not hesitate in handing over her precious necklace worth around one lakh to him, a complete stranger.
True to his word he fixed a pendant he had brought with him onto the necklace. However, instead of putting it around her neck he wanted to wear it fist promising to give it back to her later. She even helped him put it on. Thereafter he said that he needed to visit a friend of his who was warded at the Karapitiya Hospital. She accompanied him to the ward. However as visiting hours had not arrived by then they weren't allowed to go in. Undeterred by this he somehow found a way in. Let's go from this side, he said pulling her in with him. However, instead of waiting for her he vanished around the corner and she lost sight of him. She tried to call him on his mobile phone but she the phone went onto recording and she got no response.
Suddenly, she came to the realisation of what had happened to her. She realised that she had been duped by a confidence trickster. She had lost her necklace worth of Rs. 100,000. It was her folly. Now she was left with nothing to do but go to the Galle Police Station and lodge a complaint about her misfortune.(D.G.Sugathapala)

India asked to clarify stand on Ram Setu which connects SL
	
The Indian Supreme Court on Monday asked the Central Government to clarify whetherit wants to remove the Ram Setu, the chain of limestone shoals connecting Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, Scroll India reported today.
Quoting theANI, it said the SChad giventhe government six weeks time to file an affidavit on their stance.
The Ram Setu bridge  also known as the Adams Bridge  is a 50-km stretch from Rameswaram Island in Tamil Nadu to Mannar Island in Sri Lanka.
According to Indian mythology, it was built by an army of monkeys for Hindu god Ram and his warriors to cross over to Lanka to rescue Sita.
The bridge has been embroiled in controversy since 2005 after the governments Sethusamudram shipping canal project was planned. The project required dredging in the region.
The Sethusamudram project has been opposed by several groups, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  this is because of the canals alignment, which would involve cutting through the Ram Setu.
The project was challenged before the Supreme Court in 2005 with some groups claiming that no one should touch the bridge, keeping in mind its mythological significance.
Matters came to a head in 2007, when the Archaeological Survey of India filed an affidavit before the court that said that Ram was a mythical character and that the Ramayana had no historical basis.
The BJP had used the affidavit to mount a campaign against the Congress.
Meanwhile, the Indian Council of Historical Research is conducting an underwater exploration to ascertain whether the Ram Setu was built naturally or is a man-made structure.
Experts from the Archaeological Survey of India, research scholars, university students, marine experts and scientists are scheduled tosubmit their report by November-end.

More worries for the TNA
	
A new political front is likely to be mooted against the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in the Northern Province ahead of the elections to the local authorities, EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran said yesterday.
The TNA, made up of four political parties is facing an internal struggle after the Eelam Peoples Evolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) led by Mr. Premachandran decided to quit the alliance. Since its inception in 2001, the EPRLF has contested elections under the 'House Symbol' of the Ilankai Tamil Arachu Katchchi (ITAK), which is the TNA's main constituent party.
Mr. Premachandran told Daily Mirror his party was no longer prepared to contest elections under the ITAKs House symbol, and it had notified the TNA leadership about the latest decision.
He said the people gave a mandate to the ITAK to work out a political solution to the national question and secure the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces but the ITAK was only rubbing shoulders with the government with no solution in sight.
Mr. Premachandran said his party would contest the local government elections on its own or under a new political front, which might be formed ahead of the elections.
When asked whether Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran would back it, he said he was unable to say just yet how it would be worked out. (Kelum Bandara)

MR whacks government, budget-2018
	
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today said only 358 out of 493 budget proposals made in 2016 had been fulfilled and that the Government should fulfill its promises given to the people.
In a series of tweets, Mr. Rajapaksa said, in 2016, Rs. 65billion(35%) was spent from Rs. 203 billion allocated for the Education Sector, Rs. 13 billion (44%) was spent from Rs. 30 billion allocated for Megapolis Development and Rs. 996million (62%) was spent from Rs. 1577 million allocated for Telecom.
Some of the other promises of this Government that have gone unfulfilled from the 2016 budget proposals are Malabe Mahapola University, EXIM Bank, 7,000-seat Conference Hall in Colombo and the Keleni Valley Railway Line Development, he said.
He said the Government was trying to mislead the public by reducing taxes on certain consumer goods immediately before the presentation of the Budget 2018.
It is reducing taxes from the very goods on which it imposed higher taxes at previous budgets. While the Government is increasing revenue through heavy taxation on the public in the Budget 2018, the Governments recurrent expenditure has increased by Rs. 868 billion, or 62%, compared to 2014. Is this how you reduce wastage, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said in order to achieve a per capita income of $5,000, as proposed in the Budget 2018, Sri Lankas GDP must be more than $106.5 billion.
In 2017, it was $84.9 billion. That means the economy must grow 25%. How can that be achieved at the current growth rate of 4.5% Sri Lankas budget deficit in 2018 is expected to be Rs. 675 billion. This is a significant increase from Rs. 591 billion in 2014, he said.
As of December 2014, he said government debt was Rs. 7.4 trillion and by the end of 2018, the debt is expected to be more than Rs. 12 trillion, a 64% increase in four years.
During my nine years as President of Sri Lanka with the war and subsequent development projects, the Government obtained a total of Rs. 5.2 trillion in loans. During the first four years, this Government plans to obtain Rs. 4.7 trillion in loans. Thats 90% of how much we obtained during nine years.
As a result of the reduction in global oil prices, the Government would have saved more than $5 billion during the past three years. If used responsibly, the Government could have paid off most of the debts that were there when it assumed office in 2015, he said.

Prez, PM won't tolerate NGOs surviving on foreign aid: IGP
	
The President and the Prime Minister would not tolerate the NGOs, whichare dependent on foreign aid and racketeers who deposit public funds in foreign banks, Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara told afunction held at Mallawapitiya in Kurunegala. 
He said people should be sincere and should refrain from saying something and doing just the opposite.
The Police Chief said it was important for people to display human values and that it was the President who is being blamedoften.
The President is a man from the village, a humble person possessing exemplary qualities. He has teamed up with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is a person well known in international circles. This is a resilient combination, not easily dented, he said.
Those who amassed wealth by corrupt means, those who earned commissions, those who hoodwinked the masses and earned enough to last several generations, those who fattened the foreign banks with the ill-gotten wealth are the ones who hate the President and the Prime Minister. There are some in the left who are trying hard, by staging protests to embarrassthe government. They spread false rumors abroad and earn money. This is their main task, he said.

Rajitha asks Mangala to rescind tax cut on beer
	
While asserting his opposition to the tax concessions granted to soft liquor such as beer and wine, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today urged the Finance Minister to withdraw the proposal before put to the vote in parliament.
Speaking during the Budget debate, he said children would be motivated to drink beer and thereby be induced to use stronger alcoholic drinks.
The minister said steps should be taken to reduce the consumption of alcohol and added that he, as the health minister, would not support any proposal detrimental to the health of the people.
He said the facts brought to justify the decision to reduce tax on beer were completely wrong.
"The figures on the consumption of illicit liquor which was said to be 49% is wrong. According to police and excise department reports, consumption of illicit liquor has reduced. It is only by 6% of the population," the minister said and added that the excuse that beer consumption had been promoted in European countries could not be applied to Sri Lanka because the situation in Europe was different from ours.
"Beer is a part of the meal and life style in Europe. It's their tradition. But in Asia, we consume beer to get a kick out of it," he said and added that the fact that tax concessions were given to beer to make Sri Lanka a modern country was unacceptable because modern countries had increased tax on liquor.
The minister said liquor consumption had resulted in most road accidents, suicides, diseases and domestic violence. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Rectify error of postponing PC polls: Wijeyadasa to Speaker
	
MP Wijedasa Rajapakshe today has in a letter dated November 11 requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to abolish the Constitutional Assembly and take steps to rectify the error made by Parliament to postpone the provincial council elections by violating the Supreme Court verdict.
The former minister in his letter said the decision to appoint a constitutional assembly on March 9 2016 was illegal.
He the people had not given a mandate to set up a constitutional assembly because no party had secured a majority at the 2015 general elections. The traditional concept adopted by the whole world is that pledges given by a political party at an election does not hold true when that party had not secured a majority in the legislature," he said.
Mr. Rajapakshe said a new constitution has to be approved by the people at a referendum and by a two-thirds majority in Parliament taking into account the MPs who were absent during the voting and that it was not possible to form another institution to exercise legislative powers under Section 76 of the Constitution.
He said it was possible to appoint a select committee if the legislature requires assistance of such a committee under Standing Order 94. However, he said it only provides provisions to appoint a special select committee comprising MPs with expertise on a particular sector pertaining to the drafting of the document.
Mr. Rajapakshe recalled that the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government had to appoint a committee which had no connection to the legislature to draft the Republican Constitution because there was provision to set up another body with legislative powers. He also said the 1978 Constitution was presented to Parliament because of the same reason.
"The people expected the government to follow a transparent process in enacting a new constitution but what had taken place today is that a number of NGOs, international advisers and pro-federalism idealists held the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly to ransom," Mr. Rajapakshe said in his letter to the Speaker.
Referring to the 20th Amendment, he said it was passed in Parliament by neglecting the Supreme Court verdict that the amendment could be approved only through a special majority in the House and through a referendum.
"You have the power to rectify matters whenever wrong decisions are made by the legislature and therefore it is your responsibility to do so. If not it is you who will be held responsible in the event of an unrest," Mr. Rajapakshe said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Sagala denies meeting Gamini Senarath
	
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake today denied reports that he had a secret meeting with former President's Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath who was remanded today.
Minister Ratnayake issuing a media statement in this regard said this was a baseless and malicious allegation as he had no intention of meeting a suspect in a corruption case which involved billions of public funds.
Despite many challenges and obstacles, the Sri Lanka Police, the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) and I, as the Minister, endeavor to deliver results, in this regard. It is in this context that a section of the media, including some online publications and social media pages, have published news items indicating that former President's Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath, who is suspected to have embezzled Rs 4 billion of public money, had a secret meeting with me. This is a baseless and malicious allegation. I have no reason to meet a suspect in a corruption case involving billions of rupees in public funds. I have nothing to gain by holding meeting with a person of that "calibre," the minister said in the statement.
Therefore he categorically denied the allegation and charged that it was his firm belief that a handful of bankrupt political elements with hidden agendas are behind this propaganda campaign.
It is widely known that a small clique affiliated with the top-brass leaders of the previous government were involved in large scale bribery and corruption cases. Their corrupt practices pushed over 6.2 million people to come forward on January 08, 2015, in a bid to topple the Rajapaksa government. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who gave leadership to these progressive forces, played prominent roles in this 'silent revolution'. The government of good governance and its ministers came to power with the promise of investigating into these cases of large scale corruption and bringing the culprits to book. I, as the Minister of Law and Order, have a special responsibility in this regard and I must state that I am committed and determined to fulfil that responsibility, the Minister added.

Colombo University community development project
Students performing for a song 

A team of university students of the Faculty of Management & Finance of University of Colombo gifted a renovated Singithi Uyana and a class room turned - library for Yashodara Vidyalaya in Kelaniya on October 25, under a community development project.
The opening ceremony was held in the school premises, with the participation of academic advisor of the Team Flyers - CDP - W.A.S.P. Weerathunga, project coordinator Rajistha De Alwis Senevirathne, the parents and teachers, Kelaniya - Rotary club members and the flyers team. 
Dayani Rajasekara, a school teacher, welcomed the audience with a speech and reminded how hard they worked for success and the difficulties they did overcome.They first came to our school, had permission from the former principal and started renovating Singithi Uyana and making the most required reading room. Today is an unforgettable day for our school. Now they have shining new books to read. Today our students are fortunate to have a library, first time ever in their school history. Even though we wanted to do this early, financially we werent stable . she articulated. 
I have noticed that some of these university students had lunch in the evening while working here. Some worked even when they were suffering from illnesses. While they were painting the equipment in the playground, all of a sudden it started to rain and all the paint was washed away. They had to paint all over again. Finally, I asked them what was the point of painting in the pouring rain They said it was okay and will paint again after the rain stops. We also helped them in many ways. They showed a great courage and dedication their goal regardless of obstacles. she reminded how they worked on through thick and thin. 
We are feeling very grateful for what they have done to us. True this is a project, but I must say they showed great passion and enthusiasm. Children like you are needed for this country. She thanked them profusely.

Rashini Prabuddhika, a team member of the Management Faculty clarified how the school appeared when they first visited. A student living close to the school had informed the team about Yashodara Vidyalaya, and as they were willing to help some school in need, they willingly chose the school. The team started their project soon. The hardest part was to raise funds, we even sold pens in buses in faraway cities like Matara, printed tickets, sold achcharu in university, and tried so hard to find sponsors until the Rotary club - Kelaniya and other sponsors offered their helping hand. 
Establishing more than a century, Kelaniya Yashodara Vidyalaya has now become a solitary Oasis for differently-abled children. A teacher in the school, B.N.S Perera told us that there are only 48 students in the school now, with four students in the special needs section. The total number of teachers in the school is around six, according to a teacher, Dayani Rajasekara. Being a school located in close proximity to Colombo, the school lacks desks and other materials. Children with different abilities anyway have to have a lot more facilities compared to other schools. They lack the tables for grade 1 and 2, and they were willing if they could have more classroom facilities. While having no facilities at all, many students have passed the Grade 5 scholarship exam. 
The group was led by Saroj Rajapaksha. Navodya Fernando was the secretary while the treasurer was Geethan Wanninayaka. The team members are R.P Gomez, K.K.N.H. Kannangara, R.I.S. Nawoda, H.D.S. Niwarthana, H.J.M.C Perera, H.S.U Perera, K.P Rathnasekara, B.K.J.M Rodrigo, K.K.D.B Sachithra, B.H Sandamal, N.P Sanjeewa, S.A.M.A.S.S Senanayaka, R.M Sewwandi, P.M.K.M Somarathna. H.D.N Upekshika, D.I.H Weerasinghe, M.E.I.D Wijesiri 
This renovation took place under the community development project of these first-year students, which has been implemented to enhance the soft skills of undergraduate students of Faculty of Management and Finance (FMF) at the University of Colombo. The main objective of this project is to broaden the scope of the interaction of the students with the university community and the general public through planning and implementing a successful project to uplift and support the lives of identified groups in the society.

The Centenary  of the  Bolshevik Revolution: A Search for Legacy
	
I will have to plant thee, and will 
Make thee full of growing. Shakespeare: Hamlet
"The Bolshevik Revolution was a lagged continuation of the French Revolution: it heralded the emergence of the working class as significant wielders of political power, consequent on its own capture of State power"

That which presently lies in the past, once lay in the future,foreshadowing possibility. 
The search for legacy is not a Proustian effort to redeem the past but a forensic exploration of what to forget, in order to revitalise the future. The Bolshevik Revolution, which was heralded with such heady acclaim, lies in ruins today with the rubble of the Berlin Wall. The State, established by the Revolution - The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) - and the system created by the Revolution- Soviet communism - no longer exist. What legacy of the Bolshevik Revolution, then 
The Bolshevik Revolution- led by Lenin- overthrew the Czarist feudal regime. It was a pivotal event in world history which took place a hundred years ago, on 7th October 1917. It was a mutation on the French Revolution which was also an overthrow of the ancient regime of the Royalist Bourbons- another pivotal event of world history which took place on 14 July, 1789 in Paris. The French Revolution symbolized the capture of State power from the Feudals by the newly empowered bourgeoisie and the entrenchment of the capitalist class in State power. After the French Revolution, politics became a lucrative game played by different contending segments of the capitalist class. Scams are not exceptions in capitalist government but an integral part of its governance- a part of its duality- as rice and parippu are an essential part of Sri Lankan cuisine. 
The Bolshevik Revolution was a lagged continuation of the French Revolution: it heralded the emergence of the working class as significant wielders of political power, consequent on its own capture of State power. Its concern was to make sure that workers now become entrenched as permanent players in the political power game. The Post-Bolshevik Revolution shifted political focus from being an inter-capitalist jostle, to becoming an intra- political battle of capital and worker, in Sri Lanka symbolised by the Communist Party being a member in one of her bourgeois Cabinets. 

"It was argued that since women hold up half the sky, they should be given equality with men. The Soviet Union became the beacon for womens rights and gender equality"

The Bolshevik Revolution was ideologically based on the Marxian model of history, best explained in the Communist Manifesto (1848), co-authored by Marx and Engels. Marxian ideology was a component part of the Whig interpretation of history- Hegel and Nietzche being among its distinguished adherents. In this interpretation, human progress lay in a constant and persistent upward movement towards the light. Its Marxian variant was that it was only social class and economic constraints which could sponsor such action, the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles. In 
elaborating on this propelling mechanism, Marx upended the Hegelian dialectic of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis. Action starts with the thesis, which generates an anti-thesis and, eventually, the best of both elements merge into a synthesis. An example of this movement was where feudals (the thesis) would generate its anti thesis- the capitalistic bourgeoisie- who, in its turn, would capture State power. 
The evolving movement continues on the same beat but on an elevated track. Capital (now entrenched as the thesis) would create workers (anti-thesis). Empowered capital had its French Revolution, it is not the responsibility of empowered workers to have their Bolshevik Revolution. A combination of the best of these two, would push towards a more humane work relationship and a greater productivity of capital, a win-win situation both for capital and workers. Revolutions will be generated from below and continue their democratic fervency, till they end by reaching the nirvana of communism. 
Fifty years had passed since the Communist Manifesto appeared. Like today, post-1850s had lost faith in the political system, lost faith in their leaders, was not sure of its own values or even recognise who they are. There was an abyss- an emptiness- beneath the illusory sense of stability best captured by Dosteovsky in his books Crime and Punishment and Notes from the Underground.
Despite Europe being influx during this post-1850s turbulent period, with bitter strikes and industrial unrest, there was not seen a definitive revolution organised from below, though small, regular insurgent sightings did periodically appear, like Banquos ghost. It was at this time the Lenin, radicalised by reality, reshaped classical Marxism. In his, What is to be done (1902), he opined that there was no automaticity in revolutions occurring, as Marx had forecast. Lenin argued that revolutions do not descend from heaven, but have to be made to happen when conditions were ripe. It was to be carried out by a professional, revolutionary Communist Party, this Party totally dedicated to The Cause.
The Communist Party must take a vanguard role in educating and making workers aware about their exploitation. Workers must be made to realise the unfair apportionment of the fruits of their labour- by owners of the means of production, distribution and exchange-to excessively reward capital, that is themselves. In this Leninist interpretation, Revolution was not a Marxian democratic event driven from below but an autocratic event, imposed from above. 

"The Bolshevik Revolution- led by Lenin- overthrew the Czarist feudal regime. It was a pivotal event in world history which took place a hundred years ago, on 7th October 1917"
In the early 1900s, the most mature working class primed for revolutionary action was in Germany, as Germany was economically, technologically and culturally, the most advanced nation of the time. She also had a tried and tested leader in Rosa Luxembourg, to lead the capture of power. But German revolutionary grasp did not extend to German revolutionary reach. It was not in Germany but in Russia that the Revolution took place. Russia was the most backward of the European countries, economically, technologically and culturally, but contrary to Marxian Dialecticism, it was in this backward country where the revolution first took place. It was like Neanderthals detonating the first atom bomb. How come Lenin tried to explain this contradiction. Europe was a weakly interlinked economic chain. It was also an assymetric linkage. 
The Bolshevik revolution took place at the end of World War1, and like vultures, Europes victorious powers demanded more than their kilogram of pork, similar to demands made on defeated Germany. Trotsky, the foreign minister, had to concede lamely most of the demands, in the Brest-Litovsk treaty. Within the Soviet Union itself, there were insurgencies, White Russians, Cossacks etc. While attempting to build the new society in a bankrupt State, the new rulers had to simultaneously negotiate the end of this cruel and bloody civil war. 
As appropriate to a movement that hegemonises humanitarian concerns over capital, the paradigmatic change made by the Bolshevik Revolution was mostly with respect to upgrading the abysmal condition of the Russian human stock at all levels and providing it with long overdue humanitarian solace. Capitalism concentrated on providing and extending legal rights: socialism concentrated on providing and extending humanitarian and social rights. The different treatments of poverty highlight the difference. For capitalism, poverty was an externality to be solved by individuals through hard work: for socialism, poverty was the most pollutant of pollutions, to be solved by collective effort. 
In 1920, the Soviet Union was the first country in the world, despite its bankrupt status, to introduce free health care for all its citizens, regardless of their background. This comprehensive health package included medications and operations. This innovation enabled the Soviet Union to claim the moral high ground over capitalist countries placing her at odds with the USA, where even today, the USA does not provide this fundamental right of health care, the limited subsidies provided by Obamacare being under regular threat of substantial restrictions. To the USA, providing health care is not a moral obligation of the State, but an investment to earn profits.
It is interesting that the next country in the world to provide comprehensive free health care, is Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). It is not known whether George E de Silva, the father of the Sri Lankan scheme, studied the Soviet system, but full marks have to be given to him. It is mistakenly claimed that it was in Britain, after World War 11, that the first comprehensive National Health Scheme (NHS), was introduced.

"All education upto the University was provided free. It is not known whether these reforms were inspired by Bolshevik policies on education. Illiteracy was wiped out and Sri Lanka"
 
Education was another universal humanitarian initiative undertaken by the financially strained Bolshevik government. It has a widely proclaimed- and acclaimed- public policy of the Bolshevik government that good quality education was a right of all children and young people. Czarist Russia was one of the worst feudal countries in the world. Education was provided on payment by Imperial Russia, mostly to the aristocracy and a minuscule slice of the emerging bourgeoisie. 
Within a few years of the Revolution, the government- the first initiative in the world- provided free, compulsory, primary and secondary education. In addition, education in universities and technical institutes were made free. The results were startling. In 1900, under the Czars, literacy was less than 30%, under the Bolsheviks, in 1930, it shot up to 75%, and in 1950 it reached the 98% mark which is the maximum possible, since there is a hardy, residual cohort of senior citizens who were averse to education. Like in Health policy, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), under CWW Kannangara, followed similar humanitarian policies of the Soviet Union. All education upto the University was provided free. It is not known whether these reforms were inspired by Bolshevik policies on education. Here, again, the results were startling. Illiteracy was wiped out and Sri Lanka, with her upgraded human resources, is set on the path to becoming an upper middle income country. 
Women, in Imperial Russia, had no rights. They were the most exploited segment of the populace, after serfdom was abolished. After the Bolshevik revolution this changed. It was argued that since women hold up half the sky, they should be given equality with men. The Soviet Union became the beacon for womens rights and gender equality. 
Women were recruited to the labour force in droves and were given equal wages for equal work. For the first time, women worked in factories, in production lines and offices. They operated agricultural machinery, joined fishing crews and the police and defence forces. 8th of March was recognised as Womens Day, which subsequently became International Womens Day. Family planning was encouraged, the USSR was the first country in the world to provide paid maternity leave and abortions were provided on demand. The Soviet Union recognised that a woman has sovereignty over her own body. The eastern rite which was the official Christian religion and the sturdiest exploiting supporter of Imperial czars, was dis-established and atheism encouraged. 

"Its Marxian variant was that it was only social class and economic constraints which could sponsor such action, the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles
The greatest achievement of the Soviet Union was her rapid industrialisation, at a clip unheard of earlier. On an earlier occasion, Peter the Great ventured to do so, but there were no great successes though Russia incurred tremendous human costs. Great economic ventures result in great achievements but the downside human costs are harrowing. The great American drive to go West was through genocide- the wiping out of scores of Red Indian nations. Britain created famines, where, literally tens of millions of forefathers of those living in current India died of starvation, because food was exported elsewhere in British India. Industrialisation in the Soviet Union was carried out with an iron hand, by Stalin (The Man of Steel). He found Russia to be a wooden spoon and left her with the atom bomb.
The massive industrialisation saved the USSR from annihilation by the Nazi Wehrmacht during World War 11. The Russian Grand Army, under the Czars, collapsed in ruins in World War1, because it did not have the industrial infrastructure to sustain the Grand Armys resistance and meet the need for its arms and war material. Not so the USSR Army during World War11. With the years surcease gained by the master stroke of Russian diplomacy, the Ribbentrop-Molotov peace agreement, Stalin was able to push all USSRs heavy industry to East Russia, out of the reach of Germanys Wehrmacht (the Army) and the Luftwaffe (Air Force). Although the Soviet Union suffered a death toll of 22 million in World War11, if Stalin had not developed Soviet Unions heavy industry- at a heavy humanitarian price- the victory of Nazi Germany over the Soviet Union, would have led to the decimation of the total Russian population of 240 million. Hitler had no sympathy for the Untermensch, sub-humans like the Russian Slavs, as the Jews would knew well, of whom 6 million were gassed.Development is not a tea party. It has its extremely harsh side. The Bolshevik Revolution had its pluses and minuses, the pluses far exceeding the minuses. Its reforms, especially on the humanitarian side, inspired people around the world and set precedents for countries to emulate. The Bolshevik Revolution is a legacy to celebrate.
