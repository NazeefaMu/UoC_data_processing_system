As part of the programme, seven levels of new business in the ?Prosper? segment have been outlined and a variety of rewards were set for each level. The special programme was launched in 2014 and is running for the second consecutive year in 2015.?
The ?Who Wants to be a Millionaire? programme, was created to motivate staff to achieve results beyond their targets.

The new reward scheme provides opportunity to win large cash prizes and encourages staff to reach outstanding levels of achievement. ?
Commenting on the programme, Reyaz Jeffrey, CEO, ATL Life, ?The ?Who Wants to be a Millionaire? programme was carefully crafted to motivate our employees to perform at their very best. Through this programme, employees who go beyond and deliver exceptional performance will be able to reap the rewards of their hard work. The prizes vary based on the target achieved and one hard working employee was able to walk away with Rs. 1 million. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all ATL employees who participated in the programme and reached beyond the targets that were set for them last year.??
ATL Life ?Prosper? is Sri Lanka?s first Shari?ah compliant Investment linked insurance plan with some of the lowest fund allocation charges in the industry. In an era of growth and prosperity, ?Prosper? is a unique plan where anyone can benefit from growing markets, whilst enjoying Takaful benefits. There are three Shari ?ah compliant funds to choose from when making the investment, understanding that individual needs for returns are different and that the individual should have the freedom to decide what level of return he or she desires. ?Prosper? is designed to give the investor the added advantage of a prudent investment for the future, while providing for the protection for his or her family.?
ATL Life has been recognized for its innovation and quality of service for over 15 years. Amana Takaful PLC recently transferred its Life insurance business, Family Takaful to Am?na Takaful Life Limited (ATL Life) which is now operating as a separate business entity. ?ATL Life offers a variety of innovative and state-of-the-art insurance products that are convenient, affordable and reliable.

ComBank extends lending, multirole support to Northern revival
	
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has lent nearly Rs 250 million to small businesses and farmers in Sri Lanka?s northern region in the past four months, as part of a multifaceted on-going engagement to play a catalytic role in the economic and social resurgence of the area.
Combining the extension of banking services, capacity and knowledge building, promotion of digital banking and supporting community needs, the Bank?s efforts concentrating on the Northern area has seen its officials in a hands-on direct engagement with large numbers of existing and potential entrepreneurs both in the peninsula and the northern mainland.
In the latest connected activity, the Bank participated in a Programme for SMEs Development organised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The main objective of the programme, held at the Divisional Secretariat of Mannar, was to create awareness among small scale entrepreneurs about the banking facilities available to them and to build a bridge between banks and entrepreneurs who are in need of financial assistance to expand their businesses.
Commercial Bank selected and interviewed 10 potential entrepreneurs from among the participants and invited the selected individuals to visit its Mannar branch to explore possible support for their business ideas. The majority of the participants were women engaged in the dry fish and garments businesses, the Bank said.
Loans granted over the past four months to entrepreneurs in the northern region included large agriculture loans totalling Rs 206 million, Rs 33.7 million as short term agriculture loans principally to paddy farmers, and micro loans amounting to Rs 3.6 million.
?Our activities in the North showcase the Bank?s commitment to partner and empower individuals and communities to improve their economic status and capacity,? said Jegan Durairatnam, the Bank?s Managing Director. ?They also exemplify the multiple roles the Bank can play in stimulating economic growth through direct engagements in several areas, including building financial literacy.?
Among the recent activities conducted by the Bank in the northern region were a seminar by the Bank?s Agriculture and Micro Finance Unit (AMFU) of Vavuniya and Mannar for 120 sea weed cultivators from the Silawathurai, Mutharipputhurai and Arippu areas; a week-long campaign to educate the public about the products and services offered by the Bank for remittances, and to raise awareness about the dangers of using illegal methods to receive money from overseas; an event in Jaffna to educate the public on the features and advantages of the Bank?s Mobile and Online banking products, and participation in the Jaffna International Trade Fair for the fourth consecutive year.
The Bank also opened its 241st branch in Sri Lanka at Chankanai in Jaffna during this period, further enhancing its presence in the Northern Province of the country.
In the sphere of community support, the CSR Trust of Commercial Bank donated equipment to the Sub Fertility Unit of Killinochchi Hospital and provided new computers to the IT Lab it had donated previously to the SOS Village Jaffna.

Debate on 19A underway
	
	The debate on the 19th Amendment is currently under way in Parliament with voting scheduled to be held this evening.
	Deputy Minister Policy Planning and Economic Development Harsha De Silva tweeted from Parliament that he was ?worried about the fate the amendment as two issues were yet to be resolved.?
	Appointment of the Cabinet, a collaborative effort of the President and the Prime Minister, is one unresolved issue.
	The Opposition wanted the power to be given solely to the President, the Deputy Minister tweeted.??
	?
	?But the whole argument is to reduce the powers of the President but here we have to act with consensus. So, let us see if there can be a compromise,? Silva said.
	Appointments to the Constitutional Council (CC) are another bone of contention. ?
	The CC was to consist of seven non-political eminent persons and three politicians (The President, Prime Minister and Speaker). ?
	?Now the opposition is saying 'no'. It cannot have independent persons but instead wants 10 MPs. This will completely negate the depolitisisation of the CC and thereby all appointments to the Independent Commissions,? Silva said. ?
	The amendment could be in more hot water as the technical issue could change it considerably at the committee stage, the Deputy Minister said. ?
	?The Secretary General is apparently, and correctly, of the view that once the 2nd reading of the 19A is passed with a 2/3rd majority the amendments could be passed with a simple majority. If that is the case then the shape and form of the 19A can be seriously changed, at the Committee Stage unless there is an agreement on the above two matters prior to the vote,? he said.
	?MP John Seneviratne began the debate for the Opposition. MPs Dinesh Gunawardene, Prof. G. L. Pieris, Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Dullas Alahapperuma are in deep conversation,? Silva tweeted.

Earthquake shifts Kathmandu by 3 metres
	
The earthquake that devastated Nepal and left thousands of people dead shifted the earth beneath Kathmandu by up to several metres south, but the height of Mount Everest likely stayed the same, experts said today.
According to early seismological data obtained from sound waves which travel through Earth after an earthquake, the ground beneath the capital Kathmandu may have moved about three metres (10 feet) southward, said University of Cambridge tectonics expert James Jackson.
His analysis was similar to that of Sandy Steacy, head of the physical sciences department at the University of Adelaide.
"It's likely that the earthquake occurred on the Himalayan Thrust fault, a plate boundary that separates the northern moving Indian sub-continent from Eurasia," said Steacy.
"The fault dips about 10 degrees to the north-northeast. The relative movement across the fault zone was on the order of three metres at its greatest, just north of Kathmandu."
The fault lies between two tectonic plates -- one bearing India pushing northward into a plate carrying Europe and Asia at a rate of about two centimetres (0.8 inches) per year -- the process that created the Himalayas in the first place. (NDTV)

?We requested the previous government to introduce constitutional reforms but they ignored our plea. So we had to topple that government. We hope the new government will take steps to introduce the 19th Amendment,? the thera said.

Ranil says Nepal operation a first; Wimal says no
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa are reported to have had a heated argument in Parliament today.
It resulted from the Prime Ministers statement that the deployment of the emergency response team to Nepal was the first such mission undertaken by the Sri Lanka Military outside the country.
Mr. Weerawansa asserted that a similar military contingent under the command of Rear Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda was deployed for relief work in the aftermath of the tsunami in Japan and as such the deployment in Nepal was not the first time that such a relief operation was undertaken overseas.
?I wish to correct the Prime Minister on this matter," he said.
However, Mr. Wickremesinghe shot back saying that this was the first occasion that the Sri Lanka military had flown in an Air force plane and as such this could be construed as the first such exercise.
He said for the relief mission to Japan no military aircraft was used.
"We did it soon after the disaster. By the time I contacted Nepali Prime Minister Susil Koirala he was stuck at the Bangkok Airport," he said and added that Mr. Karannagoda appeared to have lied to Mr. Weeranwasa.
?He has told a lot of lies which we will deal with in the future," Mr. Wickremesinghe said.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Reviewing the 100-day programme of the government, Cultural and Arts State Minister Nandimithra Ekanayake today expressed disappointment about being overlooked for a Cabinet Minister post during the appointment of new cabinet ministers while he still remained a state minister.
He said he was one of the four Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members who left and pledged support to President Maithripala Sirisena during January's presidential election campaign and that he was the most senior.
?I have served as a cabinet minister twice and also as the Central Province Chief Minister, but today I have been given a state ministerial post,? he told a news conference held at the ministry.
He said that there were only six ministers in the present Cabinet including the Prime Minister who were senior and said all the other ministers were subordinate to him.
?As ordinary human beings, it is our desire to be appointed as a cabinet minister from the post of state minister. However, I was not made a cabinet minister,? he said.? (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH
