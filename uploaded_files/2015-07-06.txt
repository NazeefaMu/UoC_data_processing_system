## Title: Am?na Takaful announces SURPLUS payment for third consecutive year

Am?na Takaful announces SURPLUS payment for third consecutive year
	
Staying true to the spirit of Takaful, ATL (Amana Takaful PLC) announced a payment of SURPLUS to its General Insurance Policy-holders for the third consecutive year.?
Following Surplus Payments of 12.5 percent and 15 percent in 2012 and 2013 respectively, the board decided to award a SURPLUS of 10 percent for 2014, to be distributed amongst the company?s non-claimant policy-holders. Such Policy-holders will receive their payments commencing 03July 2015. ?
As opposed to conventional insurance, the Takaful concept not only benefits claimants but also takes care of non-claimant policyholders. Such policy-holders receive a proportionate share of the SURPLUS from the risk fund at the end of a defined period. By virtue of being a Takaful participant, one becomes a member of the Risk Pool. The Risk Pool meets all claims of the membership among other expenses. In the event of a SURPLUS in the Risk Pool, non-claimants among the participants are entitled to a proportionate share of the SURPLUS. Award of Surplus is a Key Distinguishing Benefit in the Takaful System. ATL is proud to honour this commitment: the only Takaful Operator to do so.
Composite Gross Written Premium of ATL grew by 10.2 percent over the previous year, ahead of industry growth and crossing the Rs.2 billion threshold to close at Rs.2.06 billion. The General Takaful segment achieved a GWP of Rs. 1.38 billion an increase by 4.0 percent over the previous year, in which the motor class sustained its revenue, while non-motor business improved by 15.9 percent. Net claims increased to Rs. 636 million, 5.5 percent over 2013. ?Industry-wide, ATL has a record of a relatively low claims ratio, attributable to astute claims management due to prudent underwriting and risk assessment. As a consequence, the risk fund is in surplus for the third successive year, enabling the Company to distribute a surplus to non-claimant participants in 2015, on the basis of the fund?s performance in the reporting year.
?We are delighted to share a SURPLUS with all our non-claimant policyholders for the third consecutive year. Notably, in this this pay-out, non-claimants in respect of Medical policies too are included. All policyholders will do well to note that this must not be confused with the No Claim Bonus (NCB), which is a feature of a regular Motor insurance policy. Whilst thanking our customers for subscribing to the products and services of ATL, we also look forward to their valuable patronage in the future. We shall make every endeavour to keep rewards coming your way over the years?, said Fazal Ghaffoor, Chief Executive Officer, ATL.
General Takaful (insurance) customers of ATL may call the hotline 7 501 000 for any clarifications.?
ATL has been recognized for its innovation and quality of service for over 15 years. The company offers a diverse range of insurance products that reaches out to customers from all segments of society. The company recently transferred its Family Takaful (Life insurance) business to ATL Life Limited which is now operating as a separate business entity. ?ATL offers a variety of innovative and state-of-the-art insurance products that are convenient, affordable and reliable. As part of its commitment to remain ?open to all?, ATL serves all communities and employs through a multi-ethnic team across its network of 27 branches. ??
The current Board of Amana Takaful PLC includes, Tyeab Akbarally (Chairman), Ehsan Zaheed (Executive Director), Non-Executive Directors- Osman Kassim, A.A.M. Haroon, Dr. Ifthikar Ismail and Non-Executive Independent Directors M. H. M. Rafiq, Dato? Fadzli Yusof, A.S.M. Muzzamil, and, R. Gopinath.

Missing dornier: coast guard in touch with SL
	
	Chennai:? Coast Guard authorities are in touch with Sri Lanka as part of their search efforts to locate the Dornier plane which went missing nearly a month ago, the mother of a missing crew member said in Chennai today.
	"Coast Guard chief Vice Admiral H C S Bisht has informed me that Sri Lankan authorities have been requested to alert India if they sight the aircraft or its crew," Padma Shankari, mother of Deputy Commandant Suresh Subash told PTI.
	Suresh Subash was one of the three crew members who went missing after going on board a Dornier plane for a routine maritime surveillance sortie in coastal Tamil Nadu on June 8.
	Since then, multiple agencies, including the Coast Guard, Navy and Coastal Security Group of state police have done extensive search operations in Tamil Nadu, including the Karaikkal-Cuddalore coastline.
	Expressing deep distress over the pace of search which she was told was "still on," she said, "had this happened on foreign soil, the response would have been much speedier."
	"The Defence and Coast Guard authorities could have done much better and much earlier and they should have got international support in their efforts," she said.
	The top CG official wrote to Padma in response to her letter to the Defence Ministry over the issue of locating the aircraft.
	"The letter indicates that the Coast Guard authorities are also looking at the possibility of the crew being stranded in Sri Lankan waters. Indian High Commission in Colombo has been apprised on the issue," she added.
	Sounding apprehensive, she said since a month would pass in the next two days, "what will happen now? there might not be signals any more, the earlier ones were themselves weak."
	"I am proud of my son, he chose to serve the nation, but I want to see his face. I want to know what happened, uncertainty is very, very painful, this is the pain of a mother," she said.
	She said it was distressing that there was no response to either her tweets to Prime Minister Narendra Modi or her letter to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.
	She had written to the Chief Minister's cell on June 13, a few days after the disappearance of the aircraft, seeking the state's help in locating the aircraft.
	Thirty-year-old Suresh Subash joined Coast Guard in 2010.
	He was a B Tech graduate from Regional Engineering College in Jalandhar.
	Eight days after the plane went missing, his wife Deepa Lakshmi tweeted to the PM's office saying, "@PMOIndia 8 days since my husband Subash Suresh, pilot of CG791 is missing. Request your attention #FindSubash". (NDTV)

	Despite former Ambassador Udayanaga Weeratunga?s request to release the container carrying his personal effects, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) states that it cannot be released until he hands over his diplomatic passport to the ministry.
	MFA Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne told Daily Mirror Online a short while ago that the container would not be released without Mr. Weeratunga?s diplomatic passport.
	??He hasn?t yet handed it over to the ministry despite repeated requests to do so,? she said.

	She said she was unaware whether the container had been handed over to the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID).
	?An inquiry has been made from the overseas affairs division on whether Mr. Weeratunga's container was handed over to the FCID but we haven?t yet received a response. I am sure if it had been handed over it was done so upon obtaining proper legal clearance since an investigation against Mr. Weeratunga is currently ongoing in the FCID regarding the controversial MiG deal,?
