Air strikes kill 22 civilians in eastern Syria: monitor
	

BEIRUT AFP Dec28, 2016  -Air strikes carried out by unidentified aircraft killed at least 22 civilians, including 10 children, in a village held by the Islamic State group in eastern Syria, a monitor said Wednesday. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the civilians were from two families at Hojna in Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq and is the countrys second biggest province after Homs.  The oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor is almost totally under IS control and has been regularly targeted by a US-led military coalition.  The only part of the eastern province outside of IS control is its capital, which is also named Deir Ezzor and is held by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
IS has carried out a series of attacks across Europe and has been targeted by military offensives on several fronts in Syria and Iraq, where it declared an Islamic caliphate in 2014.

Catering to future generation will be challenging: DFCC Senior Vice President
	
DFCC Bank will launch a unique savings proposition for families with the objective of empowering them to build a secure financial foundation in the New Year. This scheme will be launched on the 1st of January and all DFCCs branches will be open to welcome customers for business as usual.

Could you provide an overview of DFCC Bank and how the Bank connects with customers in the retail banking space
DFCC Bank, with a legacy of over 60 years has grown and evolved in line with the needs of consumers and the economy, and is today, one of the leading Banks in the country.
Over the years, the Bank has contributed immensely to the nation by funding all sectors of the market, not only meeting financial requirements, but also providing advisory services and guidance in designing and implementing projects. At DFCC, it has been much more than banking as we believe in partnerships, and it is most heartening to note that these relationships have lasted throughout generations. As a fully-fledged commercial bank, following the amalgamation with DFCC Vardhana Bank in 2015, DFCC Bank offers the full range of banking services across all economic sectors and geographies in the country, with sustainable value creation as a core objective.
In terms of retail banking, we offer our retail banking customers an entire range of flexible financial solutions catering to their varying individual needs, be it housing, vehicle, educational or personal loan or credit/debit card. We also have a range of attractive deposit products for the entire family starting from the new born to the senior citizen. 
Moreover, as the digital economy gains more ground in the banking sector, we are focusing on developing digital channels that enables us to provide ease and convenience to customers and further personalize our offerings to a large extent. For example, earlier this year, DFCC launched the Vardhana Virtual Wallet, which is a unique concept and a first in the industry. This revolutionary product offers our retail customers a hassle-free and convenient option to manager their funds, eliminating the need to carry around any other payment instrument. Users can maintain funds in the Virtual Wallet and conduct day-to-day transactions at just the click of a button.
We will continue to focus on technology and innovation to offer personalized services and convenience to our retail customers whilst also focusing on customer service and nurturing our relationships with them.
What are the plans for the New Year
We will look at increasing our market share by focusing on new and innovative products and services backed by technology. We will also invest in new channels of delivery with the objective of gradually moving away from brick and mortar structures and reaching out to customers across economic sectors.
Catering to the future generation will undoubtedly be challenging as banking will happen via electronic and mobile applications, nevertheless we are fully geared to meet these challenges. DFCC also has the advantage of specialization in both development and commercial banking aspects, which sets us apart from our competitors. We will raise our expertise to go beyond traditional boundaries and to cater to new
business opportunities.
What was the thinking behind the special savings proposition for families
Our main objective of devising this offer was to inculcate the habit of savings, and what better way to save, than as a family unit Savings empower people; creating a secure financial future as well as a sound platform to achieve ones financial goals
in life.
We believe that families who save together could enrich the financial future of the household. This promotion also holds great significance in encouraging children to model themselves by following the lead of their parents
in saving.
Further, this offer will be launched on the 1st of January in keeping with the Banks tradition of providing its customers with a positive start in the New Year, and customers can walk into any of the DFCC Bank branches on the 1st to avail themselves of this offer.
What are the unique features
of this offer
How it works is that members of a family who open two or more savings accounts with a total deposit of Rs. 25,000 will receive an instant cash reward or DFCC Gift Voucher worth Rs. 1,250, which is redeemable at DSI showrooms or Sarasavi Bookshops
island-wide.
Further, as an additional incentive to save for their children, if a deposit of Rs. 25,000 is deposited into a Childrens Savings account, they will receive a cash reward or Gift Voucher valued at Rs. 2,500. The Vardhana Virtual Wallet facility will also be offered on a complimentary basis for all accounts, while Vardhana Garu Saru Senior Citizens will receive a loyalty card free of charge.
Apart from the rewards mentioned above, we offer concessionary rates of interest on cash backed facilities permitting borrowings up to 100 percent of the deposit value. Account holders whose salaries have been remitted to the bank, as well as new remitters whose salaries will be assigned to the bank, will be entitled to a 100 percent salary advance by way of a loan payable over a period of 12 months. Furthermore customers who use their Vardhana Virtual Wallet at Laughs Super Markets, Sterling flowers and e-channeling will be eligible for a special discount of 10 percent on their purchases.  
How will this add value to customers
We feel that apart from the rewards, this promotion will add immense value to our customers by helping them save as a unit, thus binding the family together and sharing the responsibility of saving.
By inculcating this valuable habit, the family unit becomes stronger and more responsible with each member contributing to his or her own financial future. This proposition also bridges a generational divide as it brings together grandparents, parents and children in a common cause. Strong family values are one of the most endearing traits of our people, a proud tradition and heritage which DFCC Bank is privileged
in preserving.

Development Bil: JHU says must bring in Bill with required amendments
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today that the Development (Special Provisions) Bill should be brought in with necessary amendments despite petty political gains as it was crucial to establish a powerful institute in encouraging and retaining foreign investors in the country.
JHU national organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said they did not reject the Bill and added that there was no debate on the requirement of such a bill.
We have the need of such a Bill today. There is an economic crisis in the country today. The economic growth rate has decreased to 4%. The export revenue has decreased to 10% in relation to gross domestic product (GDP). So we need a fully fledged institute to expedite an economic progress in the country. We do not have a particular institute to encourage foreign investments and retain them in the country, said.
He said important bills such as this should not be presented without agreement and approval of all stakeholders.
This bill should have been discussed in the cabinet and necessary amendments made before presenting it in the provincial councils if there were controversial matters. The government should have brought in the bill with necessary amendments when it was rejected in one provincial council. Even the Prime Minister admitted that there were shortcomings in the bill. So why was it presented without amending it, he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said there should be fully-fledged establishment where people could get everything done under one roof but it should not be to create super ministers.
What we want is not to create super ministers but to create a super country by bringing in foreign investors by providing them with necessary facilities. We had super ministers like Basil Rajapaksa during the previous regime, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

I want to topple the govt. in 2017: MR
	
Two years after he was unseated, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the first time explicitly stated his intent to make a political comeback, saying he wants to topple the current government in 2017, the Hindu reported.
While the National Unity government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has a majority in Parliament, it may not last as they are fighting each other, he told Colombo-based foreign correspondents on Thursday.
Sri Lankas Constitution disallows dissolution of the Parliament before four and a half years. The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe combine currently has about 155 seats in the 225-member Parliament.
The pro- Rajapaksa faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party  which President Sirisena leads  sits in Opposition, with nearly 50 members.
In a wide-ranging discussion at his Colombo residence, Mr. Rajapaksa, attired in a multi-coloured sarong and half-sleeved shirt, spoke at length about his political project for 2017 and on Western, Chinese and Indian diplomacy in Sri Lanka. He attributed his defeat in the January 2015 presidential polls to the opposition campaign that he accused the U.S. and India of backing. That was too much for us. We didnt know what was going on inside the party, he said, alluding to President Sirisenas unexpected defection to the joint coalition that challenged him.
He blamed his successor-government of failing in management and development of the country. The biggest thing they did was they stopped all the development work and they started taking revenge.
Commenting on the governments contentious joint venture with the Hong Kong-based China Merchants Port Holdings Company  Sri Lanka plans to lease 80 per cent of the port in the southern Hambantota district to it  Mr. Rajapaksa said his administration only wanted to give the Chinese 750 acres for an industrial park, but the current government had agreed to part with 15,000 acres.
This is the peoples land. No other country would have given land like that, he said, adding he did not oppose investment, but opposed privatisation.
In a strong critique of Indian diplomacy, he said: Those days our Indian friends were shouting at me when a (Chinese) submarine came calling at the Colombo Port, they were very worried... Now they are like a mouse. Suggesting that India had other interests in forcing this apparent shift in its response to Colombo-Beijing ties, the former President said: They [India] also must be getting something. I dont know whether the Trincomalee Harbour is going to them or Palaly [airport] and Kanesanthurai [harbour], referring to projects in the north and east.
He said he opposed the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India, which Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has been pushing. India should not do this. They have to be very cautious about it. Because when the people go against you all, go against the country it is not good for them, not good for us.
On Indias role during the end of the war, which former NSA Shivshankar Menon speaks of in his recent book Choices, Mr. Rajapaksa admitted to receiving New Delhis help to defeat the LTTE. Yes, I have said that [before]. But they didnt want to come out. Because of South Indian attitudes.
Admitting that there was some truth in the criticism that he failed to unite the country after the civil war ended, the former President said: Unfortunately, I thought people must have their basic facilities I didnt do politics there. I first gave them everything they needed to live.
On whether he had misjudged the peoples requirements  the northern Tamils overwhelmingly voted against him in 2015 -- he said politicians and the diaspora had influenced them.
When I wanted to move on political solutions, I invited [TNA leader] Sampanthan and other political parties. They didnt want to have anything to do with me at that time. They didnt even want to discuss with me, he said, adding:
In a scathing attack of the United States, which vocally criticised him during his presidency, Mr. Rajapaksa said the US had spent nearly 650 million dollars to bring about a regime change. Blaming the current government for cosying up with the super power and roping them to train its officials, he said angrily: Let the Americans come and rule the country.
On his political future, Mr. Rajapaksa said he had initially planned to retire from politics following his January 2015 defeat, but the current government "went after him", forcing him to "respond". Asked if he was confident of making a comeback, the two-time President said: Very. Earlier when I said that I am going to defeat Prabakaran, I knew, I could he said, emphasising he felt similar confidence now.

Consequently the transaction cost to the banks and customers have come down drastically by almost 10 fold, saving the country billions of foreign exchange that would have otherwise drained out of
the country.

Making a very emotional speech, the Inspector General of Police Pujitha Jayasundara called on all policemen to try and win the hearts of the people at all costs, though they were being severely criticised by the latter.
Almost with tears in his eyes, the Police Chief said, "Nowadays, the police are badly needed. There is an increase in the criticism of the police and that means there is a need for the police."
He made these emotional remarks at a book launch held at the Police Department on Tuesday. The IGP also requested policemen not to lose their temper or take revenge from people.
There is no war and extremism in the country now. People like to have freedom. They like to walk anywhere in the country and come back home without any harm. The people are requesting that type of freedom. That request has to be fulfilled for them by the Police Department, not by the grama niladhari, school teachers or doctors, he said.
The people of the country are still with us and we are trying to win those people's hearts. This is the message we are trying to spread in the country, he said.

Israel Prime Minister  faces criminal investigation over  fraud and bribery
	
Israeli police have obtained new documents in a secret probe against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, prompting them to seek a full criminal investigation against the politician on suspicion of bribery and fraud, local media reports. 
Since discovering the files, police have requested from Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit that he allow a full investigation against Netanyahu. Authorities are reportedly convinced that they will be able to open one in the coming days, Channel 2 News reported, according to The Times of Israel. 
The documents were reportedly obtained as part of a secret inquiry against Netanyahu by special police unit Lahav 433, which was launched in June. The probe was given the green light by Police Chief Roni Alsheich, who demanded secrecy and that no details of the investigation be leaked to the media. 
Meanwhile, Mandelblit also reportedly instructed employees in the state prosecutors office to look into allegations that Netanyahu accepted 1 million ($1.04 million) from Arnaud Mimran, a French businessman currently serving eight years in prison for committing carbon tax fraud. During his trial, Mimran claimed he donated the money to Netanyahu during his 2009 election campaign. 
However, Netanyahu has repeatedly denied the donation, and a spokesperson for the leader has called the newest action against him nonsense. 
Since Netanyahus victory in the last elections and even before, hostile elements have made heroic efforts to attempt to bring about [Netanyahus] downfall, with false accusations against him and his family. This [latest attempt] is absolutely false. There was nothing and there will be nothing, the spokesperson said, as quoted by Haaretz.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder What you need to know
	

Certain behavioral patterns deemed to be ritualistic and recurrent in an individual can be a telling sign that the person in question may be a victim of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle, stressed the need to provide proper treatment for OCD patients; in an attempt to avoid the recurrent behaviour evident in such patients. Explaining the intricacies related to OCD, Dr. Attygalle also highlighted that the peak age of onset for this condition falls during early adulthood. Excerpts of the interview are given below. 
QWhat is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and how does OCD affect the well-being of an individual
The core feature of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), are recurrent and intrusive thoughts that are distressing to the patient. Sometimes the thoughts themselves may get lost with time, leaving behind a ritual (washing hands ten times before and after eating) that the patient cant get away from.
When the thoughts are present, those with OCD try to resist them, only to see them come back again after some time. Unlike in psychosis, those with OCD are able to understand that although intrusive, these thoughts are their own and not put in their head by someone else. While this is a simple elaboration of the condition, it is a very complicated condition that is sometimes associated with other conditions such as depression, anxiety and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children. 
While we all have thoughts that are bothersome and recurrent (e.g. coming back to check whether the door is locked before you leave on a trip), for those with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder these thoughts are disabling and affect their day-to-day functioning. For example, someone with recurrent thoughts of contamination, might spend long hours thinking about how not to get their hands dirty. They may also have elaborate and time consuming rituals to clean their hands once they get dirty. For a child, this would be a huge distraction from schoolwork. Thus the whole process becomes distressing for the afflicted person and affects the way they do things in their day-to-day life. 

QWhat are the symptoms of OCD and how do you diagnose a patient
The symptoms we see will invariably vary with the type of recurrent thoughts the person has. The common themes could be cleaning/contamination, symmetry, hoarding and forbidden thoughts of a religious, aggressive or sexual nature. So while hand washing may be associated with contamination, keeping thing in painstaking order may be associated with symmetry. Forbidden thoughts may be associated with a wide range of behaviours, for example if the thought is sexual they may avoid being in contact, or be angry with the person the thoughts relate to, for no apparent reason.

Diagnosing OCD should be done by a person with experience in doing so. This is due to it being a complicated condition that is sometimes difficult to unravel. Having a Psychiatrist or a Child Psychiatrist in the case of a child confirm the diagnosis would be appropriate. 


QWhat are the risk factors/ causes leading to OCD and do genetics play a role with regard to being diagnosed with OCD
OCD has a high heritability, meaning that genetic factors are a major contributor. However, these factors are not simple but very complex genetic associations. Anomalies in neurotransmitter and firing of neuronal circuits in the brain are also thought to be contributory factors.


QWhat is the vulnerable age group diagnosed with OCD
The peak age of onset for this condition is in early adulthood. However, about 50% of development symptoms can be observed during childhood and adolescence but may not have been identified. The onset of the disorder happens earlier in males than in females, which leads to more children with the condition being male. 
Furthermore, most children with OCD are not able to identify the distressing thoughts but engage in recurrent activities that are difficult to stop. As children and their parents themselves may not be able to understand the condition, such children may get into trouble at home and at school. For example, the child who erases frequently because he wants to get every letter perfect, may be good in class but may get into trouble during a timed exam. Some children although aware of these obsessive thoughts, may keep them hidden because they may believe that the thoughts are bad, especially in the case of those with sexual content. 

QWhat kind of treatment or therapy is available for patients with OCD
For OCD that is mild, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) may be useful. In this form of therapy, an attempt is made to put in place behavioral strategies that help the child get used to tolerating the intrusive thoughts. For example, a programme to help the child with excessive hand washing would look at sensitizing him to having dirty hands. At a different level, CBT may also be used to help deal with the thoughts themselves. However in the case of children, CBT has to be adapted in a manner relevant to the childs age. 
With more severs forms of the disorder, medication has a significant benefit. However, medication may sometime take months to develop maximum benefit. Thus it is important to continue to take these medications regularly. A combination of the above 2 forms of treatment as well as supportive measures too can be helpful. 

QCan OCD be prevented
As OCD tends to have a mostly waxing and waning course, proper treatment taken for the appropriate duration can prevent recurrences. Another aspect of OCD that can be prevented is the secondary consequences of OCD. A child could be being made fun of because of his rituals. He could have failing grades because of the need to get every letter perfect and he cant finish on time. Thus such a child may feel depressed, refuse to go to school and struggle with friendships. All these could, to a certain extent, be prevented by proper treatment of OCD.

"Prabhakaran could have been PM if he was alive": Minister
	
If LTTE leader Prabhakaran had been living today he could have become the Prime Minister of the country, said the State Minister of Child Affairs, Vijayakala Maheswaran.
She said so during a ceremony at the Kilinochchi District Secretariat to grant compensation to the Kilinochchi General Market stall holders whose stalls were gutted in September.
The Vadamarachchi area was renowned for Education. LTTE leader Prabhakaran, was from Valvettithurai. Compared to all of our presidents none could hold a candle to Prabhakarans leadership, she said.
If he had been living today, he could have been the Prime Minister or a Parliamentarian. It is our bad luck. Some politicians here say that the destruction started by Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe was ended by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
If our talk involves racialism in this manner we may be deprived of what we are entitled to. Instead of talking we must understand what we can get and what we cannot get out of this government of Good Governance and act accordingly, she said.
Whether it is in the North or the South if we talk racism, it is our generation that will be affected. In this government of Good Governance only good things are happening, she said. (S. N. Nibojan)

Throw that fairness cream away!
	


How many of us believe that fairness is the ultimate expression of beauty Today, fairness has become trendy so much so that fairness creams have become priorities. Beneath the urge to use life threatening cosmetics is the societal conception that dark skin is unacceptable. The cosmetic industry plays on this societal thinking and has since longtime advertised the efficacy of fairness creams, thus alluring the public who are dissatisfied with their skin tone. Daily Mirror spoke to Consultant dermatologist, Dr. Nayani Madarasingha on the harmful effects of skin whitening creams, injections which apparently whiten the skin and the importance of using an appropriate sunscreen to protect oneself from the scorching sun.  What we need to maintain is blemish free clear skin and not fair skin. Fairness given by fairness creams is temporary. Once you stop applying it the colour comes back as you have been born with it, said Dr. Madarasinghe. 
We live in a tropical country. Naturally we are exposed to sunlight. Long-term exposure to sunlight causes effects of ageing such as wrinkles and rough skin. 80% of premature aging is caused by sun damage. Exposure to sun can cause skin cancers. But we are not so prone to sun- related skin cancers as in other countries where fair people live, because we are protected by the melanin in our skin, she said. 
She added that attempting to remove melanin artificially causes many harmful effects. Ageing and skin cancers are the main health effects. In certain salons, products are made to give fairness with no due care to its ingredients. There is a drug called steroid, prescribed for skin diseases, which makes the skin fair as a side effect. Some use this drug alongside other ingredients to make fairness creams. This can cause the thinning of skin, redness, over whitening of the skin and pimples. Heavy metals such as mercury can cause skin cancers.  She noted that pigmentary diseases, genetics, hormonal imbalance, weight gain, certain cosmetics and sun exposure made one dark in appearance. You have to treat the root causes. If you get darker because of gaining weight, you have to reduce your weight instead of applying fairness cream. Even internal cancers can cause skin darkening. Therefore you need to meet a skin specialist who could identify the root cause and treat it accordingly, she said.  Referring to the problems related to pigmentation she said, Certain pigmentary problems are aggravated by sun exposure. There are certain skin conditions where you get black patches or darkening of the face. In these cases there are skin whitening agents but they have to be taken under the supervision of a specialist.  Sometimes, when I prescribe such a cream to be taken for two months after which the patient is supposed to meet me, the patient takes it for 6 months and then decides to come back to follow it up. This is wrong. You cant use a cream that has been prescribed for a friend either, she added, asserting that over the counter fairness creams were not safe. 

GLUTATHIONE INJECTIONS ARE NOT SAFE
She further said injections which supposedly made people fair were not safe as their long-term efficacy and safety had not been proven scientifically. The injection called glutathione is not registered as a safe drug in Sri Lanka. No board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon will prescribe this. However there is a racket going on. Long-term effects of injecting this drug are not known. Certain countries have banned this injection as well. 

SUN PROTECTION
Emphasizing the importance of sun protection Dr. Madarasinghe said fairness could be achieved to a certain extent by applying a sunscreen. You can improve the complexion through sunscreen. It delays ageing. Certain sunscreens are not cosmetically appealing as they tend to be oily. You need to use different sunscreens and use one that is appropriate to your skin. You need to apply a thick layer of sunscreen half an hour before going out in the sun. It has to be reapplied every three to four hours.

UNP hits out at SLFP saboteurs working with JO
	
The governments main constituent party the UNP today charged that some SLFPers who are dealing with the Joint opposition are working to sabotage the development programmes of the government.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha told a media briefing that this situation was clearly indicated by the statements made by some members of the government and the defeating of the Development (special provisions) Bill in several provincial councils.
" We are sure that the no one who is backing President Maithripala Sirisena are involved in these dramas but those in the joint opposition and a handful of SLFPers who have secret dealings with them are involved in it" Mr Jayamaha said.
"President Sirisena should be aware of these forces" the MP said while revealing that UNP MPs intend having a dialogue with the President to clear things up.
Further he said the development special provisions Bill could be implemented by the Central government after it is approved by Parliament. At the same time the MP said President Sirisena or others could bring in amendments to the Bill. "It is possible to discuss the amendments and implement them" he said.
MP Kavinda Jayawardena alleged that some members of the government including Dilan Perera were engaged in making unnecessary statements. "These Ministers should realize that they are putting President Sirisena in a difficult situation. The UNP will never isolate President Sirisena and will not allow the conspiracies of the joint opposition and few others to succeed" he said. He said this government would carry on till 2020 under any circumstances.
He said the development special provisions bill was referred to the provincial councils because they were moving in a democratic manner
MP Hector Appuhamy said the government would bring in a 'Top hundred' programme under which shady 100 deals of the previous government will be revealed. He said said this was aimed at countering the ' Top 10' programme of the joint opposition.(Yohan Perera)

US denies Israeli claims that US was behind UN resolution
	

RT.COM/ 27 Dec, 2016 -  Accusations by the Israeli ambassador that the US was behind the UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements are just not true, the US State Department said. Israel has blamed Washington for not vetoing the resolution. 
Adopted on Friday, Resolution 2334 declared Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East-Jerusalem to be a flagrant violation of international law. 

We reject the notion that the US was the driving force behind this resolution, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters at the daily press briefing Tuesday. Thats just not true. 
Toner said that Palestinians worked with Egypt to formulate the resolution, and that Washington urged some changes to the text to make it more balanced. 
We ended up abstaining because we didnt feel it was balanced enough, Toner said.
He defended the resolution itself, however, saying that there was nothing in there that would prompt us to veto.
