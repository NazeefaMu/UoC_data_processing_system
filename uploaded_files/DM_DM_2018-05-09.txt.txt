A Century of Service reviewed Bringing nostalgic memories of  Girl Guides movement
	
elegantly produced volume to commemorate 100 (1917-2017) years of the Girl Guides movement in Sri Lanka was compiled by a team and written primarily by Prof. Ryhana Raheem, formerly of the Open University ofSri Lanka, who was also a committed Girl Guide. 
Once a Guide, always a Guide, she said when I protested that I dont really have the credentials to review this book, because in my own time I had been an indifferent Girl Guide who dismally failed the simplest of tests. But her words resonate in the accounts in this book of a rather impressive group of women leaders who formed, shaped and navigated the Girl Guides movement in this country through the turbulent years of the 20th century and the first two decades of the 21st century. 
This project to record the development of the Girl Guides movement is, in essence, an attempt at writing its history, never an uncomplicated task. This was compounded, as Prof. Raheem says in her introduction, by the loss of many old documents due to Colombos humidity and even the floods of 1990. 
A significant part of the narrative is visual, with old sepia and black and white photographs showing Girl Guides and leaders evolving from wearing military style colonial dresses with hats to white saris and osaris
Still, these multiple sources have made for an impressive account of the Girl Guides movement that traces its growth alongside the sociopolitical history of the country. This interweaving of the particularities of the Girl Guides with the significant events of the country during the 100 years it covers is skillfully done in the narrative, making the text of interest to a much greater readership than the nostalgic ex-Girl Guide. 
The book begins by tracing the beginnings of the movement in England, still very much the centre of the British Empire. The military roots of the Boy Scouts movement and its founder, the much decorated British army general Lord Baden Powell, veteran of the Boer War and the Great War, are no less evident in the origins of the Girl Guide movement with its principles of patriotism, collective industriousness, and leadership; its administrative units; its orders of hierarchy; its ritual salutes and march-pasts. All this was faithfully replicated in colonial Ceylon. First introduced by Jeannie Calverley at Girls High School Kandy, then at Methodist College Colombo and next at Southlands, Galle, Guiding spread fairly quickly to other missionary and local schools in the country. 
A significant part of the narrative is visual, with old sepia and black and white photographs showing Girl Guides and leaders evolving from wearing military style colonial dresses with hats to white saris and osaris, and to the trouser suits and brightly-coloured T shirts of the present day field uniforms. The headquarters building remains a constant: built in the 1930s, and still the official hub, providing the venue for many activities. 
Conservative girls schools 
The book also attempts to describe the regional spread through an account of how guiding spread in the North and the East, specifically in Jaffna and in Batticaloa, and in the South, for example in Galle and Tangalle, in addition to its spread in Colombo and Kandy. In the conservative girls schools of Jaffna at the time, momentum to the spread of Guiding was gained, apparently, by the heroic deed of a Girl Guide called Ariyam Hudson Paramasamy who saved a girl from drowning in a well. Accounts like this, snippets of speeches during the considerable number of visits by Lord and Lady Baden-Powell to Ceylon (the Guides of Ceylon are in fine fettle! Lady BP is said to have declared at a rally) and of Miss Calverley, on her way to Colombo by ship to her post at Kandy Girls High School reading the Handbook for Girl Guides during the voyage, all add rather delicious touches to the book. 
Independence and the subsequent decades of the 20th century saw the growth and the decentralization of the Girl Guides movement in Sri Lanka. Names changed to reflect the local culture, Brownies became Little Friends, and Owls, the leaders of Brownies were ditched for creatures who sound less inauspicious. The language of Guiding still remained largely English even after independence, even though the publication recalls how the Handbook for Girl Guides which Ms Calverley read on her sea voyage to Ceylon was translated into Sinhala and Tamil as early as in 1933 by Rene Blaz who worked in the Vernacular Commission of the time. 
The accounts by successive Commissioners form a significant part of the narrative. These accounts present an interesting picture of the evolving tasks and responsibilities of the Girl Guides and how they responded to the changing needs of the country: Community based projects to uplift maternal health, child health, water and sanitation, and nutrition; skills training; leadership skills training; peace camps and training in conflict resolution, to interethnic friendship camps, Uthuru Mithuru, after 2009. 
Sirimavo 
Collaborations have included those with international organizations such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), UNICEF and UNDP, as well as networking with various departments of the Government. Impressive too it is to read about the recognition and honour that the Girl Guides received, often from the head of state no less (Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was a Girl Guide in her day, a fact that appears to be capitalized on during the 1970s!). 
Also of significance are the Commissioners accounts of how the movement survived during times of strife: the breakdown in communications with the UK during World War II, and surviving the disapproval of the shadowy rebel groups of the 1987-1989 Reign of Terror in the south (apparently the Tiger rebels approved of the Girl Guides). Chief Commissioner from 1983-1990 the late Venetia Gamage says that her tenure was a time when the country was caught between troubles in the North and in the South, forcing the Guides to be as low key as possible. The Commissioner during 1971 also recalls how Guiding came to a virtual standstill after the 1971 Insurrection and the ban on gatherings by youth. Tenacity however prevailed, of almost a missionary zeal; the movement managed to set up a Guide company for former female rebels of the Insurrection in a rehabilitation camp in Nugegoda in 1972 and for former female LTTE cadre in a similar camp in Ratmalana in 2010. 
The book also attempts to describe the regional spread through an account of how guiding spread in the North and the East, specifically in Jaffna and in Batticaloa, and in the South, for example in Galle and Tangalle
A refreshing piece of honest, reflective writing is offered by two Commissioners, just when the reader might feel the absence of a more critical view on the SLGG movement. Yasmin Raheem, Chief Commissioner 2013- 2017 and Visakha Tillekeratne (the Current Chief Commissioner) consider the challenges faced by the Guides: the school-based structure of the movement that provides stability but has also engendered a very teacher-centric, top down approach to Guiding, the resistance to change, the lack of leadership skills to ensure sustainability, and the challenges to adapt to the changing needs of the 21st century. Interestingly, some of these challenges besiege most local organizations and hamper their growth. 
In response to these challenges, the Guides, to their credit, have launched a Community Guiding project to include young women and girls who fall through the cracks of formal education such as street children, children of fishing communities and gypsy communities.
The Centenary publication, priced at Rs. 2500/= is available at the Headquarters of the Sri Lanka Girl Guide Association,Sir Marcus Fernando Mawatha, Colombo7.  
From a movement that began in a handful of colonial schools in the early part of the 20th century, there are 60,000 Girl Guides in 2,000 schools all over the country today. The leadership of the Guides that in the early decades tended to be made up of the urban upper classes appears to be changing. Local languages are increasingly more accommodated in the activities of Guiding, while, at the same time, an international outlook is sustained. 
This book manages to capture all this and much more in its pages. It is a far cry from the usual commemorative volumes that are often well intentioned, but end up being rather dismal indulgences in nostalgia, hastily produced, besieged by flowery, platitudinous prose, and non-existent editing. With its well-written content, meticulous editing and a sparse, but beautiful design, A Century of Service looks good enough to adorn your coffee table, and to learn about a fairly formidable organisation that is a significant part of contemporary Sri Lankan history. Not to mention becoming a part of any Girl Guides life, because, you know, once a Guide, always a Guide.

A selfless offer with a romantic undertone
	

A big row over the question of a toilet is said to be brewing these days at a key government office located at a very high level at a high rise building the city, they say.

There is no toilet for those working in a certain division of this key office and they are compelled to climb up to an upper floor to share this this facility with those working on that floor.
Meanwhile, a certain high-up in charge of vital documents working on the upper floor where the facility is available has offered his cubicle to be converted to a toilet for the specific use of those working on the floor sans a toilet provided that some space for him to work is set apart on the latter floor.
Meanwhile, the chief of the maintenance division who had made inquiries as to why the high-up was prepared to give up his comfortable cubicle in preference to an improvised work desk on another floor, had learnt that there was a romantic undertone to his selfless offer. The man was in love with a lady on the floor sans a toilet and her nearness to him was more worth and desirable to him than the comforts of his spacious cubicle on the upper floor.
However, the authorities concerned turned down his generous offer and are said to be looking for suitable space elsewhere to construct a toilet.
The course of true love seldom runs smooth, they say.

Appointment of Mahanama as Chief of Staff - Should have warned Prez: Rajitha
	
I should have told President Sirisena not to appoint I. H. K. Mahanama as his Chief of Staff, as I knew that many allegations had been levelled against him, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a news briefing, he said he was not informed that Mahanama, who was earlier the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms, was to be appointed the Presidents Chief of Staff.
When Mahanama was secretary to the Ministry of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms, I was the minister in charge of the subject. One day, I noticed that Mr. Mahanama had leased a land belonging to the government to a private firm to be used to build a chocolate factory. That was the first indication to me that he was not acting according to my orders. Thats how I knew he cannot be trusted, Senaratne said.
I was unaware that he was the Presidents Chief of Staff until he was arrested while receiving a bribe, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Battered Meethotamulla residents demand their lands
The time was not at all auspicious for residents of Meethotamulla area back in 2017 on April 14th when the entire country was getting ready to welcome the Sinhala and Hindu New year. The garbage mount which covers a vast area collapsed without leaving a trace of propertyand 31 lives. 
The Meethotamulla garbage mount received the attention of authorities in January, 2013 when Meethotamulla Sri Rahula Vidyalaya closed down. From then many protests were staged urging the authorities to halt garbage dumping in the area. At that time around 800 tons of garbage was dumped daily in the area which coversapproximately 17 Acres. 
The residents pointed out that it was a tragedy which could have been prevented. Under the Supreme Court order SCFR 218/2009 the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had limited authority to dump garbage. However, contrary to the order, CMC continued to dump garbagein this area. 
Despite the many campaigns held with the aim of eradicating dengue none of them was applicable to Meethotamulla. The area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and there were many residents who contracted dengue. Residents in the area suffering from skin diseases and respiratory issues was common. Irrespective of the number of pleas, protests and the campaigns the authorities turned blind eyeto the issue. 
The loss of lives in April 2017 was an eye-opener to many. Some lives had to be sacrificed for the authorities to notice the issue and put a stop to the permanent dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla. 
A year has passed and there are residents in this area without homes. This is despite promises made to them by the authorities.  Shantha Jayasinghe, a resident who lost his house and vehicle due to the collapse of the garbage mount, said that he was born and bred in the area and that the residents possessed deeds for the land they lived on. We are not illegal residents despite some of the Media saying so he said. 
He said that an estimate of forty Lakhs was made for the houses, but no estimate had been made so far regarding thevalue of the land. 
Housing in flats 
The residents said that they were given Rs. 50,000 per month as a rent for three months. But this payment was halted after August 2017. During this period some of the residents were evacuated as they were living in areas which were identified as danger zones. Also some of the residents were evacuated considering the fact their houses were half or fully damaged. Some even got housing in flats. 
They point out that the basis of the valuation is not fair. And they again had to make requests regarding thebalance payments. 
We had to go to Divisional Secretariat requesting for the balance of the compensation. Following a few meetings and requests being made, arrangements were made to give us the money due from August 2017, theresidents said. 
The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayed
Kapila Perera, another resident who lost his house, said that there is another sect of residents who didnt receive compensation. Yes, we managed to receive compensation, but there are some residents who didnt receive anything. There are residents who do not have title deeds, but a card instead which was given during the period of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. But this card is not accepted anywhere nor is any guidance given to those residents, he complained.  Perera further said that although the media portray that 90% of the issues of the residents were solved this news is far from the reality. 
Fighting for what they deserve 
It is indeed sad how some of the media portrayed this whole incident. Some of the people got the idea that the collapse of the garbage mount was a blessing in disguise as some residents got houses in flats. This is not true. We were left only with what we wore at that moment. Since then life has been a constant battle. We have not been given a permanent solution for the housing issue. We have to fight even to get what we deserve, he said. 
The residents said that none of the Members of Parliament who represented the area followed up what had happened after the collapse of the dump. Adding to their woes none of the Non Governmental Organizations approached them to offer help. They live in constant fear as to what
would happen next. 
Many promises were made. One of the promises made was to make this a green zone, but nothing has been done even after the lapse of a year. There is no plan for the next step. True, now they do not dump garbage here, but what are they going to do to the mount It is still there. Sri Rahula Vidyalaya is still closed. Our Children faced not only health issues, but also had to deal with social concerns. Once the school was closed they were given new schools but were looked down by other students, they said. They said that compared to other similar situations that developed in the country they were not offered any help to uplift their mental status. 
When other disasters struck the country many steps were taken on behalf of the peoples welfare. During past disasters there was also psychological support for those affected. There were children who were to sit for the Grade five Scholarship Examination. This is one opportunity which a child gets to join a school that offers better facilities. After the devastation the children could not perform at the exam in keeping with expectations as they did not have books nor other psychological support. As parents we could not support them as we too were devastated at that time, they said.  The residents further said that if they arent provided with a reasonable solution by the Government the only option they have is to return to the area close to the garbage mount and build houses.
We were born and bred here. All our lives evolved here. If the Government is not going to dump garbage they can clear the area, improve infrastructure and give the lands back to the residents, the residents said. 
Furthermore they said that although a committee had been set up, the only action taken so far was the removing of the Commissioner of the CMC. 
It is not just the Commissioner who should be responsible for this. There were many people who are responsible. What is the use of removing just one official It does not make any difference to our lives theresidents argued. 
The garbage mount still stands tall. The monument gives the indication that it is trying to relate a story about a section of the society that has been battered and betrayed.  When the Daily Mirror contacted Navin Mannapperuma, Director Western Province Waste Management Authority, he said that measures had been taken to make the garbage mount less active. There are many garbage mounts like these in the world. Although many claim that the garbage here can be recycled, in reality we cannot use the entire mount for that purpose. What can be done is to make it inactive. There is a plan executed by University of Moratuwa along with the Ministry of Megapolis with regard to Meethotamulla, he said.

## Title: Duplicate-Mahinda  is not the answer UNP needs a winning unifier
## Section: Opinion

Duplicate-Mahinda  is not the answer UNP needs a winning unifier
	
Be yourself, because an original is worth more than a copy- Unknown quotes
In order to defeat the Mahinda Rajapaksa juggernaut, there is one thing the United National Party (UNP) should not do  field a Duplicate Mahinda. What is the Mahinda Rajapaksa-candidature looking like In an election campaign, the one thing one must pay most attention to is the basic brand of the candidature. How does the voter look at the brand Is there an identifiable brand Did the planners of the campaign, or the politico-experts, originally plan to brand the Rajapaksa-candidature or did the advertisers do so Sometimes a brand gets built up without any effort being made to build it. Unlike professional marketing of branded products, like Sunlight for soap or Astra for margarine, political marketing, prior to early 1990s, there was no sophisticated campaign planning. Yet, the 1956 campaign of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) seemed to have been a coordinated effort without which such a sweeping victory would have been possible.
Bandaranaike, with that campaign in 56, gave a fantastic brand to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), common mans party and a brand which is valid and applicable even in todays context of a more sophisticated and tech-savvy public relations environment. That common mans party brand has outlasted its creators own assassination, its domination by a feudal tyranny such as Sirimavo and Felix Dias Bandaranaike, its being decimated by the Rajapaksa clan and its seemingly obliteration under the current leader of the party.
In addition to being branded a cardboard or duplicate-Mahinda, any nationalistic or narrow chauvinistic appeal to the voter would betray the very essence of the UNP
Such a strong branding has been facilitated by its incessant propaganda, despite the SLFPs numerous and varied flirtations with the not-so-common man. The SLFP leadership, until it fell on the present holder, has been, including the Rajapaksa clan, set up on a feudal platform revolving around a family. Although the Rajapaksa family does not belong to that feudal denomination in a classical sense, family rule was the core power centre, so to speak. The great irony of this phenomenon is the ease with which the rank and file of the party accepted this family rule.
The acceptance of the Bandaranaike family could be explained as its founder, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike hailed from a leading low-country, Govigama family in the nineteenth century. SWRDs father was the first among many local government servants who served the colonial British regime at the time. Subservience shown by the then populace towards these feudal masters continued towards this family rule even after independence albeit the fact that SWRD was one of the earliest liberals who advocated breakage of the bond between the master and servant, a generations-old practice which was exercised by the Bandaranaike clan before him.
When he launched his new political party on the five-pronged platform of Sanga, Veda, Guru, Govi, Kamkaru, (Buddhist Clergy, Indigenous doctor, school teacher, farmer and worker), so was launched the political party of the common man. However, since his assassination by a member of one of the five pillars of his platform, since its takeover by his widow, the SLFP became anything but common mans party. The widow, Sirimavo with the able assistance of Felix Dias, a Bandaranaike whose participation in politics SWRD never sought, turned the common mans party into an uncommon mans party. Yet, its grassroots rank and file clung on to its draconian leaders and their representative henchmen and women at the village level. The theory of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Propaganda Minister under Hitler, that an untruth repeated over and over again would become the truth was proven right. Today the common mans party is really a petty mans party.
While the SLFP was branded the common mans party, the UNP became the rich (uncommon) mans party. One stark reality within the ranks of the SLFP remained its sense of nationalism bordering on chauvinism. This chauvinistic legacy was passed down the line of successive leaderships in the SLFP and the Rajapaksas were the last to be the fortunate recipients of that ignoble inheritance.
However, the Rajapaksas added value to this chauvinism of the party. The thirty-year war with Tamil militants and its conclusion to a gleaming success thanks to devoted and determined efforts of a military and its leadership of the calibre of General Sarath Fonseka was that added value. All of a sudden, the common mans party became a party of patriots. And every other political party was branded unpatriotic! Mahinda Rajapaksa became a devout Buddhist overnight; he started giving Mercedes Benz cars to leading Buddhist monks and followed the R. Premadasa practice of Bana at the Temple Trees on every Poya Day. To paraphrase a clich of Catholic genre, Mahinda Rajapaksa had become more Buddhist than Arahat Sariputta.
So cleverly and consistently built was this image of patriot and Buddhist, Mahinda Rajapaksa became unsurpassable on the score of religion and love for the country. In other words, he made it impossible for a duplicate-Mahinda to be constructed in the political arena. It is here, if any of the UNP leaders attempts to float an image of a duplicate-Mahinda in order to defeat him or his cohorts such as Gotabaya, Basil or even Chamal in an election, would fall flat. The UNP leadership has drawn its strength not from being fringe-friendly; on the contrary it has drawn its strength, from D.S. Senanayake downwards up to Ranil Wickremesinghe, apart from the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, the Tamils in the North and the estate sector and Muslims scattered all round the country.
For instance, take all the Cabinets from 1947 to date, not a single elected non-UNP/Independent/Federal/TULF/TNA Tamil leader has served any Sri Lankan Cabinet. In the DS Cabinet, the two Cabinet ministers were C. Siththampalam and C. Sundaralingam, both elected as Independent MPs. Later, G.G. Ponnambalam joined the Cabinet not from the Federal Party but from Tamil Congress and both Sundaralingam and Ponnambalam lost their seats in the following elections. The next Cabinet member was Thiruchelvam in Dudley Senanayakes coalition government from the Federal Party and its leader Chelvanayagam saw to it that the Cabinet minister came from the Senate (non-elective body of government). Sirimavos Cabinet in 1970 had a Tamil minister, Chelliah Kumarasuriar, and he too originated from the Senate, not elected. In the 1977 J.R. Jayewardene Cabinet, S. Thondaman from Nuwara Eliya became quite a powerful Cabinet minister. The Northern Tamil was not represented in an overwhelming Sinhalese Cabinet since 1965  M. Thiruchelvam.
However, after the Presidential system was introduced, since 1982, no candidate has been successful without securing the support of the Tamil vote in the North. The only exception is 2009 Presidential election which was held soon after the war-victory which explains the Tamil vote in the North was not a factor.
If any in the UNP thinks that he or she can outdo Mahinda in Mahindas strong suit, then think again
The argument is, as much as Sir John Kotalawela failed miserably at the 1956 general election despite promising more than Bandaranaike for the Sinhalese Buddhist cause, no duplicate-Mahinda will be a successful candidate from the UNP. In addition to being branded a cardboard or duplicate-Mahinda, any nationalistic or narrow chauvinistic appeal to the voter would betray the very essence of the United National Party, a party that represents a united Sri Lanka. Populism and nationalism might well be the political wind that is sweeping across the USA and European continent, the Sinhalese Buddhist vote being divided between the UNP and anti-UNP bloc proportioned on a 35% to 65%, it is highly unlikely to secure the seat of presidency without the Tamil vote in the North and the Muslim vote all over the country.
The scorching Jaffna-sun is indeed having its effects not only on the untiring Tamil working farmers in the North, it is bearing an unchallenged consequence on the electoral landscape in Sri Lanka. The UNP and its new leadership with the younger heads such as Navin Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa have a formidable challenge. Their bitter battles will be fought not only in the rural hamlets where the unrivalled majority are Sinhalese Buddhists, they will have to predominate the North, hill-country and the East. Minority votes are not only a must; they are the foundation on which any realistic campaign could be built upon.
If any in the UNP thinks that he or she can outdo Mahinda in Mahindas strong suit, then think again. When the voter wants to oust Mahinda or his siblings, the voter is looking for an alternative, not a duplicate. Most politicians make this grievous error in judgment. Especially in the sphere of socio-political issues, the voter is extremely sensitive when he makes his choice. Unlike economic issues to which the voter confronts them on a daily and continuously changing circumstance, socio-political issues entrench him over a long period of time. Sensitivity to socio-political issues does not depend on short-term whims and fancies of one or two politicians. Any politician who changes his or her stance on a socio-political issue may not gather more votes from the majority bloc; but if he chooses to trek a different path, he may lose a sizable chunk of the minority costing him the election. That is not an option for either Navin Dissanayake or Sajith Premadasa, if they are planning to contest the next Presidential elections on the UNP ticket.

Executive Presidency Dont burn fingers by striking while the iron is hot
	
I allude to the recent article titled Abolition of Executive Presidency has become viable published in the press by Mr. Jehan Perera focusing on an emerging prospect of abolishing the Executive Presidency. My immediate response would be to say, Why throw the baby with the bath water. A pithy Sinhala saying is Muhunath ekka thiyena tharahata aiy nahaya kapaganney (Why cut ones nose because of the anger with the face) Any proposal to abolish the Executive Presidency at this moment of time can only be hatched in the womb ofpolitical expediency. 
Review merits and demerits in the present and future context
Mr. Perera has side-tracked the implications and the pros and cons of this critically important issue by casually stating that merits and demerits of the Executive Presidency have been discussed over the years, since its inception in 1978. It is unfortunate that one had to shift the focus to striking when the iron is hot without reviewing the implications of this elusive issue in its current and future contexts. Why should we burn our fingers by striking an iron just because it is hot Isnt it unprecedented in the history of Sri Lanka or for that matter world politics, that two arch rivals in the political arena formed a hybrid Govt.
to focus on Country first by setting aside parochial political-power differences and self-interests For decent citizens it was indeed a candid exhibition of political maturity and signalled the beginning of the much awaited Paradigm shift in Sri Lankas Political Culture, leading to a Peoples Govt. Is it fair to throw this superlative political renunciation to the dust bin of history or nip this singular effort in the bud, within a span of 3 years 
Who created the seeming chaos
In our view, it is the cavalier- style, irresponsible, immature statements made by a coterie of our unprincipled, haughty and spineless politicians that have upset the Apple cart more than anything else. It is regrettable that our mass media have exercised their liberty to blow such unpatriotic small talk and statements out of proportion, merely to sensationalise and play to the gallery. Ironically and unfortunately it has created a rift between the main parties of the Hybrid Govt. Is it not a result of a power-seeking coterie of politicians breathing down the throats of the ruling Govt. under the pretext of following the model of Westminster Parliament democracy 
Merits of Executive Presidency
In all my relevant submissions to the press, I have supported retention of Executive Presidency, provided that all dictatorial clauses (including judicial immunity) are removed. Of course, the unparalleled merit was that it directly helped to end the 30-year plague of terrorism. Now it has become a sine-qua-non for the Executive to build up a Sri Lankan identity devoid of ethnicity, colour, caste and creed. Another important merit is, it can be effectively used to control the behaviour of Provincial Governance. Executive machinery makes decision making and problem solving quicker, to ensure rapid development of the country. This post can be used to discharge the functions of a National Ombudsman quite effectively. The Presidents Fund and the activities of the Presidential Secretariat surely are positive features. However, proper administrative checks and balances should be introduced to prevent abuses such as the Sil Redi case and release of funds through the Presidents Fund. 
Steps taken to remove demerits
The hybrid Govt. through the 19th amendment took a refreshing start by removing some of those abhorrent clauses such as the 18th amendment, power to dissolve Parliament after 01 year, unilateral power of the president to make appointments to key State Institutions and introducing a power-sharing and a consultative mechanism with the Prime Minister which compensates for the dilution of the Presidents powers. If there is a sincere political will, umpteen ways can be found to remove barriers! 
Conclusion
As we know, abolition of the Executive Presidency requires a 2/3rds majority and a high-cost Referendum. Therefore, let us avoid such wasteful expenditure and remove the remaining bad teeth such as Judicial immunity and other such clauses, if any, bordering on dictatorship through suitable amendments, and continue with the Executive Presidency in keeping with the emerging needs of the country without becoming victims and slaves of academic theory and practice. It is also necessary to make the Executive President serve purely as a Statesman cum Caretaker of all the people irrespective of political hues, ethnicity and creed. For this purpose, the President should not be allowed to participate in party politics during his term of office.
In our view, the rivalry issue of Executive President vs Prime Minister or Parliament will not prevail if our politicians stick to the objectives of a democratic machinery and learn to place the country first, in their decision-making and behavioural processes. The issue of Hung Parliament or Unstable Govt. too will not arise if politicians raise up their hands to all policies and proposals that are beneficial to the country without opposing for the sake of opposing. Thus the need of the hour is a change of heart by all politicians to selflessly contribute to fine-tune and amend proposals or bills, with the sincere intention of doing their best for the greater good of the country.

External forces attempting to disrupt China-SL ties: Ambassador
	
Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan maintained that certain external forces are provoking unfounded speculation on joint mega-projects between Sri Lanka and China in order to disrupt the cooperation and create problems between the two countries in order to further their own interests.
Issuing a statement, the Chinese Embassy said the Ambassador has expressed these views upon meeting Speaker Karu Jayasuriya last week. At the meeting, Ambassador Cheng reiterated that China attaches great importance to its relations with Sri Lanka and stands ready to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries.
Work on the Colombo Port City Project, the Hambantota Port as well as the economic corridors connecting Colombo to Hambantota and Kandy are progressing rapidly with our joint efforts, he said.
Ambassador Cheng denied allegations of a military motive behind China's decision to conduct friendly and pragmatic cooperation with Sri Lanka.
Responding to this, Speaker Jayasuriya thanked China for its long-term support especially following the civil war and highlighted that Chinese President Xi's Belt and Road Initiative and the idea of building a community of a shared future for mankind have been added to the United Nations' documents several times.
The Speaker stressed that all concerned are aware of the truth behind the Hambantota Port Project, which is a commercial project undertaken between two countries rather than, as some have alleged, a case of "militarization" by China.
There are people with extremist ideas in every country and those making unfounded speculations may have their own ulterior motives. Sri Lanka attaches great importance to cooperation with China, especially with regards to the Hambantota Port Project and the Colombo Port City Project," the Speaker said.

Failed mission of an enterprising politico
	

The political sibling of the Giruwapattu family who has been given the credit for leading Pohottuwa to victory at the last mini-polls, held a bash the other day to mark his birthday. His elder sibling, the former strongman too had attended the event. Gabby Rattaran had brought the birthday cake.

By the way, there had been many religious ceremonies in several parts of the country organized by the Pohottuwa activists to invoke blessings on the Pohottuwa Lokka and those at the birthday party had also come prepared to accompany the Pohottuwa Lokka to these religious ceremonies.
A stranger too had tagged along the group led by the Pohottuwa Lokka on their visits to the organized religious ceremonies. However, the Pohottuwa Lokka had ignored the tailing stranger right along.
Meanwhile, some inquisitive ones in the group who had made inquiries had found that the stranger was a Ratna, a former Diyawanna member from Atugala out to warm his way into the graces of Pohottuwa Lokka with a view to contesting the next general polls as a Pohottuwa nominee. And this worthy had decided that he had to build a strong rapport with the Pohottuwa Lokka if he were to do better at the polls than the other two stalwarts from Atugala, Johnny and Salinda.

Fire breaks out at Katunayaka duty-free shopping mall
	
A fire broke out at an electrical home appliance shop in the Duty-Free shopping mall at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) this morning, Airport duty manager said.
He said the fire was immediately doused by the fire brigade attached to the Katunayake Airport with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Army fire brigade.
Electrical home appliances such as refrigerators, televisions and washing machines were destroyed due to the fire. One floor of the duty-free shopping complex was filled with a dark smoke so we had to use a backhoe to break down a wall of the shopping mall," the manager said. 
The cause of the fire has not been identified and officials are yet to calculate the estimated loss of electrical items that were destroyed in the fire.
Katunayaka police are investigating the incident. (T.K.G.Kapila)

Focussing on Sri Lanka Railways Bumpy rides on rusty rail lines
	
Neighbouring India has trains running Apps which allow passengers to be aware of train delays and where the trains are located at any given time. This facility is so convenient for passengers who experience frequent train delays, which take place especially when Sri Lanka Railways cancels trains without providing back-up trains. 
General Manager of Railways S.M Abeywickrama said that if Sri Lanka Railways was unable to provide a train following a delay, the authorities are able to provide compensationto passengers. 
But passengers who are travelling for short distances wont wait to receive the compensation, being
aware of the usual long process involved in getting work done in aGovernment institution. 
We have already paid customers in the absence of trains during occasions such as strikes and have also provided free bus services during such strikes. We offer compensation on days when there are strikes, on days when we exactly know that there wont be any trains operating, said Abeywickrama. 
Answering a question as to why the railway services arent developed and updated to suit the present demands, Abeywickrama said that the railway services are being used by a massive crowd which had increased recently. 
Not only the scarcity of trains, but the presence of having only a few railway lines has become a barrier for us in providing a good service. Between some places like Fort and Maradana, there are only a limited amount of lines, which further adds to the train traffic during peak hours. Another line is essential between Fort and Maradana, said Abeywickrma. 
Additional line for problem areas
As many as 340 trains run daily. Therefore more railway linesare required. We are planning to add a line to the problematic areas like Polgahawela and Kurunegala in the future. We have recognized several locations like that where there is a need to add more lines and reduce the traffic, he said. 
15 new trains, including six from India and nine from China, have already been ordered. Additionally, 160 train carriages and 22 engines will be bought by next year. We would be able to develop the current railway service by the mid half of next year. We have already started several projects to renew a number of frequently used dilapidated carriages. The Railway Department itself is carrying on one project, he said. 
Nine renewed carriages after being connected have commenced passenger transportation recently. These carriages were renovated with the support of the private sector. 
We are planning to continue with this project. We admit that sometimes trains get delayed due to technical faults or traffic lines. If one train breaks down, the next one to run on the line would be definitely late. Anyway we have informed the Railway Maintenance Section to keep lines fully serviced. Despite some old railway lines are being maintained daily, there are some places where the maintenance work has stopped. We have to replace rails at some places. Much funds are needed to import sleepers. If those replacements are not made, we have to put speed limits tocertain points. 
Many vacancies
No recruitment has been made to fill voids at the top positions, hence a number of vacancies remain. There is a shortage of train drivers, guards and station masters. There are low salary scales associated with certain sections. Employees recruited at executive level have been inactive for years. 
A private party was tasked with the cleaning of trains. This was following a tender process initiated by Dhawana Bala Upa Department. 
Commenting further on issues related to Sri Lanka Railways, Withanage said that the railway tracks in Sri Lanka belong to the stone age and lack basic essential facilities
Train accidents-which include suicide attempts-have hugely burdened us. We ourselves have to take the victim to the nearest hospital and such actions cause an unavoidable delay, said the General Manager. 
Whats unfortunate is that a few days after the newly modified train was launched, passengers had completely destroyed it. 
National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection ( NMCRP ) Chairman Ranjith Withanage said that Sri Lanka Railways does not have a method to offer compensation to passengers during train delays. 
Commenting further on issues related to Sri Lanka Railways, Withanage said that the railway tracks in Sri Lanka belong to the stone age and lack basicessential facilities.
Railway Unions carry out strikes all of a sudden despite the fact that there are thousands of people waiting to reach their destinations. Passengers do not have as option, other than disembarking from the trains and finding some other mode of transportation. Sri Lanka Railways should pay the entire ticket fare to passengers if they are unable to provide anothertrain. he said. Speaking elaborately on passenger rights, he said that passengers are not safe while travelling in trains. He added that there had been instances when passengers had been wounded and a few had died after stones were thrown at them recently. 
Withanage further noted that passengers are not offered a worthy service in keeping with the price they pay for tickets. 
He also mentioned that passengers need to fulfill certain responsibilities. Sagging seats, food wrappings and unclean walls are common signs in trains. Passengers steal light bulbs, break fans and glass windows, throw trash out of windows, cut seats for fun, travel in cliques singing and joking aloud and disturb fellow passengers. Some carriages lack electricity hence it is not safe for females to travel alone at night. Even during the day women clad in jewellery have been victimized by thieves. Our people still have an uncivilized attitude when it comes to protecting national services like this, he said. 
Many people die as a result of accidents which happen when they travel on the foot-board of the train, due to lack of space inside. We still have the same Railway lines built by the British. Those have not been reformed or developed. Trains still run at certain speed limits which have not been updated to suit the modern era. If the relevant authorities solve these issues, especially the issue with the speed, citizens might use trains more frequently to travel, reducing the traffic congestion, air pollution and sound pollution in return. 
We have been asking the Government to provide canteens, sanitary facilities, proper lighting, comfortable seats instead of hard, nearly vertical and narrow seats and to increase the speed limits. All our requests have been ignored so far. Many countries in the world have methods and systems to offer compensation during train delays. The compensation depends on the operator travelled with, type of ticket and the length of the delay. Trains are operated by train companies in other countries and they do update the Passengers Chart on which the compensation schemes are displayed. According to internet sources, details regarding the situations associated with trains and other related information are available in the Passenger Chart. 
The issues within Sri Lanka Railways must come to an end. Sri Lanka Railways should be able to provide a quality service to the general public. The passengers on the other hand have a responsibility in protecting national assets. The most fitting solution to road traffic would be a developed train service. It will be a long wait until the day arrives when the relevant authorities understand the importance of developing the railway servicesin Sri Lanka.

Mariks of Kolonnawa was a guest at the opening of the Vesak Zone organized by his former workplace. Number One was the Chief Guest at the event.

The ceremony over, Number One was about to get into his vehicle when he saw Mariks leaving the place. He immediately called him: Mantrituma, hop in to go places with me!
He got in not knowing where Number One was destined for.
Mariks soon noticed that the vehicle turn towards the Temple Trees and he got panicky. Sir, where are we going
We are going to open the Vesak Zone at Temple Trees!
Highly ruffled Mariks tone turned apologetic: Given the problems we are having in the party these days, God knows what our Lokka will think about me when he sees me going about with you!
Dont worry! You are accompanying me! was Number Ones nonchalant reply.
By now the vehicle pulled up opposite the Temple Trees and Number Two was approaching the vehicle to welcome the distinguished Chief Guest.
Number One got out of the vehicle and walked on and soon the Big Two were exchanging greetings.
However, Mariks remained quietly inside the car until the duo stepped inside the building, they say.

Iran nuclear deal: Trump pulls US out in break with Europe allies
	
US President Donald Trump says he will withdraw the US from an Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran.
Calling it "decaying and rotten", he said the deal was "an embarrassment" to him "as a citizen".
Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.
In response, Iran said it was preparing to restart uranium enrichment, key for making both nuclear energy and weapons.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said: "The US has announced that it doesn't respect its commitments.
"I have ordered the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran to be ready for action if needed, so that if necessary we can resume our enrichment on an industrial level without any limitations."
He said he would "wait a few weeks" to speak to allies and the other signatories to the nuclear deal first.
"If we achieve the deal's goals in cooperation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place," he said.
The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions that had been imposed by the UN, US and EU.
Mr Trump had previously complained that the deal only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period; had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles; and had handed Iran a $100bn (74bn) windfall that it used "as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression" across the Middle East.
"It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal," Mr Trump said.
"The Iran deal is defective to its core."
Former President Barack Obama, who signed the deal on behalf of the US three years ago, called Mr Trump's announcement "misguided".
he US Treasury said economic sanctions would not be reimposed on Iran immediately, but would be subject to 90-day and 180-day wind-down periods.
In a statement on its website, it said sanctions would be reimposed on the industries mentioned in the 2015 deal, including Iran's oil sector, aircraft exports, precious metals trade, and Iranian government attempts to buy US dollar banknotes. (BBC)

Kim Jong-un meets Chinese President Xi Jinping
	

REUTERS, 08th MAY, 2018- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited China this week and met President Xi Jinping, the state media of both countries said on Tuesday, their second encounter in two months amid warming ties between the Cold War allies.
Their talks in the northeastern coastal city of Dalian comes as tension on the Korean peninsula over North Koreas development of nuclear weapons eases ahead of what would be a historic meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, as soon as this month, according to the White House.
China has been keen to show it has an indispensable role to play in seeking a lasting solution to tension over North Korea, concerned that its interests may be ignored, especially as North Korea and the United States establish contacts. Kim, during his visit on Monday and Tuesday, told Xi he hoped relevant parties would take phased and synchronized measures to realize denuclearisation and lasting peace on theKorean peninsula.
So long as relevant parties eliminate hostile policies and security threats toward North Korea, North Korea has no need for nuclear (capacity), and denuclearisation can be realized, Chinas official Xinhua news agency cited Kim as saying.

New Battle to win hearts and minds of people
	
After the prorogation of parliament on April 12, a new session was ceremonially inaugurated yesterday with a confident President Maithripala Sirisena making a policy statement in which he outlined the important achievements of the coalition government and the key aspects of the plans for the next 18 months before his term ends in November next year. 
In the wake of the August 2015 parliamentary elections, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) decided to form a consensus government. It was the first time since Independence in 1948 that the two major parties agreed to work together and the disputes or divisions that arose were not unexpected.
The rule of law and the independence of the judiciary were restored while the 19th Amendment strengthened democracy to a large extent. We also saw important achievements such as the landmark Right to Information Act (RTI) and major progressive steps in the important fields of public health services and education. But the SLFP was split down the middle with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa going all out to get back to power. This led to a crisis culminating in its devastating defeat at the local council elections on February 10 this year. Since then, the coalition government has faced conflict after conflict with parliamentarians going here, there and some of them nowhere. 
It was in such a backdrop that President Sirisena made his policy statement yesterday and expressed confidence that the coalition government in the coming 18 months could win back the hearts and minds of the people. He said in the coming months, the socio-economic policies would be people-friendly and bring practical economic benefits to the people. 
The President, as he has often said, stressed again that the highest priority would be given to poverty alleviation. Without this structural adjustment where the gap between the rich and the poor is significantly reduced, the hearts and minds of the people cannot be won. That was the clear message from the local council elections. Almost all over the world, we see a monstrosity where one per cent of the rich and ruling elite own more wealth and resources than 50% ofthe people. 
As a major part of the poverty alleviation programme, the President said, the coalition would give priority to the generation of new and productive job opportunities, especially for the youth. Economic analysts have said that instead of just doling out money through schemes like Samurdhi, the provision of well-paid jobs would help restore the human dignity of poverty-stricken families. This in turn would go a long way in building a just, peaceful andall-inclusive society. 
President Sirisena is still very much aware that it was the minority votes that led him to victory at the presidential election on January 8, 2015. In the policy statement yesterday, the President said steps were being taken to give the Tamil people an equal place and equal rights while addressing their grievances. He assured that the government would also give equal rights to the Muslim people while taking effective steps to protect their socio-cultural values. The President, the Prime Minister and other coalition government leaders have stressed that by giving equal rights to the minorities, they hoped to strengthen the Sri Lankan identity of all people, so that all races and religions could work together in a spirit of unity in diversity for the common good of all.
Up-country Tamil workers have for decades been oppressed and given a raw deal despite their hard work from morning till night. The President promised that steps would be taken to give them also an equal place in society. While doing this, the President assured the government would see to the welfare of the Sinhala Buddhist majority, protect and develop their cultural heritage. While empowering women, and making provision for those with special needs, the President said that an eco-friendly, all-inclusive and sustainable development policy wouldbe implemented. 
We hope that while working towards these goals, the government will ensure that all politicians  ranging from ministers and MPs to Provincial and Pradeshiya Sabha Members  will sincerely, sacrificially and selflessly serve the people, instead of getting involved in large-scale bribery, corruption, frauds and other political crimes as we have often seen up to now. Only then will we see a new Sri Lanka.

NY Attorney General resigns over abuse charges: SL woman among four accusers
	
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has resigned after four women came forward accusing him of physical abuse, threats and other misconduct. 
In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me, Schneiderman said in a statement on Monday night. 
The accusers, two of them speaking on the record, told the New Yorker in an article published hours earlier that Schneiderman had hit or slapped them without consent, often in bed, and frequently after drinking. Two of Schneidermans former romantic partners, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, came forward to share their allegations against him, which they classify as assault. 
Selvaratnam, who is from Sri Lanka, claims that Scheiderman called her his brown slave and demanded that she call him Master, slapping her until she complied. 
She said that he also choked her, cutting off my ability to breathe, and added it was a fairy tale that became a nightmare.
The slaps started after wed gotten to know each other, she recalled. It was at first as if he were testing me. Then it got stronger and harder... It wasnt consensual. 
A third former romantic partner, who was not named, shared similar stories of bedroom violence. A fourth woman, an attorney in New York, said Schneiderman made unwanted advances and then slapped her when she rebuffed him. 
No one is above the law, including New Yorks top legal officer, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in a statement on Monday night calling on the attorney general to resign. 
My personal opinion is that, given the damning pattern of facts and corroboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as attorney general, and for the good of the office, he should resign, Cuomo said.

President should allow UNP to run Government   Shiral Lakthilake
	

Shiral Laktilake, the Coordinating Secretary of President Maithripala Sirisena, speaks about the current status of the government and why the concept of good governance failed. The excerpts:-
He should play the role of statesman
	It is not strange that the Rajapaksas are making a comeback
	It was broughtfor powerpoliticalgame of PM
	19 Amendment is creating a constitutional crisis
	Common candidate concept will not work
	It has to be undone somewhere
Q You played a role in promoting the concept called Good Governance ahead of the 2015 Presidential Elections. As far as the realization of this concept in the actual context, what do you feel now
That is very normal in any power context. When what you actually thought or conceptualized is transformed into action, there is a possibility of forming gaps. If you look at the pre-2015 period, there was a big demand for these concepts. There was a need for transparency, accountability and the rule of law. If you look at the elections in 1994, 2001, there was a specific need for every election. This time, there was a need created by society in this regard. That happened because of gaps and lacuna created by the then rulers before 2015. We formulated a policy platform as a result. 
Literally, people who had bowled and took wickets have not come to the field for batting (cricketing jargon). This is what happened eventually. The people who came into power have never absorbed the values of rule or law, transparency or accountability. 
Q Whom do you refer to in this instance
Even the latest incident (the arrest of Presidents Chief of Staff and the Timber Corporation Chairman) speaks of the sad situation in the country. The real people who were instrumental in toppling the previous government along the line of good governance didnt take over the power.
If you look at the way the Rajapaksa government operated, they had done something. We need not deny that. They won the war. They had brought certain development to the country. We should not negate that aspect
Q What are the other reasons for failure to realize the concept of good governance
I am not saying it is a total failure. We have failed partially.
Q You are part and parcel of the system. How can you say you were not included in power
I am to a certain degree, but, only a small cogwheel.
Q Why werent others included
That is because of power. Lets go to history! After Lasantha Wickramatunga was assassinated, I was with the UNP. I was instrumental in developing this Platform for Freedom. Unfortunately, the way the platform worked was detrimental to the attraction of large masses. They thought they could bank on Geneva proposals (UNHRC resolutions) to create pressure on the Mahinda Rajapaksa government. They never understood that they were alienating the Sinhala nationalist sentiments by doing so. We should never forget that although we are espousing liberal agendas, this country, as a whole, has a certain set of values. These values are sometimes liberal, Marxist, social-democratic and so on. But, all these values are based on some nationalistic feelings. Then only we realized the Platform for Freedom should attract all across the board.
We have studied extensively the Hong Kong law and the Singaporean law. We prepared a proposal and gave it to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to put forward as a Cabinet proposal. We do not know what had happened to it. The Cabinet has not followed it up 

Hence we created the National Movement for Social Justice, under the patronage of late Ven. Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera. We put forward ten points: Abolition of executive presidency, change of electoral laws and abolition of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution to set up independent commissions among others. There were certain concerted efforts to undermine that. Some people wrote saying that we were trying to create a Buddhist Kumani. We knew that the step was correct politically. Although it is a small platform, it has been able to attract a large segment of society. The UNP had not been able to put pressure on the then government for consecutive years. Numerically, the UNP had 40-45% of supporter base. But, they lacked that 5%. Ven. Sobhitha Theras movement was able to attract that 5% under the new concept of common candidate. 
Q Some people call the regime change as a victory. Do you genuinely see it as a victory
In any country, it is an evolution. From time to time, you put forward certain policies. If you look at the way the Rajapaksa government operated, they had done something. We need not deny that. They won the war. They had brought certain development to the country. We should not negate that aspect. They brought infrastructure into the country. They built roads all over the country. Whether the expenditure made on them is proportionate or not is a different matter. They brought infrastructure needed for the development of the country. That is true. But, there was a need for democratization and humanization of society, and respect for the rule of law. All these were the logical next step. That need was understood. It is a victory as a result. 
Q Do you think our society has been democratized now
We won. But, when it came to implementation, there started hiccups in terms of development, democracy and structural development of the country. 
For example, we said expenditure on highways was exorbitant. We criticized the Matara-Hambantota stretch of the southern expressway under the Rajapaksa regime. It was Rs.250 billion. Once we came to power, a committee of experts was appointed to look into this. That committee evaluated data and said the road could have been built with Rs.125 billion covering all the aspects - local and international. You know what happened. Our government awarded the contract to the same amount of Rs.250 billion, ignoring the experts report. It is a good example of how we have deviated from the values we espoused. 
I need not explain the Central Bank issue. Everybody knows it. We have created precedence for those who are in power that you can make money. We never imposed any kind of credible laws to prevent it.
We were instrumental in developing a legal framework for dealing with corruption. We have studied extensively the Hong Kong law and the Singaporean law. We prepared a proposal and gave it to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to put forward as a Cabinet proposal. We do not know what had happened to it. The Cabinet has not followed it up. 
We established the National Procurement Commission. In order to develop it, we need the National Audit Act. So far we are not in a position to pass that in Parliament. We have not been able to establish proper infrastructure. I am not bothered whether the thieves had been caught or not. Those are short term affairs. By doing so, you bring only the deterrent aspect. Laying the foundation for long term stability is the most important factor. 
Q In 2015, you adopted the formula for bringing all the political forces together to unseat the Rajapaksa regime. How applicable will this formula be at the next election
I do not think so. Now, the common candidate concept will not work. Now, the people think the government is deteriorating. People will ask for a stronger candidate who will be well supported by the parties. 
With the 19th Amendment, we see a lot of crises. After 2020, it would aggravate. This Amendment was aimed at empowering the Premier; nobody else. As a result, we see the constitutional crisis evolving. It would reach its apex in 2020
Q Will the parties that were together come under one umbrella once again
I dont think so. Numerically one would say they (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) got only 40% at the last election on February 10, whereas we all had got 60%. Practically, it is there. It is not possible to bring them all on one platform in 2020. It would be a competition between two parties as a result. 
Q You are an official who is familiar with the establishment. How did this conflict between the President and the Prime Minister evolve
My frank opinion is the 19th Amendment. Today, constitution-making process takes place within a small circle. People never participated in it. As a result, the Amendment to the Constitution was drafted in order to satisfy the Prime Ministers power political needs. With the 19th Amendment, we see a lot of crises. After 2020, it would aggravate. This Amendment was aimed at empowering the Premier; nobody else. As a result, we see the constitutional crisis evolving. It would reach its apex in 2020.
Q You mean to say that the 19th Amendment would boomerang one day
Definitely. 
Q Would you think it should be undone
Somewhere, somebody has to undo it. 
Q How hopeful are you of the JVPs initiative to bring the 20th Amendment to abolish the executive presidency
It is interesting. Whether the 20th Amendment is good or bad, it does not happen on the principles of constitutional law. It happens on power politics. If you look at the seminar conducted by the Buddhist monks and the press conference called by Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara recently, they are now creating a public opinion that we should not allow anyone to abolish the executive presidency. It is handled by Gotabhaya Rajapaksas politics. He thinks the 20th Amendment is brought to prevent him from becoming the President. He is releasing the forces to agitate against the forces. 
Q Who will be successful
I think Gotabhaya will be successful. These monks are creating a moral high ground. 
My only worry with the Rajapaksa administration is that they had committed policy blunders. They are coming to power now without a self-criticism. Our society is also going to accept them without a self-criticism
Q This government was a failure during the last three years as some people say. There is a Cabinet reshuffle now. Do you think the journey during the next one and-a-half years would be successful
After the February 10 election, I named it as crisis without a crisis. Seemingly, it looks calm. But, there is a crisis. Whenever you try to rectify it, you create another crisis. All the decisions taken since February 10 had failed. We said there would be a Cabinet formed on a scientific basis. It has boomeranged now. The coalition government is not going to work. I stress that our President should allow Ranil Wickremesinghe to govern the country with one party. All the SLFPers who want to stay should be allowed to join the UNP. The President should be neutral. He should play the role of statesman. 
Q What do you think of the residency of SLPP or the Rajapaksa-led political camp
It is not a strange affair. If you analyze the world context, the French Revolution happened in the 17th century. After ten years, the same people asked for a dictator. As a result, Napoleon Bonaparte came into power. The same happened in Russia. In Sri Lanka too, it is not bewildering to say that there is a demand. But, the demand is not sufficient to change the government. They have to go a long way. My only worry with the Rajapaksa administration is that they had committed policy blunders. They are coming to power now without a self-criticism. Our society is also going to accept them without a self-criticism.

Journalist: What is your stance on the Presidents appointment of Anuruddha Polgampola as the new Chairman of State Timber Corporation who had been arrested over two major financial frauds earlier
Minister: Anuruddha Polgampola was the one who went to Bribery Commission to lodge a complaint against me.
Journalist: Is this your Good Governance to give him such a post merely because he was so active during the Local Government elections and supporting the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Minister: Normally, such helpful persons are the ones who are appointed to such posts.
Journalist: Your government is boasting that the portfolios are given according to scientific basis. Has any scientific basis been used to this appointment.
Minister: Even those who were appointed under the scientific basis have been caught and arrested.
Meanwhile, Minister Thalatha Atukorale who also participated in the news briefing was seen gesturing to the journalist who asked the questions stating that it is getting late. Parakku Wenawa.( Sheain Fernandopulle)

Purohita Mangie had wanted to make a certain request to Number One ever since taking over the Finance portfolio and he was patiently biding his time. And the opportunity had come in his way quite recently and he had told Number One that he, as the person handling Finance wished to deal with the closely allied subject of Banks as well.

Now that the main bank which had been a charge of Number Two had already been brought under the Finance portfolio, Number One may have had considered that it was nothing but logical to bring the other banks too under the purview of Finance purohita, they say.
So, a gazette notification bringing the entire banking sector under the Finance is expected to be issued shortly.

SL women obesity rate exceeds 45%: UNICEF
	
Over 45 per cent of women in Sri Lanka are overweight or obese indicating a serious double burden of malnutrition within the adult population, the UNICEF today said.
Following a three-day regional conference on actions to accelerate improvements in womens nutrition across South Asia held in Kathmandu the SAARC and UNICEF, it said many adolescents and women had also faced serious obstacles in meeting their right to health and nutrition.
UNICEF Director in South Asia Jean Gough said gaps in national policies, programmes and care services during pregnancy, combined with poverty and customary practices mean that women had failed to receive the nutritional care they need for a healthy pregnancy.
Essential nutrition services, including dietary counselling and iron-folic acid supplements,are reaching too few women during pregnancy. Underlying causes include the under-investment in maternal health services,the low prioritization of nutrition services,and the low reach of care for pregnant women, the UNICEF said.
Pregnant and breastfeeding women need better nutrition to protect children from stunting and disease. The progress on improving nutritional care of women in South Asia during and after pregnancy is slow, impacting on their childrens survival, growth and development, he said.
It said over one-third of the worlds anaemic women live in South Asia, and no country was on track to meet the global nutrition target to reduce anaemia by 50 per cent women by 2025. In Sri Lanka, nearly 32 per cent of pregnant women are anaemic.
Children who are born small due to poor maternal nutrition start life at a huge disadvantage. They are more likely to become wasted or stunted in early life, do less well at school, earn lower wages in adulthood and suffer diabetes and chronic heart diseases later in life, it said.
SAARC Secretary General saidAmjad Hussain Sial said women's nutrition required special attention and the governments should look at how they could provide healthy diet and lifestyle options. 
We must strive towards a collective effort that involves health providers, community based workers, families, schools and mothers themselves, he said.

The politico-turned-general despite the happy turn of fortune since yahapalanaya taking office had not been happy with his lot thereafter too. His complaint had always been that he had not been assigned a subject he was best suited for.

His disgust took a turn for the worse when he was denied the much-coveted law and order portfolio after giving him the hope of getting it at the reshuffle before the latest one. A person never used to hiding his feelings or keeping his tongue tied, the general in interviews with media later slammed Number One for cheating him.On the eve of the latest reshuffle, the general had approached Number Two and had told him, Sir, please assign the law and order subject to me at least at this reshuffle!
After mulling over the request for a minute or two, Number Two had replied: Now look! Not even two months have passed since this subject being given to that chap. Isnt it too early to change it Please waitSo, the general had to go back empty-handed. However, he had the consolation of being given another subject at the swearing-in held the following day.

Top Tips for Best Returns on Apartment Investment
	
Over the last decade, Colombo City has been rapidly building upwards with the supply and demand of apartments being on the rise. The building boom that is underway in various parts of the city foretells a new era of a city living culture. As the cosmopolitan lifestyle trend develops in Colombo - with luxury shopping, diverse cuisine and plenty of entertainment  the lure to live in the city has never been more appealing. International attention has turned our way with billions in investments entering our shores, clearly indicative of an emerging market in trade and commerce. Those in the know of this potential investment opportunity in real estate can watch out for the following tips to enjoy the best returns from apartment investment.
Location: Two similar apartments can be priced very differently determined purely by location. A good place to start is to compare the land value of the identified projects. Then look out for the surrounding neighbourhood - schools, shopping and entertainment, should be in close proximity to a great home location. Weigh the pros and cons of a mixed-development vs. a purely residential one. Traffic and congestion are inescapable in any growing metropolis; therefore, choosing a locale that is commuter friendly, near major roads and public transportation, adds significant value to an investment property. Colombo is expecting a Light Rail System in the near future  proposed routes and stops could be analyzed to identify the most convenient access.
Developer and Contractor: Two pivotal players in your investment decision. Research the projects completed by both. Timely delivery is the most important factor to consider when planning for best returns; months and years in delays can be detrimental to your financial planning. Make sure you receive a construction schedule that is linked to the payment-plan, so you only pay on progress. Inquire after the reputation and experience of working with the developer and the construction company. Request to visit past project sites and look out for quality and finish of the build, as well as products and fixtures.
Design: The architecture, lighting (natural and artificial), common areas plan, landscaping, and layouts of the apartments, are all considerations for Design. Make certain all these aspects are professionally planned. Contemporary open-plan style is generally preferred by apartment dwellers for its easy maintenance. Heed cultural factors such as the local need for maids quarters and closed kitchens. High ceilings are a definite plus. Overall, look for neutral concepts that are unlikely to date too soon.
Amenities: Assess the amenities in a building in direct correlation to the needs of its potential tenants. A pool and gym are standard features in most modern developments and certainly add value. Keep in mind, more amenities mean higher maintenance fees. Be aware of these expenses and get an estimate of this monthly expense from the developer. Luxury developments will have a slew of amenities to offer  the trick is to figure out whats expected, whats needed and what isnt.
Returns: Whether you are buying to live or buying to rent-out, be aware of the market potential of your investment. Do your research by browsing online listings and acquiring professional real estate reports - your developer will often have this information at hand. Keep abreast of trending neighbourhoods and potential new markets. For example, The Port City expansion project is set to bring in an affluent international workforce, thereby, creating a new market for luxury apartments in the mainland. There is also a growing expatriate community moving back to Sri Lanka  the retirees are on the market for secure, luxury housing and the young entrepreneurs and professionals are looking for that pad in the city.
Financing: Shop around for loan options from several banks. You can find a loan that is tailor made to your finances. Ask your developer which banks are willing to hold tri-partite agreements with them. Banks delve into stringent detail to ensure the legal background of a project is airtight, therefore, it is a good indication of a sound investment if major banks deem the development viable.
The Small Print: Make sure the legal documents, including titular documents, are in compliance with regulations. Check the credentials of the legal firm working with your Developer and confirm they are reputed professionals. It is well advised to hire your own legal counsel to safeguard your best interest. Find out all expenses related to the purchasing process such as taxes, legal fees, stamp duty etc. Request a list of apartment specifications from the developer, leaving no room for uncertainty in what youre getting. Ensure Freehold against Leasehold rights on the property.
Residential property retains its value into the future depending on various factors that contribute to the livability of the location. When choosing to invest, look out for other similar grade residential projects in the area that will help maintain the neighbourhood, picturesque natural and curated public spaces such as lakes and parks, and accessibility to all conveniences, this will all ensure a high appreciation value of your chosen address. Colombo is, in preparation with Megapolis, to establish the needed infrastructure with expert city planning, to achieve the vision of a top livable city in South Asia.Will it all ever happen Theres the gamble. Apartments are on the rise and investing is risky business, but some ground work and research should help you find that peak investment.

## Title: UNP CRISIS, SLFP REBELLION, TNA THREAT
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 9 May 2018 12:17 am
UNP CRISIS, SLFP REBELLION, TNA THREAT
	
What happens when the protracted crisis of a political party which is in government, coincides with a dramatically mounting economic crisis The UNP is the countrys second oldest political party. Never in its 70 year history has it been away from the apex of power and the top post in the country for as long as it has been during this stretch: a quarter century. The other main contender for power, the SLFP has never been out of the top spot for that long. 
The UNP has had lean stretches before in its long history, but even in defeat it has been led by personalities who were popular. This is manifestly not the case today. During this entire period of almost a quarter century out of the top spot, the UNP has been led by one man. Today there is open dissent against his leadership; dissent that makes it to the TV news every single day. 
Earlier, when the UNP was in office, it had impressive marches on May Day, culminating in a huge rally on Galle Face Green. Todays UNP, devoid of the capacity to mobilize a march, penned itself into the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. The UNP has no powerful Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya to organize a May Day parade. 
Earlier, when the UNP was in office, it had impressive marches on May Day, culminating in a huge rally on Galle Face Green. Todays UNP, devoid of the capacity to mobilize a march, penned itself into the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium
What we are witnessing is the shrinking, cracking and crumbling of the UNP. It has been beaten into second place by the Pohottuwa. Though its strategists are counting on the abolition of the executive presidency, projections show that even at a parliamentary election the UNP would clock only 60 seats while the JO-Pohottuwa would clock 120 i.e. double that number. 
Ranjith Aluvihare, MP and descendant of a clan of UNP stalwarts in Matale, said on TV news that,
the UNP has a problem as to its presidential candidacy in 2019 It will lose the Provincial Council elections [It] has already lost its base in the villages. 
I have never seen the UNP in as bad a shape as it is now. If its leadership remains unchanged, the UNP will plunge to its lowest ever percentage at the next nationwide election. In short, 2019 will see the worst defeat in UNP history. 
The only silver lining for the UNP is Sajith Premadasas speech at Sugathadasa stadium and the uniquely tumultuous applause both he and it received. ITN cameras repeatedly cross-cut to the supercilious smirks and bemused exchanges among Ranil Wickremesinghe, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Navin Dissanaike, as Sajith made a blistering critique of neoliberal economics, exposed the horrendously unequal distribution of wealth, emotively invoked his father, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, and rolled out an electorally compelling, pro-peasant/pro-youth populist policy package. 
Sajith is the sole populist in the front ranks of a party dominated by an unpopular neoliberal globalist elite, at a time that populism is on the rise globally and neoliberal globalism is on the retreat. Way ahead in the UNP leadership stakes, he wont get there in time to salvage the party in 2019 despite his super-subtle signalling that he hasnt ruled out running as candidate (endorsed by hundreds of thousands at Galle Face Green). When the party crashes and burns in 2019, he will get the chance of leading it into the parliamentary battle of 2020. 
The SLFP is at its lowest ebb ever, in terms of electoral percentage. It is in a governing coalition, and yet its trade union wing just broke away and the party was unable to mobilize a parade for May Day. With the crossover of 16 SLFP MPs, most SLFP parliamentarians and voters are in the Opposition, with only the Chandrika-ist rump faction of 23 remaining in government, devoid of most of its popular vote. The SLFP numbers in the Opposition will increase, not decrease. 
The SLFP is better placed than the UNP. It has two options. It can regrow its base as an independent Opposition party albeit with links to President Sirisena, a dualism which may not quite work because the nexus with the incumbent may be counterproductive in the context of an anti-Establishment tsunami. But the SLFP retains the option of bandwagoning, i.e. transition to a broad anti-UNP coalition led by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his designated Presidential candidate. 
The only hope for rebellious UNP MPs is to imitate the Pohottuwa and the SLFP Sixteen, and sit in Opposition as an independent entity (as Dayasiri Jayasekara argued for in 2011). The UNP dissidents and the SLFP rebels could form a moderate Macronist centrist cluster in the Opposition. 
Chandrika, India and the Wests formula of a UNP-SLFP government is collapsing like a pricked balloon. The UNPs vote base has shrunk, as has the SLFPs, and the residual SLFP in government has a negligible vote base. 
What the last nail in the governments coffin will prove to be, has already been spotlighted by columnist DBS Jeyaraj in these pages. The TNA is due to launch a campaign of non-violent agitation calling for the implementation of the Governments alleged promise of a new Constitution. He writes that MA Sumanthiran and Jayampathy Wickremaratne have a draft which can be fast-tracked in two weeks, if the Government gives the green-light. If not, the ITAK will endorse at its convention this June, the slogan of a non-violent campaign of agitation. He discloses that such a campaign had been planned and thousands of Gandhi caps stitched for use in late 2014, but was halted by the victory of the Yahapalana regime change project. So the caps will be dusted off for use from mid-2018.
At a time when the government is on the decline, nothing is more certain to bury the UNP/ Yahapalanaya electorally than agitation for a new, non-unitary Constitution in the North. Nothing could be more conducive to generate a hardline majoritarian nationalist backlash which any Opposition candidate will feel tempted to surf! Nothing is more likely to trigger a military intervention in politics by civilianelectoral means!

It is probably the case that the planned Northern agitation is intended by foreign intelligence agencies as a preemptive strike, setting the stage for a Kosovo-Kurdistan type separatist project once the inevitable happens and the Rajapaksas return next year.

The government has alienated itself from nationalist, and even more basic national, sentiments. Those who recall the election of 1956 and 1970the Silent Revolutionswill remember the role of the Buddhist clergy in the election campaigns. Can anyone doubt that the Sangha will mobilize itself and plunge en masse into the campaign next year 
Meanwhile, in the penultimate year before decisive national elections, the government has just hiked the price of staples, milk powder and cooking gas, with signals that fuel prices and water bills will also increase. I have never seen a government quite so suicidal. James Carville famously coined the slogan of Bill Clintons campaign: Its the Economy, Stupid! In the case of this UNP governments coming demise, the appropriate slogans would be a variation: Its Not Only the Economy, Stupid! or Its Also the Economy, Stupid! 
As the massive May Day manifestation in Galle clearly showed, Mahindas JO-Pohottuwa is on the offensive and dominates the national political battle-space. The most important question in Sri Lankan politics is this: who will Mahinda Rajapaksas choice of Presidential candidate beGotabhaya, Basil or Chamal The UNP takes comfort in the factional rivalry that is latent, but thought the same when Mahinda split the SLFP and backed the Pohottuwa. The UNPs assumption collapsed with MRs Feb 10th triumph over both the UNP and the SLFP. The factional rivalry can be likened to the US presidential primaries and will die down once the choice is made. Even if Mahinda were to draw lots blindfolded to pick the candidate from among his able brothers, whoever that random choice is will probably win next years election.

Vista Rooms continues strong growth in Sri Lanka by expanding its network in the East
	
Vista Rooms, South Asias largest chain of affordable stays, is expanding its operations in the East coast of Sri Lanka following a wave of success in the Western, Central and Southern regions of the country. With a current inventory of 50 rooms in the East, the hospitality startup is expected to grow to over 200 rooms before the end of the year.
The expansion will solidify Vista Rooms presence in Sri Lanka after having entered the market in 2016. This latest move comes on the back of Sri Lankas continued growth inpopularity as a holiday destination among international travellers. In 2017 Sri Lanka reached an all-time high of 2,116,407 tourist arrivals. That stellar trend continued into the new year with double digit year-on-year growth.
Commenting on this new focus Amit Damani, Co-Founder of Vista Rooms, said, Traditionally there has been a strong focus on tourism in the West and South of the country. However, as Sri Lanka continues to invest in the tourism industry and reach towards its vision of being identified as a place for memorable, authentic and diverse experiences, we believe the East will see greater growth in tourist numbers. This will likely be bolstered by further investment in infrastructure that makes the East more easily accessible.
In less than two years we have become operationally profitable and in the past year alone we have grown 10 fold. We see a bright and prosperous future for tourism in Sri Lanka and our investments in the East coast will help secure Vista Rooms place in that future, he added.
Vista Rooms goes beyond increasing monthly revenues for their partners, by taking care of the entire guest lifecycle and improving day-to-day operations. Regular audits of each property guarantees a standardised experience for all guests  their average review score of over 7/10 on Booking.com is a testament of this focus on excellent guest experience. With access to the Vista Rooms preferred vendors, their partners source their supplies at lower rates and thereby, reduce their maintenance costs considerably.
Recently, Vista Rooms, identifying a surge in popularity in the informal sector, began providing complete turnkey solutions for the private stays segment. They offer end to end support to villa and apartment owners  right from tech, to sales, to regulatory and operational support.Having already tied up with over 50 apartments and villas across the island the company has begun providing an off the beaten path experience to tourists.
Since entering the Sri Lankan market Vista Rooms has been successful in quickly capturing market share and building the largest network of branded stays in the country with over 350 properties across 30 cities. The same swift growth can be expected from the brand going forward, as they begin catering to a large, untapped demand segment.

Was he in a coma
	

Green partys businessman-politico from Digamadulla was among the top team members sworn in, the other day.

However, he was in for a big disappointment when he did not get the portfolio he expected, they say.
When his name was called, he came forward and signed the appointment letter after being duly sworn in. However, to everyones surprise, he walked away without receiving the appointment letter from Number One.
An obviously disconcerted Number Two had to call the newly sworn in purohita by his name several times before the latter turned back to receive the letter of appointment.
Most of those present at the event shared the view that the disappointment that the Digamadulla one suffered was so severe that it may have sent him into a coma,they say.

World awaits decision on nuclear deal
	

DPA, 08th MAY, 2018
The world will soon find out whether Trumps rants about the 2015 deal will produce a concrete shift in US diplomacy, regarding one of the most important foreign policy issues of his presidency.
Trump officially has until Saturday to decide whether to reintroduce US sanctions on Iran, which among other things could spell an end to the accord. But he has said he will announce his decision at 2 pm (1800 GMT) on Tuesday.
In January, Trump renewed waivers for US sanctions on Iran, but warned that it was the last time he would do so unless several disastrous flaws in the agreement were addressed. His ultimatum triggered a 120-day period that ends this weekend.
There is a growing consensus in the United States that his decision will effectively pull the US out of the deal, and that prospect has been accompanied by a range of speculation over what comes next.
French President Emmanuel Macron said he didnt know what Trump would decide, but after several meetings with the president over a three-day state visit recently he said: My view ... is that he will get rid of this deal on his own for domestic reasons.
The president campaigned on getting out of the deal and I think that hes going to do so, Lieutenant General William G Boykin said on Thursday on Fox News. Iranian leaders already have pledged to abandon the deal if the US withdraws. But it could remain in the deal with Britain, France and Germany, along with China and Russia, which have expressed their continued support.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned meanwhile that if Trump withdraws, it could risk war.
