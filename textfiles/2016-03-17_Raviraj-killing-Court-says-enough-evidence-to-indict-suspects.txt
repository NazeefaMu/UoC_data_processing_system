Considering the evidence and affidavits submitted by the prosecution during the non-summary proceeding in connection with the killing of former parliamentarian Nadarajah Raviraj and his driver in 2006, Colombo Additional Magistrate Thilina Gamage said today there was sufficient evidence to indict the seven suspects in the high court.

Submitting the affidavits and the postmortem examination reports on the killing, senior state counsel Dilan Ratnayake, who appeared for the Attorney-General, told the court that the prosecution would conclude its submissions today. The Magistrate ordered the suspects to be finger-printed and directed that the case file be forwarded to the high court.

Suspects Prasad Hettiarachchi, Gamini Seneviratne and Chaminda are in remand custody while suspect Sampath Munasinghe is on bail.

However, the other suspects Palanaswami Suresh, Vivekanandan and Fabian have still not been arrested and the non-summary proceeding was conducted in their absence.

The suspects in remand were further remanded till March 31.

The suspects were charge-sheeted by the Attorney-General on four counts that of being members of an unlawful assembly, conspiring to kill Nadarajah Raviraj and his driver. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
