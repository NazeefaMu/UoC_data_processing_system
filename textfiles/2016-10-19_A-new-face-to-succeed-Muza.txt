A new face to politics is due to succeed Muza as the Green party candidate for the main chair of the city council.

 


The Green candidate tipped to run for the main chair of the city council is a close kinsman of late President Jayewardene, they say.


There was speculation some time ago that this J.R.’s kinsman was offered the main chair of the state-owned gas company. 


The name ‘Eranda’ of youth council fame mentioned in connection with the main chair of the city council has now been replaced by the name ‘Niroshan’, Sirikotha sources say.
