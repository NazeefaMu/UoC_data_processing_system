British Prime Minister David Cameron has expressed hope that this Sinhala-Tamil New Year will bring communities closer together in helping to heal the wounds of the past in Sri Lanka.
“I’m sure many people celebrating today will be thinking of loved ones overseas, especially in Sri Lanka. When I met with President Sirisena in Downing Street last month I offered my support for the steps his government has begun to take to address the issues of the past. But I was also clear that the Government must go further and that they must continue to offer full support to the ongoing UN investigation,” Mr. Caneron said in a Sinhaa-Tamil New Year massage.
PM Cameron said:
“I would like to send my best wishes to everyone in Britain, Sri Lanka and around the world celebrating Aluth Avurudda and to all Tamil communities celebrating Puthandu today. It’s a time when millions of people will be coming together with families, friends and neighbours to celebrate their New Year.
“But it is also a time to remember the fantastic contribution Tamil and Sinhalese communities make to Britain. We see it around us, every single day – in our schools and our hospitals, in the arts and businesses – you play an incredibly important and positive role.
“I’m sure many people celebrating today will be thinking of loved ones overseas, especially in Sri Lanka.

“I hope that this New Year will bring communities closer together in helping to heal the wounds of the past.
“To everyone celebrating Puthandu and Aluth Avurudda I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.”
