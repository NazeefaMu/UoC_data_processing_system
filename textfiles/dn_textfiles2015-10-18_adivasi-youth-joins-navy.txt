Adivasi youth joins Navy

The Sri Lanka Navy created history by recruiting an Aadhivasi youth into its 223rd intake. The passing out parade of the intake of 366 recruits was held under the patronage of Southern Naval Commander Rear Admiral J.J. Ranasinghe at Sri Lanka Navy Ships Nipuna in Galle on Saturday.
Among the large crowd present at the passing out ceremony was the great grandfather of Naval recruit H.M. Prasanka Pradeep Jayawardana, the Aadhivasi youth. Unaapaana Varige Heenbandiyala aththo of Dambana, Mahiyanagana had come from Badulla to watch the skills and talents of his great grandson.
Jayawardana's father, H.M. Jayawardana, 54, is a farmer and his mother J.M.Priyanaka Kumari ,44, is a house wife. Heenbaddiyaala eththo is Jayawardana's parents' grandfather.
“We are from Dambana, Mahiyangana. We have three children. Our eldest son is employed as a security officer. Prasanka Pradeep who joined the Navy is our second child.
Our youngest daughter is studying for her A/L examination. Since his childhood, our second child wanted to join the Navy. He passed G.C.E.O/L at Orubendiwewa Maha Vidyalaya. I think he is the first to join the Navy from our region,” Kumari told the Daily News.
Adivasi Heenbanddiyala aththo said he was happy and proud as his great grandson has brought prestige to their tribe by becoming the first to join the Navy from their community.
