Two brothers contesting from the two main political parties for the same ward at the upcoming local government polls have become a source of much amusement to their voters, they say.

 


The two brothers, activists of the same political party for a long time had parted their political ways with one brother joining the main rival party on the eve of nominations. 


Voters taken by surprise by one brother’s unexpected move to quit his party to contest his own brother are confused over whom they should support while the two brothers are at a loss to tell who their supporters or opponents are. “This is a funny situation. Both brothers have become laughing stock,” one voter remarked.
