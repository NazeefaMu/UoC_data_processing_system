Ranjan appreciates JO's complaints against 'Top Ten'


	

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today he appreciated the Joint Opposition's move to lodge complaints with the Bribery Commission (BC) against the government politicians what they termed as "Top Ten" because it was easy to identify real thieves when the thieves attacked one another.

Speaking at the debate to revise the limits of Bribery Raids Advance Account of the Bribery Commission, Mr. Ramanayake said it was not important who lodged the complaint but what was important was to recover the money stolen.

"We must thank MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage for making complaints at the BC against government MPs. It was not important who makes the complaint. What is important is to give the stolen money back to the people. These are not media shows. These things should happen," he said.

He said the former Bribery Commission Director General Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe, who was working efficiently, had to leave her post due to the dubious allegations against her.

"Thieves won and Ms. Wickramasinghe was defeated. Today those who accused her are also going to the BC," he said.

He said the remuneration and perks of the MPs should be reduced and increases the salaries and allowances of BC, FCID and CID officials and added that these institutions should be strengthened.

He said some politicians of the previous government had evaded the BC' s investigations citing ludicrous reasons during the previous regime.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
