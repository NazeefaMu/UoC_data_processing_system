Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake today threatened to resign from his ministerial portfolio if the Finance Ministry tried to take a sum of US 60 million dollars belonging to the Sri Lanka Tea Board, which falls under his Ministry.

Addressing a ceremony in Elpitiya, Mr. Dissanayake said it was reported that the Finance Ministry intended to take the funds from the Tea Board. “I can’t give Tea Board funds. If they were to take it, I will resign as I can’t continue to function as the Minister,” he said.



He said the funds were collected through the CESS Tax and it therefore belonged to the Tea Board. “The funds do not belong to the government. It will be used for the promotion campaign of the Tea Board which will protect the Ceylon brand in tea” he said.

Minister Dissanayake asked State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa who was also at the event to enlighten the President over his remarks stating that it would be an injustice if the funds were taken away from the Board.

“No one had ever tried to take away funds of the tea board before. I’m not certain as to why they are trying to take funds now. These moves are not in line with yahapalana principles. If the Government is going against the principles of Yahapalanaya, we can’t endorse it. We are working without making a fuss but if there is injustice I will quit this post”.
