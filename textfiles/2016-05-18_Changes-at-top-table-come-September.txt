Speculation about a reshuffle of the team at the top table has been rife for some time. First it was rumoured that the event would come soon after the May Day.  The latest talk in the town is that the red letter day is to dawn for certain in September. 

 


The day in September has now been fixed on the advise of an astrologer who is, by the way, holding an important office in yahapalanaya, they say. He had warned that making any change in the current team before the date and the time he had ordained, would portend ill for the government. So those eagerly waiting to become the new faces at the top table have to bide their time till September.


A doctor from Kotte, a Yapa from Matara and another from the West are expected to be included in the reshuffled team, they say.
