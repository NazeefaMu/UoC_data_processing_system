Foursome braced to cross the great divide


	


The latest story churned out by the political rumour mill says that four opposition Diyawanna members are set to cross over to the Green party.
Three of the foursome are going to be ‘double-crossers’ who once quit the green party vowing to strengthen the hands of the former strongman. One of them is from a family in Uva with original green roots. The second one is a young buck from the South. The third one from the hills failed in his first bid under yahapalanaya to cross the divide as the feelers he sent out drew no positive response. 
The fourth crossover-to-be is a member from Sabaragamuwa. However, his name is a closely guarded secret, they say.
