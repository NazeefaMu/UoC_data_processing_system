A truth meant only for the caller’s ear


	



 

There were varying estimates of the turnout for the recent JO-sponsored Paadayathra and the new Big Boss had wanted to know the most accurate figure for his own edification.

 


  As there were wide discrepancies between the figures given by state intelligence sources and certain private sources close to him, he decided to obtain the most realistic figure from the horse’s mouth itself. 


So the new Big Boss contacted a JO stalwart – a former purohita with a big mouth -- who shed much sweat to make the event a great success.   He made his query right away. “Tell me the truth. What is your estimate of the number that participated in your Paadayathra?”  


The JO stalwart from the upcountry who was taken aback by the unexpected question took a few seconds to collect his scattered wits before giving an answer. 


Presently, he had looked around to make sure there was none within the earshot; re-assured, he had whispered his reply into the mouthpiece of the telephone, they say.
