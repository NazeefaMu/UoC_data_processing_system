The Joint Opposition yesterday said Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry was in an attempt to proceed with the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) during the discussions that were scheduled to be held today with the related parties.

JO member MP Kanaka Herath told a news conference that Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and the Ministry’s Secretary was trying to sign the ETCA which was detrimental to the country.

“The Ministry has signed the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in the same manner concealing its true nature to the country as the ETCA. The discussions scheduled for today will prove fatal to the country,” he said.

He said as per the experts' views, Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA had enabled the import of waste materials released by other countries to Sri Lanka and added that the country would face many issues if such predictions would turn to be real; “We already have garbage disposal issues in Sri Lanka, especially in Colombo,” he added.

He said the entire service sector and occupations of Sri Lanka would be at a risk if the government would proceed with the trade agreements such as ETCA and Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA.

Meanwhile, another JO member MP Kanchana Wijesekera said the Independent Experts Committee on Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA to conduct a special study was a mere eye-wash.

“We have made an official request to the said committee in order to express our views on this FTA. The committee has not made any response so far,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
