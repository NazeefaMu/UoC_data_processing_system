A Farewell to Arms - By Ernest Hemingway A modern soldiers autobiography
	
Love, war and intolerable twentieth-century images
In todays world, the experience of being a soldier on the frontline is accessible at our fingertips. From wartime photographs to televised interviews with veterans on leading broadcast channels, from feature-length films to virtual experience video games; the trials and tribulations of being embroiled in a bloody and devastating war have never appeared more conceivable, relatable and believable.

It is important due to its in-depth complex characterizations of soldiers on the frontline
	Still holds sentimental value to readers of today
However, in 1929, upon the publication of American author Ernest Hemingways second novel A Farewell to Arms, to the Post-WW1 American public, military life in foreign lands was a private and mysterious matter, hinted at, only in radio broadcast and propaganda posters.
A Farewell to Arms tells the tale of Frederic Henry, a young American Paramedic in the Italian military during World War I, whose political confrontations on the frontline intersect with a more personal and private romance involving the protagonists affair with a beautiful English nurse.
A Farewell to Arms was such an influential and important literary contribution of its era due to its gritty and graphic depictions of warfare
Through its iconic and graphic depictions of warfare, Hemingways A Farewell to Arms effectively pioneered the modern soldiers autobiography.
A Farewell to Arms was such an influential and important literary contribution of its era due to its gritty and graphic depictions of warfare, which were utterly alien to early twentieth century readers.
Authors preceding Hemingway wrote their novels in a quaint, decorative Edwardian Style which eschewed reality in favour of beautiful descriptions.
In contrast, A Farewell to Arms introduced readers across the world to an innovative, modernist, style of writing that focused wholly on a characters thoughts, feelings
and sensation.
This is highlighted by Hemingways comprehensive depictions of the episodes of mundanity - such as briefing, preparation and planning - which are overshadowed by key historical events of warfare.
For example, Frederic Henrys daily drives transporting wounded soldiers across a series of military camps are enhanced via Hemingways portrayal of his various thoughts and impressions, which accompany him as he travels. As a result of this, A Farewell to Arms forges complex characters that bring an invaluable dimension of humanity to war, which is often reduced to mere facts, figures and statistics.
Additionally, the importance of A Farewell to Arms as a literary work can be conceived via French philosopher Jacques Rancieres concept of intolerable images.
Ranciere argued that illustrations of unsettling and unnerving moments in literature were essentially intolerable in the sense that they provoked sentiments of indignation and discomfort in an audience.
Ranciere argued that illustrations of unsettling and unnerving moments in literature were essentially intolerable in the sense that they provoked sentiments of indignation and discomfort in an audience.
Furthermore, Rancieres theory asks the question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to exhibit disagreeable images as art.
A Farewell to Arms can be used to answer this conundrum via representations of violence which, while monstrous and despicable, illuminate the emotional landscape of war.
Essentially, the moments of gruesome violence between enemy forces in the novel parallel peaceful moments of love and friendship, which encompass an intricate psychological portrait of human warfare.
Overall, Ernest Hemingways 1929 novel A Farewell to Arms is an important novel to read due to its in-depth and complex characterizations of soldiers on the frontline in World War I, which, while shocking and original in the era of its publication, still holds sentimental value to readers of today.

Cabinet mulls RMB and Yen bonds
	
The Cabinet is reported to have decided to explore the possibility of issuing International Sovereign Bonds in Renminbi (RMB) and Japanese Yen instead of depending solely on the US dollar for the purpose of raising funds.
Sri Lanka currently issues such bonds only in US currency. However, the Cabinet decided to issue bonds in Chinese and Japanese currencies as well.
The Cabinet appointed a five-member committee comprising officials from the Treasury and The Central Bank to explore various possibilities and work out modalities for this purpose.
China promotes RMB as a currency to be used in international trading and has also signed currency swap agreements with several countries. It is doing so to avoid the exchange cost of converting to the US dollars when trading with the respective countries. (Kelum Bandara)

Clinical assault of surgeon questions morality of undergrads
	
On the morning of August 3, Dr. Yohan Koralage stopped his vehicle on the side of Galaha Road to answer a phone call from a fellow medical officer
Dr. Koralage says he lost his consciousness a few times during the merciless assault
	Although Dr. Koralage is recovering miraculously from this near-death experience, he is suffering from a neurological deficit in his right arm
	Who is responsible for all the patients whose lives are endangered by the absence of such a highly skilled surgeon likeDr. Koralage
He was to discuss the treatment process for one of his patients and expected the phone call to last at least 30 minutes. No matter the circumstances, patients were always a priority for Dr. Koralage. Little did he imagine that circumstances would be this grim, for making the simple mistake of parking his vehicle on the wrong side of town. 
A few minutes after parking his vehicle the doctor was approached by a couple of young men who informed him - albeit offensively -that he could not park his vehicle within the university premises. Dr. Koralage politely explained that he was a doctor attached to the Anuradhapura Hospital and he would need a few minutes to attend to his patients needs. The young men after threatening Dr. Koralage walked away, only to return with a few other friends, who suddenly attacked the doctor. 
Out of the blue, they started to attack me. I was forced to the ground and beaten up, even after identifying myself. I didnt know that I couldnt park my vehicle there, laments Dr. Koralage. The doctor suffered serious injuries to his head, neck and arm as a result of the assault. He was admitted to the Kandy General Hospital and later transferred to the National Hospital, Colombo. On a slow path to recovery after the appalling incident, Dr. Koralage says he is still in disbelief of what transpired that morning. 
What shocks me the most is how they kept on pounding me. I told these men that I was a frequent visitor to the university. I told them that I was a doctor at the Anuradhapura Hospital and that I was simply attending to a patients need. I also told them that I intended to drive away after the call. Despite all this, they kept on thrashing me, deaf to my pleading, Dr. Koralage recalls. The specialist Neurosurgeon is no stranger to Peradeniya University. He was in fact visiting a plot of land in Hindagala, where he was building a house, when the incident occurred. 
Dr. Koralage says he lost his consciousness a few times during the merciless assault. They were patient until I regained consciousness only to beat me up again and again. I begged them to stop. Fortunately, security officers attached to the university came to the scene and stopped the assault, he recalls. However instead of assisting the severely injured victim, the security officers had removed the doctor from the university grounds. They chased me away from the university. I got into the vehicle, which they had also thrashed and damaged at that point. Somehow I drove towards the construction site, where the masons I have employed came to my help, recalls Dr. Koralage. 
Work in hospitals comes to a standstill
Operations of the Neurosurgical and Neuro-trauma units of the hospitals in North Central, Northern and Upper Eastern provinces came to a standstill following the brutal assault of the Neurosurgeon. Dr. Koralage oversaw the neurosurgery and neuro-trauma units in two key provinces while he was also in charge of neurosurgery in North Central Province. Moves are underway to appoint a professional to replace Dr. Koralage and assist his recovery, sources reveal. 
Dr. Himantha Atukorale, a colleague of Dr. Koralage, speaking to the says the absence of a skilled professional poses a great risk to patients of the area. A person with a simple fall or accident may suffer head injuries. There are also routine procedures for treating cancers and tumours. Dr. Koralage monitored a large amount of work and he should be physically present at these units to function smoothly. Without his guidance, no major surgeries are done in these hospitals, explains Dr. Atukorale. 
Who is responsible for all the patients whose lives are endangered by the absence of such a highly skilled surgeon like Dr. Koralage he questions. The injuries Dr. Koralage suffered as a result of this brutal assault, especially to the head, neck and arms, have disabled him to such a degree that performing an intense duty as a neurosurgeon would not be a possibility right now, opines Dr. Atukorale. Interestingly only 13 neurosurgeons are serving in Sri Lanka and Dr. Koralage is one. 
Dates for surgeries are allocated three or four months in advance. All routine surgeries have been postponed since the incident and all cases of head and spinal injuries are being transferred to hospitals in Colombo or Kandy, he adds. 
One of Sri Lankas rare Specialist neuro surgeons Dr. Yohan Koralage manhandled nearGalaha Road
Suspects arrested
Although Dr. Koralage is recovering miraculously from this near-death experience, he is suffering from a neurological deficit in his right arm. Severe numbness and the inability to do certain fine movements with his hand indicate that he wont be able to perform any surgeries for a considerable time. 
Whether the students of the University of Peradeniya allegedly involved in this incident intended to cause grievous harm or not, they are now facing serious charges of assault. Peradeniya Police HQI Chief Inspector M. Caldera said two suspects had been arrested on August 7 and were produced in court on August 16. 
Two suspects were arrested so far with the help of the university authorities. We have received information that 6 more suspects were involved in this incident. Their short names have been obtained and we are in the process of obtaining their personal details and addresses from the university. They will be arrested as soon as we receive the information from the Vice Chancellor, explained the law enforcement officer. 
Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya University Prof. Upul Dissanayake said that the university has offered assistance in identifying the perpetrators in this incident. As we have been informed, the surgeon was harassed and assaulted, while he was travelling across the university, by a group of students. Dr. Koralage himself has attempted to inform me of this incident, Prof. Dissanayake said. 
As of now we have only two parties as witnesses; the first being the victim and the two security officers attached to the university. Fortunately the doctor has managed to take several photographs from his mobile phone and accordingly two students were identified and arrested, the Vice Chancellor detailed. 
This is no less than an act of terrorism. As we have assisted in identifying the two students, we expect the Police and the courts to do the needful. As the two students and the security officers are unable to conceal evidence in a court of law, we expect they will co-operate in identify anyone else involved in this dreadful incident, he said. 
The Vice Chancellor affirmed that the said group of students was found occupying the university premises, whilst the university was closed due to student protests. Following the police inquiry the university will conduct an inquiry of its own to verify these details. We have offered our co-operation and hope that justice will be served in no time,the Vice Chancellor said. 
The sole neurosurgeon serving one-fifth of the country has been irrationally attacked leaving his illustrious career in uncertainty. Patients with complex and crucial medical needs are left without a choice. An all this has happened as a result of the exploits of a group of students allowed to run around executing their own whims and fancies, at the expense of anothers life. Reports of assault and harassment by university students are far too commonplace. How far is too far

Committee on SL-S'pore FTA: JO wants Prez to hold sittings
	
The joint opposition (JO) yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to immediately convene the committee of experts appointed to study the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA).
The President had in August appointed a committee of experts to study the SL-Singapore FTA and submit a report in two months.
MP Bandula Gunawardena told a news conference the five-member committee headed by Professor W.D. Lakshman had not met yet.
The committee has to submit the report in two months. However, neither has it met nor has it invited any relevant stakeholders to appear before it. The committee needs an office for its meetings, additional staff to record evidence and funds to carry out its mandate. Unless it is a method of hoodwinking the people; facilities should be provided for the committee to begin work, he said.
The MP said the JO was ready to give evidence or clarify matters related to the FTA, which
He did not even have an expiry date and therefore, its negative repercussions may last forever.
He claimed that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had neglected his duties when the FTA was tabled in Parliament.
We blame the Speaker for failing in his duties. Parliament and not a minister has the power to make financial decisions. Just because an FTA is signed, Customs duty on imported goods cannot be removed without Parliament's approval. However, a gazette has been issued secretly removing Customs duty on about 4,000 items imported from Singapore. The Speaker should clarify how this happened, the MP said.
He said the Speaker postponed the debate on the Central Bank Bond Commission report because of the unavailability of the Tamil translation but had allowed the debate on the SL-Singapore FTA to take place even when there was only the English version available.

## Title: Drastic decline in farm gate price of coconuts

Drastic decline in farm gate price of coconuts
	
However the prices at which they are sold to consumers have given rise to the need for the authorities to take immediate action
Commencing from around the third week of July the farm gate price of coconuts has dropped from a high of around Rs 45.00 to Rs 28.00 by August 15. The years 2016 and 2017 experienced a sharp increase in coconut prices owing to climate change conditions, caused due to the lack of monsoon seasonal rains. The coconut yield dropped by 40-50 % in the coconut triangle area and the nut weight reduced by 30-40%. The farm gate price peaked at Rs. 55/= and the retail nut price at Rs 100/=. However the coconut growers did not benefit by these high prices due to sub-standard sizes of nuts and poor crop yield.
The country needs around 240 million nuts per month for domestic consumption and industry use. Owing to the shortfall of nuts in 2017, coconut processing industrialist lobbied for the importation of frozen coconut kernel. With much reluctance from the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) and other stakeholders including the Coconut Growers Association, by mid June 2018, 1751 metric tons of coconut kernels were imported. What was imported was equivalent to 5.2 million nuts.
As per the documentation available regarding the imported consignment, the landed cost of kernel when converted to a whole nut works to around Rs 56/=. This excludes the value addition that accures when local nuts are used from the derived bi- products, husk, parings, shell and coconut water, the cost of frozen coconut kernel translated per nut was around Rs 56/=. Few industrialists ventured into these imports They have now suspended the import of kernel as it was not a viable solution. More importantly, the processed products exported could not be identified as Sri Lankan products
During the period 2016/ 2017, though the prices were increased, owing to the low nut weight and reduction of yields, the farmers did not obtain an enhanced income
Sustainable price
Its obvious that if an adequate coconut supply is to be maintained for domestic consumption and industrial production, a viable coconut growing sector has to exist for which a sustainable price to the grower must be paid for the nuts. 
During the period 2016/ 2017, though the prices were increased, owing to the low nut weight and reduction of yields, the farmers did not obtain an enhanced income. They managed to sustain their plantation by irrigation and moisture conservation practices at additional costs.
However, with generous rain during the 2017 north east monsoon and the 2018 south west monsoon, the coconut nut yields have improved. The Coconut Research Institute (CRI) predicted a crop yield increase for 2018 as against 2017. In Kurunegala District the increase is as follows Feb- 7%, March 17%, April 21%, May 31%, June 22%, July 50% and August 13%.
Due to the negative psychological publicity by the coconut traders in with respect to the importation of coconut kernel, increase of nut yields, shortfall in demand , the nut prices from January 2018 have been declining steadily and the present farm gate price is Rs 28/=. (the retail price of coconut in the cities and suburbs is still around Rs 70.00, with no benefit to the domestic consumer).
The cost of production of a nut is between Rs 30 and Rs 35/- as determined by the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) & CRI.
According to The Sunday Observer of 19th November 2017, the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) Chairman Kapila Yakandawala said with the crop yield increasing by around 40 million nuts per month, from next month the price of a nut will drop to around Rs. 65. The grower could get a minimum price of Rs. 45 while the consumer could purchase a nut at around Rs. 65.
We need to control the price fluctuation which is not good for the industry. We hope to maintain the price range between Rs. 40-60 per nut, Yakandawala said.
It is paramount that a sustainable price to the coconut farmer is maintained at Rs 40/= to Rs 50/= per average size nut to enable the farmer to carry out essential agricultural practices with a depleting work force, escalating wages and the withdrawal of fertilizer subsidy.
What are the proactive measures that should be taken in the short term and long term to maintain a reasonable farm gate price
Disproportionate prices
Proper marketing strategies should be in place to maintain a sustainable price to farmers. The strategies should include domestic consumption and industrial use.
The disparity between the farm gate price and urban retail price is disproportionate, having provided for transport cost and profit margin. 
Strategies that should be adopted are:
To produce fresh grated coconut packs under refrigeration and grated coconut in dehydrated form to the consumer instead of transporting coconuts to the domestic consumer. This would reduce the price to the consumer as the packing cost would offset the other two by products of coconut water and the shell. The volume & weight of grated coconut pack being less transport cost too would drastically reduce. 
	Allow export of fresh nuts without export levy.
	Restrict the import of palmolein and other edible oil.
	Allow industries without restrictions to produce value added products for export.
	Formulate mechanisms for forward contracting with minimum price and a formula for price escalation if required.

Electoral System not important: UNP seniors
	
The electoral system under which the PC Elections should be held was not important for the UNP as the party wanted the Provincial Council Elections held as soon as possible under any system, several party seniors said today.
UNP Spokesman Harin Fernando told a media briefing that the system under which the elections were held was not important as the party wanted the elections held as soon as possible under any system.
If we keep on crying on the electoral system, it will result in a political setback, the Minister said.
Minister Fernando added the report of the Committee appointed to look into the Delimitation of Provincial Constituencies was discussed by the Cabinet on Tuesday and both-President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe-had called for another report on the amendments that had to be made with regard to Delimitation.
He said decisions would be made after they get the report.
State Minister Eran Wickramaratne, who also participated in the media briefing, said the debate on the delimitation was included in the Order Paper.
He said it was up to the MPs to decide on how would vote- in favour of the Delimitation Committee Report or not - after seeing it. (Yohan Perera)

Glorious concept of virtuous Hajj
	
Eid-Ul-Adha is the festival of sacrifice, celebrated around the globe each year at the conclusion of Hajj performance in Mecca, preferably on the 10th Day of the month of Zul-Hajj. 
It is a commemorative festival in reminiscing about the episode of Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) endeavouring willingly to sacrifice his own son as an act of obedience to Allahs command. 
Subsequently, the Prophet was astonished to see that his son was unharmed and instead Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) was provided with a goat by Allah, to be sacrificed. 
This significant and glorious occurrence and the endeavour are celebrated and honoured on this day by the Muslims the world over. 
In coinciding with this renowned and distinguished circumstance, Muslims all over the world sacrifice goat or cattle and distribute among the poor, relatives, friends and family members. 
Hajj pilgrimage is one of the most significant concepts in Islam, where an enormous gathering of different nations and different colours, assemble at the Holy City of Mecca to perform this consequential obligatory act. 
Islam does not presuppose man as an infallible
	Hajj pilgrimage is one of the most significant concepts in Islam, 
	Man buoyantly and joyfully spends his hard earned money in accordance with Allahs directions.
	Performing Sai Safa and Marwa, stand as another important ritual.
The Holy Quran reveals: 
Behold! We gave the site, To Abraham, of the (Sacred) House, (saying); Associate not anything (in Worship)With Me; and Sanctify My House, For Those who compass it round, or stand up, or bow, or prostrate themselves therein in prayer (Holy Quran 22; 26-29)
The Holy Quran has commanded extensively subscribing about the House of Allah (The Kabah) and its credentials, how Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) declared and announced the pilgrimage on the direction of the Almighty and responded to it down the ages, the benefits of the pilgrimage and how it represents the essence of all other acts of devotional worship in Islam, especially the spirit of piety and surrender to Allah, disseminating every aspect of pilgrimage. 
The Quranic revelation further emphasizes placing pilgrimage in its historical contexts. 
Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) constructed (The Kabah), the House of Allah, at the site identified by Him, in its special Sacred Status. 
As for maintaining its pure and Sacred Holiness, the directive has both a literal and a figurative sensation, clear of all material and spiritual obscenity and corruption for the purpose of true worship of the universal God. 
Thousands of years ago, long before the era of the press post, the telegraph, the wireless, the radio, television and other such equipment and apparatus of modern publicity and propaganda, that mankind has been responding to during all these centuries, by performing the pilgrimage in their tens, hundreds and thousands every year. 
Man buoyantly and joyfully spends his hard earned money in accordance with Allahs directions. So doing, he enthusiastically places divide rulings above his interest.
This Islamic stance is part of its broader scheme of things, according to which man is only a trustee, with some possessions placed under his charges such as his body, his physical and intellectual faculties and potentials and his earnings. 
Man is liable to err and forget divine guidance. However, a more important factor is that he should be conscious of all this weakness and repent as soon as he realizes the lapses committed by him.
Islam does not presuppose man as an infallible creature, who does not do any wrong.
Performance of Hajj provides an opportunity to pilgrims, to observe and perceive the benefits by augmenting numerous and varied accomplishments in sectors of religious, financial, social, political and intellectual. 
Consistently, Prophet Muhammad (Sal) communicated that on accomplishing Hajj, a pilgrim is akin to a newborn baby, in being pure and sinless. 
At the outset of the Quranic verse prescribing Hajj and Umrah, man is clearly told that he should perform all these for Allah alone. (Holy Quran 2196).
This assertion stems from the distinct strain of pure, unadulterated monotheism in all acts of worship in Islam.Sacred sites associated with Hajj are Makkah, Arafat, Muzdalifuh and Mina. 
Yet, a pilgrims attention must be focused on Allah only. Gender by the same spirit the pilgrim should perform Hajj rites in the manner laid down by Almighty Allah. 
Moreover, each night of Hajj is characterized by many benefits which have both functional and catalytic value. Performance of Hajj rites commences after access into the State of Ihram. 
Man is liable to err and forget divine guidance. However, a more important factor is that he should be conscious of all this weakness and repent as soon as he realizes the lapses committed by him.
The clothing of Ihram makes one realize paradoxically both the importance and worthlessness of clothes of which one is habitual since birth. Pilgrims dressed in frugal Ihram display the essential uniformity of mankind, cutting across distinctions of social class, financial status and ethnic origin. 
The strong individuality exhibited, rather reinforced by ones preferential clothes, is instantly replaced by the awe-inspiring unity of mankind with one of the millions of Pilgrims, assembled every year during the period of Hajj.
More importantly the donning of Ihram places certain restrictions on a person, refraining from sexual relations with ones wife in hunting or applying perfume etc.
Talbiyah chanting is a significant sequence for the pilgrim, where it helps to discover the true image, by completely surrendering himself to the Supreme Lord.
Circumambulating around the sacred Kaabah (Thawaf) broadens and reinforces the pilgrims spiritual benefits, which act is the most significant observance in performing Hajj or Umrah. 
Performing Sai (swift walk) Safa and Marwa, stands as another important ritual.
Standing near Kaabah, praying at the spot on which the Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) had once stood, visiting the Zamzam Well and drinking its water, are all being part of procedures of Hajj that helps the pilgrims to re-enact the Sacred History. 
History bears testimony to the fact that Muslims as a community have demonstrated numerous instances of solidarity, cutting across barriers of race, colour or language, and achieved commendable accomplishments. 
The epitome of social equality as professed and practised by early Muslims was the key to the phenomenal spread of Islam across all parts of the globe. The most significant cause for this phenomenon was that the exploited and deprived staggering from crisis to crisis, under a yoke of bondage, saw Islam with its teachings and practice of equality and fraternity on their champion and warmly embraced it in large numbers. When performing Hajj, the pilgrim imbibes the spiritual experience flowing from the philosophical and theoretical framework of the Prophets Ibrahim (Alai), Ishmael (Alai) and Muhammad (Sal) and Hajara (Alai). Every one of them represents an illuminating paradigm model of wholesale surrender to Allahs Will and of steadfastness characterized by determined resolution and undoubting courage in following the path prescribed by Him. 
Staying in the valley of Arafath is another important rite of the pilgrims. 
Millions of pilgrims display the homogenization of the purpose of the journey and of status, where it brings to mind immediately the Grand Assembly before Allah on the Day of Judgment when each and every human being will be recompensed in proportion to the record of his/her deeds.
Hajj embodies the virtuous inclination of the pilgrims will. It thus serves as an excellent opportunity for dignifying and sublimating a persons emotions and sensation. 
Indecent indulgence and wicked acts, whether privately or publicly, outrages the moral health of society and hence constitutes a serious wrongdoing and injustice to fellow human beings. 
The young especially, are prone to be so afflicted. It perhaps amounts to stating the obvious that a society teeming with vices cannot enjoy peace and happiness. Sustainability and substantial reconciliation can be attained only if we nullify and annihilate the immoral characteristics. 
The convergence of pilgrims from all parts of the world representatives of vast social economic catchment areas, provide pilgrims with manyassociated benefits.
Acquaintance and social contact with fellow believers revitalized the sense of community with solidarity and open up avenues for trade and commerce. Throughout the history, this institution of Hajj has continued to serve as the major unifying influence in Islam and the most effective common bond among the diversified and distinct believers. It renders every pilgrim a physical healthiness, at least once in a lifetime by circumambulation. 
Allah is to be glorified and thanked for His imparting guidance to man.

GMOA dictates President to stop moves on Trade Agreements
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) urged President Maithripala Sirisena to immediately suspend the proceedings, which were scheduled on end of August to compose trade agreements including Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA).
GMOA Secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge on Tuesday said Development Strategies and International Trade Ministrys Secretary had reportedly convened several parties to compose these trade agreements by August 24 in an arbitrary manner.
He said the Ministrys Secretary did not have any such authority to convene parties to compose trade agreements under the national trade policy.
He added that it was dubious that such a Secretary had sufficient qualifications to take decisions on international and national trade.
President Sirisena has appointed an Independent Experts Committee on Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to conduct a special study, in which the same Secretary was involved. The Ministry Secretary has acted in an arbitrary manner with regard to Sri LankaSingapore FTA as well, he said.
Accordingly, President Sirisena should take immediate measures to suspend the proceedings on other trade agreements including ETCA, which are scheduled for August 24, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

He put his foot into mouth again!
	

There are still one or two guys from the Group 16 now downsized to 15, maintaining a shuttle-liaison between the Pohottuwa and the Maithri-faction, they say.

Of these two-timers, the most conspicuous one is the gabby one from central hills who was called a vote machine in his heyday, but now at Diyawanna thanks to the charity list.
He recently stirred a hornets nest by submitting a proposal to the Blue party central committee that the incumbent Number One be nominated as the party candidate at the coming big poll with the explicit understanding that the former strongman would be his Number Two.
Several JO stalwarts who had reacted with anger to this proposal had lashed out at the gabby one from hills and warned him to stop playing the double game.
The gabby one who got highly disconcerted by the unexpected angry reaction from the JO faction had increased his courtesy calls on the former strongman by way of making amends, they say.
He had even invited the former boss to a public function in his constituency as a damage control measure.

Hours-long battle ends in Kabul after militants killed
	

An hours-long battle in the Afghan capital involving insurgent rocket attacks and military airstrikes ended Tuesday with the death of two militants, authorities said. 
The assault came as President Ashraf Ghani was making a speech marking the first day of the Islamic Eid al-Adha holiday, days after he offered the Taliban a conditional three-month ceasefire. 
It was not clear who carried out the attack. 
Two attackers were involved. The enemy was firing mortars, General Murad Ali Murad, commander of Kabuls garrison, told a press conference. 
They were killed and at least six civilians or security force members were injured, he said. 
Police said the attackers used rockets, several of which landed in at least two areas of Kabul around 9:00 am. 
During the battle an Afghan army helicopter swooped in low near the Eidgah Mosque in a central district and fired a rocket at a militant position, sending a plume of dust into the sky. Shoppers who moments earlier had been buying livestock for the Eid feast sprinted for shelter as cars swerved in the road to flee the fighting. 
Blasts and gunfire could be heard as security forces cordoned off the area.

Its his turn now to act!
	

A group of WPC members had called on Number One the other day to make a collective request that the incumbent provincial chief be removed.

On this occasion, the scion of the Rajagaha political family had told the big boss: Sir, if you remove this guy, I and my wife will be by your side from tomorrow!
Number One by now quite used to this type of assurances had offered the ambitious member a proposition.
I can certainly remove him from office. But first, make your appearance at our party convention come September!
This story had soon appeared in various news websites and the man had been inundated with inquiries over the phone from interested and inquisitive parties. But he had studiously avoided giving a reply.
All are now quietly waiting for his next move, they say.

Japan wants Htota to be free of military activities
	
Japan wants Hambantota port to be "free of military activities", the visiting Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onedera has said amid concerns in the region over the leasing of the facility to China, the PTI reported on Wednesday.
Onedera, who arrived in Sri Lankayesterday, is the first Japanese defence minister ever to visit Sri Lanka.
His visit comes amid the regional concerns over growing Chinese influence in Sri Lanka, the PTI said.

"Despite the lease, there was an agreement that port remains free of military activities," Onedera was quoted as saying by NHK. He is also scheduled to visit Hambantota.
Sri Lanka and China entered into a 99-year lease of the Hambantota port which will enable the Chinese to set up an industrial park around the seaport.

Keeping extremism under control
	
I had a dream. No, I didnt cross a stream. Instead, I found myself seated in the public gallery of a courthouse. A Tamil youth who has been in detention for years without any charge or prosecution was being produced. The only perceivable reason for his incarceration turns out to be an opinion of the Secretary of Defence that he poses a threat to national security.
As to what constitutes such a threat or the reasons for the opinion is something to which nobody in the courthouse -- including the learned judge -- is privy to. So the suspect is promptly re-remanded and sent back to detention, the location of which, is known only to the divine.
An elderly person, judging by his attire to be a Hindu priest, aghast and shocked by the proceedings ventures to express his dismay by uttering a few words of anguish inside the court. The guardians of law in uniform swiftly pounce on the unruly delinquent who was later sentenced to two years RI. 
I wake up in utter jubilation and a sense of pride that the dignity and the grandeur of the system has been upheld and those who take lightly the rule of law has been deservedly punished.
Then I fall asleep again and... I had another dream
I am seated yet again in the courthouse. This time some intelligent men who have been made suspects after investigation and with convincing prima facie evidence implicating them in the abduction of a journalist, are produced and again, remanded. A bald-headed person in saffron robes gets up and accuses the system of victimizing patriots. Undeterred by the timorous and deferential pleadings of the guardians of law in uniform, he proceeds to threaten the wife of the abducted journalist with death. To the relief of all, nothing untoward happens to this personage as he walks out of the courthouse, still engaged in verbal excesses! 
I wake up again. Without any emotion, being fully aware even in the dream that it is prudent not to show emotion in these types of situations. 
In my third dream, I become aware that the robe-bearer is sentenced to six years RI! At the same time, I hear many voices suggesting a Presidential pardon to this priestly personage. In a second, Article 12 of the Constitution flashes before my dreaming eyes. We all know that it is not safe to rely on particular details we see in our dreams, yet this sentence dazzles in crystal clear letters.
All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
Back to the stark reality; I wake up, feeling proud to be a citizen of a country where the Constitution is upheld to the letter. If not for the quick measures of restraint from my beloved wife, who is next to me, I would have danced on the bed, hardly able to contain the joy of a law abiding citizen. In fact, the bliss of that emotion has not left me to date and keeps getting better with every day that passes by.
Presidential pardon is a thing that none of the lesser mortals understand. The manner in which it has been exercised in the past
Our country is heading for unprecedented heights 
Presidential pardon is a thing that none of the lesser mortals understand. The manner in which it has been exercised in the past is public knowledge. Not only does this outrageous liberty given to the executive tend to blur the distinct line that the concept of separation of powers that a constitutionally governed democracy envisages in the first place. But in the context of specific occasions in which it has been evoked, it makes light work of judicial findings based on evidence that emerge in a trial or judicial inquiry.
Galabodaaththe Gnanasara who acted in so disrespectable and contemptuous a manner surpassing any conduct hitherto reported inside a courthouse, it is said, is to get the pardon. In any event, his lawyer has confirmed the intention of appealing to the Supreme Court. Even if the same fate that befell him at the Court of Appeal repeats itself, he has little reason to despair. He has the benefit of the Executive of this country at this point anxious to be in the good books of the so-called Sinhala-Buddhist voters in 2020. He is not alone in this respect as the other two top national leaders are abreast with him in this regard. 
Illustrious Company
Gnanasara is not the only monk in prison; he is in the company of 15 other monks doing time for various acts of delinquency. Hardly a whimper emanates from the Mahanayakes, pious Buddhists or politicians for their cause; in fact, if not for the controversy regarding the prison jump suit, many would not have known that such a number of clergy were behind bars.
So what causes a stir in this particular case In what respect is Gnanasara different from other monks To be precise, what could be the logic behind a pardon, if that becomes an eventuality The answer lies in the Socio-Politico-Religious dynamics that have been shaping ground realities, power and governance for the last two decades. A hegemonic Sinhala-Buddhist ethos that symbolized a war mentality and a general mode of life underpinned by a majoritarian and dominant national psyche has not only outlived by far the war effort; it has spilled over to all areas of life, undermining the rule of law, civil society structures, constitutional rights as well as impartiality and objectiveness of the criminal justice system. 
Even leaders who have not constituted part of that ethos are now being constrained to play along to the tune of retrogressive, hawkish and majoritarian power wielding by Sinhala Buddhist extremism. What seemed to be mere fringe, in the blink of an eye, has usurped the centre and would not yield the stage to the tolerant and non violent Theravada Buddhist outlook which has been, at least, the theoretical mainstay of social life in this country for decades. It is gradually laying siege to all three arms of governance which are seemingly being paralyzed with fear of imminent seizure of power through a Hitler-like figure in the future. The euphoria is attaining proportions of unbridled thuggery and violence directed at all and sundry who dare to utter a syllable in dissent. Gnanasara is only the tip of the iceberg!
From secularism toa theocracy
Europe managed to separate institutionalized and power wielding religion from the affairs of the State centuries ago and attained the socio-economic and political development that they have today. The Middle East did not manage to do that and despite standing on fountains of wealth in the form of oil reserves are unable to even aspire for such development. In fact the entire middle east languishes on the cusp of disintegration. We as a country, for our part managed for the good part of a century after independence to keep retrogressive forces of majoritarian religious inclinations at bay through progressive forces led by secular-oriented leaders. The only leader who used those forces for expedient power grabbing was SWRD Bandaranaike, and promptly paid the price. The present and would be leaders would do well to keep the lessons of 1956 and 1959 in mind.
In the words of the one time PM of this country, Sir John Kotelawala, You need to keep tied up dogs under leash all the time! When those dogs are rabid with racist and supremacist hallucinations, the tighter the leash, the better!

More than two million Muslims mark  Eid al-Adha in Saudi
	

MINA Saudi AFP, Aug 21, 2018- More than two million Muslims took part in the symbolic stoning of the devil Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, the last major ritual of the hajj pilgrimage that heralds the start of the Eid al-Adha feast. 
Muslims on the annual hajj pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam, made their way across the Mina valley of the western Saudi Arabian Mecca province, many carrying pebbles in plastic bottles.

Pilgrims clad in white threw seven stones each at a pillar symbolising satan, shouting Allahu akbar ( God is greatest ) under the watchful eyes of security forces. 
Large fans sprayed water over the crowd as temperatures climbed to 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit). 
Thank God it hasnt been too crowded this year. There hasnt been a big rush, said Mohammed Osman, 27, who regularly attends hajj. 
Mina was the site of a 2015 stampede which saw more than 2,300 pilgrims crushed or suffocated to death. Authorities have since reinforced safety and security measures.

Next clean-up scheduled for September 1 Nokunu Team continues to keep city clean
	
The Nokunu Team, also known as the Guardians of the City, was established to spread awareness among people regarding the segregation of garbage and transforming Colombo into a cleaner city. Under the supervision of Sumi Moonesinghe, the mastermind behind this initiative, the Nokunu Team initiated its concept as a door-to-door campaign where they visited lower income families in the greater Colombo areas and educated them about the segregation of garbage.

Under the supervision of Sumi Moonesinghe, the mastermind behind this initiative, the Nokunu Team initiated its concept as a door-to-door campaign
	The Nokunu Team is going on a door-to-door campaign to educate people about segregating garbage
	The Nokunu Team receives continuous support from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) which is involved in wetland management
Taking one step further in this campaign, the team together with various supporters recently succeeded in conducting a large scale clean-up around the Beira Lake. Following this success, the team is ready to take its initiative forward, educating the masses about the effective segregation of garbage. This September the team will visit the lower income families living along the waterways from Wellawatte, Pamankada up to Thalakotuwa Gardens, educating them about this initiative and effective garbage disposal practices. 
This phase will begin from the SLLRDC Office, Stratford Avenue on September 1 at 7.30am.
Speaking to the , a member who has been involved with the Nokunu team since its inception said there are close to 250 less fortunate people living along these areas. We are going to do a door-to-door campaign to educate them about segregating garbage. The Portuguese didnt build these waterways for fun and we in turn have to keep them clean and take maximum use of them. In fact it is important to create awareness among people, so that they are consciously disposing garbage. If we go to a foreign country, we wouldnt act the same way we act in our own country. We would think twice before throwing a toffee wrapper but here we tend to do it anywhere. I believe that people in big companies should take the initiative to reduce the use of plastic and produce items which are reusable and biodegradable,the member said. 
The waterways protect the city from flooding, but people carelessly dump garbage. Even for the slightest rain Colombo goes under water and therefore it is important that these waterways are cleared and are used more effectively. The waste from these canals and waterways end up in the lakes and eventually in the sea and it has now become a vicious cycle. The Nokunu Team receives continuous support from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) which is involved in wetland management.
The Nokunu Team clears garbage
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) too has extended its fullest support to take this initiative forward. Therefore they look into the cleaning and maintenance in these wetlands and waterways on a daily basis. In the case of the Beira Lake, the Army and the Navy do a daily cleaning round to keep the city away from its seasonal stench. Various stakeholders and companies based around the Beira Lake got their teams to do the cleaning around their perimeters and as many volunteers said, it was quite a pleasing experience. 
Hence the Nokunu Team invites all interested parties and volunteers to be a part of its next phase. Volunteers are expected to bring their own ekelbrooms, gloves, mammoties, spades and other cleaning equipment.

Next request will carry an international label!
	

Several political characters had been trying their best to persuade the onetime master willow-wielder Sanga to contest the upcoming big poll without success.

Greatly inspired by the recent case of another master willow wielder of another country winning high office, these characters have now redoubled their persuasive efforts to bring our master willow wielder to the centre-stage.
However, in a move to discourage his self-appointed patrons, Sanga had posted a comment on his Facebook page vowing that he would never enter politics and that he had decided to dedicate his second innings for the success of his family life.
Nevertheless, the interested parties, instead of calling it quits had approached several foreign envoys based in Colombo for their backing. Diplomats from a powerful Asian country and two European countries had been among those who had pledged their co-operation.
So, all present indications are that the next request to Sanga would be a very weighty one carrying an international label which is expected to produce the effect of a brainwash on him, they say.

No decentralized budget for MPs for 8 months: JO
	
The Government had failed to release the decentralized budget funds to MPs for the past eight months, the Joint Opposition (JO) said today.
JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the decentralized budget allocates Rs.10 million per an MP and the MPs depend on this fund to facilitate projects at their electorates.
For the past eight months, no decentralized budget fund was released to an MP. Meanwhile, the government has launched an initiative called Gamperaliya to boost the villages. This Gam Peraliya will end up in a Rata Peraliya, he told a news briefing.
He said the village-level economy was in ruins and several leading utility companies had financially collapsed because the people have no money in their possession to spend.
Meanwhile, he said the construction fees amounting to Rs.25 billion had not been paid to the Road Development Authority (RDA) for projects it had carried out.
Commenting on the newly opened Special Court, the MP said its proceedings should be independent.
However, only the Justice Minister was available at the opening. Not even the Judges of the Special Court or the Chief Justice was present there.
The absence of key personnel in the Judiciary raises the question whether this court will act independently, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Open letter to the UNP hierarchy If you want a change, change the context
	
Life does not change if you only modify the content, your life will change if you will dare to alter the context. 
~ Santosh Kalwar
In my previous column, I emphasized the need for any political party, if it were to be successful, to name its candidates well ahead of time. However, I do repeat my argument so that its appeal to the reader is surpassed by its urgency to the one leader who has shown some remarkable ability to keep ahead of his followers by avoiding doing just that. The need to retain the leadership of the UNP seems to play an integral part in the political calculus of Ranil Wickremasinghe. On last two occasions, 2009 and 2015, Ranil displayed that inner craving. In 2009 he opted for Sarath Fonseka, a total outsider; not only to the UNP, but to politics altogether, while in 2015 he chose Maithripala Sirisena a one-time UNP hater from Polonnaruwa, which was a UNP bastion during the golden era of the UNP-rule, when the lucrative benefits of the Mahaweli Programmes were flowing to that ancient land.
Ranil can still overcome this deficiency. If only he tries to portray an image of strength, decisiveness and allegiance
	The announcement of its candidate by the UNP leadership is seen as a usual routine
	Ranil should realize, once and for all, that delaying the announcement is a lose-lose option
	Ranils generation is waning; in the twenty first century, its spending its last lap in life
On both those occasions, if his judgment was not to nominate himself, Ranil could have effortlessly nominated a second-tier UNPer for the Presidential race. Either Karu Jayasuriya or a younger candidate such as Sajith Premadasa may have had a fighting chance to win the election. In 2009, Karu Jayasuriya was the assured choice the UNP would have fielded, but in 2015 the context was quite different. The trio of Ranil-Chandrika-Ven. Sobhitha Thera came into the scene and selected Maithripala Sirisena, who by that time had realized that the horrendous rule of the Rajapaksas had to be defeated. In the aftermath of both these elections, the rank and file of the UNP did not have to say anything remotely close to complement towards Ranil. The number of traditional UNP supporters who did not go to the polling booth was more than sufficient to defeat the opponent had they opted to vote! Yet the nett result of the strategy conceived and executed by Ranil was successful in that he managed to remain the leader of the UNP.
But todays context is different. The UNP is in power. It is more than likely that the common candidate Maithripala Sirisena would not be a common candidate of any coalition that the UNP will be associated with. In such a positive scenario, the announcement of its candidate by the UNP leadership is seen as a usual routine. Unlike past leaders of the UNP, Ranil is being perceived by his own rank and file as a doubtful winner. His past performance is not very attractive. His lack of charisma and inability to be a sought-after national speaker in the vernacular is woefully noticeable. The leader of a nationally reputed political party such as the UNP has had in its
storied past some magnificent speakers of the calibre of Dudley Senanayake, JR Jayewardene, Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali. Among them Ranasinghe Premadasa could be classified as one of the best ever Sinhala Speakers of Sri Lanka. Only Rohana Wijeweera would match him as a mob orator. The wherewithal of such oratorical skills is the most demanded product in an election time. People would trek miles to listen to such an orator.
Ranil could still overcome this deficiency. If only he tries to portray an image of strength, decisiveness and allegiance to truth and facts, by delivering a calm and stern speech, he could avert this decisive disadvantage. If necessary, he might have to recruit another speechwriter whose fidelity is to the needs and demands of grassroots elements in the country. Great orators are not born. They are always made. One unique example is Premadasa. In his speeches, he had gone to the extent of noting in his written speech as to where he had to pause, at the end of which sentence he had to remove his spectacles etc. for the dramatic effect such gestures would entail. Sir. Winston Churchill used to practise his speeches in the toilet before a mirror. Speechifying, or for that matter all politics, is drama and theatre. Ranil has to adopt the positive aspect of that drama and theatre. Of the two elements of any oration, content and delivery, the average man is moved more by the delivery than the content. When one lacks in delivery, he or she has to make do with the content. Ranil has to be more consistent with the content of his speeches. Continuing on the same lane would eventually take him to a political cul-de-sac and he would have nowhere to turn. 
In 2009, Karu Jayasuriya was the assured choice the UNP would have fielded, but in 2015 the context was quite different. The trio of Ranil-Chandrika-Ven. Sobhitha came into the scene and selected Maithripala Sirisena
If, on the contrary, he opts to adopt a more forward-looking and aggressive posture, I once agin iterate, he has a fighting chance in the coming Presidential Elections. But in the absence of any evidence that he would make such adjustments, both the second tier and the rank and file of the party will keep hoping and praying for anyone but Ranil Wickremasinghe.
Being preoccupied with the next election is no evil; it is not a political sin to organize for the next election, especially in case of a government power. Ranils generation is waning; in the twenty first century, its spending its last lap in life. Two generations have come to the political stage since the 1977 JR-led UNP victory. Those two generations do not remember JR, Premadasa, Gamini or Lalith. For those two generations, print media is an anachronism; the predominance of the social media has changed life and the direction in which average socio-political dynamic taking them; its unpredictable as any other social transformation in human history.
A generational thinking, that is as supple and susceptible to the vagaries of social and cultural spectacles such as fundamentalism in religious action and adherence to the fringes of the political spectrum, is waiting in the wings of sustainable change. That is the ultimate challenge facing the UNP leader. Prime Ministerial powers have not been able to allure an intellectually curious and politically probing generation. Waiting until the proverbial eleventh hour would only exacerbate an utterly volatile situation. The popular belief that Ranil would be anyway contented even if the UNP loses, by being the Leader of the Opposition is a myth; a political party in Opposition is much more prone to divisions and inside fighting so as to challenge its leadership and come aftermath of a potential UNP loss in 2020, the UNP would be disseminated into pieces.
That is why Ranil should realize, once and for all, that delaying the announcement is a lose-lose option, firstly for Ranil and secondly for the UNP and eventually for the country. He has to make that announcement as an official statement of the Party, not through intermediaries or unacceptable emissaries. If not himself, Sajith, Navin or Karu, let it be announced now. Then his successor has sufficient time to launch and execute a successful campaign.
Fundamentals of politics have not changed. Prime among those fundamentals are content and process. Tactics as to how the content is phrased and nuanced could be changed. They need to adjust and adapt themselves to be changed. In the same vein, the process and the need for a solid and fundamentally sound process is a fundamental for a developing society. Whatever the character the process takes, whether its authoritarian, democratic or by royal decree, a need for a process does not change. 
So, what is that content and what is that process by which the content is delivered to the people who ultimately decide in a democratic society While the structure of a process is being built by the UNP, the leader which is an essential and integral part of that content still remains a core issue in the UNP. That burning desire of the people to discover the next leader or deliverer is second only to the desire to come to power as one single unit which is the Party, UNP.
Today that content includes among others, Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake in the lead. The UNP grassroots may be having an inclination towards Sajith on the grounds that he has been more overtly active, especially among the Buddhist clergy in the country. Yet he has not been recognized as a great orator on the one hand, and on the other, his inability to criticize the Rajapaksas and the blatant absence of his rhetoric on nationally urgent issues has contributed to him being considered as not-yet-tested category.
On the other hand Navin Dissanayake catapulted himself to the leadership ranks thanks mainly to the 65% of the votes he received from amongst Working Committee members of the Party and the immense faith and trust the Party higher-ups had for his father Gamini Dissanayake. Sajiths father, President Premadasa, died when his popularity was on a downward trend, thanks mainly to the aborted impeachment issue, while Gaminis demise occurred when he was on his way to the summit as the UNP Presidential candidate. That is exactly why I say that, in politics,its all context that matters aboveeverything else.

PHU wants Govt. to declare holiday over JO protest
	
It would be convenient for people if the Government announced September 5 as a public holiday in order to reduce the congestion that could be caused by the protest campaign organised by the Joint Opposition (JO), the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said.
The Janabalaya Kolambata, Anti-Government protest campaign organised by the Joint Opposition (JO) is scheduled to be held on September 5 in Colombo.
Addressing a news briefing, PHU leader Udaya Gammanpila said the employees working in Colombo would be highly inconvenienced owing to this massive protest.
We dont like to see people getting inconvenienced because of this protest, which is done against the inefficiencies of the Government,
If the Government would not make the day a holiday, we request the heads of the companies in Colombo to give their employees a holiday on that particular day, Gammanpila said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Playing diplomacy!
	

A Colombo-based envoy from a very powerful country, who wound up his stint here, paid the customary valedictory call on the Diyawanna Opposition Chief the other day.

During the lengthy chat that ensued, so the story goes, the envoy requested the grey-haired chief quite diplomatically not to back the countrys former strongman at any upcoming poll.
A seasoned politico, the Opposition Chief too wanted to be equally diplomatic.
We become helpless sans an alternative on certain occasions, he replied.
Now, this person appears to be enjoying the majority support in the South We cant get our problems solved if we antagonize the South.
Then it was the outgoing envoys turn to show cause to justify his request. And the elderly politico again gave him his attentive ear. Presently he took pains to further explain the position that his party is placed in.
Our people in the North-east question us about the new Constitution we promised. We are stumped! You see that we cant help but play by ear!
The envoy did not look happy with this reply. But he did not further press the issue, they say.

PM invites Japan to assist SL in port development
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the visiting Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera that Sri Lanka expected assistance from Japan to develop ports in Sri Lanka.
The Premier expressed these views when the Japanese Minister called on him at Temple Trees Tuesday evening.
He said countries around the Bay of Bengal would achieve a rapid growth in the coming years and that Trincomalee Harbour would become a vital port by then.
Minister Onodera in response said that he expected to visit Trincomalee to get an idea about the area and the port.
During the meeting, the Premier highlighted the importance of signing a defence agreement between Sri Lanka and Japan.
He said Sri Lanka always remained committed to the free Naval movement in the Indian Ocean as highlighted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Politicking in gentlemens game!
	

Green Party backbenchers are set to make a formal collective request to the party leader, who is also the Number Two in yahapalanaya to appoint Captain Cool to the main chair of the body controlling the popular gentlemens game, they say.

The rationale for their request is that all the successive occupants of this coveted chair in the recent past had been Blue Party loyalists and it was high time that a deserving Green Party one was given a chance to occupy this position.
The Green backbenchers propose to point out that it behoved the authorities in the interest of the future of the game to keep out of the scene the long-serving chief of the controlling body who got pushed out with the recent administrative change.
Meanwhile, Number Two had suggested to the backbenchers to brief both Number One and the top team member handling the subject on their proposal, they say.

Spore-SL FTA in force, says Harsha
	
A Presidential Commission probing the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA did not mean that the agreement was not in force, State Minister Harsha De Silva said today.
"The Singapore Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is in force despite a probe being carried out by a Commission appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to look into it, he said.
I have seen a notice calling the general public to come and make deliberations on the FTA to an office opened at the BMICH.
However, I would like to state that the agreement is still in force, the State Minister said at a media briefing last morning.
Dr De Silva denounced the allegations made by the Opposition and some trade experts that Sri Lanka would become a garbage dump as a result of the FTA and said there were no clauses in the agreement under which importation of garbage from Singapore was allowed.
Only thing that is done is the inclusion of a list of items that are considered as garbage, he said.
A similar list was included in the FTA Sri Lanka signed with Pakistan in 2005 under which human waste, clinical waste, scrap metal and tungsten are named as garbage, the State Minister said.
Dr De Silva added that the FTA has been prepared in line with the General Agreement on Tax and Tariff (GATT) criteria, while it is also in accordance with BASEL convention under which trading of hazards waste is protected.
Meanwhile, Minister Harin Fernando who criticized the GMOA said the doctors were unnecessarily attacking the FTA.
These doctors fail to see how the reduction of the prices of essential drugs had benefited people, he said. (Yohan Perera)

The enormity of an antipathy!
	

A prominent yahapalanaya top team member, hailing from a remote corner of Sabaragamuwa, was addressing a group of Diyawanna colleagues at a lobby session the other day.

He was, in fact, holding forth on the coming big poll and the aspirants likely to enter the race.
Meanwhile, another group led by a JO pundit on law points dressed in immaculate white national attire came there.
By this time, the members of the first group had started mentioning the names of likely candidates for the big race.
The top team member turning to the JO group inquired whether it was correct that they had decided to field so and so at the big poll. The group members confirmed it in unison. Another member mentioned that the Green Party leader was too due to come forward as a candidate. At this stage, a JO member mentioned a name of a prominent yahapalanaya figure and asked:
Is it true that he too is set to enter the race
It was the top team member who was the first to react to this seemingly innocuous inquiry. He appeared highly worked up. You take this from me he blurted out turning to the JO members. Even if we decide to vote for your boss, this guy will not get our votes!
They say that this revelation came as a bombshell and all JO members looked on wide-eyed!

Tough action against ragging imperative
	
Higher Education Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe had a startling story to tell the country last week about ragging of newcomers by senior students of Universities. According to him, for the past two years, nearly 2000 students who entered universities had left them due to inhuman ragging by the senior students. We have heard about brutal ragging incidents in universities and other higher education institutions and stories about students leaving universities but nobody expected such a large number of students to give up university education just because of the barbaric mindset of another group of students. 
Earlier, in May 2016, Vice Chancellor of the Kelaniya University Prof. Sunanda Maddumabandara had told that eight students had left his university during the year due to ragging and there could be more planning to leave or have already left without giving notice. Even that number was deemed then as a manifestation of a serious problem. But now Higher Education Minister says the number runs into thousands.
The annual intake of students for all universities in the country does not exceed 40,000 yet. And around 2000 students are leaving the universities not due to poverty, or lack of hostel facilities or any other facilities, but due to the activities of a set of psychopaths. Where is the university administration Where are the marshals Where are the so-called student union leaders who take to streets even at the drop of a hat, claiming that the free education was in danger Where are the GMOA leaders who shout at the top of their voice about free education Where are the political parties that provoke students through their student unions to demonstrate on all 365 days of the year, in the name of students rights
What might the students leaving the universities due to ragging be doing after so leaving The affluent ones might enter foreign universities spending millions of rupees worth countrys foreign exchange and for some others that would be the end of their higher education. What a crime! 
The Minister says that the law against ragging that was adopted in 1998 provides for the students found guilty of ragging to be sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment. Yet, every year since then we have heard of stories of ragging and sometimes students being arrested. However, we hardly hear of students being meted out any prison term for the past twenty years. Then what is the use of the law 
Sometimes a few students are captured by the university authorities or arrested by the police for ragging but only to let them go scot-free in a few weeks or months, sometimes on the ground that their education would be affected due to the legal actions. With the revelation by the minister now it is clear that the authorities are concerned about the education of a few senior students who are the members of student unions and not about thousands of new students. The excuse occasionally given by the authorities for their failure to penalize the raggers who ruin the higher education opportunities of thousands of students is that the victims do not come forward to complain and the difficulty in identifying the culprits. Should one believe that the authorities were unable to find the raggers for decades This points the connivance of the authorities in ragging for some reason, may be in fear of student unions. There should be a mechanism to monitor their activities as well, in respect of ragging. 
Ragging in universities and other higher education institutions is the best indication of the hypocrisy of those students unions, professional organizations and political parties that claim to stand for the students rights and free education. Are they blind to the fact that thousands of students are leaving the universities just because of the cruelty of a section of psychopaths 
They make thousands of students go to foreign universities by agitating against local private universities. They make another group of students go to foreign universities apart from shattering the dreams of higher education of some others, by way of ragging. They never demand the increase of university intake, while hundreds of thousands of students are being deprived of the right to higher education every year. This is the kind of concern they have on the free education. Therefore the minister must take action against the inhuman ragging without giving in to the fear of intimidation by the student unions.

Udayanga recommended company as GSA for Russia
	
Former Sri Lankan ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga had recommended a company named Sri Lanka Limited to be appointed as General Sales Agent (GSA) for SriLankan airlines in Russia, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka was told yesterday.
Shiromi Cooray, Manager Industrial Relations, SriLankan Airlines notified the commission that writing to the SriLankan country manager in Russia in 2011, Weeratunga has said that Sri Lanka Limited could help the country forge closer relationships with Russia and Ukraine and the company should be selected for this reason. This is the first time that we have appointed a GSA to Russia, she said. She also said that there had been no advertisement announcing the decision.
It was also revealed that this was a direct violation of rules formulated in 2009 which stipulates that prior to selecting a GSA, SriLankan should conduct a market survey of a new territory and call for applications through advertisements in newspapers and SriLankan websites and also hold a legal and financial review.
"There had been no interview process to select a suitable company and there has been no legal or financial review during this process," she said.
She also informed the Commission that although the then CEO, Kapila Chandrasena had recommended Sri Lanka Limited, according to the 2009 rule manual the CEO does not have the authority to appoint a GSA.
"Chandrasena had also extended the agreement in 2015, again violating the rules appearing in the 2009 manual, for another three years, however the GSA terminated the agreement in 2015 after SriLankan stopped direct flights to Russia," she said. (Yoshitha Perera)

WHEN WILL WE LEARN
	
WPC bums demand 650,000/- chair
Buying expensive cars, and now even expensive chairs for the WPC members to place their DELICATE bums on, seems to be the order of the day!!! This is at the cost of ONLY Rs. 650,000/- PER CHAIR FOR 104 CHAIRS FOR THE WPC!!! Apparently, buying these chairs is SIMPLE FOR THE CASH-RICH WPC!!!
In our last weeks column we highlighted the lessons we could learn from some countries around the world!!! However, this seems to have had no impact whatsoever!!! Let me quote another shining example, the official vehicle of the Mexican Ambassador in India is a TUK TUK, and she is so proud of it, she says it is unique!!! She says that before being an Ambassador, she has travelled to India and has always used an autorickshaw!!! She thought millions of Indians use autorickshaws, so why wouldnt an Ambassador However, it wasnt so easy; the Mexican Embassy had to get special permission to buy an autorickshaw!!! The designs on the TUK TUK were done by a Mexican artist visiting Delhis Art Festival and the initial reaction in her office was What Madam, are you using an Autorickshaw, Madam, Madam, Madam The Embassy driver had to be trained to drive an autorickshaw and again it was not easy!!! How do you go from being an autorickshaw driver to being the driver of an Ambassador!!! The Ambassador affirms that it was not easy to explain, but what she tried to tell them was you are still the driver of an Ambassador, it is just a different vehicle!!! If the Mexican Ambassador can travel in a trishaw, why cant Indias elite do the same Our question is: Why do our Yakkos need THE MOST EXPENSIVE EXCLUSIVE CARS TO GO AROUND IN AND NOW THE BIGGER YAKKOS WANTING CHAIRS WORTH Rs. 650,000/- EACH TO PLACE THEIR DELICATE BUMS ON!!! WHY CANT SRI LANKAS SO CALLED ELITE TAKE AN EXAMPLE FROM THE MEXICAN AMBASSADOR IF THEY DO, WONT WE STAND AND APPLAUD
Where are the honest leaders
It seems like our erstwhile President has woken up from a long deep slumber and is finally expressing himself quite categorically and with no holds barred, no nonsense!!! Robert Frost comes to mind here
The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep!!! Yes, indeed he does have miles to go before 2020; perhaps he realizes THATS WHEN HE HAS TO GO TO SLEEP!!! So now he has started getting vociferous, no increments for Ministers, he settled the train strike, dared the GMOA to strike again and, at the unveiling of a statue, he even emphasized that today the people need and look for HONEST LEADERS!!! When and from where did this sudden realization dawn
Jaliya, Arjuna still at large!
As we have said before, the people are wondering what has happened to the criminals and law breakers who are still out of the country and those languishing in REMAND!!! The Wheels of Justice seem to grind exceedingly small and slow here; we are constrained to ask WHY JALIYA AND MAHENDRAN ARE STILL AT LARGE, ALOYSIUS AND PALIASENA ARE LANGUISHING IN REMAND, THE MURDERERS OF LASANTHA AND THAJUDEEN ARE YET TO BE NAMED; WHAT OF ALL THE OTHERS, OR DO WE NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK HAVE ALL THOSE WHO WERE SO GENEROUSLY GIVEN LEAVE TO PROCEED ABROAD FOR ALLEGED MEDICAL TREATMENT RETURNED WHEN THEY HAD TO WHO MONITORS ALLTHESE GOINGS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE COMINGS WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MOTIVATE THE LEADERS TO BRING THESE CASES TO CONCLUSION MOTIVATE! THATS THE OPERATIVE WORD HERE!!!
Stop pampering pets
A message supposedly from disgruntled UNPers is going viral asking the Prime Minister to quit as he has abused the trust placed in him twice!!! It claims that after twenty years of hibernating in the Opposition, he was placed in the seat of power to govern the country!!! They further claim that after 10 or more previous years of untold corruption, unimaginable violence, nepotism and impunity, they believed Sirisena and Ranil when they went around the country promising that they will punish those who murdered the innocent, raped the country of its wealth, beggaring and indebting us forever!!! They further state that both Maithri and Ranil affirmed they had all the evidence against those perpetrators to arrest, prosecute and jail them!!! Has this happened According to them, Ranil had only one agenda to safeguard the villains and traitors!!! They ask why an unseasoned first timer pip squeak is appointed to the education of the youth of our country!!! Yet another incompetent nincompoop gets Ministry after Ministry piled on him!!! They further claim that the UNP voter with a bit of common sense despises Ranil!!! Apparently, his behavior in Parliament is reprehensible and unbecoming of a Prime Minister!!! The Talented Youthful MPs of the Party are left languishing and frustrated while Ranil pampers his pets!!! They further claim Ranil has messed up the country and is killing the Party and are urging him to go before the UNP breathes its last!!! They want Ranil to go before he is kicked out!!!
Following fathers footsteps
Be that as it may, this column has also urged that the youthful MPs of the Party be given a chance to show their mettle!!! The majority of them are sons of former talented MPs who would undoubtedly be proud to follow in the footsteps of their fathers and show what they could!!! Why cant the ruling bunch of nincompoops realize this, accept that they can no longer deliver the goods and step aside with dignity, that is if they have any left!!! They are constantly resorting to unhealthy competition which is a never ending cycle!!! Continuously looking at who is ahead of them, who has the better job, who has more money in the bank, more education, better circumstances and a better life style!!! One important realization escapes them, which is that you can be the best that you can be when you are not competing with anybody!!! This is the root cause of their insecurity because they pay too much attention to what the others are doing; where they are going, what they are wearing, what car they are driving and what others are saying of them!!! Sadly, the realization has escaped them that they should be content with what they have; accept their limitations and stay focused on living a good life and providing a better standard of living not just for themselves but for the country in general!!!
Social media garbage
With all this going around and the country in total disarray, we read of a variety of medicines and food declared as unfit for human consumption!!! IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE ALL THIS CRAP THAT IS BEING DISHED OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THERE WONT BE ANY FOOD LEFT FOR US TO EAT AND WE WILL HAVE TO BE MORE THAN CAREFUL ABOUT THE MEDICINES WE INGEST!!! WHAT WE ARE TOLD IS GOOD TODAY SUDDENLY TRANSFORMS INTO BAD, UNHYGIENIC AND UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION TOMORROW!!! Chocolates, soap, pain balm, Coke and Pepsi (purported to have 21 types of different poisons!) Complan, Horlicks, Maltova, Protinex, Lifebuoy soap; all unhealthy for our consumption!!! Apparently Amitabh Bachchan underwent 10 hours of surgery to remove his large intestine due to consuming too much Coke and Pepsi!!! Wish we could get clarification from AB himself!!! The way social media is dishing out all this garbage, whom do we contact to find out if this is fact or fiction Shouldnt there be some kind of Competent Authority to whom we could refer this for clarification
Ultimately, the bottom line is there is no competition in Destiny, we each have our own!!! As we said earlier, competition and comparison are the thieves that kill the joy of living!!! Run your own race, and you will lead a happy, peaceful contented life!!!
