Sri Lanka needs a leader who wants all beings to be happy and healthy as it is preached in Buddhism, Minister of Housing and UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said over the weekend.

Mr. Premadasa said this during an opening of Sanda Dinu Gama reawaken village in Anuradhapura on Saturday.

‘We hear statements where some call for a Hitler type administration in this country. Some say the country need a Mussolini type of administration and others call for an Idi Amin type of administration. These are shameless statements,” Mr. Premadasa said.

“What this country need is a leader who wants beings to be happy and healthy as it is preached in Buddhism. We want people to live in this country,” he added.

One should remember that Hitler killed thousands and thousands of Jews by using poison gas. He therefore, questioned as to how one could call for a Hitler type of administration in Sri Lanka.

“Some claim that they meant that Buddhism in this county should be safeguarded when they called for a Hitler type of administration.

However, one cannot understand how Hitler’s policies and Buddhism could be associated,” he also said. (Yohan Perera)
