SL complains to ICC on air pollution during Delhi Test


	

Sri Lanka Cricket has officially filed a complaint with the International Cricket Council regarding the disturbing levels of pollution in Delhi after the conclusion of the third Test between India and Sri Lanka.

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara lodged the complaint on Tuesday itself saying "we can't play like this as four players had vomited" due to the pollution.

The ICC responded by saying that they would take necessary action; however, no action has been taken so far.

Despite India and Sri Lanka playing out a stalemate at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi, the Test had its fair share of controversies which kept fans gripped to the action on the field.

On the second day of play, the Sri Lankan players were seen donning masks on the field to cope with the pollution in the air. The play was even stopped which forced the Sri Lankan and Indian coach to come out onto the field and have a chat with the officials.

A few Sri Lankan players had to leave the field as well as they felt uneasy.

Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal went on to say that his side was not used to such conditions, which led to their struggle on the first two days.

The Lankans managed to save the match from a losing position while chasing 410 for victory. They ended their innings with 299 runs on the board for the loss of five wickets. Dhananjeya de Silva top scored for them with a scintillating century to his name.

However, India went on to win the three-match series 1-0.

The ICC is yet to respond to SLC's complaint and take some action.

The pollution in Delhi has affected a lot of people over the past few months and the match should have been shifted from there in the first place.

After the events which transpired in the final Test between India and Sri Lanka, the ICC might step in and drop Delhi as a venue during the winter due to the spike in pollution.(SportsKeeda)
