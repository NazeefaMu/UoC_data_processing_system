Sri Lanka has convinced the global community that it was not necessary to hold an international probe on war crimes alleged to have been committed by the armed forces personnel during the final phase of the humanitarian operation, Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana said yesterday.

He said the government however, would consider the participation of foreign judges or lawyers as observers in a domestic inquiry,

Foreign Affairs Minister Marapana PC, assumed duties at his office at the old Senate Building last morning amid religious observances by four main religions.

The minister who is also a former Attorney General and a Defence Minister said Sri Lanka's Constitution and its judicial system did not permit foreign judges for prosecution or inquiry and this has been accepted by the global community.

"There is no threat of an international inquiry on Sri Lanka anymore," he said. “We have told them that foreign judges or lawyers may attend any domestic probe as observers and this has happened in the past as well."

The minister said in a case was filed in the 1990s against former UNP MP Jayalath Jayawardana on a salary matter, he complained to the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva saying his parliamentary privileges had been violated. He said the IPU sent an Indian judge as an observer to the judicial inquiry held here and added that he had studied the Geneva Resolution on Sri Lanka, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and the US and said he had found no serious effect on the country.

"The UN has given Sri Lanka ample time to set up a domestic mechanism to address the issues that had been raised in the resolution and they are satisfied that we are dedicated and capable of meeting those objectives. They are watching us to ensure that we are moving in the right direction," he said

Responding to a question asked by Daily Mirror, the minister said ample time was necessary to set up a judicial mechanism for a domestic inquiry and in some countries it had taken 20 to 30 years to finalize a domestic inquiry on charges of violating the International Humanitarian Law, (IHL).

"What is more important is that the International Community and agencies are of the view that Sri Lankan government is safeguarding human rights and there is judicial freedom, media freedom, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Cabinet ministers are questioned by presidential commissions and therefore they are aware that Sri Lanka is on the right path,” the minister said.

When asked by a journalist about the alleged manhandling of a minor employee by Police Chief Pujitha Jayasundara, the minister said it was an ‘unfortunate incident’ that should not have happened.

“However, a departmental head has the right to question an employee but it was the manner of questioning that raised concerns. However, it is up to the relevant authorities like the Police Commission to conduct an inquiry on the issue and act appropriately,” the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
