Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today during his submission revealed that the Special group of Prison Department officers has found three mobile phones and five sim cards from the remand cell of Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena in the Colombo Remand Prison.

He said initially the prosecution had received information that Aloysius and Palisena are allegedly communicating with outsiders using mobile phones and based on that the Prison Department conducted a search on June 29, 2018 around 2 pm at the 'H' ward of the remand prison.

The Officials found one mobile phone kept between the pillows of Arjun Aloysius, said ASG Kodagoda.

However, President's Counsel Anil Silva who appeared on behalf of Aloysius denied the allegation and said those findings did not belong to his client nor he had used them to communicate with outsiders as there were 30 other remand prisoners in the cell.

Acceding the prosecution's request the Magistrate permitted the CID to obtain details relating to the Sim cards and the imei numbers of the mobile phones.

ASG Kodagoda also pointed out that these findings could lead to more revelations while it could also amount to an offence fell under Prison Ordinance. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
