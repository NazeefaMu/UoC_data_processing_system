There are more ways than the obvious one


	



 

Eastern provincial chief had recently received an urgent call from the Diyawanna opposition chief. 

 


The opposition chief had given this call to the provincial one to advise him to defer the presentation of the controversial Amendment pending some revisions the government proposes to make in a bid to win the support of more members. 


So the provincial chief who readily accepted the Diyawanna opposition chief’s advice had deferred the process leading to taking a vote on the Amendment. 


Meanwhile, the council members who read deeper into the advice given to the provincial chief were amazed at the ploy employed by the Diyawanna opposition chief to have the upcoming provincial polls postponed, they say.
