These images circulating in social media show a motorcyclist, who seems to have come up with an interesting idea, carrying the fuel tank of his motorcycle to the filling station somewhere in Colombo. The photographs were circulating while the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development issued a circular to all fuel stations in the country directing them to issue fuel only to vehicles and not to cans and bottles.
