That much-talked-about ‘wedding of the year’ has come and gone but many anecdotes related to this gala event keep popping up in political circles providing much humour and laughter, they say.

Turning to his bride smilingly, he addressed the photographer: “Do you know my friend, that you are taking pictures of the country’s first lady-in-waiting? So, you have to be at your best!”
