DPA, 24th APRIL, 2018 - The suspected gunman in a weekend shooting that left four people dead at a restaurant in the US state of Tennessee has been arrested, bringing an end to a manhunt that lasted a day and a half, police said Monday.   


Travis Reinking was found in a wooded area by Nashville police who were following up on a tip from a citizen. A semi-automatic weapon was found in his backpack, Lieutentant Carlos Lara told a news conference.   He did not try to resist and made no statement, Lara said.   


Nashville police spokesman Don Aaron told a news conference that Reinking requested a lawyer after arriving at police headquarters. He was taken to hospital to be evaluated. He faces four counts of criminal homicide, Aaron said.   


Reinking, 29, moved late last year from Illinois to the town south-east of Nashville near the restaurant where the shooting took place around 3:30 am Sunday (0730 GMT).
