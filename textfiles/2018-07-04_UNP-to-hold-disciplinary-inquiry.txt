UNP to hold disciplinary inquiry


	

The United National Party is to begin disciplinary proceedings against State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran today (4), Party Spokesman Harin Fernando announced yesterday.

Minister Fernando told Daily Mirror that they had asked Ms. Maheshwaran to appear before them today for an inquiry to be conducted into a statement attributed to her calling for the resurgence of the LTTE in the North.

Meanwhile, it was announced that State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran is to clarify her statement that had created a huge controversy in the country on Friday (6).

Minister Fernando told a news conference yesterday that Ms. Maheswaran will publicly clarify what she said in her statement at a media briefing to be held on Friday. “I have spoken to Ms. Maheshwaran who is in Jaffna at the moment and she had agreed to go before media and clarify her statement. According to what Ms. Maheshwaran told me it is clear that what the media has reported is not what she actually said. However I am not going to come out with any details now as I want to leave it to her to clarify her own statement,” he said.

Minister Fernando said the UNP rejects any statement which calls for the resurgence of the LTTE and will carry out a disciplinary inquiry against Ms. Maheshwaran. “We in the UNP do not want to see another Prabhakaran emerging in the North and neither do we want to see a Hitler coming out of the South,” he added.

Minister Fernando, who touched on the recent New York Times report, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should submit an affidavit if he had not obtained money from any Chinese Company. “It was revealed one year ago that the company that constructed the port and offered to get into a partnership with the Sri Lankan government had offered only Rs. 700 million, claiming that the cost of construction was the said amount. However, the former government claimed that it spent Rs 1.7 billion for the construction of the Port. One could see what the New York Times is talking about when looking at this situation,” he added.
