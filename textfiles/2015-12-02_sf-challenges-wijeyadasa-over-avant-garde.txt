	Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today challenged Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to reveal if he had any sort of connection with Avant Garde owner within the next 48 hours.
	Field Marshal Fonseka said he had a doubt that Minister Rajapakshe was having a special connection with the Avant Garde proprietor even though Minister Rajapakshe was acting like he had no such connection.
	“I ask Minister Rajapakshe to reveal if he had any sort of connection with Avant Garde proprietor. If he had one, what was the connection he was having. I have a doubt that he was having a special connection with Avant Garde proprietor. I ask him to respond to me if he was having any connection with him during the next 48 hours,” he said.
	Field Marshal Fonseka said Minister Rajapakshe had sent him a letter of demand for Rs. 500 million and that he was not afraid of it.
	“Minister Rajapakshe has sent me a letter of demand for Rs. 500 million. I think it is a gratitude for helping in numerous ways for them to enter Parliament. We contributed a lot for them to enter Parliament. This is a gift for that,” he said.
	Field Marshal Fonseka said no one was talking about the Avant Garde incident now and asked the authorities including the Attorney General and Justice Minister to take action against the company. (Ajith Siriwardana)
