Superior man and common man


	



The superior man thinks always of virtue; the common man thinks of comfort – Confucius

Three wheelers, no doubt have become much of a headache to motorists and pedestrians. The haphazard driving of three-wheelers often makes the others hope for a day that the government organizes alternative routes for these auto-rickshaws so that the other vehicles can travel on the roads peacefully. Despite the challenges that this small man’s transport system poses for motorists one often finds oneself flashing a smile on seeing the funny slogans written mostly on the back of the vehicles or sometimes on the side. These quite humorous mottoes and wisecracks make the usual “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Bob Marley” look of other three-wheelers, dull and colourless. The spelling mistakes only make the slogans sound spicier.   

A three-wheeler that stopped at the road crossing opposite the Faculty of Visual Arts in Horton Place on Tuesday morning displayed this sentence, “Do not underestimate the power of the common man” on the right side of its roof. Perhaps the owner would have thought of reminding the motorists not to underestimate his vehicle travelling among the sleek and shiny cars and jeeps. However those who are politically conscious may even read it as a warning to the government which does not get on well with the “common man” these days. With price hikes in essential items, slow development, conflicts between the executive and the legislature; surely there’s a long list grievances for the “common man”.   

However the interchangeable nature of the term ‘common man’ is such that it certainly makes one confused. For instance a VIP vehicle whizzes past breaking traffic rules turns even a doctor rushing for a surgery or a student rushing to sit the Advanced Level examination a “common man”. After all the VIP and his guards appear to be thinking that cutting the ribbon at a fancy event on time is the most important, decisive event of the day for the nation. Hence the need to break the rules and speed along lanes in a zigzag pattern paying scant regard to the “common man” in a car, van, bus, three-wheeler or bike. However if one is to go by the Chinese philosopher turned politician, Confucius, the moment the one inside the VIP vehicle thinks about his own convenience and comfort over the others he reduces to the level of “common man”. According to Confucius it’s the common man that thinks of the comfort always while the superior man thinks of virtues. Certainly by breaking traffic regulations and selfishly inconveniencing fellow citizens the VIP becomes disqualified to be a superior man however much he thinks he is. Even otherwise, given the rate of corruption and other self-serving strategies and the links with the underworld and other undesirable elements, the bulk of the politicians, irrespective of party lines, form the most disqualified for the title of a superior man. Comfort, convenience and self-centred calculation are certainly the words that best describe the modern day Sri Lankan politician.   

On the other hand by putting up with political dramas and inflation of the so called representatives of the people till the next general election and also practising the virtue of patience with VIP vehicles and by being large-hearted enough to pave the way for them to pass by without a problem, the “common man” has certainly turned himself to a superior man.   

With the war being a thing of the past it is however the hope of the “superior man” that the “common man” would put an end to the practice of running around the country, especially in the South, with their backups flouting road rules and looking for preferential treatment on the road over the rest of the countrymen.
