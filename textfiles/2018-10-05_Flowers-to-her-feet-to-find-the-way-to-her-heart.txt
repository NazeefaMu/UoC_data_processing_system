A female high-up who got her political appointment to Sabaragamuwa recently had occasion to take a brief walk to a public place while she was on an official tour in the area.

 


As she got down from her vehicle, she saw little girls carrying trays of flowers, lining either side of the road and imagine her pleasant surprise when they started sprinkling every step of her way with flowers.


A provincial politico who wanted to warm his way into the graces of the lady had organized this unique reception to her, they say.
