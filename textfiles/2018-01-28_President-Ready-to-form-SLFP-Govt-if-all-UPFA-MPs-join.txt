President Maithripala Sirisena said that he was willing to establish a government led by Sri Lanka Freedom Party, if all 96 United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentarians joined hands with him.

“I am ready to create an SLFP-led Government if the 96 UPFA members were ready to stand with me,” the President said speaking at an election rally in Ratnapura yesterday.

Meanwhile, the President said the Gazette notification would be issued next week to appoint a Presidential Commission to investigate frauds that had taken place in the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka airlines.
