A raffle that baffles everyone!
	

A certain chief purohita has launched a lottery purportedly to raise funds for a good cause beneficial to the entire province. School teachers, children and employees in government offices in the province are asked to buy the tickets of this lottery, they say.

Meanwhile, there is a growing suspicion among the people that the monies raised from lottery ticket sales are being channeled to an election fund and a media group looking into the whys and wherefores of this lottery project has drawn angry threats from the provincial authority,
they say.
By the way, some teachers and school children who have been asked to sell the lottery tickets are planning to make representations to the Number One in yahapalanaya about the unpleasant job foisted on them. And they also say that responsible authorities functioning in a city hallowed by the presence of sacred Sri Dalada should think twice before launching dubious projects like this lottery.

A victim of an act of revenge
	

A former top cop who headed an elite force had to spend a few days in the state-run lodge at Welikada.

The indignity this cop had to suffer had come as a surprise to many people in high places who had a high opinion about his integrity. And some of them had asked him how come he had to suffer this fate.
The cop pressed by well-wishers, had confided in some of them a sensational revelation about the persons behind the move to send him to the Welikada lodge. I had to take disciplinary action against him for leaking highly sensitive informations to some foreign diplomatic missions. I had to go on retirement in due course. But our friend is occupying an important chair today. Thats how you find me in this tangle!
The cops revelation has reached the highest echelons in yahapalanaya and a head is likely to roll if a proper inquiry is held, they say.

AG re-indicts Basil
	
The Attorney General, in the Colombo High Court, today re-indicted former minister Basil Rajapaksa and Divineguma Departments former director general Kithsiri Ranawaka on charges of misappropriating Rs.29 million belonging to the Divineguma.
The indictments originally filed in Court on Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Ranawaka were yesterday withdrawn by the AG on the basis that it had contained some technical errors which needed to be rectified.
The money had been reportedly used to print and distribute almanacs with the photographs of then presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In the wake of the withdrawal of the indictments Colombo High Court Judge Pathmini N. Ranawaka yesterday discharged Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Ranawake from the case filed against them.
The prosecuting counsel said the indictments had been originally served without the AGs consent letter. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

An epilogue to a  tragi-comic story!
	

How a bigwig in uniform drew attention on his department and on himself when he assured a high political authority that he would not allow the arrest of a certain bad guy is now public knowledge.

The uniformed bigwig gave this assurance over the phone in response to a call he received at an event of historical significance to his department held in the city of gems. And the general opinion is this fact  the significance of the occasion - adds gravity to the indiscretion committed by him.
Funny enough, our man was unaware that the media microphones set nearby could pick up whatever he said over his mobile!
There is another piece of news relevant to this story which adds insult to the injury already caused by this bigwig: It was the bad guy in question who hosted the bigwig to a sumptuous lunch when the latter participated in a celebration held in down south to mark the same historical event!
The bigwig who had attended this celebration as the chief guest had addressed the gathering from a podium erected near a bridge, which led to a road closure to much inconvenience to the road users, they say.

Ball is in their court now!
	

The former strongman made yet another visit to the land of the dragon recently.

Meanwhile, the Number One here dropped a bombshell saying that a hefty loan running into several billions for the Nilwala project received from dragons on the eve of last big poll had vanished into thin air!
Soon after this sensational announcement by the Number One here, the former strongman, who was still a guest of the dragons received a stream of calls inquiring what had really happened to the big money. Some had asked him whether the money had got dissolved in Nilwala waters.
The former strongman had asked all these agitated callers to direct their inquiries to two senior purohitas in yahapalanaya who, he said, were responsible for handling the hefty loan at the time it was received: one of them was the roly-poly one from Badulla who was in charge of the irrigation subject and the other one of Appochchi Mala fame from Moneragala.

Christmas tree at Galle face, a waste of money: Cardinal
	
The construction of a Christmas tree on Galle face is a sheer waste of money, and those responsible for this work should be asked to use the funds to construct houses for poor people or provide scholarships to poor children, said the president of the Bishops' Conference -- Colombo Archbishop, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, yesterday.
He said that though the money was said to have been given by a ministry, the ministry concerned had not been identified. The cardinal made these observations during a media briefing at the Archbishop's house.
He said the market economy was selling Christmas and making religion a tool. "The late Rev Fr. Marceline Jayakody propagated the idea that, 'My Christmas is the day the poor have a meal of rice.' We too hold this view and we can really enjoy Christmas only when the poor join in," he said.
This year the theme of Christmas is 'The Family'. There is a distinct breakdown in family relationships. This is evident in migratory families, and the Bishops' Conference is planning to bring this to the notice of the government.
"A wife on her return after working abroad finds that her husband has left her and remarried. The family is broken up. The children have become destitute. These women frequently become victims of crime.
"The idea of a small family and abortion are leading people on the wrong path. Therefore we have taken a decision to organise consultancy services to protect these families," he said.
The chairman of the Mass Media Commission of the Catholic Church, Bishop Raymond Wickramasinghe, and deputy chairman Bishop Emmanuel Fernando were also present at the media briefing. (Vineetha M. Gamage)

## Title: Elitism in Sri Lanka,  is it a scourge or a blessing
## Section: News Features

Elitism in Sri Lanka,  is it a scourge or a blessing
	
Soon after Independence, Ceylonese society, as it was structured then, was exclusively governed by an elite that was consummately skilled and able in furthering its own agenda, its own interests, both social and economic, and safeguarding the privileges that were granted to them by the departing British Raj. An elite whose education was either in Oxford and Cambridge or Colombo schools, whose virtual first language was English, whose commuting was done in luxury cars, in other words, a class of people who were absolutely divorced from the common man in the country was charged with managing the socio-economic, cultural development of the nation. This elite clique was not limited to the leading community at the time, Sinhalese; it was the same for Tamils as well as Muslims and Burghers. As Kumari Jayewardene wrote in her celebrated exposition of Sri Lankas rise of Mercantilism and the elites in the twentieth century, Nobodies to Somebodies: Members of another group of Sri Lankans, who were to form an important part of the emergent 19th century bourgeoisie, were landowners, whose holdings provided them with a means of accumulation and later, a basis for expanded growth in the plantation era. Just as the monopolistic policies of the Dutch and the British had located a stratum of officials in the cinnamon industry and endowed them with a basis for growth, their administrative policies also created a group of Sri Lankan officials, called Mudaliyars. Peebles (1973:1) has defined them as an economic and social status group mediating between the alien rulers and the bulk of the indigenous population performing functions that the foreign rulers were unable or unwilling to perform.

This elite group, that rose to real influence behind political power, along with the growth of capitalism of the local flavour, in character was snobbish and conceited but in substance and capacity, quite rich and equipped. However, Jayewardenes book did not go past the Independence of Ceylon and as a result, unless she is engaged in writing another mini-masterpiece on the transformation of elitism from one class to another class, we are bereft of a close and erudite analysis of Sri Lankas socio-economic-cultural evolution as a social democracy in the latter half of the twentieth century. Despite, this transformation-not in real substance and fundamental mindset-the modern twenty first century-elitism in Sri Lanka does not seem to have changed at all in the context of weight and influence behind the politicians who govern the country. 
Outside the corridors of power, this elitism does not seem to exist. The primary language this new elite communicates in is Sinhalese or Tamil. English is spoken only in the corporate world where the top layer of leaders are drawn from those elitist secondary schools such as Royal, S. Thomas and Trinity College. But thanks mainly to the survival of the Ceylon Civil Service, at least up to 1972, a few brightest of the bright village educated lads managed to get into this elite administrative system and shine among the Colombo or overseas-educated, elite, civil servants. But that was just a handful or even less. 
What is Sri Lankas elite To find an answer to that question, one would have to look at all layers of our society, their individual thought process and mindsets, their social intercourse, their capacity for spending money, their real lifestyles, their immediate associates and friends and their historical lineage. Elite is defined in most dictionaries as a group of persons exercising the major share of authority or influence within a larger group. In the narrow context of that definition, Sri Lankas current elite could be loosely categorized as those who are close to political powers and drawing every possible ounce of benefit from their association with the powers that be. However, one stark contrast between the Ceylon Civil Service of yesteryear and the current Sri Lanka Administrative Service is esteem in which the old Civil Service was held, it is deservedly so, and the contempt and scorn the current one receives. 
Nevertheless, the non-political elite of this country, especially in the urban sector, even though their dealings, business and social communication are mostly conducted in the vernacular, their spending and influencing capacities have reached levels that are far out of reach even for the average wealthy person. The current occupiers of the upper echelons of this elite are wealthy beyond any imagination. Their riches are phenomenal and the way its displayed on the functions such as weddings, receptions and other social events is obscene. With an uncontrolled spiralling down of spending capacities, in real value terms, of the have-nots, the dominance of these elites gets exaggerated and their perceived appearance assumes even a paler shade of gloom in the face of the common masses. 
The tragedy of the decline of the traditional elite that existed prior to the nineteen seventies is felt, not only in the mass perception of the nations psyche, it is even more evident in the cruelty with which the masses are disregarded in the most callous way, less by the politicians and more by their henchmen and cohorts. What was played out, one would argue, as a bizarre drama especially during the last days of the Rajapaksa regime was merely a microcosm of that deep issue which was sheltered by a veneer of patriotism. When this new elite which consisted of the new-money class, wrapped themselves in a patriotic flag, they became the voices not only of the regime, but they pretended to be the real vanguard of a national requisite. 
The profiles and social outlook of the elites of the security forces, Army, Navy and Air Force, were diluted below the minimum level required to be at an elite-contention. Their subservience to the henchmen and cohorts of a ruling family or clan went beyond mere loyalty to the government in power. The traditional elites in the provinces and other district capitals lost their clouts and were replaced by thugs, drug-dealers and illicit brewers with money and muscle. This gradual but sure evaporation of the traditional elites, in the center and the regions, and their replacement by the new-rich provincial Mafioso had its rapid results in the socio-cultural ethos in the country. 
Elites in Sri Lanka today are, to reverse-paraphrase what Pieter Keuneman in Parliament referred to the famous C Sunderalingam, more of a target of anger rather than an object of pity. In the overall scheme of matters, elite politics, elite business, elite sports, elite social life, elite bureaucracy, elite security forces all come down to one glaring reality. That reality is physical closeness to the powers that be. That closeness consists in, for example, to be seen with the political leaders of the day, to be visible in the same arena where the big political boys play, to be talked about in the same sentence with powerful leaders. 
The traditional Sri Lankan elite which was the monopoly of the leading civil servants, commanders of the forces and leading businessmen of the day has evaporated into thin air. The English-speaking educated in the leading Colombo schools first and then in Oxbridge overseas, played a vital role in shaping the destinies of the nation yesteryear. Whatever their follies, their political philosophies, their financial dealings, they still played the game by its rules. They sometimes behaved in the maddest fashion, yet there was a method in their madness. That order, that discipline and that adherence to the rules of the game had their inherent advantages, for when they were proven wrong and short in judgment and execution of matters of the state, business and security etc. they accepted the rules of the game; when they were defeated, they left the arena with their heads severely bruised but held high. To that galaxy of elite belonged D S Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Sir John Kotalawala, J R Jayewardene, S W R D Bandaranaike, N M Perera, Peter Keuneman, Phillip Gunawardene,Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, S J V Chelvanayagam and Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake and Anura Bandaranaike, Lakshman Kadirgamar, of latter decades along with Sir Oliver Goonatilleke, Raju Coomaraswamy, Bradman Weerakoon, Shirley Amarasinghe, Dr. Wickrema Weerasooriya and Jayantha Dhanapala and an innumerable number of civil servants and force-commanders and businessmen. The cultural elite that could boast about Ediriweera Sarathchandra, Mahagama Sekera, Lester James Peries, Joe Abeywickrama, Gamini Fonseka, Punya Heendeniya and the rest of those cultural giants cannot be replaced by those who sang eulogies to modern kings. That elite was a blessing to the advancement of our society as a cohesive nation. They did not sacrifice their personal integrity nor did they surrender their professional uprightness for the sake of currying favor with the powers that be. 
The elites of today have stripped themselves of that yesteryear-decency; they are an elite that is trapped in their own cocoon of avarice; they are a bunch of henchmen and hench-women whose DNA has been identified as severely spoiled and unique in character in that its holders are prone to multiplying disproportionately to its original approximations. They find themselves in an unfamiliar arena where,in the past, champions played and excelled. They are a scourge to our society and the sooner we realize it, the better for the country.

## Title: Growth outlook for emerging Asia still relatively strong

Growth outlook for emerging Asia still relatively strong
	
Economic activity in the Asia-Pacific region will broadly hold up well, even as many emerging-market Asia (EM Asia) countries are severely hit by persistently sluggish world trade due to their relative openness, Fitch Ratings says.
The outlook for EM Asia sovereign ratings in 2017 is stable but potential vulnerabilities include increased protectionism, a stronger US dollar and higher political risk across both advanced and emerging economies. Nine of the 11 Fitch-rated EM Asia sovereigns carry a stable outlook as we near year-end.
The median of Fitchs real gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts in 2017 for the 11 EM Asia countries it rates is 5.5 percent, substantially higher than in other regions (3.5 percent for EM Middle East and Africa, 2.9 percent for EM Latin America and 2.8 percent for EM Europe). Without China, which makes up 69 percent of the regions GDP, the weighted average growth is expected to be 6.3 percent in 2017 and 6.4 percent in 2018, from 5.9 percent in 2016. All EM Asia entities, except Mongolia, are expected to grow faster than the medians of their rating categories.
Global trade in 2017 will present limited upside for EM Asia and a long-term growth impetus presented by the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact now seems off the table after President-elect Donald Trump said the US will pull out of the agreement. Some Asian countries, like Vietnam, were expected to gain substantially from the TPP. It is unclear to what extent regional alternatives, such as the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, can make up for this loss.
Domestic sources of growth include an infrastructure boost and the implementation of ambitious reform agendas in some Asian economies, such as India and Indonesia. Room for monetary and fiscal policy easing differs from country to country. Limited room seems to exist in EM Asia for a policy rebalancing from monetary to fiscal stimulus similar to what Fitch expects in advanced economies. Among EM Asia entities, Fitch expects a widening of the fiscal balance in 2017 only in the Philippines (to -3.0 percent of GDP in 2017 from -2.4 percent of GDP in 2016). Public debt levels are high in some countries, such as India, and credible fiscal policy rules prohibit further fiscal stimulus in Indonesia.
A strong US dollar in 2017, which Fitch anticipates, amid signs of the Feds intentions to raise rates, and increased public spending in the US, could weigh on economies with large external refinancing needs and/or those that rely heavily on foreign-currency-denominated debt. A strong dollar has already weakened the external-debt dynamics of Mongolia and Sri Lanka - exacerbated by low commodity prices, in Mongolias case - and the combination of this and severe fiscal slippage prompted Fitch to downgrade both sovereigns in 2016.
EM Asia countries are relatively exposed to a severe China slowdown scenario, though that is not Fitchs base case. Vulnerabilities are building up further in China, as policy settings continue to prioritise rapid growth over macroeconomic stability and debt levels across the economy continue to rise, at least until 2018. But Fitch believes China still has the administrative and financial resources to address these imbalances without a disorderly adjustment, even though its capacity to do so diminishes with time if not addressed.

Halt to World's Tallest Christmas Tree
	
The ongoing construction of the worlds tallest artificial Christmas Tree at the Galle Face Green had been halted today, the convener of the Prime Mover Driver's Union attached to the Ports Authority and Social Welfare Committee Mangala. P. Gunasekera said.
He told a news conference at the Ports Authority that the construction of the worlds tallest Christmas Tree was halted following a request by the Colombo Archbishop, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, yesterday.
The Cardinal said the construction of a Christmas Tree on Galle Face was a sheer waste of money, and those responsible for this work should be asked to use the funds to construct houses for poor people or provide scholarships to poor children.
The Ports Authority has no connection with the construction of the Christmas Tree and it has not funded for the construction, Mr. Gunasekera said.
The construction of the 315 feet Christmas Tree was started three months before with the intention of making a Guinness World Record.
The estimated cost for the Christmas Tree was Rs.12 million and about Rs.6 million had already been spent for the construction.
All the funds had been received as material donations from private companies, Mr. Gunasekera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

He dealt equally with people of all walks of life
	
It is 10 years since the passing away of Justice Ramanathan. I remember the first day I met him, thirty eight years ago, as if it was yesterday. It was at the residence of my dear friend, Tony Fernando. I was just a law student. Tonys father was a District Judge and Mr. Ramanathan was High Court Judge - Matara. I was introduced to Justice Ramanathan by Tonys late father, as a law student. That great gentleman immediately put me at ease and spoke to me as if he had known me for many years. My admiration for him grew ever since. I found in him a great source of inspiration, as did many others who had the good fortune of associating with him closely. I am reminded of the words of Professor G L Pieris, when he spoke at the six months remembrance of the Late Justice Ramanathan - when he said, he was one of those people who felt genuinely at home and comfortable with people of all walks of life. 
Justice G P S de Silva, former Chief Justice, an equally admirable gentleman, was a close friend of Justice Ramanathan. He was Additional Solicitor General, head of the Criminal Division of the Attorney Generals Department, when he summoned me one day and said, I am sending you for the next session, to prosecute before Rama. Make the maximum out of this opportunity and learn. What I learnt before Justice Ramanathan, was not just the law. The manner in which he conducted himself on the bench, endeared him to counsel as well as litigants. No one left a court presided over by him with the sour feeling that he did not get a fair hearing. Justice Ramanathan was courteous. Never did he use a harsh word on anyone who came before a court presided over by him. He patiently listened to a submission made by the most junior counsel, as he did when a senior Queens Counsel made submissions before him. I often felt, judging by our mortal standards, he was a person of limitless compassion
and patience. 
He was stern and firm as expected of a judicial officer. None could read his mind when making submissions. All that one was assured of, was a just Order. Yes, he did it his way. 
Deshamanya P Ramanathan was a descendent of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan. He was educated at St Josephs College - Colombo, was a Barrister-at-law, and a Bencher of Grays Inn. During his distinguished and multifaceted career, he served as a State Counsel, a High Court Judge, a Judge and also the President of the Court of Appeal, a Judge of the Supreme Court, member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, Governor of the Western Province, Chancellor of the Uva Wellassa University, and Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. 
Outside his official activities, the late Justice Ramanathan, was an active member of the Medico Legal Society of Sri Lanka, and once served as its President. He was a past president of the British Scholars Association and of the Rotary Club. He was well known for his participation in the activities of the Kennel Club where his Dachshunds won awards at many competitions. 
He was a man blessed with many virtues. He carried them with unimaginable grace and humility. He was a genuine friend on whom one could rely. Many junior members of the legal profession looked up to him for guidance. They saw in him a reliable friend. 
One of the most notable features I observed in the late Justice Ramanathans character is his sensitivity to problems of others. He was sensitive to problems of those who worked under him, in a way any person could rarely be. On numerous occasions I had seen, members of the staff and even helpless juniors come to him with their problems and difficulties, and thereafter, Justice Ramanathan responded as if it was his own problem. He was indeed a great man. 
A beautiful verse, the author of which I am unaware, but quite often quoted by my good friend Kumar Arulanandam, reads as follows: 
The world is full of froth and bubble - but two things stand as stone; Kindness in others troubles - and courage in your own 
In the late Justice Ramanathan, I saw this quality in abundance. 
Though, I had associated with Justice Ramanathan quite closely, I did not have the opportunity of meeting Mrs Mano Ramanathan until a few years ago. However, her late Father Mr Subbiah Saravanamuttu, was an advocate of high repute, with an extensive practice who used to appear before the High Court of Batticaloa, when I was prosecuting there. I still remember when I was introduced to Mrs Ramanathan her spontaneous response was, Oh! So you are this Palitha Fernando, of whom Rama used to speak quite often. I could think of no better honour or compliment! 
The Late Justice Ramanathan has been described as a good judge, a fine prosecutor, a jurist of very high calibre, and those are but a few of the accolades achieved by him during his career spanning over 40 years. But to me, without fear of contradiction or accusation of adulation, I can safely say, that above all, he was one of the finest human beings I have ever met. 
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Moksha!

There is a card that every citizen above the age of 18 in the country should possess. Plans are afoot now to issue an electronic card in place of the card now in use.

Tenders were called and the head of the department responsible for carrying out this task awarded the contract to produce some 15 million e-cards to the lowest bidder, a reliable one to boot.
Meanwhile, an elderly gent who introduced himself as the advisor to a prominent purohita  not the purohita in charge of the subject  told the departmental head to follow the instructions of his purohita in regard to the production of e-cards.
The departmental head had put his foot down and told the elderly advisor that he was not prepared to take instructions from his purohita and he would strictly adhere to the correct procedure in carrying out his responsibility.
The interfering purohita had turned livid with anger when he heard the curt reply given by the departmental head. And he had taken immediate action to transfer the disobedient departmental head to the pool as punishment, they say.

December 1, 2016 saw the best of the life insurance industry gathered at Eagle Ballroom, Waters Edge to celebrate the successful completion of the Life Insurance Awareness Month campaign (held in September 2016) and to recognize and reward the top performers of the programme.
Presiding over the award ceremony as the chief guest was Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa with IBSL Director General Damayanthi Fernando as the guest of honour.

In his welcome address, Pereira stated that he was pleased to note that the insurance industry in Sri Lanka continues to grow. Pereira also stated that he was delighted with the results of the Life Insurance Awareness Month campaign. However, he cautioned the gathering that the insurance industry of Sri Lanka still had a long way to go in order to be prepared to face the challenges of the future.
Sugathadasa graciously acknowledged the hard work of the top 100 performers and commented that the award ceremony would serve as motivation to the other members of the industry. The sales force is the thread binding insurers and the insured, she stated, emphasizing the need for further development in the life insurance sales sector.
Fernando congratulated the life insurance sales advisors for their performance throughout the campaign. She also went on to thank the MSF for their hard work and dedication towards ensuring the success of the campaign and the award ceremony.
Hemachandra proudly announced that nearly 60,000 life insurance policies had been secured during the month of September. He went on to state that it was vital that an insurance sales advisor maintains a strong relationship with his/her respective customers.
At the final prize distribution session, A.G.P. Kumari of AIA Insurance walked away with the top prize in both the highest number of policies sold and premium collected during the campaign period categories. The leading companies that produced the highest number of winners in both categories were Ceylinco Life with 41 awards, Union Assurance PLC with 36 and AIA Insurance Lanka with a total of 19 prizes.

The joint opposition today lodged a complaint against Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale at the Bribery Commission over a case of financial misappropriation causing the State loss of Rs. 1,500 million.
Addressing a media briefing, the joint opposition MP Niroshan Premaratne said Minister Atukorale had caused the State a loss of Rs. 1500 million by the mandatory insurance scheme of Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) for all Sri Lankan migrant workers since August 2015.
The SLBFE has announced all Sri Lankan migrant workers to get the insurance from the Gulf Insurance and Reinsurance Company in Kuwait by paying USD 100 each. The Supreme Court has ordered the SLBFE to refrain from choosing a selected company to provide the insurance, he added.
He said the SLBFE had ignored the Supreme Courts order and had arrived to an agreement with the Gulf Insurance and Reinsurance Company despite two other companies were given quotations for USD 60 each to provide the same insurance with more facilities.
He said the Minister Atukorale was involved in this financial misappropriation by gaining excess of peoples money worth USD 40 (Rs. 6,000) from each Sri Lankan migrant worker.
There are nearly 263,307 of Sri Lankan migrant workers who have obtained the insurance during the period from August 2015 to December 2016. Therefore the total of Rs. 1,417, 842, 000 (nearly Rs. 1,500 million) of excess amount has been taken by the SLBFE from these innocent people, he added.
He said this insurance scheme has been cancelled by Minister Atukorale on December 1 with the enquiry made by him in Parliament about this financial misappropriation on November 30.
Minister Atukorale has tried to prove her innocence by denying my allegations. But her guilt was proved with the immediate cancellation of the insurance scheme. We have lodged a complaint against the SLBFE Chairman along with Minister Atukorale he added.
Meanwhile, the joint opposition today onwards launched a website named www.yahapalanatop10.com to make people aware of the financial misappropriations which took place during the Yahapalana regime. The people were also enabled to make their complaints against them through info@yahapalana.com. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Lankan packaging industry expects govt. support to become a direct exporter
	
By Chandeepa Wettasinghe
Fresh from an injection of foreign expertise, the Sri Lankan packaging industry is hoping to receive government support on further knowledge transfers as well as capital expenditure to become a major direct exporter of packaging material, the Lanka Corrugated Carton Manufacturers Association (LCCMA) said.
Were currently producing 12,000-14,000 tonnes of packaging a month, mainly for the local market. Direct exports make up around one percent. Going forward, we will be focusing on direct exports. We will be using Sri Lankas strategic position to target Africa and South Asia, LCCMA President Kumudu Warnakulasooriya said.
The industry is currently a major indirect exporter and Export Development Board (EDB) Chairman Indira Malwatte has advised that all support be extended to the industry to become a direct exporter.
The recent expert was brought here by the EDB after we requested expertise. So we would like the government to continue to help us with bringing in experts, LCCMA Past President Mohamed Riyaz added.
The seven companies that form the LCCMA were recently trained by Jan van der Plas, a Dutch expert attached to the Netherlands governments management training programme PUM Netherlands, who left the island last week.
He (van der Plas) taught us a lot about improving standards to European levels, minimizing wastage and improving productivity, Warnakulasooriya added.
He said that van der Plas had advised them to transition towards more automated practices, for which the LCCMA is hoping the government would support with subsidies.
We are semi-automated and fairly labour intensive but the labour costs are going up. Because of the conflict in the past we couldnt invest. So we may have to import labour or we need to go for more automation, Warnakulasooriya added.
This is the second time that the LCCMA has been provided foreign expertise through support from the EDB.
Warnakulasooriya noted that the LCCMA members had seen a significant increase in quality following training by the first expert, who had also invited employees of some companies to visit Europe for training and stressed that Sri Lankas packaging quality has become higher than any regional competitor.
Our packaging standards are near the European Union (EU) and US FDA standards, which we are trying to reach. Were moving towards sustainable products. We are hoping to make Sri Lanka into a packaging hub that everyone in the region can come to, for any kind of packaging, in the future, he further stated.
Riyaz added that many overseas investors are also starting to notice Sri Lanka has a possible hub for the region.
He said that the Sri Lankan packaging industry is trying to position itself as a total solution provider instead of acceding to all the requests made by their clients.
The client may say he wants a certain type of packaging, which may not be good for their product, if it is to be frozen. Theres also something wrong if theyre asking for the same packaging that weighs 10 kilogrammes they used 10 years ago now, when theres lighter and stronger material available, he said.

No changes to Rs. 25,000 fine for seven traffic offenses: Rajitha
	
The Cabinet spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne today reiterated that there would be no changes on the proposed fine of Rs.25,000 for seven traffic offenses.
While speaking to the media at the weekly Cabinet press briefing at the parliament complex, Minister Senaratne said even the governments decision was also the same and there would not be any rollback of the proposed fine.
We will never give permission for drivers to kill people. Since the date the decision was taken there is a slight decrement of road accidents. I think the accidents would be less if the law was implemented, he added.
The proposals were made to take legal actions for overtaking from the left side, speeding and to place speed limits. First of all, decisions should be taken on implementing the legal situation of overtaking from the left side and speeding, he said.
He said the President had not said anything on changes to proposed the imposed fine of Rs.25,000 for seven traffic offenses during the discussion with the Bus Owners Associations held at the parliament complex on Saturday (3).
He said it was fair to impose a reasonable fine for overtaking from the left side and speeding but there would be no relief for the other five offenses. He had also requested the government to take legal actions strictly against persons who damaged the Sri Lanka Transport Buses (SLTB) during the private bus strike.
128 SLTB buses were damaged during the strike and the police should have arrested 128 people who were held responsible for them. But the police could not arrest that much of people. The police have no connection with the people in those areas. In that case there is no use of the police, he said.
He said most of the bus strikers were the ones who had worked according to a certain political agenda and added that most of the members of the bus associations were used to take part in poster campaigns during the previous elections under their names. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne today said who ever spoke to IGP Pujitha Jayasunadara during the press conference in Ratnapura on November 30 was not to influence him to arrest or not to arrest any individual but only to know about the position of the said case.
Responding to a barrage of questions from journalists at the weekly Cabinet news briefing in Parliament, Minister Senaratne said no one could suggest that the so-called Sir was in a move to influence Mr. Jayasundara to do something or not to do it.
If you closely go through what transpired during the conversation, it was very clear that Mr. Jayasundara was explaining to the Sir about an ongoing inquiry against a Nilame. He did not say whether he was to arrest or not. The Sir also did not apparently asked Mr. Jayasundara to take action to arrest the Nilame or not. I think, the media blew this incident out of proportion and it became a big topic in the media and in political circle, Minister Senaratne stressed.
However, when asked by a journalist whether it could be Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister Senaratne said 'it could be'. (Sandun A.Jayasekera)

The government bigwig asked the top ten list author why they were making baseless allegations against them. The JO stalwart replied that they would not level a corruption charge against anyone without a reason. Thereupon, the government bigwig reassured the JO man that he would not go outside the book in carrying out the functions related to his subject.
The Top Ten List author had replied: Whether you like it or not, you have to follow the book and we will see to that youdo so
Thereafter, the top ten in the government had put their thick heads to work out a plan to turn tables on the top ten list author, they say.

Speculation is rife in political circles these days that three politicos who made their way to Diyawanna through the Betel leaf list are about to step down to make way for three other newcomers.

One of the outgoing trio is reportedly a minority community leader holding State purohita status and he has been offered a gubernatorial office.
The other two are a young politico referred to as Tilake and a Northerner respectively.
By the way, there is a big surprise in store for all: A powerful character of the previous regime, who had a big say in defence matters is tipped to be one of the incoming lucky trio! However, he is yet to be sounded on the windfall in the offing. A youth leader hailing from Wayamba is expected to be another lucky one. A name closely linked to the Left is mentioned as the most likely third lucky one.
Meanwhile, the highly dejected Green party backbenchers are said to be getting invitations to one tamasha after another these days. This is said to be one way of consoling them.

A high seat of learning in the city recently decided to bring out a publication containing the profiles of its alumni who had brought honour to it by becoming members of the Diyawanna council.

Later the head of this high seat of learning had sent a written request to the Diyawanna authorities to provide them with a list of Diyawanna members, who had passed out as graduates from this institution.
On receipt of the list of graduates sent by the Diyawanna authorities, the institutions counterparts had carefully gone through the list and had grown suspicious about two names in the list. On double-checking the two names, they could rule out the possibility of the two Diyawanna members in question having ever stepped into the institutions building complex even by accident seeking shelter from a downpour!
One of these imposters is now a State purohita hailing from Wayamba. A former top team member, he had contested at the last general poll on the Betel leaf list.
The other imposter, a Green party new comer to Diyawanna hails from the main city in the South. By the way, this member got a reprimand from the party hierarchy quite recently for going on a foreign jaunt without the permission from the party.
Discreet inquiries have now begun to find out how the names of these two members found their way into the alumni list of the prestigious high seat of learning in the city.

Unnecessary fear is created on trade agreements: President
	
Unnecessary fear is being created by interested persons on the trade agreements which Sri Lanka is planning to sign in the future, President Maithripala Sirisena told Parliament today.
Speaker during the committee stage of the budget the President said trade agreements would be signed only after disadvantageous clauses are taken away." All the trade agreements which the country intends signing will be presented to Parliament" the President said.
We are saddened by the false statements made by some on the trade agreements including the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA)" the President added.
He said the situation is the same with military and on the national security.
Especially false statements are being made on the Constitutional reforms even before a draft is compiled" he said.
The President who commented on yesterday's debate said it was disappointing to see MPs criticising about the way the government is dealing with the military, security and the sovereignty of the nation without coming up with alternative suggestions.
He stressed the support of the entire Parliament is essential for the country when it comes to facing internal and external challenges which the country is facing. (Yohan Perera)

Vallibel Finance 2Q, first half profit up despite rising interest costs and slowing leases
	
Vallibel Finance PLC, Dhammika Perera-controlled licensed finance company, made a net profit of Rs.192.9 million or 18.57 a share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (2Q17) recording a 69 percent growth over the same period last year despite rising interest rates posing challenges for growth for the firm, the interim results showed.
Vallibel Finances net interest income grew by 18.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.484.7 million for the quarter amid faster rise in interest expenses over the interest income providing indications that the rising interest rates have weighed on the companys revenues and interest margins.
The interest income for the period rose by 38.3 percent YoY to Rs.1.1 billion, while the interest expenses rose by a faster 60.2 percent YoY to 594.8 million.
Meanwhile, the company has given loans and leases of Rs.3.2 billion during the six months to September 30, 2016, recording an increase of 17.2 percent from the beginning of the financial year.
Now the company has a total loans and leases portfolio of Rs.21.7 billion. The bulk of the leasing portfolio of the company consists of vehicles leasing  mostly two-wheelers and three-wheelers.
Now that the lower loan-to-value ratios are expected to come into play from next year onwards, the market is expected to become further toughened for the finance companies in growing their asset books.
The higher interest rates and lower disposable incomes will also weaken the demand for new loans and leases while the pressure could also fall in to the existing loan book in terms of higher non-performing loans.
According to a statement by the company, the gross non-performing loan ratio has clocked in at 3.49 percent.
Vallibel Finance has an asset base of Rs.25.6 billion after recording an increase of 12.6 percent increase during the six months.
The customer deposits grew by 12.8 percent or Rs.1.9 billion during the period to a total deposit base of Rs.16.7 billion.
However, the borrowings had risen by almost 37 percent to Rs.3.1 billion as the deposits were insufficient to fund the growth in loans and leases.
Despite the mounting pressure on the top line and the margins, the company recorded a return on asset of 3.01 percent, increasing from 2.40 percent from a year ago while the return on equity rose to 35.81 percent from 27.94 percent a year ago.
Meanwhile, for the six months ended September 30, 2016, the company posted a net profit of Rs.323.5 million or Rs.15.57 a share, an increase of 53.9 percent from a year ago.
The net interest income rose by 19.2 percent YoY to Rs.936.4 million.
As of September 30, 2016, billionaire businessman Dhammika Perera along with his investment company held a 76.141 percent stake in Vallibel Finance.
