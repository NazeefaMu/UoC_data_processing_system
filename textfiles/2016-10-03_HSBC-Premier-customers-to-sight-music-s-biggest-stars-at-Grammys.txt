As music’s biggest night comes around in February 2017, HSBC Premier together with Mastercard has partnered to give HSBC Premier customers an exclusive and unforgettable experience at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.


Two lucky Premier customers and their companions selected via a grand draw will get to celebrate the biggest night of their lives, with a walk down the red carpet alongside the most sought after celebrities in the international music industry. 


They will each receive complimentary business class air fare, hotel accommodation, show tickets and a complete makeover to dazzle with the stars in LA, all made possible by Mastercard - ‘Priceless Surprises’.


In order to qualify for the draw, Premier cardholders must meet the minimum spend criteria of Rs. 600,000 during the promotion period from 1 October to 31 December 2016. Every additional spend of rupees 100,000 will entitle them to an extra chance at the draw. That’s not all, all existing customers may also increase their chances by referring a friend to HSBC Premier, through the existing ‘Member Get Member’ programme. 


Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Nilantha Bastian stated, “We are delighted to offer yet another ‘Priceless’ experience to Premier customers, this time to be part of music’s biggest night - The 59th Grammy Awards in LA in February, next year with the compliments of our partner Mastercard. In 2015 three lucky HSBC Premier customers and their companions had the fabulous opportunity to witness a Rugby World Cup semi-final match at Twickenham. We hope to offer similar experiences as we continue to enhance the personal economy of our customers.”


“Mastercard is delighted to offer HSBC Premier cardholders exclusive access to Grammy winning artists and experiences leading up to Music’s Biggest Night,” said R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager – Sri Lanka and Maldives, Mastercard. 


He further added, “Our Priceless Surprises campaign is about providing our discerning cardholders with special access to a range of exclusive and curated experiences that are in line with their interests. Working together with our partners in the country, we look forward to offering more such customized experiences to our cardholders.”


The current promotion is another initiative to support the personal economy of Premier customers who share a personal interest for lifestyle events both locally and globally. 

 

This year, HSBC Premier customers had the opportunity to experience and be part of a world class line up, starting in March with an awe inspiring gastronomical experience with celebrity chef and godfather of modern cooking - Marco Piere White. Avid photographers were exposed to renowned international photographers, Chris Packam and Mark Goldstein at an event titled ‘Wild Life Exposed’ held in April and Rugby lovers got the opportunity to ‘Meet and Greet’ Wallaby Rugby legend George Gregan at an exclusive event in April. More recently Premier customers got to enjoy a fabulous day of Golf at the 4th annual HSBC Premier Golf Tournament held in the cool climes of Nuwara Eliya and two lucky winners are en-route to witness the World Golf Championships in Shanghai this October.
