Aloysius gave me Rs.100,000: SF


	

Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, who claimed that he received Rs. 100,000 from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius for his election campaign, said today he could refund it with interest, if needed.

He told media after an event at the Sri Lanka Foundation institute in Colombo that it was a normal practice for businessmen to contribute for election campaigns, not only in Sri Lanka but also in other countries in the world.

“No one can say that I took Rs. 100,000 from bond scam money. Businessmen contribute for election campaigns and we use them as petty cash in day-today activities of the campaign.  I have nothing to hide,” he said.

Minister Fonseka said politicians had to seek money when needed for political campaigns and added that it was not amounted to bribe.

“I contributed Rs. 600,000 to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s election campaign in 2005 after Gotabhaya Rajapaksa appealed to me. This happens all over the world, even in USA. It is not a bribe.

Those who contribute may expect some benefit but I am not someone, who resorts to illegal things as support in return. We cannot reject such offers in politics as we may make political opponents, if we do so. What I did was not illegal,” he said.

Minister Fonseka claimed on Wednesday in Kandy that Aloysius had given him Rs.100, 000 for his election campaign and that he could not remember whether it was cheque or in cash.
