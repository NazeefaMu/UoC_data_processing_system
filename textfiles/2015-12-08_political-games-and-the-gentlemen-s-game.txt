With two Goliaths entering the arena exercising equally strong political muscle, the battle for the chair of the national body for the gentlemen’s game has now become a real ding-dong.
However, some observers say that the two former rivals posing a joint challenge this time round has placed at a disadvantage the contender from a family long dominating the game. 
Sensing possible defeat, this contender is said to be now seeking the patronage of a sibling from a very influential family, but the latter who is only interested in business deals is giving the contender the slip.
Meanwhile, the other contender has told the former strongman whom he met at a wedding in the city that he was confident of winning the race adding he would proceed to take the ICC chair as well.vv
