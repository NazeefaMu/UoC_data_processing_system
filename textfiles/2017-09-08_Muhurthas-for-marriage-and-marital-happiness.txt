Most people in our country like their compatriots in other countries in the East, believe that success in any important work or event greatly depends on the Muhurtha or the auspicious moment at it is commenced.  Panchamga or five cardinal basics and the planetary positions (Tatkaala Kundali) operational at a given moment goes a long way in determining the Muhurtha. 

 

 

What is Muhurtha? 

Panchamga namely Vedic Day, Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga and Karana are mainly determined on the basis of the movements of the Moon and the Tatkaala Kundali is the celestial map or the positions of the nine planets in the Zodiac at a given moment. Most Sinhalese refer to the astrologically auspicious moment as Muhurtha or Nekata. 

 

Sri Lankans as a nation make it a point to embark on any important activity or launch an important event at an auspicious time or Muhurtha worked out by an astrologer. Of all events in the life of a person, marriage is considered the most important and we are used to arranging all activity connected with the marriage ceremony to take place at an auspicious time or Subha Nekata.  

 

Tatkaala Kundali or the planetary positions in the Zodiac at a given time is used as the main guide for determining Subha Muhurthas for a marriage ceremony.

 

 

Tatkaala Kendra based on the time for tying the nuptial knot 

Tatkaala Kendra or the horoscope must be cast based on the time fixed for tying the nuptial knot when the formal union of the bride and the groom takes place on the Poruwa.

 

 

Clear 1st House vital

The celebrated Indian Jyotish Guru Dr. B.V. Raman says that in the horoscope cast for the marriage ceremony the Ascendant or the first Bhava should be free from planetary occupation or without any planet posited in it. Mars should not occupy the 8th House and Venus must not be in the 6th House. Jupiter, Venus or mercury should be in a quadrant or a Kendra excepting the 7th House. 

 

According to classical astrological work, Narada Samhita marriage should take place in an auspicious Ascendant and Navamsa Ascendant.

 

 

Results of marriage in different Ascendants

According to Kaalaprakashika, a famous work on Muhurthas, marriage would be a success if it takes place in Gemini, Virgo or Libra ascendants. 

 

According to  astrological principles  given in classical astrological works,  if the marriage takes place in the Aries ascendant, bride becomes adulterous; in Taurus, husband loses his job or his business prosperity, in Gemini the bride will bring fortune to her husband and in-laws,  in Cancer she  becomes unchaste, in Leo she bears only one child, in Virgo she brings fortune to her husband, in Scorpio she becomes unfaithful to her husband,  in Sagittarius up to 15 degrees  she becomes promiscuous,  in Sagittarius from 16 to 30 degrees she becomes divine (highly virtuous woman, in Capricorn she gets involved in extra-marital relationships, in Aquarius she becomes unfaithful to her husband and in Pisces she becomes unchaste. 

 

 

Results in different Navamsa Ascendants

According to Indian Rishi Vasista marriage Navamsa Ascendant is more powerful than the marriage Ascendant.  According to him, if the marriage occurs in Aries Navamsa, the bride develops affection for a person other than her husband. In Taurus Navamsa, she remains emotionally and mentally stable even times of great stress and hardship.  Marriage in Gemini Navamsa confers sons and wealth.

 

Marriage in Cancer makes the bride a person of weak character.  Marriage in Leo Navamsa makes her live in parental home away from her husband.  Marriage in Virgo Navamsa bestows wealth on her family. In Libra Navamsa she comes into all comforts and luxuries in life.  Marriage in Scorpio Navamsa confers virtue and prosperity on the bride. In Sagittarius Navamsa, Ascendant up to 15 degrees she becomes wealthy and from 16 to 30 degrees she becomes adulterous. Capricorn Navamsa Ascendant deprives her of chastity and wealth. Aquarius Navamsa keeps her away from husband and in-laws. Marriage in Pisces Navamsa brings her fortune, but she becomes unfaithful to her husband.
