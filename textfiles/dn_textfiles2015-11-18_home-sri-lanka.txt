At home with Sri Lanka

The international film festival of Colombo or the Colombo festival has induced fresh hopes amongst the film fraternity and filmgoers alike towards betterment of local cinema. Second edition of the much awaited event concluded with a high note on November 11 in Colombo.
IFFC2015 was launched on November 6 at the Regal theatre with the screening of Cannes Golden Palm award winning film Dheepan directed by renowned French film director Jacques Audiard.
Main actress of Dheepan, Kalieaswari Srinivasan, made her presence at Regal on the day of the opening ceremony when Dheepan was screened.
Daily News had the privilege of interviewing a youthful Kalieaswari amidst her tight schedule of drama and film acting.
Excerpts of the interview.
Q. How was the red carpet event of IFFC2015 in Colombo?
A. Very special indeed! I am touched by the warmth of people in Sri Lanka experienced at the festival.
Be it the organizers or the audience the reception has indeed been overwhelming that I felt at home here!
Q. How different was IFFC2015 to Cannes? What are the things we have to rectify in the Colombo fest?
A. It is unfair to compare them both. For a film festival that is in its second year IFFC has been organized well.
I had told the festival director and the volunteers that I am impressed by the sincerity and the attitude of the people involved in the festival and I am sure the festival would make itself a bigger name and a bigger success in the years to come.
Q. How did you feel when the shooting of Dheepan was on?
A. Immersed in the process and the work! Had no time to feel anything else.
Q. You did semi-nude scenes in Dheepan? Your comment?
A. When you choose to ask about my comments on my scenes at the Mullivaikkaal refugee camp at the ferry escape point when I as Yalini bursts her heart out crying and more as such I may choose to comment on these scenes too.
Q. What attire do you like to wear most? You looked elegant in Saree…
A. I love to be and feel comfortable in whatever I wear! That could be Jeans, trousers, skirts or sarees. It depends on my mood and the occasion. I wore my favourite saree at the Cannes festival.
Q. How do you define “Acting”?
A. I honestly do not know how anyone defines acting. It is in my view a different process for different people. This is my philosophy in acting.
Q. Have you seen Sri Lankan films? What do you think of Sri Lankan actors?
A. The only Sri Lankan film I have seen and am lucky to have seen it is With you or Without You by Prasanna Vithanage. Needless to say I loved everything about the film. Sri Lankan actors whomever I met here at the festival though I haven't seen their movies come across as genuine and warm people. I am sure they do great work in their country and they have great potential.
Q. To what extent is a film-script important in making a film?
A. As an actor I feel it is more than necessary to have the full script in hand weeks before the shoot to have enough time to create and evolve the character and also to understand the story in its totality.
Q. What do you think of Dheepan director compared to Indian film directors?
A. I have only worked with Jacques completely on a single project at the moment.
That has been exhilarating and a huge learning experience for me.
Q. What will be your future projects?
A. I am at present working on a play titled Land of ashes and diamonds which is about the Second World War and the Sri Lankan civil war.
Also working on a movie with a Tamil director Arun Karthick where Shobashakti and I would be getting back together again.
Q. Do you aspire to hit Hollywood?
A. To me working in an interesting and challenging project is the most important thing.
Be it theatre or movies, be it a Kollywood, Bollywood, Hollywood, European or a Sri Lankan project.
