	The Supreme Court has re-affirmed the death sentence imposed by the High Court Trial-at-Bar Judges on the four convicts in the Angulana double murder where two youth were abducted and later killed.
	After a lengthy trial the three Trial-at-Bar Judges Deepali Wijesundera, W.M.P.B. Warawewa and Kumudini Wickramasinghe found all four convicts -- Angulana Police former OIC K.W. Newton, former police Constables Piyadasa K. Dhammika, Nihal Senaratne and Janpriya Senaratne -- guilty on all charges and imposed the death sentence for the murder of Dinesh Tharanga Fernando and Dhanushka Aponsu on August 12, 2009.
	The Court had also imposed 10 years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.100,000 on each of the convicts.
	They later appealed to the Supreme Court seeking a revision of the death sentence. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
