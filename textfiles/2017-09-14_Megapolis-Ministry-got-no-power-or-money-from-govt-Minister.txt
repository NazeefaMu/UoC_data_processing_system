Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today lamented that the government had neither given a cent to his Ministry nor an authoritative power for Western Development though the ‘Yahapalana Government’ completes two years on Sunday (17)

Minister Ranawaka however added that all social development, transports and environment related projects and mega construction programmes were carried out with no prejudice and malice with any one.

Addressing a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone to build New Green City’ on Kirimandala Mawatha in Narahenpita, Minister Ranawaka said the cabinet approval has been given to develop a ‘New Green City’ at the venue comprising all facilities, amenities, infrastructure and a transport network.

The Green City’ will become another smart city within Colombo and a transport center once it is completed. This will be constructed as a model to follow when other cities in the country are developed. The adjoining Kerawalapitiya will become the center that provides answers to solid waste disposal in Colombo and satellite cities.

Minister Ranawaka said it was a victory for Trade Unions who were instrumental to change certain clauses in the Port City agreement in favour of Sri Lanka and as a result, the government must not bear any cost to construct the Port City.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
