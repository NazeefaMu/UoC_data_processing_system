All zebra crossings in the country which have been painted in yellow will be painted white from December 3, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said today.

RDA Chairman Nihal Sooriyaarachchi told Daily Mirror that the zebra crossings would be changed in line with international standards. “Implementing this will be advantageous as the white crossing can be seen more clearly, especially in the night,” he said.   

A ceremony to launch the project will be held in each province, with the ceremony for the Western Province scheduled to be held at Green Path on December 3.  

“We have informed the Attorney General that the colour of all pedestrian crossings will be changed to white within a year,” he said.

A Gazette notification was also published on the project, Sooriyaarachchi said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
