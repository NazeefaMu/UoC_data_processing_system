Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is likely to make a statement on political reforms once he returns to the island after his official tour of New Zealand, informed sources said yesterday.

“The Prime Minister said he will talk also about the new law which is to be brought in replacing Prevention of Terrorism Act, when he returns from New Zealand,” a member of the Sri Lankan delegation told Daily Mirror when inquired about the report which was carried by the New Zealand Media quoting Mr Wickremesinghe that the new law to prevent terrorism might be ready for discussion next week.

Meanwhile, a press release from the Prime Minister’s office said Sri Lanka has focused on the mixed electoral system in New Zealand and the Sri Lankan legislators will be able to visit that country to study the system. Also it was stated that MPs from New Zealand will visit Sri Lanka to hold workshops for the local MPs.

In another Development Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had told the Sri Lankan community in New Zealand that he will be always proud of his ethnic group and the religion and will always stand up to safeguard those. He had made this remark on Saturday October 1, 2016. “Everyone should be committed to build a new Sri Lanka through unity and commitment,” he said. The Prime Minister therefore requested the Sri Lankan community in New Zealand to support the government in this endeavour.

“Sri Lankan had been taken on a new avenue under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and the country should travel along that avenue in order to achieve reconciliation and much needed development,” he added.
