Tiny Dog Survives Brutal Torture

Teenagers tortured a beloved family dog in what an RSPCA inspector has described as the “worst ever” unprovoked attack.
Tiny Chihuahua-cross Chunky had his neck broken and was set on fire before being dumped in a rubbish tip when he was less than one year old. He was stolen from his owner by four teenagers on February 24. Three of the teens, aged 16 and 15 at the time, admitted to punching and kicking Chunky before breaking his neck and leg, then setting fire to his face by lighting an aerosol deodorant can. They then fed him drugs before dumping him at the tip in Margate, Kent, where a passer-by found him the following evening and called the RSPCA
Investigations by the RSPCA revealed that he was taken onFebruary 24 and tortured over a period of several hours before being dumping him the next day. “It’s a miracle he survived,” RSPCA inspector Caroline Doe said. “This was the most disturbing case I have ever dealt with - by an absolute mile. “The whole thing sends shivers down my spine. The defendants may have been young and confessed to being under the influence of drugs but the cruelty they inflicted on this poor dog was extreme, barbaric and inexcusable.”
The trio, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty in October to cruelly ill-treating the animal in a way which they knew would cause him to suffer unnecessarily.
They were all disqualified from keeping all animals for five years, given a referral order for 12 months and ordered to pay costs. A fourth youth, aged 16 at the time of the offence, pleaded guilty to the same offences under the Animal Welfare Act, at a trial at Folkestone Youth Court on Tuesday.
He was also disqualified from keeping animals for five years and given a referral order for twelve months, plus his father was made to pay costs of £5,800.
“I will never forget how terrified and depressed he was when I first saw him,” Doe added.
“Thankfully he has now been restored to health and returned to his loving owners, though I fear he will always be timid and nervous as a result of his ordeal, and imagine the owners will never quite be able to come to terms with what was senseless and needlessly inflicted on their beautiful family pet.”
