The United National Party (UNP) will explore the possibility of removing President Maithripala Sirinsena in conformity with Article 38 (2) of the Constitution, the party’s media spokesman Harin Fernando said today.

Article 38(2) says, “ Any Member of Parliament may, by a writing addressed to the Speaker, give notice of a resolution alleging that the President is permanently incapable of discharging the functions of his office by reason of mental or physical infirmity or that the President has been guilty of intentional violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, misconduct or corruption involving the abuse of the powers of his office, or any offence under any law, involving moral turpitude and setting out full particulars of the allegation or allegations made and seeking an inquiry and report thereon by the Supreme Court.

Mr. Fernando said that, “We feel that President Sirisena neither is nor fit to hold his post considering the way he believes and acts and therefore we are focusing on removing him under the article 38(2) of the constitution.(Yohan Perera)
