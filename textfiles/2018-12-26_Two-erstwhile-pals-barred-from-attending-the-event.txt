When the Green leader was invited to call at the main office to take oath again in the office he lost to the former strongman under circumstances now part of history, it was Deputy Saji who took the initiative to make plans for the swearing -in ceremony in consultation with Number One. When the Green leader was invited to call at the main office to take oath again in the same office he lost to the former strongman under circumstances now part of history, it was Deputy Saji who took the initiative to make plans for the swearing -in ceremony in consultation with Number One. 

 


Deputy Saji agreed with Number One that the swearing-in should be a simple ceremony and the latter requested that the Green guests at it be restricted to five persons. 


However, Deputy Saji made an appeal to Number One to allow the party’s party senior ones to attend the ceremony given the significance of the event. 


Number One was averse to the idea at first, but as a concession to Deputy Saji, agreed to permit 18 party seniors to attend the ceremony. But he added a rider: “But there are two persons who should not under any circumstances be among the 18 allowed to attend the ceremony!”  


On further inquiry, Deputy Saji was to learn that one of the duo under the taboo was a onetime close colleague of Number One who held the Health portfolio and the other one was a war hero whom he himself elevated to the highest military rank!
