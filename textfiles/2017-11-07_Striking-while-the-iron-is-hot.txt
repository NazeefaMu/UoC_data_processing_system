The official vehicle used by this whitecollar high-up heading an establishment related to education was damaged in a road accident.

Despite the fact that this vehicle could be used again after effecting the necessary repairs, the high-up had reportedly misled the authorities above him with a fake report that the vehicle was damaged beyond repairs.

The high-up has now purchased a deluxe Outlander vehicle which has cost the establishment Rs.10 million, they say.
