Adopt essential confidence building measures - EU

The European Union yesterday urged the Sri Lankan government to implement the "immediate adoption of essential confidence building measures" for the victims of Sri Lanka's armed conflict.
In a statement to the 30th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, the EU expressed its "deepest solidarity with the victims and their relatives" and had "sincere admiration for the manner in which victims have contributed to the work of the OISL and have placed their confidence in the Human Rights Council".
"We also wish to welcome the historic commitments made to the people of Sri Lanka and to the international community by the government of Sri Lanka during this session. The resolution tabled by the core group and Sri Lanka marks a crucial step towards a credible transitional justice process in Sri Lanka with the active support and participation of the independent community," the EU delegation added.
"The full implementation of these commitments is now needed, starting with prompt action on a fully participatory national consultation, especially with the victims, for the design of a comprehensive justice process and the immediate adoption of essential confidence-building measures," it added.
The EU assured that it would support Sri Lanka as the country wanted to work in partnership with the international community to implement its commitments.
"The EU said it would also explore with the Sri Lankan government how best to assist in the implementation of the resolution.
