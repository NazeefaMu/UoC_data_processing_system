The Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Ministry is opposed to the move to hand over the Trincomalee Oil tank farm in total to the Indian authorities for development under a joint venture, Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today.

The Minister told Daily Mirror that at least 15 tanks should remain with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and the rest could be considered for joint development with Lanka Indian Oil Company. He said the issue would be discussed with the Indian authorities.

However, a Cabinet paper has been submitted to transfer all the tanks for development under a joint venture with LIOC.

There are 84 tanks remaining unused at the moment. In 2003, the UNP government signed an agreement with India for the development of this Oil Tank Farm. Currently, LIOC is using 14 of the tanks in the lower farm. In the upper tank farm, there are 84 tanks still not used. (Kelum Bandara)
