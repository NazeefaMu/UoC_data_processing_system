Responding to President Maithripala Sirisena’s statement made at the 76th commemoration of the late Ven. Sobitha Thera, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday the statement showed that there is no government in the country today.

He expressed these views to journalists at an Iftar ceremony held at his residence in Colombo last evening.

Mr. Rajapaksa said continuous speeches made by both the President and the Prime Minister validated that the only solution available to the current issues is the dissolution of Parliament.

“The country cannot be developed or taken forward in this manner. The Parliament should be dissolved and a general election should be held to establish a stable government,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
