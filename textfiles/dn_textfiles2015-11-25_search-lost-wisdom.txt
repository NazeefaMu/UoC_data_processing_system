In search of lost wisdom

Engr. Mahinda Panapitiya Irrigation Engineer, B.Sc (University of Sri Lanka), M.S, Department of Agriculture & Biological Engineering, Utah State University, USA
Water Resource Development projects are intended to harness Land and Water resources to create well-being and wealth for people and nations. In approaches adapted during the last century in designing of those projects in Sri Lanka specially targeting irrigated agriculture, water has been treated as the limiting resource. As a result, the primary emphasis was placed on exploiting the water resource to maximize the returns from irrigated agriculture and the benefits were measured purely on conventional economic indicators.
However, maximizing these returns may come at the expense of long-term sustainability of the project itself. For example, Sri Lankan farmers, especially the paddy grower, including the pioneering colonists who have been settled in the past century under various irrigation systems, now lead a livelihood at subsistence level.
Recently implemented fertilizer subsidy can be reckoned as a good indicator of the economic plight of these farmers. Without those subsidies agriculture is not feasible. Fertilizer subsidy for these farmers is in fact identical to the “dole” for unemployed people in developed countries who are striving to lay an economic footing. The health of beneficiary farmers is another aspect. The root cause of the renal failure found in high concentration in the Mahaweli and other paddy cultivating region has been proved to be related to fertilizer and other input chemicals such as weedicides and pesticides.
Technology-wise but ecologically – foolish approach
Perhaps the approach adapted during the last century would have been Technology-wise but ecologically – foolish way of dealing with the land resource and its assets to address poverty. The huge infrastructure costs incurred for storing and diverting/ conveying water from water-rich areas to dry areas, and the relative abundance of “undeveloped” lands in dry areas, may explain this distorted over emphasis over the water as the primary resource. Investment in water for irrigated agriculture is usually so large especially in trans-basin water diversions projects such as Mahaweli programme. In order to justify the investment, it is normally taken for granted that the newly acquired water resource must be used mainly for irrigated agriculture by spreading it over a maximum possible land area with the objective of distributing those irrigable lands among people as a solution to population growth and unemployment.
According to this approach, if more water could be made available for development, it should be dedicated only to irrigate more lands and other components of the natural environment, such as forests, wetlands, flood plains, soils and riparian zones in the area are not considered to be assets and water is not allocated for the protection and maintenance of those ecological assets. As a consequence, the whole landscape within modern irrigation projects have become a “monotony” of irrigated agriculture, lacking ecological diversity, and depending not only on imported water from water rich areas, but also, on imported pesticides and fertilizers from overseas.
These dependencies are not favourable conditions, especially in view of current global economic and environmental crises. There could be alternative design approach that seeks better ecologically and economically sustainable synergizing methods of land with water derived from recognition of water’s natural functions and appreciation for its ecological values.
Normally when we talk about our ancient hydraulic systems, we think only about the glory of Big Dams built by our ancestors to store water, but the underlying rationale and philosophy of how the stored water was used below the Dam (Downstream Use) for sustainable agriculture practices are rarely appreciated.
The consequences of the lost wisdom are well reflected on the present day to day meal plate of the farmer families living in irrigation projects developed during the last century. It consists nothing else but a heap of rice and a curry of fish caught from the nearby tank. Heap of rice stands for the monotony of paddy fields and the fish curry stands for the water that goes to the paddy fields.
The food plate of the farmers under modern irrigation systems is lack of curd due to lack space for the cattle to graze and to keep. The plate is lack of protein rich cereals such as Kurakkan, Sesamum, Meneri, Tanahaal etc. It is lack of all type of local pod varieties and hundreds of types of yams and vegetables and fruits as there are no lands for them to grow. No bee honey is available because bees do not colonize in the neighbourhood of chemically polluted lands. When one carefully study the irrigated agriculture systems adapted in the ancient approach of land development for irrigated agriculture, it is obvious that the nutritious level of the day to day meal plate of our ancient farmers would have been at the same status as the typical meal plate of rich countries of the modern world.
Rice comprises only very small portion of the meal plate of people from rich countries such as Japan. In contrast the day to day meal plate of our present day farmers living in so called modern irrigation projects comprises mainly of a heap of rice. Ancient systems used for landscape development produced not only rice under irrigated conditions but various other nourishing food varieties generating from numerous assets of the Landscapes such as Natural Forests, Livestock, and Wildlife.
The natural forest, the perennial crops, the seasonal crops, the animals both tamed and wild and small and large including the earth worms and microorganisms live on the ground and sub surfaces are the real source of nutrients and nutrient generators which can supplement the crops grown in the deep valley that is paddy in this context. What happens when the whole lands on the downstream are bulldozed off and converted to a one single mass of paddy fields? The whole landscape gets impoverished of generating and holding the nutrients-the essentials for revitalizing the productive powers of soil. As a consequence, the paddy grown on the entire land begins to fail and the farmers in modern irrigation systems are then advised to depend on the chemical fertilizers which are the sole inviters to pesticides and the weedicides causing various health problems such as kidney diseases.
Indigenous ways of handling nature is a lost paradigm. For example the chena cultivation which has been branded as notorious has now been identified as a very sustainable way of synergizing land and water for food production. There is need to study the actual practices prevailed at ancient time before branding it as notorious. The past will inform the future - The agro-ecologically intelligent and sustainable methods employed by Sri Lanka’s ancient hydraulic technocrats to produce foods without imported Agrochemicals might also offer important insights for alternative ways for handling water resource more intelligently in producing foods for human beings. Soil rich in organic matter improves soil structure and improves water retaining capacity. Carbon rich soil could hold 40 kg of water for each 1 kg of carbon. If organic matter is incorporated into the soil, the dependency on irrigation could also be minimized in addition to the dependency on imported fertilizer.
Need for an alternative approach
Ancient approach would have focused to convert the Dry Zone into ecologically sustainable Wet Zone by replenishing the Ground Water in addition to well known surface irrigation practicing today. There is also need to exploit resources within the target area as the first step rather than importing them from outside.
As a first step prior to hardware design of inter-provincial water transfers systems, it should be subjected to evaluations of risks of conflicts within existing social and legal frameworks of the country. Ultimate objective of an irrigation project should be to produce healthy food varieties in an economically and socially sustainable mode while the beneficiaries are enjoying a livelihood in a pleasing natural environment without depending on heavy and uncertain government subsidies.
The first step toward in finding alternative and sustainable design approaches is to investigate and understand in a holistic manner, the true current performance of irrigation systems developed during the last century, especially in terms of their productivity in sustainable mode and dependability on imported inputs to maintain the sustainability.
This kind of assessment is essential so that the inadequacies inherent in “modern” design methodologies get exposed and adjustments can be made to meet the shortcomings. Otherwise, the mistakes of the past century will be perpetuated in development of remaining suitable lands and the opportunities will be lost to achieve truly integrated, sustainable projects. Perhaps commonly practiced ways of exploiting landscape as adapted in recently developed Mahaweli project with the main objective of settling people for irrigated agriculture may become questionable because as explained above, it could be only a matter of time for those settlers eventually to become depend on a Subsidy of imported fertilizer. These kinds of dependencies are not favourable conditions, especially in view of current global economic and environmental crises.
The intent of this article is to create awareness to spark a dialogue among professionals about the value of deep and honest performance assessments of irrigation projects built during the last century. Hopefully this would lead to more insightful, ecologically sensitive design approaches and, ultimately a sustainable land use model which could be applied in exploiting the remaining land resource especially in the North and East of Sri Lanka. For example, Lands in Maduru Oya Basin and lands planned to be developed under NCP canal could be used as a Pilot Area to design in ecologically and socially sustainable project. Challenge for the Engineers/ Agriculture Experts/ Social Scientists / Ecologists in this exercise would be to deliver a design which could guarantees subsidies free and sustainable irrigated agriculture system. In other words, it should be a Techno-wise, as well as an Eco-wise water resource development.
A draft Terms of Reference which could be used to select the right team of multidisciplinary experts for future Irrigation Designs at least at Pilot Scale are as follows.
* There should be no need to apply imported agro chemicals to grow crops
* Economic benefits generated to the country should be competitive enough to a level which is least be the same as conventional design
* Minimum disturbance to wild life and forest cover and the design should clearly identifies measures incorporated in the design addressing climatic improvement at global level
* There is no restriction to adhere to paddy only mode
* Possibility of generating alternative and creative income generation opportunities such as eco and agro tourism, carbon trading, high value organic food products, bee keeping and livestock etc. should be indirect benefits of the design
* Project should create benefits for already existing settlements around the project area and should not disturb their lifestyle by phenomena such as human elephant conflict
* Final output of the design should be to create a food plate for farmers equivalent to nutritional level of developed countries such as Japan (Ex: Small amount of rice with lot of protein rich food)
