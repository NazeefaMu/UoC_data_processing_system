Jayantha’s ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ celebrates 30 years


	



The elders among us still have nostalgic memories from the past when accomplished politicians ruled the country. This was several decades ago. The sacrifices they made and the dedication with which they serviced made the people happy. It is with a tinge of sadness that they talk about the vacuum created by these politicians who are no more or retired. The politicians who belong to this past era are of such high calibre. Their distancing from the present day politicians is justifiable. However, the present politicians live in a reverie for long years with little or no concern about their duties to the people. These politicians run around seeking support when elections are around the corner.   


Even in present times there are people who command recognition. One such person is the founder of the Pragna Pradeepa Programme Dr. Jayantha de Silva. He has been popular among the people for his dedicated service. He has been distributing large consignments of books and school requisites to the children from low income families and has implemented projects of his own to uplift the poor. This year marks 30 years in De Silva’s career as a social worker.   

Withstood criticism   


It is an arduous task to be dedicated in serving the the people. Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala was a classic example of a great man who relinquished all comforts and sacrificed his whole life to serve his fellow men. However, it is sad to know that he has been subjected to criticism and humiliation rather than being praised. Regardless of praise or blame he continued with his services to the nation. He has strongly believed that one mustn’t take to social service unless one is prepared to withstand criticism. Ultimately he was so disgusted with the country that he left for India, never to return. Dharmapala was hopeful of being reborn in India after his death. Dharmapala’s life story is a clear indication of trials and tribulations facing a man dedicated to service. One can judge in the light of his life story what obstacles would have been experienced by this samaritan Dr. Jayantha de Silva, during his 30 years of serving the public.   


“I thought of social service and started my ambitious career as a social worker early in life. I undertook that arduous task even before I took to politics. I followed the path of my parents who were social workers. They often said that the ideal life for a person would be to serve fellow men. Their vehement expectation was that I dedicate my life to serve the nation and my fellow men. Example is better than precept they say. My mother never allowed any visitor to leave at least without having a cup of tea. If it was lunch time he was sure to be hosted to lunch,” is how he recalled the days when he was young and came under the care of his parents.  
Ananda College gave a new impetus to his ambition and equipped him with the noble concept that of serving the people. Several of the teachers at Ananda College were dedicated social workers who set an example to individuals like Dr. de Silva.

The right path 


In fact Ananda College had been founded by patriots to kindle the flame of wisdom in children belonging to ordinary families. “I as one of them decided to follow in the footsteps of patriots who founded Ananda College. Everyone of these patriots shone as a beacon light to the children and helped to put them on the right path. With this in view I founded the Pragna Pradeepa Programme which today celebrates the 30th anniversary in its long journey,” Dr. De Silva said.   


He said that Ananda College was the nursery where he was cast in a mold and turned out as a social worker. There was another indispensable character behind his success. This towering figure in the Pragna Pradeepa Programme is no one else, but its Secretary Deshabandu A Sumith Perera who has been playing an integral role.   


“At the beginning the donation of school books was funded by Dr. Jayatha de Silva with his personal wealth. He spent the whole of his salary for this worthy cause. We inaugurated the Pragna Pradeepa Programme with only eight children. We were able to organise a loan scheme for low-income families, depending on self employment. We implemented projects to develop infrastructure facilities in under developed areas. The project to uplift the living standards of carters was just another special project implemented by us,” Sumith Perera said.   


 

They soon realized that the Pragna Pradeepa Programme was for them and they joined hands with us to forge ahead. They offered us strength to make it a massive social service venture which functions as a local NGO.



In reply to a question on the obstacles faced by the Pragna Pradeepa Programme during the 30 years, Sumith said at the outset that the people had a misunderstanding that this programme was just an attempt to gain cheap political mileage. “But in the long-run they realized the truth that it was an endeavour to uplift underprivileged people and not one that was politically motivated,” Perera said.   


“They soon realized that the Pragna Pradeepa Programme was for them and they joined hands with us to forge ahead. They offered us strength to make it a massive social service venture which functions as a local NGO. At present it has a staff comprising 35 people who are rendering a voluntary service,” he further added.   
Perera said that a massive donation of schoolbooks along with the holding of a cultural show have been scheduled for December 16 at the Campbell Park in Borella to mark the 30h anniversary of this programme.
