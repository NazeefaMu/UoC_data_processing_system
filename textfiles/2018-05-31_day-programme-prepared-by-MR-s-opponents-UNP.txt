Highways Minister Kabir Hashim said today the 100-day-programme was prepared by those who campaigned against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2014.

He told this to the media after the UNP Working Committee meeting held at Sirikotha.

“The UNP is responsible for the 100-day-programme,” he said in response to a statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday that he was unaware as to who prepared the 100-day-programme.

Moreover, the President had said dissolution of Parliament soon after the 2015 elections would have been a better option as far as politics was concerned.(Yohan Perera)
