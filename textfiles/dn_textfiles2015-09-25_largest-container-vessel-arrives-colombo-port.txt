Largest container vessel arrives at Colombo Port

Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranathunga yesterday emphasised that the Government would develop the ports in the island to place Sri Lanka as one of the top container hubs in Asia.
He said so welcoming 'Marco Polo,' the first largest container vessel to the Colombo Port yesterday.
The minister said the government would further develop infrastructure facilities in the Colombo Port to achieve the set targets.
The 'Edith Maersk' was the largest container vessel that arrived in Sri Lanka before Marco Polo. It had 15,550 containers of cargo carrying capacity, while the Marco Polo has 16,020 containers of cargo carrying capacity. The Marco Polo is a UK registered vessel which was the world's largest vessel in 2012 and it was also the one and only UK flag containership.
The vessel is 396 meters in length and 29.9 meters in height. The Marko Polo was launched on November 7, 2012.
Speaking to the foreign media, Minister Ranathunga said the Government would hold 51% from future investment projects to be received to develop the Colombo Harbour for the country's benefit.
"Sri Lanka has now turned out to be a crucial center for shipping routes between China and Europe. Hence, we hope to develop our harbours to place Sri Lanka as an Asian container hub.
Currently, we are re-exporting vehicles to the Hambantota harbour. During the last political era, investors were reluctant to invest in the country due to the unfavourable socio political situation in the country. However, significant development had been achieved in port industry within last six months.
Now we should focus on increasing the potential of the Port Authority. We would be able to bring in a huge income to the country by developing the East Terminal at the Colombo Port," the Minister further asserted.
The Minister also visited the vessel before its departure tonight, a Ports and Shipping ministry release said.
