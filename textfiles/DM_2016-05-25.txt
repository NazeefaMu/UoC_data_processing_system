Did he exceed his authority
	

The conduct of a holder of a very high office in the august assembly has come under fire from the Green party members, they say.

They maintain that the way the high office holder conducted himself in the aftermath of the vote taking that triggered noisy protests from the opposition cannot be condoned.
The Green members taking up this issue at their Diyawanna group meeting last week had pointed out it was highly irregular for the authority concerned to have granted permission for a re-play of the video footage when the Chair had already announced the result of the vote taken. Besides, the re-scrutiny of a result announced by the Chair runs counter to both tradition and the law, the members had maintained.
Meanwhile, reports point to the possibility of an early replacement for the current office holder now under fire.

EP Governor rejects allegations
	
Commenting on the allegations made by Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahamed alleging that Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando did not know the protocol and frequently undermining the Chief Ministers authority in the Province and interfering in his work, Mr. Fernando said he was a protocol minded man and thus respected everybody.
Mr. Fernando said he did not accept any of the Chief Ministers allegations and therefore he had no reason to reject them.
I am a protocol-minded man and I respect everybody. I do not accept any of his allegations and therefore it is still with him, he said.
Commenting on the allegation by the Chief Minister that the Governor had rejected to take him to Sampur in the helicopter after a function in Kinniya, Mr. Fernando said he did so not because the Chief Minister should not be given a flight but since there had been no room in the helicopter.
The helicopter was not organised by me. It was organised by Minister Faiszer Musthaphas Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri. He wanted to take the Chief Secretary and the Government Agent in the helicopter. So I had to send my wife and my police officer by road. I informed the Chief Minister that he may have to go by road as there was no room in the helicopter, he said.
When asked, Mr. Fernando said he would not even think of asking for an inquiry about the allegations, as he did not accept them. I was not affected. Any affected party can ask for an inquiry, he said.
He said, if the people know who the Governor was, and not who the Chief Minister was, without introduction, it was a bad show.
The Chief Minister yesterday alleged that the governor had shown a lack of respect for him, frequently undermining his authority in the province and interfering in his work, and that if the Governor had told the organisers that I was the Chief Minister, and that I should be allowed on stage, this wouldnt have happened.

FSP front-liners Jagoda and Kuruwita arrested
	
Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jagoda and Central Committee Member Sujith Kuruwita were arrested by the Maradana Police today.
The arrests were made after they were summoned to the Maradana Police to record a statement on the tense situation that prevailed at the Immigration and Emigration Department in Borella on April 1.
A heated argument between FSP members and the Police led to a clash when the protesters attempted to enter the building after breaking open the glass doors.
The main demand by the protesters was that FSP politburo member Kumar Gunaratnam be granted dual citizenship.
FSP Politburo Member Duminda Nagamuwa told Daily Mirror that an unidentified group of people claiming to be from the police had attempted to arrest Sujith Kuruwita two days ago while he was at his home.
However, they were unable to make the arrest as they had failed to produce an arrest warrant.
The group had left after asking him to surrender to the police.
Meanwhile, Mr. Nagamuwa claimed that according to the police 13 more FSP members were to be arrested soon in connection with this incident. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Gifting elephants  a new dimension to elephant issue
	

Law enforcement authorities have been busy rounding up illegally held elephants  mostly young ones in various parts of the country for the past few months. And several cases filed against the parties responsible for keeping these animals in captivity without a permits as required by the law are pending in courts.

Meanwhile, some Buddhist prelates and leading citizens in the country have made representations in this regard to the Big Boss and the second in command in yahapalanaya which have now placed the issue in a new light. It has also now been brought to light that the successive governments in the past have made it a practice to gift elephants under Sannas-patra (acts of conferment).
According to records available, even a high political authority of the present government had gifted elephants to a Buddhist temple going by the Sannas-patra procedure.
Given this new development indications are that government is likely to take a fresh look at the entire question of prosecuting those found domesticating elephants without a permit, they say.

GMOA to strike across the country except in disaster-hit areas
	
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) today decided to go on strike next Tuesday (31) in all government hospitals in the country except in disaster-hit districts, against the arbitrary action of the Medical Services Director (MSD) of the Health Ministry.
Accordingly, floods and landslides hit districts including Colombo, Gampaha, Kegalle, Puttalam and Kilinochchi will not be affected by the island-wide strike of the government doctors.
GMOA was planning to launch an island-wide trade union action against the Medical Services Director (MSD) for changing the list of vacancies without their consent, after it had been prepared by the Health Ministry and GMOA for assigning post-internships to doctors.
A number of GMOA branches island-wide had objected to the Medical Services Directors arbitrary actions, warning of strike action. The original list had been replaced with a new list prepared by the MSD and a Public Relations Officer of the Health Ministry. According to the new list some of the peripheral hospitals would not get doctors at all, the GMOA Spokesman Dr. De Soysa said.
We prepared the list according to the information received from hospital directors and regional health service directors at a meeting of the heads of health institutions. Now, it has been changed without our consent, he said.
He also said that considering the disaster situation which the country is currently facing, the strike will not be carried out in those districts.
However, doctors in Batticaloa and Ampara have vowed to launch the trade union action this Friday (27), the GMOA said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

A certain purohita has made secret plans to become the team leader at the top table in yahapalanaya, they say.

This ambitious one hailing from the hill country had his first break under yahapalanaya when he was given a seat in the council from the gratis list. He was once lambasting his former boss, but now he has stopped saying anything against the latter as a tactical measure, they say. Incidentally, the man got into hot water once for shooting off mouth.
According to reports, our worthy had held several rounds of talks with reps from three political parties at a joint in Battaramulla area to fine-tune the roadmap leading to his goal.
If I gained this position, reaching the apex would only be a matter of course, the ambitious one had bragged after a drink or two.

The diplomatic mission of a European country that played a lead role in the aborted peace bid celebrated the countrys Independence Day at a function held in the mission premises recently.

Two Buddhist prelates who were actively involved in the efforts to bring about peace and good governance in the country were among the distinguished guests present at the function. At the tea party held at the conclusion of the main function, a burly purohita from the Colombo district holding a key portfolio approached the two Buddhist prelates and greeted them respectfully.
Before the purohita could utter a word, one of the prelates launched into a scathing tirade against him: We also did a lot to bring this government into power. Some people have forgotten that and I was waiting to remind you of the role we playedYou cant take us for a ride
The prelate went on with his harangue while the other monk from Nugegoda, a close friend of the purohita helplessly looked on. The poor purohita who had to suffer humiliation in the presence of a distinguished gathering might shun the Rukmale temple like a plague in the future, they say.

His alleged absence causes fireworks at home
	

The furor that rocked the august assembly the other day when the opposition made a noisy protest claiming that the score on a vote taken on an important Bill has even made newspaper headlines.

A political bigwig living in the Kalutara area had to face a serious domestic problem as a repercussion of this incident.
This Diyawanna member had left home early in the morning on the day in question saying that he had to be present on time in the council to register his vote. However, the better half of the member had learnt later that the name of her husband was not on the list of members who voted for and against the Bill. The lady already wise to the flings of her gallivanting husband put two and two together and created an ugly scene when the latter returned home.
The Diyawanna member had protested his innocence, but the wife would not listen to him.
Meanwhile, there was a buzz in the lobby, they say, that the poor man, in a bid to pacify the lady breathing down his neck was planning to seek the Speakers help to prove that he was present in the council on that particular occasion.

It was Austin Fernando's fault: Nazeer
	
Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahamed yesterday gave the background to the incident that occurred at the function held at the Sampur Maha Vidyalaya. He said he had lost his temper because of the actions of Governor Austin Fernando.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said the governor had shown a lack of the respect for him, frequently undermining his authority in the province and interfering in his work .
Commenting on the incident at the function, he said that he, the Chief Minister, had not been acknowledged officially by the compre.
However, when I tried to get on the stage after the governor called me, the compre tried to stop me. Then I lost my temper. If the governor had told the organisers that I was the chief minister and that I should be allowed on stage, this wouldnt have happened. I know the navy officers are innocent. It was the governor who was at fault, he said.
Prior to attending the Sampur function, he said, they had attended another function in Kinniya. When he asked the governor about going from there to Sampur in the helicopter, the governor had said there was no room for him .
I was hurt. He asked me to leave the function early so that I could get to Sampur on time, and that they would follow in the helicopter. So I went to Sampur and waited for them. The governor, ambassador and others arrived later. I was not even acknowledged there. Had the governor informed the organisers, this would not have happened, he said.
When asked whether his outburst was justifiable in front of the students, he said he had lost his temper because he had been snubbed in front of his people. This shows how the Chief Minister is treated. The post should be respected. After all, he is the head of the province, he said.
He said his province had people belonging to many different communities and it required much work to achieve reconciliation. That is what I have been doing here. I am working for the people, dealing with the TNA, SLMC, UNP and the UPFA. This is why the East is different to the North, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Must ensure the Megapolis is a livable place: Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the recent floods had shown that the government should ensure that the Western Region, which is to be converted into a big city under the Megapolis plan, was a livable city
Going by our vision, our polices, the Megapolis must not only be the largest city in the Indian Ocean region. It must rank high in regard to sustainable development. We want a livable city. In South Asia cities are no longer livable," he said, speaking at the "2030 Now" summit organised by the UNDP last evening.
He also focused on the manufacturing sector. He said, What should our manufacturing industries be Such industries should be in accord with our thinking. We must think of the wishes of the Sri Lankan people. They want a high income. This is why they are leaving the country. You have to look at wages and incomes. These are some of the issues we have to look into.
He said the government would have to think of the rural people as well: You cannot forget the countryside. You cannot forget the rural economy. After all you have to feed people. There will be more mouths to feed in 2050 than you have today. One has to focus on sustainable agriculture, he said.
What is Indian Ocean It has always been the richest trading region in the world. It is going to become one of the fastest growing regions in the world in the next three to four decades -- that is unavoidable. South Asia and South East Asia (which borders the Bay of Bengal) will have a population of well over two billion. If you take the whole Indian Ocean region it will contain almost three and a half billion people. Countries which are fast growing will soon become middle income countries, he said
Referring to other future plans, he said the country would not be affected as much as anticipated. Despite the global downturn we will not face a serious crisis because of the agreement we have with the IMF (the extended $ 2.2 billion facility), the SWOP facility with India involving a billion dollars, international sovereign bond markets and discussions with China to put Chinese equity into our markets, he said
By putting Chinese equity into our markets we could repay about $3 billion of Chinese credit. We would like to give first choice to Chinese companies in the equity market. At least we can breathe now. This is something we could not do in 2015, he said.(Yohan Perera)

A video of the CM rebuking a naval officer, who was the compere at an event at the Sampur Maha Vidyalaya, went viral recently. Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando and US Ambassador Atul Keshap also attended the event as Chief Guests.
Mr. Ahamed lost his cool when he had mistakenly assumed that the navy personnel was requesting him to move off the stage, when he had in fact only requested the media personnel to make room for students to come up on stage.
"Get out from here idiot. If you dont know what protocol is, just get out. Who the hell are you to stop me Even you, the Governor, dont know what the protocol is. I respect the Ambassador much more. You should know Governor, you should know the protocol," he was heard saying.
Navy Commander Ravindra Wijegunaratne yesterday said that he handed over a report on the incident to the Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi.

The Land Reclamation Development Board (LRDB) has been tasked with the job of handling the relocation.
LRDB Chairman Asela Iddawela told Daily Mirror the decision was taken at a meeting with the stakeholders on Monday. He said 48 families living in Kolonnawa had to be relocated while steps were being taken to relocate the other families.
It has been decided to prohibit all forms of land reclamation in the affected areas while permission granted to reclaim some of the lands will be cancelled, he said.

A number of Betel leaf purohitas are said to be in a state of indecision about their political future. Such a wavering purohita from a district famous for its gems ran into a JO camp stalwart of the same political party quite recently.

After small talk, the duo turned to the subject of the recently increased VAT regime. And they swapped their concerns about the burden placed on the poor masses. The purohita from the gem-district looked highly disillusioned. We will have no future, if this state of affairs continues, he lamented.
The purohitas comment was music to the ears of his colleague from the JO camp.
If you are so disgusted, why dont you join our group the Gampaha colleague asked.
I was ready to join your group. But I had second thoughts when I heard that henahura had descended on your group. I am prepared to move and work with anyone, but not with that character! I dont mind if you quote what I say when you meet our former boss the next time.
The purohita did not name the individual whom he referred to as henahura. But the Gampaha colleague knew whom he meant.

Why he opposes the RTI Act
	

A workshop was held in a city suburb recently to familiarize the Diyawanna members with the nuts and bolts of the proposed Right to Information Act.

Presentations by the resource personnel over, it was the turn of the seniors among the purohitas and Diyawanna members to express their views on the proposed Act. And a prominent purohita who looks after his electorate in Uva from his perch in the city expressed his displeasure at giving the right to information to all and sundry as envisaged in the proposed Act.
He said: If we are to supply information to every Jack, Tom and Harry in the manner proposed, I dont think we will be in a position to run this government. He asked: Will there be enough time for us to attend to our workaday duties if there is 500 to 1,000 people rush each day to seek information
A sibilance of whispered comment by the members seated at the rear ensued the broadside fired at the proposed Act by the senior purohita.
Our man appears to be in a state of terrific fright, one member told the colleagues around him.
What is the reason for him to get into a fright another member asked.
A talkative member from the Colombo district came out with the reply to the question. He is shaking with fright because he knows that he would be in a hell of a soup if his wife took advantage of the new law to find out all about her man. This sally created ripples of amusement among those seated at the rear.
