ISLAMABAD AFP Jan9, 
2017 - Pakistan on Monday test-fired its first submarine-launched cruise missile, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and giving the country a credible second strike capability, the military said.  


The missile was fired from an underwater mobile platform and hit its target with precise accuracy, it said in a statement.  


A military spokesman confirmed to AFP the missile, with a range of 450 km (280 miles), could carry a nuclear warhead.  


 “Babur-3 is a sea-based variant of Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) Babur-2, which was successfully tested earlier in December, last year,” the statement said.  


 “Pakistan eyes this hallmark development as a step toward reinforcing the policy of credible minimum deterrence.” Pakistan and neighbouring India -- which have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 -- have routinely carried out missile tests since both demonstrated a nuclear weapons capability in 1998.  


Both countries can already launch surface-to-surface ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear or conventional warheads.
