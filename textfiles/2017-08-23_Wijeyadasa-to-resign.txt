Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is likely to resign from his post today, informed sources said yesterday.

According to top government sources the Minister had informed President Maithripala Sirisena that he is willing to resign from the post.

Though it was speculated that Talatha Athukorala was expected to be sworn in as the new Minister of Justice, Ms Athukorala denied the story that she was to be appointed to the post. “No one had asked me to take over the Justice Ministry,” she said.

Other sources said some Ministers and MPs were pushing for the appointment of MP Jayampathi Wickramaratne to be appointed to the post. (Yohan Perera)
