Wimal’s bail application rejected


	

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today refused to grant bail for MP Wimal Weerawansa on exceptional circumstance of his daughter being admitted to a hospital.

The Magistrate said that there were no sufficient reports in court which could explain the health condition of the suspect's daughter.

MP Weerawansa was not brought to the Courts today by the Prison Authorities because he was currently being treated at the Colombo National Hospital.

Earlier, defence counsel put forward the bail application on the ground of exceptional circumstance that the suspect's daughter was admitted to hospital due to bad mental health condition after her father was remanded. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
