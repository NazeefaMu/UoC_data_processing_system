CEB violated the transmission license: PUCSL
	
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has told the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) that the latter has violated the Transmission License on maintaining an uninterrupted power supply throughout the country three times in the last 6 months since September 27, last year, by way of islandwide power failures.
PUCSL Chairman Saliya Mathew has written to General Manager, CEB, M.C.Wickramasekara saying that it was the responsibility of the Transmission Licensee (CEB) under Condition 30 of the Transmission License to maintain an uninterrupted power supply throughout the country.
Therefore you are required to inform the Commission on actions the Transmission Licensee has taken in order to prevent repetition of an islandwide power failures and the Transmission Licensee is responsible for maintaining the system fulfilling this criterion,Mr. Mathew said..
Further, the Commission highlights that single element failure in the power system shall not result in islandwide power failure and the Transmission Licensee is responsible for maintaining the system.
The Commission has conducted a comprehensive study with the assistance of Manitoba HVDC research centre on the power failure on September 27, 2015 and observed several shortcomings.
The dynamic transmission system model used by the CEB Transmission planning and system control branches are not accurate enough for dynamic response analysis, and the model data need to be verified with field tests for system elements along with accurate modeling of loads, according to those observations.

Hyde Park meeting: SLFP CC to decide on errant members
	
The SLFP Central Committee (CC) will meet shortly to decide on the action to be taken against SLFP parliamentarians who participated in Thursdays joint opposition rally at Hyde Park, General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said yesterday.
He said the SLFP did not take decisions arbitrarily and individually and the issue of taking part in the joint opposition rally would be taken up at the next CC meeting.
"We are not in a hurry to take disciplinary action against those who participated in this meeting, but will act in accordance with party guidelines and constitution. I have sent a letter to SLFP parliamentarians and provincial councillors, not to violate party discipline. We will take a decision in line with that directive, he said.
When asked whether explanations would be called from errant members, the minister said it would be decided by the CC and that participating in a meeting would not be considered a big deal.
However, the CC will review the situation, go through what has been said at the meeting and then decide whether there was a violation of party discipline by those who participated, he said.
However, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayaka recently said that strict disciplinary action would be taken against SLFP members who participate in the joint opposition rally.
Former President, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, former speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, former Ministers Bandula Gunawardana, Kumara Welgama, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, SLFP Colombo District Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila were among the SLFP frontliners who participated, and some of them addressed the meeting.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Lunar eclipse on March 23
	
The first penumbral lunar eclipse for the year will occur on March 23, 2016, a day after the Medin Full Moon Poya Day, Board Member Arthur C. Clarke Institute of Modern Technologies Professor Chandana Jayaratne said yesterday.
Professor Jayaratne who is also a Board Member of the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics and Professor of Physics University of Colombo said the eclipse would begin at 3.09 p.m. on March 23 and end at 7.24 p.m. Sri Lanka standard time.
In a penumbral eclipse, the moon will not enter into the dark shadow of the earth, but to the lighter shadow.
Therefore, during this eclipse a person will not be able to see the dark shadow as in a total or partial lunar eclipse but only a reduction of the brightness of the moon. Penumbral eclipses are difficult to observe, especially during the early and late stages, but a distinct shading should be visible across the moon, the Professor said.
He said the eclipse will reach its peak from the eastern horizon at 6.23 p.m. when 77 per cent of the moons disk will be in the earths penumbral shadow.
The last lunar eclipse of the year will occur at midnight on September 16, 2016, on Binara Full Moon Poya Day. (Yohan Perera)

Power crisis likely if drought continues: CEB
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said yesterday if the prevailing drought continued for the next few months, the country might be in the throes of a power crisis and that currently priority had been given to thermal and coal power generation.
CEB General Manager M.C. Wickramasinghe said hydro power generation hydro has been cut down because of the reduction in water levels in most reservoirs and added they were in contact with the Meteorology Department for any possible change in weather conditions.
We expect inter-monsoonal rains by May. We cannot predict rains just like before as the weather patterns seem to have changed now. If it did not happen we will have to face extreme conditions. We are planning statistically with the hope of facing any situation that may arise, he said.
Mr. Wickramasinghe said priority was usually given to water for irrigation and drinking purposes than to the generating of hydro-power.
As of March 16, out of the total energy requirement of 34.06 GWh, only 11.04 GWh had been generated from hydro power plants while Thermal Oil had contributed to the generation of 22.96 GWh of the total energy requirement.
As of yesterday the water levels in most of the reservoirs had reduced by a considerable amount and the water level in Kotmale was 25.3%, Victoria 53.7%, Rantembe 5.3%, Castlereagh 26.1%, Mausakelle 39.4%, Samanalawewa 30.9% and Randenigala 89.4%. (Ajith Siriwardana)
