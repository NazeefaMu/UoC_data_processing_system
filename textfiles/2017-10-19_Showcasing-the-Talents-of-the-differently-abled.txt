Each day takes us closer to October 21.

The need to create a disabled-friendly nation where there will be no difference in the abilities between the able bodied and the disabled and live in harmony with each other was what inspired ETD to launch Dirijaya Prathiba.

Parents expressed their delight over the event and the children were excitedly anticipating the day of the event.   
“We are very happy. Our children do not get many opportunities like this. So we are grateful. This gives them a chance to engage in fun activities as well as display their talents,” 20-year-old Tharuny’s mother said.   

“I am very happy. I like to dance. I will be dancing at the concert,” 16-year-old Denal said.   
“My son loves to dance. He is waiting expectantly for the show. He is heals over head with anticipation to perform at this event. He is very lucky to get such an opportunity,” 18-year-old Ashan’s mother said. 

“My daughter is a very talented dancer. The moment she is free, she listens to music and starts dancing. At school too, she likes to take part in every dancing event. The concert is a good exposure for our children,” 16-year-old Claire’s father said.   

“My son loves dancing. He likes art too. In his spare time, he either dances or draws pictures. He is a talented dancer and to develop his talent, I send him to dancing classes. Dirijaya Prathiba is a good chance to showcase the talents of our children,” 18-year-old Lahiru’s mother said. 

“My son is good at dancing. He is talented. My son and his classmates from school is taking part in Dirijaya Prathiba. The teachers from school support their talents and help develop them. It is because of the teachers that our children are doing well,” 16-year-old Nisal Peiris’ mother said.

 Witnessing the success of ETD’s efforts at the final rehearsals, the Daily Mirror spoke to some of ETD’s members. 

“The kids are enjoying themselves so much. We are so glad that our efforts are bringing happiness to many lives. All that’s left is for the public to witness their talents and cheer them on October 21 when the concert takes place. I hope that these children don’t stop their dreams from here. We hope that they take it further and carve for themselves a niche in society. We have just given them a step up. It is now up to them to pursue their dreams and improve their talents,” said Jean, a member of Enable the Disabled.   

“It has been a roller coaster ride. But when we see these happy faces, we feel that every single second that we have devoted towards organizing the event was worth it. When I look around and see how everyone came together to support our cause, it makes me feel that there is a lot of humanity in people even today,” ETD President Jezaayar Hassendeen said and summed up her feelings in four words, “Together we are one.”   

Let us also show that humanity is not lost and that hope is alive among all our people as we join each other to stand as pillars of strength by being there for them and provide the necessary space and the opportunity for the participants to overcome their disabilities and share their talents with the country through Dirijaya Prathiba 2017.
