Parliamentarian Tiran Alles along with five other Directors of the Radha Company were barred from leaving the country by the Fort Magistrate’s Court in connection with alleged fraud in companies purportedly set up to reconstruct houses for tsunami-affected people, Police said.
They said Shanthi Kumar, Gajan Kumar and their mother Anandi Shanthi Kumar, said to be directors of a fake company named Oomps textiles Ltd., were also arrested and produced in the Colombo Magistrate’s Court today.
Police said the Radha Company established in 2006 under the Chairmanship of MP Tiran Alles for the purpose of constructing houses for Tsunami-affected people in the East Coast had obtained Rs.645 million from the Treasury with the approval of the Presidential Secretariat but that no houses were constructed.
They said the companies, ‘B.M.K. Holdings’ and ‘Everest Civil Engineering’ also set up for the purpose of reconstructing houses for Tsunami affected people in the East coast, were not registered and bore false addresses.
The Police confirmed that the funds collected by the Radha Company were credited to Oomps textiles Ltd., through the abovementioned fake companies and that Rs.125 million of the funds allocated by the Treasury were fraudulently misappropriated.
They said the Radha Company was shut down in 2006, the same year it was set up.
The State funds that been paid to Oomps Textiles Ltd. had been taken over by Mr. Alles and former LTTE activist Emil Kanthan.WATCH
