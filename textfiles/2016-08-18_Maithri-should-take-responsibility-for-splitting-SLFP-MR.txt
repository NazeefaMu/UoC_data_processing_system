Maithri should take responsibility for splitting SLFP: MR


	

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today charged the yesterday’s removal of 16 SLFP electoral organizers had effectively caused a split in the SLFP and that President Maithripala Sirisena should take the responsibility for splitting the party.

Issuing a statement, he said the decision by the President to replace popular organisers of the SLFP with less popular politicians is the latest round of reprisals against SLFP members associated with the Joint Opposition.
 
“On earlier occasions, Dilum Amunugama, Salinda Dissanayake, S.M. Chandrasena, Geetha Kumarasinghe and Prasanna Ranatunga were similarly removed from their organiserships. Puttlam district parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha was suspended from the party. This persecution has effectively caused a split in the SLFP,” he said.

Sixteen electoral organizers including Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Pavithra Wanniarachchi,
Rohitha Abeygunawardena, C.B. Ratnayake, Gamini Lokuge, Kheliya Rambukwella and several others were removed from their organiserships by the President on Wednesday.

Mr. Rajapaksa said the move would weaken the SLFP and act in favour of the UNP as organizers such as
Prasanna Ranatunga, who got the highest preferential votes in the Gampaha district, had also been removed.

“These are all very popular politicians and stalwarts of the SLFP. Nationally known figures have been replaced with individuals who are either defeated candidates. Such changes are designed to weaken the SLFP and to give the UNP the upper hand when it comes to an election. The responsibility for splitting the SLFP by removing its most popular electoral organisers will finally have to be borne by the President who is the leader of the party,” he said.

He charged the removal of organisers was the second phase in a plan to destroy the SLFP and the first was the dissolving of the local government institutions.

“These local government institutions would have been immensely helpful to the party in the event of any election. Yet all these were dissolved, giving a clear advantage to the UNP. The coalition between the UNP and the SLFP was extended from two years to five years without seeking the views of the SLFP central committee. I call upon all members of the SLFP to carefully observe these moves that are being made to weaken the party and give the UNP the upper hand,” he said.
