The new European Union (EU) Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Tung-Lai Margue today said the European countries are amazed at the rapid progress made by Sri Lanka under the new government during a very short period.

He assured President Maithripala Sirisena that EU would extend fullest support to the government plans for reconciliation, economic development and social progress.

The new ambassador presented his credentials to President Sirisena at the President’s Residence today.

President Sirisena, referring to close bilateral relations with Sri Lanka and the EU member countries expressed confidence that the new envoy would strive to further strengthen bilateral friendship and cooperation in many areas including strengthening of democracy, reconciliation, trade and investment.

The President also recalled the close economic cooperation between Sri Lanka and European Union and thanked EU for lifting the fish import ban. “Now we are in a position to send more fish to Europe,” he said.

President Sirisena also expressed hope that the EU would restore the GSP Plus concession to Sri Lanka so that it could increase exports of goods, especially the garments.

Ambassador Margue said he visited the Export Fair held in Colombo yesterday and said he was highly impressed with the range of products Sri Lanka offer for the export market.

He said that he fell in love with Sri Lanka when he spent a holiday with his wife two years ago and he was very happy to come back as EU Ambassador to strengthen relations between the European Union and ‘this beautiful country’.

Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Secretary to the President P. B. Abeykoon and Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon were also present.
