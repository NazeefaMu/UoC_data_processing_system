H'tota Airport-Govt. to review agreement


	

The Government is planning to review the agreement to be signed with China Merchants Holding International Ltd for the development of the Hambantota Airport on the basis of a Public Private Partnership with a 80 per cent stake to be handed over to the company.

A government source said in any case this matter would depend on the Supreme Court ruling. The government hopes to set up an industrial park as well with Chinese investments.

Joint opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara has filed legal action against the move to transfer a stake in the port to a foreign company. (Kelum Bandara)
