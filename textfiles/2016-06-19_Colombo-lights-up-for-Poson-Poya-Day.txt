The city of Colombo came alive with Dansals and Bakthi Gee programmes during the Poson Poya Day, so as to observe the arrival of Arahat Mahinda who brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka. Picture shows devotees being served dinner at a Dansala organised on the Nawala–Narahenpita road last night. Pix by Nisal Baduge
