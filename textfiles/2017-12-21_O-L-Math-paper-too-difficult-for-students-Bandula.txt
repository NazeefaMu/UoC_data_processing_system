O/L Math paper too difficult for students: Bandula


	

The Mathematics paper of the GCE Ordinary Level Examination was extraordinarily difficult for the students, Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane claimed.

Addressing a media briefing, he said the students were psychologically affected after facing the paper and claimed that one student had committed suicide as a result.

“It is a huge injustice to the students who sat for the examination. Moreover, the allocated time for some questions was not sufficient. Even some teachers have admitted that some questions were not strictly according to the syllabus. In such a scenario, the subject Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam should pay his attention and announce his stance on the matter,” Gunawardane said.

Meanwhile, MP Sisira Jayakody said as the incumbent Government had amalgamated both the Ministry of Education and the Archaeological and Cultural Ministry, it seemed that the works of none of the Ministries were efficient and effective.

“It was reported that some Buddhist ruins in Sampur have been vandalised by unknown people recently. Yet, no action has been taken. Thus, we insist the Government to be more considerate on such incidents and take steps to conserve the valuable ruins in Sri Lanka,” Jayakody added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
