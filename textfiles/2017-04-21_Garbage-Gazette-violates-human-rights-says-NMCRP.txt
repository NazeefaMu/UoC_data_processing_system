The National Movement for Consumer Rights’ Protection (NMCRP) today condemned the gazette notice issued by President Maithripala Sirisena, stating that it violated human rights and could be used to take political revenge.

The gazette notice issued on Thursday declaring that garbage disposal by local government bodies was an ‘essential service’ and that those disrupting the collection and disposal of garbage would be arrested.

NMCRP President Ranjith Withanage said the gazette notice issued under clause 17 of the Public Safety Act has violated the Constitution exposing the Unity Government’s dictatorship even when there was no state of emergency within the country.

He said under the latest gazette notice, innocent people could be arrested without a warrant. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
