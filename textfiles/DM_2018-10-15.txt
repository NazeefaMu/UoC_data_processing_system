## Title: Commonwealth poetry oh, please. Can we have those games

Commonwealth poetry oh, please. Can we have those games
	
There was a time when people talked about the Commonwealth. Thats a distant memory now, despite the entire flurry about the Commonwealth Games a few years ago. The games became a hot topic only because of all the money to be made out of it.
No one talks about Commonwealth poetry or literature with the same excitement, because that doesnt smell of money.
The Commonwealth short story prize totals only 15,000 UK pounds, with the winner getting 5,000 pounds. It is peanuts and not enough to get any of our politicians interested in hosting a literary event.
But, while we are getting sucked more and more into the xenophobic maelstrom of believing that we are the centre of the universe, there is a vigorous stream of Commonwealth writing out there.
It isnt surprising that hardly any of our writers, in English writing or in translation, are represented in
commonwealth writing.
We have become culturally marooned on an island, quite literally, over the past few decades, unable to separate politics from culture. As the politics of the Commonwealth fade from the mind, so does the culture.
Therefore, it was interesting to come across Commonwealth Poems of Today, an anthology edited by Howard Sergeant with more than 100 poems from Australia to Cyprus, India, Ghana, Singapore and more (22 countries).
Published in 1967, it isnt contemporary; to dig it out of its shelf now is to do justice to all these poets honest labour, because poetry, the finest of all written literature, gets forgotten all too easily.
It isnt because these poems cant stand the test of time. Fifty years isnt long enough to test that. They get forgotten because of publishers whims.
Even good novelists get dropped. Poetry, followed by the short story, is scorned by many publishers, and its all too easy to drop even established poets, while publishers will keep re-issuing only the biggest names, the celebrity poets  T. S. Eliot, Pablo Neruda, W. H. Auden et al.
Hence, going through the work of these now almost forgotten Commonwealth poets (unless their work and memory are kept alive in their own countries and communities) was quite absorbing. As the editor puts it in the preface: What, then, is Commonwealth poetry One might just as well ask  What is the Commonwealthwhat, precisely, is the nature of these links among Indians, Ghanaians, Scots, Malaysians, Australians, Kenyans, Maltese, Canadians, Pakistanis, Englishmen, and many others of different nationalities
Perhaps in due course, the poetry they produce will help us towards an acceptable definition, but at present, since each of the countries concerned has its own intrinsic problems and is pursuing its own line of development, it might seem that the term Commonwealth poetry is largely one of convenience. Some of the countries of the Commonwealth may share the same problems and preoccupations, some may fit into the same general pattern, but the only thing they all have in common is the English language and literature  and many of them have other languages and literatures as well. For instance, Professor K. R. S. Iyengar says, A first look at the Indian literary scene is likely to prove most bewildering. It is said that there are nearly 200 languages and thrice as many dialects in the Indian subcontinent. Many of these have their own literatures, either oral or written. And all are implicated, to a greater or lesser extent, in the abiding life currents of the people.
Yet, this common bond of language which links over 300 million people throughout the world is one of the strongest and most important bonds they could possibly find. The introduction of English as the official language, writes J. O. Ekepenyong (in Commonwealth Literature), is one of the greatest benefits of colonialism in Nigeria. How else could communication of whatever nature among a people speaking about 250 languages and dialects have been possible without the tedious, expensive, time-consuming and sometimes unreliable, process
of interpretation...
In fact, when in response to nationalistic feeling, the Indian government proclaimed Hindi the official language of the country in 1950, it soon became evident that to discard the use of English would result in a failure of communications and would seriously impede development and progress, so that in the interest of Indian national unity it became necessary to amend the constitution to give official recognition to English parallel to Hindi.

"Sri Lanka has dropped out of the Commonwealth literary sphere"
It is strikingly noticeable that, though the constituent countries of the Commonwealth have their own cultural, social, economic and political problems to solve, each of them is beginning to use English in its own way, and each is developing its own poetic traditions (some, of course, more rapidly than others).
Though this was written in the 1960s, it is as valid now as it was then. If the term Commonwealth Poetry is largely one of convenience, was it convenient or inconvenient to replace it with
something else
Since the Commonwealth was started as a political, not cultural, phenomenon, it is worth comparing it with its replacement, which is SAARC.
SAARC has its cultural shows, but no poetry movement comparable to that of the Commonwealth, though four SAARC countries (India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh) are part of the Commonwealth, too.
The New Commonwealth of 1949 has 53 members while SAARC has only seven, but the magnitude of cultural activity cant be judged merely by size. The Maldives left the Commonwealth in 2016, but Rwanda joined it in 2009.
Among the Commonwealth poets of the 60s, there is so much talent that it seems unjust to select a few at random  but that has to be done due to lack of space.
Here are the down-to-earth, no-nonsense words of Australian David Campbell  As I was flirting with a girl,
Because my girl was playing hell,
With half a dozen different men,
Swearing from me she learnt the part,
I chanced, as she came in, to turn and catch her
Bruce Dawe, another Australian, offers us almost surrealistic imagery 
Lord, for these mariners adrift/on pains equivocal ocean,
Be the buoy bobbing on the
waters waste,
The hope of landfall as they listless lie,
In the bodys open boat, feverishly chewing,
The salt soaked leather of words for sustenance.
Canadas Raymond Souster writes with both nonchalance and biting irony, in the poem titled The man who finds love on the subway:
Some mornings are better than others
One day you find her in the first car,
Almost without a word she sits down, curls up on the seat beside you,
And before the train reaches Queen you have known her all your life, and are ready for love.
Then there are black days when you go from coach to coach and she has escaped you/or missed your train.
Taner Babbars of Cyprus says with impish humour, in Emigrants Iconoclasm:
As if a left-handed god has placed my village so dangerously on that slope,
Where even dogs sheltered their heads under rocks when barking,
Sheltered cocks, crowed always
at sunset,
Grapes taught a serious winter drunkenness.
From Ghana, poet Frank Kobina Parkes wrote obliquely about national unity in Renaissance:
Flowing streams merge with
tribalist waters
To one destined berth,
In the fullness of the ocean
All gain strength,
Sea, sea, swallow me whole,
Swallow me Niger,
Swallow me Nile,
Rivers join with national watersheds,
Making one big sea,
In the unity of the Ocean,
All are free.
Indian poet Nissim Ezekiel casts a gentle eye on human history in Philosophy with his measured, elegant verse:
There is a place to which I often go,
Not by planning to, but by a flow,
Away from all existence, to a cold,
Lucidity, whose will is uncontrolled,
Here, the mills of God are never slow,
The landscape in its geologic time,
Dissolves to show its quintessential slime,
A million stars are blotted out,
I think of each historic passion as
a blink,
That happened to the sad eye of Time.
In The Medal, Pakistani poet Tawfiq Rafat speaks in a secular voice difficult to imagine in todays religion-dominated, militarized Pakistan:
When the telegram arrived
I was combing my hair in the sun,
And gossiping with the servants,
It said the Government were sorry,
My husband was dead,
Killed in action,
For two days, I did not know what had happened
..I was invited to a ceremony where the general gave me a medal
And patted my son on the head.
Now the medal is lying in its box and is taken out less and less,
What shall I do with it
A medal has no hands, no lips, no genitals.
It is exactly what it looks like: Just another piece of bronze.
From Sri Lanka, just three poets  Patrick Fernando, Ashley Halpe and Michael Ondaatje  are included.
Ondaatjes Martinique has a cosmopolitan air typical of the age:
The music formed out of spit-filled trombones,
Seeded jazzmen appear through glares of smoked white lights:
The mercenaries creating grand irresponsibility in the dancing,
Waking the snakes in my head
Until the tongues begin to move
Like black lightning,
Me sitting in this cool
smokeless room.
Just as SAARC hasnt sprouted a comparable poetry movement (all these countries have English as a link language, except maybe Bhutan (in any case, poetry in indigenous languages can be translated into English as a SAARC cultural endeavour) one must question why Sri Lanka has dropped out of the Commonwealth
literary sphere.
In the same breath, one can wonder why Sri Lanka no longer has a poet of the calibre of Patrick Fernando writing in English.
These questions should be answered primarily by the political establishment because our culture and everything else overwhelmingly dominated by politics, and the love-hate relationship our leaders have maintained with the English language since independence is directly responsible for the decline.

## Title: Demons in Paradise and Dissent

Demons in Paradise and Dissent
	

The Jaffna International Cinema Festival, held earlier this month, lost considerable credibility, both as a film festival and as an event of international standing, following the controversial removal of Jude Ratnams courageous film, Demons in Paradise. Among many films that address ethnic violence and the armed conflict, this film is different because it critically interrogates the consequent brutal turn within Tamil militancy. The arbitrary removal of the film from the festival programme, and, worse still, the organisers vague and defensive messages, question the festivals integrity and commitment to freedom of expression. 
No doubt under pressure from Tamil nationalist quarters, the removal of the film is characteristic of the continuing intolerance of dissent in Jaffna. Even the token criticisms of some Tamil nationalists merely focused on the incidents impact on Jaffnas international standing, in line with their broader engagement with international actors as saviours of Tamil victims. Having received international acclaim, Ratnams film ultimately seeks introspection from the Tamil community, and the denial of such a debate in Jaffna is unacceptable.
Personal journey
A decade after the war, there have been many works on ethnic violence, the civil war, its devastating last phase and continuing trauma in the aftermath. There was initially a rush of works by foreign journalists capitalizing on Sri Lanka as a place of crisis. These works, for the most part, reified Tamil victim-hood. However, in recent years a few important works have appeared by literary figures and political activists, which deeply and critically contemplate on the tragic predicament facing the Tamil community. Among them, Ratnams film makes a critical intervention by opening up a conversation within the Tamil community about its past and future. 

"Demons in Paradise is a work of deep engagement in the spirit of The Broken Palmyrah, tracing the contradictions and struggles of generations of Tamils"
One gains a sense of James Joyces perspective that all great works of art are autobiographical. The film is narrated by Ratnam himself as he brings out the agony of his own struggle to come to terms with the war. Ratnams voice and the films flow dovetail with his journey in the shadow of an uncle who joined a small leftist Tamil militant group, the National Liberation Front of Tamil Eelam (NLFT). In following Ratnams personal journey and internal turmoil, the viewers are brought to engage their own tumultuous relationship to the war. 
The film does not put forward any simple moral and logical explanations; for example, to the response of the Tamil community to LTTEs massacre of the militants belonging to the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), or for that matter, the end of the war with the decimation of the LTTE and the massacre of civilians. Ratnams film, however, pushes its viewers to open their hearts and question their responsibility.
Spirit of The Broken Palmyrah
It was now the end of an era. A struggle that had, in its dawn, been fired by several noble ideals, and called forth courage and much sacrifice from young persons irrespective of group, had now reached a point where the community was powerless and voiceless. 
The Tigers history, their theoretical vacuum, lack of political creativity, intolerance and fanatical dedication will be the ultimate cause of their own break up. The legendary Tigers will go to their demise with their legends smeared with the blood and tears of victims of their own misdoings. A new Tiger will not emerge from their ashes. Only by breaking with this whole history and its dominant ideology, can a new liberating outlook be born. 
These were the words of the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) in The Broken Palmyrah, perhaps one of the most important works on the war, written three decades ago in a time of escalating violence. A deeply sympathetic concern for the youth who joined armed movements and the internal torture and internecine massacres are also a central theme in Ratnams film. 

"It was now the end of an era. A struggle that had, in its dawn, been fired by several noble ideals, and called forth courage and much sacrifice from young persons irrespective of group, had now reached a point where the community was powerless and voiceless"
Sadly, the end of an era that the authors of The Broken Palmyrah saw three decades ago, has yet to find space for genuine reflection within the Tamil community. Ratnams project is one of prying open that space for discussion on the legacy of violence within. The powerless state of the Tamil community continues to this day, and is as much a consequence of the devastation of war as it is the suppression of political alternatives to rebuilding a war-torn community. 
Demons in Paradise is a work of deep engagement in the spirit of The Broken Palmyrah, tracing the contradictions and struggles of generations of Tamils as they seek to come to terms with the protracted armed conflict. Some of them were older observers, others participants in armed struggle, and still others, like Ratnam, who from his childhood to the current moment is struggling to understand what went wrong and how the Tamil community might address its own vicious legacy. 
Should not the Tamil community as a whole take some responsibility for the youth whose lives were cut short rather than hide behind the discourse of Tamil victim-hood Is it not time to finally break with the dominant nationalist ideology and begin the search for a new political outlook
Path ahead
Returning to the removal of Demons in Paradise from the film festival, how does one respond to such cowardly acts of silencing Significantly, neither the film maker nor those who identify with Tamil dissent called for a boycott of the film festival. Indeed, the politics of boycott has become the curse of Tamil nationalist politics, a politics that is lazy to engage and struggle for alternative ways of moving forward. 
On the opening day of the film festival, three leftist intellectuals participated in a panel discussion on a local TV station in Jaffna to debate the silencing of Demons in Paradise. Such critical engagement is what we need, rather than a boycott, which would likely have been the reaction of Jaffnas crass Tamil nationalist lobby if the film had been screened as planned. Demons in Paradise is precisely trying to question such politics and kindle the conscience of a community that has been numbed by decades of Tamil nationalism and the LTTEs totalitarian rule. 

"The film is precisely trying to question such politics and kindle the conscience of a community that has been numbed by decades of Tamil nationalism and the LTTEs totalitarian rule"
One of the most powerful scenes of Demons in Paradise is a fireside discussion among a number of ex-militants from the various Tamil militant movements, including the LTTE. Such critical reflection by a generation that was brutalized by war and saw tremendous losses is an important testament for collective responsibility. The fire for introspection should be kept alive rather than allowed to fizzle out through the silencing of dissent. 
The path ahead for the Tamil community is necessarily linked to self-criticism. Those concerned about the future, including that of the younger generations, cannot leave it to the pomp of so-called international film festivals. Screening Demons in Paradise and organising public discussions and debates on such critical works in Jaffna is the need of the hour.

Freedom, Democracy, Human Rights and the US - EDITORIAL
	
iberal-minded Sri Lankans have for long looked on the US as a bastion of democracy, a defender of freedom, democratic values and a promoter of human rights the world over.
The various statements made by the different arms of the US government condemning perceived human rights violations -as during Sri Lankas three-decade long ethnic war; election malpractice -as in Russias presidential election; authoritarian behaviour of governments cracking down on peaceful protests - as at Chinas Tianamen Square- has given credence to this belief, particularly among Colombos English-speaking middle and upper class.
Additionally, the US, through a plethora of privately funded organisations and its official development arm (USAID) generously contributes, financially and materially to civil society activist groups whose activites range from compiling lists of human rights abuses, to election monitors and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) involved in poverty alleviation programmes.
The help extends from payment of administrative costs including salaries and travel to social activists, to even helping poor folk participate in various activities organised by local civil society groups, via emoluments to participants who would otherwise have to forego a days wage to participate in programmes. It also includes payment for venues, speakers/lecturers, food and beverage, travel grants to the venue and back, in addition to costs of printed material etc.
In-house training as well as international training programmes (for the English-speaking leadership of activist groups) are held outside the country to help activists understand the needs of the funding partner. Seminars, conferences, skills-based training programmes and many other programmes are organised by international backers to help activists to identify the most important problems which affect them, their people and country. It also provides training to vocalize and publicize these issues.
By mischance perhaps, aid is granted only to programmes which fall within parameters drawn up by USAID to groups conversant in English. Not surprisingly therefore the US is recognised by recipients of its largesse as the upholder of democratic values and THE guarantor of human rights worldwide. The plethora of training programmes, conferences etc., has blinded them to the extent that they cannot see the trees for the wood.
In the early 1970s, in the aftermath of the first JVP uprising we saw the birth of the first activist group in the form of the Civil Rights Movement demanding justice, protesting torture and indiscriminate killing of young people suspected to be involved in that uprising. The group was born of the conviction of its small membership and maintained without any external funds. Its voice rattled the powers that be of the day, was heard internationally, forced accountability of the state and brought to an end the extra judicial killings of that era.
Following on, it created awareness on the bloody birth of Bangladesh, the dangers of the Prevention of Terrorism Act of the 1980s and the role of US imperialism in supporting apartheid in South Africa and overthrowing governments from Iran to Latin America to help US multinational companies exploiting those countries. All without foreign funds, no large staff, but having maximum impact.
Today our local human rights groups do not raise their voices against human rights violations under Israeli occupation of Palestine, or the US vetoing any discussion of ongoing atrocities against Palestinians at the United Nations (UN).
While the US brought a motion of censure against Sri Lanka at the UN for actions which occurred during the closing stages of the near three decade-long civil war, this self-same US turns a blind eye to ongoing atrocities committed in Yemen where a coalition led by Saudi Arabia is continuing to bomb Yemeni civillians using weapons provided by the US. Saudi Arabia has also imposed a land sea and air blockade of that country. The UN has described Saudis action in Yemen as having created a humanitarian disaster.
Today Saudi Arabia also stands accused of brutally interrogating, torturing, killing and dismembering US resident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi for being critical of Saudis de facto ruler Prince Mohamed bin Salman.
Yet the US refuses to condemn the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Saudi Arabia against Yemenis or the brutal murder of one of its own residents by the Saudi regime.
According to US President Trump, he cannot endanger the billion dollar arms deal with the Saudis.

Further import controls unnecessary unless fuel prices rise: Malik
	
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said yesterday further import cuts would not be necessary unless there was a sharp rise in fuel prices in the global market.
Mr. Samarawickrama told Daily Mirror that things appeared to have stabilized at the moment.
Asked about his recent visit to Bangladesh, he said he explored the possibility of developing the apparel industry for the benefit of both countries. For example, he pointed out that Bangladeshi apparels such as Jeans and T-shirts could be warehoused in Sri Lanka for re-export after some form of value addition.
There are opportunities to this effect. We held talks with those involved in the apparel industry in Bangladesh. There will be a delegation coming here to explore the possibilities that exist here, he said.
He said Sri Lanka could be used as a hub for Bangladeshi products to be exported to foreign markets after value addition.
Asked about opportunities that exist in Bangladesh, he said Sri Lankans could seek investment opportunities in that country in areas such as construction, energy and rubber products. (Kelum Bandara)

He said even though the prosecution in the indictment had stated that the incidents had taken place from 2014 onwards, it had in fact begun in 2011 and as such the defense was unable to handle the case without the mentioned documents and requested court to direct the FCID to provide those documents to the defense.
The others in the case are: Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation's former director Piyadasa Kudabalage, Samurdhi Development Department's former director general Neil Bandara Hapuhinna and Lasantha Bandara. The four accused were indicted on charges of criminal misappropriation of public funds amounting to Rs.500 million. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

Govt. is likely to freeze fuel prices temporarily
	
The budget 2019 is likely to freeze the much criticized fuel pricing formula temporarily for a few months and also bring down the fuel prices in the domestic market to ease the hardships faced by the low income families, a senior Cabinet minister said yesterday.
The minister told Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity for obvious reasons that the freezing of the fuel pricing formula would be initially for three months as the government expects that the global fuel prices would drop considerably in early 2019.
If there was a sharp drop of fuel prices in the global market, the government would pass the benefit to the local consumer for sure. But for the moment there is no sign of fuel price reduction in the near future in the international market. The government has come to the edge of hiking fuel prices and not in a position to increase further on November 10 as usual. The government expects the freezing of pricing formula and bringing down fuel prices would also contribute to reduce prices of essential commodities, services and tariffs of utility services, he stressed.
The government would keep a close watch on the price fluctuation of fuel in the international market and reactivate the fuel pricing formula with the easing of prices, he added.
He implied that the fuel price reduction in the domestic market would be done through tax cuts on fuel imports and distribution via the budget 2019.
The Finance Ministry introduced the fuel pricing formula effective from May 11. A five member committee of officials was appointed to review the global fuel prices on 10th of each month and decide on prices of fuel in the domestic market.
Deputy Secretary to the Ministry of Finance heads the committee. Representatives from the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development, Public Enterprises and Fiscal Policy Department, President and Prime Minister are other members of the committee. The committee most probably will not meet on November 10 to decide fuel prices in November - December period, the Minister noted.

How many politicians can truthfully say they are clean: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena while speaking to a gathering in Mahara on Saturday (13) wanted to know how many politicians dare to come up on stage and say they are clean and that they do not plunder the wealth of the people and charged that such politicians were scarce these days.
He said the top officials in the government sector too were prone to following in the footsteps of politicians these days.
The President said graft was well entrenched in the political culture of Sri Lanka, and people were voting for the same set of politicians at successive elections despite being aware that they were thieves.
If we can prevent the loss of revenue due to corruption and fraudulent activities in this country bridging the budget deficit would not be a difficult task.

It is better to resign if it's everyone's wish: IGP
	
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara said yesterday that it would be better for him to resign if it were the wish of everyone that he do so.
He said this in response to questions about his decision to resign raised by journalists.
In reply the IGP said, I think I have done enough. I have been working for the police department for 33 years. I have not taken even a pittance from anyone. It is known to those concerned. I earned only the goodwill of people and my self-respect. If I receive only brickbats despite my yeoman service then there is no use in me sticking on for much longer. What is left for me now is the love and care my mother and family have for me. Some callous individuals have posted digitally superimposed pictures of my mother on facebook. I can bear the criticism levelled against me. Yet, I cannot bear the fact that my mother is being humiliated in this manner,"
(The IGP became very emotional while uttering these words). He re-iterated that he was neither a thief nor a cheat. He wanted to know just what would be left of his dignity if he was branded a rogue in this manner.
"You will probably not believe me when I tell you I do not even own a house. I have to get one now on rent at least so that my family has a place to stay," he said.
Asked whether there was a request by the President for him to resign or not, he said, "There was no such request. But, I got the idea that both the President and the Prime Minister want me gone. If they do not have confidence in me it is of no use me staying on any longer.
Asked about remarks that he could not be removed without a motion being adopted by Parliament, he said ,"Some say I cannot be removed. There are others who say I can. There is no use debating these things. The matter will be put to rest once I resign," IGP Jayasundara said.
Asked when he would do so, he said, I am contemplating it at the moment."(Sujith Hewajulige)

## Title: Lines of Fire within Mark Fields Paternalist Message

Lines of Fire within Mark Fields Paternalist Message
	

Mark Fields visit to Sri Lanka is very, very significant. His pronouncements are threaded by the paternalistic air of an Etonian schoolmaster pontificating to students. That should not be allowed to mask the Sword of Damocles that is above the Sri Lankan body via the UNHCR as the instrument of the Western international community.
Fields title as Minister for Asia and the Pacific gives the game away. In the Pacific Ocean USAs Pacific Asia Command (PAC) holds the commanding military heights. In the Indian Ocean USAs massive base at Diego Garcia plays watchdog for the West. Diego Garcia atoll and island, let me remind readers,. was handed over to USA by UK in December 1966/68 through a process which forcefully removed all its indigenized Chagossian inhabitants  one of the most horrendous human rights violations of the 20th century imposed on a harmless body of people.

"The US Ambassador in Colombo, Robert Blake, consistently pressurized the GoSL to institute ceasefire spells"

However, it is Mark Fields message to Sri Lankans -- threats wrapped in cotton really  that we must reflect upon. The Western power talons driving this project were displayed in a striking ethnographic encounter in in the UNHCR Office corridors in Geneva in September 2011 when the US ambassador to that Council, one Eileen Donahue, turned on the Sri Lankan ambassador in some fury and said, Well get you next time!
This incident lays bare the roots of the Western-cum-UN project: for which we must go back to the years 2008/09 and the last phase of Eelam War IV. It is by happen chance, that I have been working up a summarizing article on the politics of Eelam War IV in its last phase at this very moment. Let me spell out pertinent points in capsule form.
A - A secret meeting was convened in Kuala Lumpur in February 2009 involving the head of LTTE International, Kumaran Pathmanathan (KP), plus Rudrakumaran and Jay Maheswaran plus three Norwegian diplomats -- a meeting that clearly had the full backing of USA -- in order to resolve the warring situation in Lanka and, ostensibly, to prevent a potential humanitarian catastrophe involving a massive death toll among the Tamil civilian population corralled by the LTTE.
B - This gathering was preceded or accompanied by the insertion of a PAC recce team into the island to work out the ways and means of effecting this forcible intervention.
C - The Western powers seemed oblivious (conveniently) to the fact that the LTTE had assembled the civilians in the battle theatre precisely to invite their intervention  so that they in fact became the LTTEs partners in war.
D - The despatches disclosed by Wikileaks show that, in line with this partisanship and alliance, the US Ambassador in Colombo, Robert Blake, consistently pressurized the GoSL Ministers to institute ceasefire spells, while recognizing that Pirapharan would never agree to the stilling of his guns  so that ceasefire in his book was a one-way street And furthermore, 
E -  that, in Despatch 32 January 2, 2009 reporting on the outcomes of a meeting with President Mahinda Rajapaksa to work out measures for the re-settlement of Tamil IDPS, Blake summarily dismissed any reliance on the Social Services Minister: Douglas Devananda, he stressed, would not be a suitable choice because his paramilitary, the EPDP, had been responsible for the killings and abductions of large numbers of Tamils in Jaffna. Blake seems to have been blissfully unaware of the stark contradiction resting in his own hand: namely, that USA was sustaining the LTTE as a political entity  Tigers who had piled up a list of massacres, assassinations and huge bomb blast attacks in civilian space that was longer than the proverbial arm While we must also note 

"Collective identity and belonging are subjective conditions of being moulded over time by many factors"

F - That in another despatch (No. 308 of March 19, 2009) Blake indicated that he had met the Foreign Minister Bogollagama on March 18, and warned him that the deaths of  tens of thousands of civilians  would cause an international outcry, likely subject the GSL to war crime charges, and almost certainly undermine public support in the U.S. and other donor countries for future reconstruction efforts in the north.
G - So that this body of evidence led me to this conclusion: the international cabal was working within the framework of LTTE strategy [and] in effect encouraging the Tigers to sustain their use of the civilians as a defensive formation and a raison detre for international intervention. The Sword of Damocles in the form of war crimes, therefore, was held over the head of one party to the conflict in a manner that slotted in neatly with the grand strategy of the other party, the LTTE. In other words, in blithely positioning itself as international arbiter, and wrapping itself with a humanitarian cloak, USA, the UN bureaucrats working as American agents and its other international allies (embracing AI, HRW and ICG) were aiding and abetting the LTTE.
H -  and that, as revealed by Daya Gamage, the thinking behind this programme was directed by a line of policy worked out by the US embassy in Sri Lanka from the late 1970s, This policy was revealed quite explicitly by Michael Owens, an Under Secy of State in Washington, on the May 6, 2009: they had to find a way for the LTTE to surrender arms possibly to a third party in the context of a pause in the fighting, to surrender their arms in exchange for some sort of limited amnesty to at least some members of the LTTE and the beginning of a political process.
I  The political process that Owens was referring to has always been devolution in American eyes. It is also the trump card favoured today by such well-meaning agencies as the National Peace Council and the Centre for Policy Alternatives  and, as we can see from his benign presentation, none other than the British Minister for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field.

"Intl cabal was working within the framework of LTTE strategy in effect encouraging Tigers to sustain their use of the civilians as a defensive formation"
I am directed here by the long view of a historian wary of well-meant solutions that generate fresh and/or deeper problems. From this nave position I suggest that what Sri Lanka requires is an ingenious constitutional scheme that provides the SL Tamils of the north, those of the Eastern Province and those in Colombo District some clout in the centre and in the Cabinet so that they are brought into the heart of power in an integrated manner. They must reap the benefits (and shortcomings) of any political system so that they develop a stake within it. 
This line of gerrymandering must also be bolstered by policies that address identity and subjectivity. The tendency for some Sinhala-speakers to equate the category Sinhala with Lnkika must be undermined. The categorization of ethnic in the census compilations and National Identity Card bureau must be re-jigged in radical fashion to generate a selection of labels that enables each individual a choice from; viz.
sinhala lankika
demala lankika.
marakkala lankika
ja lankika
lansi lankika
kolomba chetti lankika
mishra lankika
AND last but not least
lankika..
Without addressing and reforming the political vocabulary in the vernacular, we cannot expect constitutions to yield the fruits fondly imagined by their framers.
Again, the national anthem must be re-jigged for state occasions so that it is sung in Sinhala and Tamil in the alternate style favoured by the Kiwi and South African rugger teams. The unveiling of this operation to the Sri Lankan people should be at Premadasa Cricket Stadium where a trained choir as well as the pre-prepared cricket team introduce this scheme of patriotic commitment to the public.
Such measures will not produce immediate results. Collective identity and belonging are subjective conditions of being moulded over time by many factors.
Many hands and many modalities of expression must be deployed in the hard yards required for the mind-work that is involved in moulding subjectivity in ways that will assist reconciliation. There is no quick fix.

Note dropped in a school complaint box helps net pervert
	
Hettipola Police said that a 52-year-old man who had been sexually abusing an under-raged girl for a period of 10 months, had been arrested.
A police officer said yesterday (14) that the girl who was allegedly abused had been sent for a medical examination. She was identified as a grade six student of a school in the Hettipola Police division who had been living with her grandparents due to a dispute she had with her parents.
The teaching staff of the girl's school had been alerted to her plight after reading an anonymous letter written by her and dropped into the complaint box put in place by the school authorities to help students with anything they need help with to come forward and request for it anonymously. In her note she had shared that an uncle from the neighbourhood used to come to our house and had had regularly had intercourse with her and begged the school authorities to put him behind bars so that she could live in peace.
The staff had taken the decision to inform the OIC of the Hettipola Police about the matter. A woman constable in civvies had gone to the school in this connection and the girl had informed her that she had been sexually abused by a person who was a friend of her grandfather.
After police investigations, the suspect who had been sexually abusing the girl for about 10 months, had been taken into custody. Further investigations are been carried out by a team of police officers coming under Hettipola Police IP Ananda Rajapakse.(Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)

PHU to seek Court of Appeal  assistance against Vijayakala
	
While claiming that the legal action against MP Vijayakala Maheswaran was not taken in a proper manner on her statement on the resurgence of the LTTE, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said it would seek legal assistance at the Court of Appealagainst MP Vijayakala.
Addressing a news briefing today, PHU Propaganda Secretary Thushara Dissanayake said the Police had carried out a wishy-washy investigation into the Vijayakalas statement.
Vijayakalas statement has breached Article 114, 115, and 120 of the Penal Code, Article three of the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No 56 of 2007 and the Article 157 (a) of the Sri Lankan Constitution, Dissanayake said,
According to the Article 3 (3) of the ICCPR, a person who shall, directly or indirectly support or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka, is subject to a Rigorous Imprisonment less than 10 years,
According to the Article 3 (4), bail cant be granted to such offences and it can be only granted by the High Court under special circumstances, Dissanayake added.
He said the B Report (B 95666/1/18) submitted by the Police to the court, had been complied without mentioning Article 3 of the ICCPR.
It is apparent that the B Report has been compiled in a shrewd way that it would facilitate Vijayakala to be granted bail, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Pushpa Iriyagolla Dharmasena: Demise of a dear lady
	
All who knew late Pushpa Irriyagolla grieve her untimely death almost a month ago. She was so hale and hearty.  Most of us find it difficult to fathom this loss, as she was such a lively lady enjoying life with Cecil, daughter Yoshitha and Son, Nishan, daughter in law and grandson. A gracious and a simple lady, Pushpa touched the hearts of all who knew her- be it at Visakha Vidyalaya, the school she studied before she entered the Peradeniya University, and at the Pushpdana College where she started as a teacher.
Pushpa, born on November 20, 1941, hails from a well to do family, the head being, Late
I.M.R.A. Iriyagolla, a one-time Minister of Education, who left an incredible mark as a Minister years ago.
The Late Mr Irriyagolla and his wife late Ranee Iriyagolla made an impact on the life of Pushpa whether studies and interests or outlook, especially in writing.
Pushpa with such fully fledged background education and influence of her late father and late mother and her natural talent started writing from her very young days.
As she grew she became a prolific writer in late stages in life, where she developed her writing skills as she had a partner at home Cecil who too continues to write. Both contributed their skills to writing much-valued articles in many publications.
She was also a keen follower of drama, from school days, and in entering Peradeniya University, was selected with me to be a member of the choir of Sinhabahu the famous drama of one of the great personalities late Prof Ediriweera Sarachchandra, who with his writing and drama and other cultural promotions is still revered at local and international levels.
We felt privileged to be in this choir which took us to many parts of Sri Lanka as this famous drama was much in demand and enjoyed by drama lovers. I feel this influence as ardent students of this great Teacher helped us to develop our writing. Pushpa continued to be engaged writing verse along with prose where she was a contributor to many an article.
I owe a lot to her as she was a positive supporter of my writing of Sinhalese novels contributing with much-valued suggestions. Like many close friends who miss her, Cecil will miss her association as a close companion in writing and a dutiful husband, so will Yoshitha, Nishan and his family.
Pushpa will be missed by her students as she was a committed teacher assisting her students as she started her career as a teacher at Pushpadana and later on in her retirement as a teacher in English at the Sub Department of English University. We all knew her as a professional facilitator in English taking much interest to give a helping hand to those whose need was great to develop their English knowledge.
One factor we value in her life that even though she hailed from a family with the political background she never got involved in the day-to-day politics, rather continued to b actively involved in social work.
Pushpa imbibed well of her family especially her brother Late Gamini who was a top Civil servant Sri Lanka produced.
May she attain Nibbana!

Minister Sarath Fonseka said today the removal of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) would not resolve the issues faced by the police department unless action was taken against the senior police officials in charge of police divisions such as the Organised Crimes Preventive Division.
I highly criticized in parliament certain shortcomings of the police department. Specially, I criticized the conduct of the senior police officials of the organized crimes Preventive division who had responsibility to control the crimes in the country. The increase in the crime rate is due to the conduct of the senior police officials, he told journalists following a function held at his ministry.
When asked about reports that IGP Pujith Jayasundara was expected to be appointed as the ambassador to South Korea, the minister said there was no issue in his appointment as he was a public servant who had served the country for a long period of time.
We have a history of IGPs who were sacked being appointed as ambassadors, he said.

Statement issued by the National Peace Council Increased care for victims of conflict now possible
	

The passage of legislation establishing an Office for Reparations is another significant step forward in the transitional justice process aimed at healing the wounds of war and bringing a lasting solution to Sri Lankas ethnic conflict. In October 2015 the Government of Sri Lanka committed itself before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to embark upon a path of national reconciliation while meeting international standards. The government pledges included setting up an Office of Missing Persons, a Truth Commission, an Office for Reparations and a Special Court. The time period given to Sri Lanka comes to an end in March 2019.
The three-decade-long war led to immense human suffering amongst all the ethnic communities. The National Peace Council welcomes the government initiative to establish the Office for Reparations. We are disappointed, however, at the relatively low parliamentary turn out to ratify the law with it being ratified by a margin of only 59- 43 in a parliament of 225 members. It is a cause for regret that less than one-half of the parliamentarians saw it as their duty to attend the parliamentary sitting and to cast their own votes. This lack of conviction amongst the parliamentarians, and their failure to vote in favour of the new institution may have been prompted by the campaign to falsely describe the Office for Reparations as a mechanism to give succour to the LTTE and thereby pave the way again for the division of the country. This is a false allegation and the people in general and victim population in particular need to be educated on this score.

"The three-decade-long war led to immense human suffering amongst all the ethnic communities. The National Peace Council welcomes the government initiative to establish the Office for Reparations"
The National Peace Council calls on the Government, media and civil society to take special measures in this regard.
This is an opportunity for the government, political parties and public and civic institutions that failed in the past to make amends for our failures. We believe that the Office for Reparations can provide a strong message of care to the conflict-affected populations living in all parts of the country due to the several conflicts that have taken place during the countrys post-independent history. These include the recent anti-Muslim riots and the two JVP insurrections that took place in 1971 and again in 1988-89 in which much violence was perpetrated on
innocent people.
The legislation establishing the Office for Reparations leaves it to the new institution to set out the criteria regarding those who are eligible
for reparations.

"The passage of legislation establishing an Office for Reparations is another significant step forward in the transitional justice"

As the four mechanisms incorporated in the transitional justice process are related to each other, the findings of the Office of Missing Persons which has already been established will provide one basis for reparations. There will also be a need to have the consultation with the people who have been affected by conflict to identify eligibility criteria. We call on the government and international community to fully resource the Office for Reparations so that it may have the capacity to deliver the material and non-material dues to those affected by conflicts that successive governments failed to resolve through peaceful means.

STAX outlines a three-step approach to effective crisis leadership
	
Poor leadership is costliest during a crisis. When two security officers forcibly removed a passenger off an overbooked United Airlines flight last April, viral video footage of the incident led to widespread outrage and prompted customers to call for a boycott. Back then, CEO Oscar Munozs perfunctory corporate apology did little to alleviate tensions. Long after United reached an out-of-court settlement with the plaintiff, consumers continued to express grievances against airlines, with the U.S. Department of Transportation logging a 13% increase in complaints in the six months following the incident.
Several other business scandals threatened corporate reputations last year; hastening the downfall of several high-profile business leaders, from Ubers Travis Kalanick to Equifaxs Richard Smith. These incidents lead us to question: How should leaders manage during a crisis
Much has already been written on the topic, as Daniel McGinn aptly summarizes in a recent Harvard Business Review article. The challenge is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to crisis management. Instead, it may serve leaders better to amass stories of successful crisis management and extract coping mechanisms from these narratives. As a starting point, this article offers three vignettes of effective crisis leadership.
1. Dr Gregory Ciottone and the World Trade Center: The Importance of Squaring Things Away
Imagine going from sleeping to mobilizing for an activation order from the Office of Emergency Preparedness, all in a matter of minutes.
Dr Gregory Ciottone, a physician specializing in Disaster Medicine and Counter-Terrorism Medicine, had been sleeping off a night shift in the emergency department when he first received a colleagues call notifying him of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
As he watched the attacks unfold on TV, DrCiottone considered the role he would have to play in this crisis. At the time, he was the commander of a Level 1 Federal Disaster Medical Team, part of the National Disaster Medical System in the U.S. - one of about 20 teams in the country. Designated Massachusetts 2, Level 1 teams like DrCiottones were the first ones out the door in the event of a federal disaster.
It didnt take long to receive the call from Washington, D.C.: DrCiottone. Massachusetts 2 is activated. Get your team and your cash and supplies to Stuarts Air Force Base just north of New York city. As quickly as possible and any way you can.
As DrCiottone recounted, When youre a leader in a crisis like this, there are a few things you need to do. We call it compartmentalizing, putting things in a package and putting that package away. The military sometimes calls it squaring things away, locking things down. These are personal issues, personal things.
By squaring things away, DrCiottone was not only able to lead 54 people into the challenging terrain of Ground Zero but lead each member out safely at the end of their two-week deployment.
2. Mary Barra and General Motors: Taking Ownership of Failure and Diffusing Power to Act
Shortly after Mary Barra became the first female CEO of General Motors, the automaker was hit with an ignition switch debacle that led to at least 124 deaths, the eventual recall of some 29 million vehicles worldwide, class action lawsuits with thousands of claimants and investigations by regulators and Congress. Despite these crises, Barras skillful stewardship of GM propelled her to the top of Fortunes list of Most Powerful women in 2015 and kept her there for three straight years.
Barra did something very right early on - she took ownership of failure.
"We didn't do our jobs," Barra said in a 15-minute briefing that was broadcast throughout the company. "As part of our apology to the victims, we promised to take responsibility for our actions."
Barra apologized publicly and profusely, visited the families of victims, and set up a compensation fund for them before any legal liability had been established. Barra also conducted an internal probe that resulted in the firing of 15 employees and instated new policies that prompted workers to flag problems.
I never want to put this behind us, she told employees. I want to keep this painful experience permanently in our collective memories.
Recognizing that crises involve many moving pieces, Barra also diffused the power to act throughout the company. As she pointed out, When you are in a crisis, its not like you have perfect information on day one. In our situation specifically, we learned we had an issue, and we acted. But then there was a lot to unfold.
To infuse the situation with clarity, Barra created a small team which met daily for anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours. One of the actions taken was a read-across, which is done when theres an issue in vehicle safety. The team systematically investigated whether the problem could be happening in other vehicles.
By taking ownership of failure at the helm and diffusing the power to act throughout an organization, leaders can help build a sense of internal clarity even amidst incomplete information.
3. James Burke and Johnson & Johnson: Customer-Centric Problem Solving and Media Transparency
In 1982, Johnson & Johnsons Tylenol medication commanded 35% of the U.S. over-the-counter analgesic market. However, things took a damaging turn after an assassin in the Chicago area introduced cyanide into Extra-Strength Tylenol bottles across several pharmacies. The drug tampering resulted in seven deaths over the span of a few days. The brands market share also sagged to 7%.
What set apart Johnson & Johnsons handling of the crisis was their credo to place customers first. As negative media coverage mounted, company chairman James Burke formed a seven-member strategy team. Burkes guidance was first, How do we protect the people and second How do we save this product
The company also reacted fast. Through the media, Johnson & Johnson immediately alerted customers nationwide to stop consuming any type of Tylenol product until the extent of the tampering could be ascertained. The company also put a stop to Tylenol advertising and ordered a national recall of the product; amounting to 31M bottles of capsules.
Withdrawing all Tylenol was a costly move, but it showed that customer safety was the priority. In addition, the company maintained open lines of communication. In the first week of the crisis, Johnson & Johnson established a 1-800 hotline for worried customers. They also established a toll-free line for news organizations to call and receive pre-taped messages with updated statements about the crisis. Johnson & Johnson also engaged the public through several major press conferences, with James Burke going on 60 Minutes and The Donahue Show to articulate key messages.
Through these well-timed and proactive measures, the public came to view Johnson & Johnson as the victim of a malicious crime - paving the way for a rare comeback.
Take-aways
As a starting point, the simple principles evident in these stories - squaring things away, taking ownership of failure, diffusing the power to act, prioritizing the customer in problem-solving and ensuring media transparency - should serve most leaders well.
However, each crisis is unique. Some, like the events of 9/11, happen at warp speed and give leaders very little time to react. Others, like GMs ignition switch scandal, might unravel over years but are no less challenging to manage. In this sense, crisis management can look very different across leaders, teams and situations. This means that every leader must be prepared to consider - ahead of time - the nuances of their company and industry that may potentially impact crisis response across a range of situations.
It is also worth remembering that strong crisis leadership is difficult without a strong sense of purpose. The leaders who effectively shepherd others through difficult situations tend to deeply value the company or team they represent. In a pinch, these leaders are not only able to fall back on core values when making pivotal decisions, but they can take the view that their organization and broader purpose is larger than the crisis that has enveloped them. Where such dynamics are lacking, leaders need to first work on cementing core values and infusing a sense of purpose.

UNP suffered because of rifts between the late leaders: Navin
	
Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake at a public meeting in Anamaduwa said, the United National Party (UNP) suffered because of rifts between the late leaders such as former President R. Premadasa and Gamini Dissanayake, and hoped a similar feud would not arise between him and his colleague Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The Minister said there was a hard time ahead for the party.
If we act properly, we can succeed. Our political opposition is also riddled with problems. They are yet to decide who is to be fielded next time as their candidate. We have to read the pulse of the people and act. We have to carry out an internal struggle within the party. We will field a candidate who is capable of winning, he said.
The Minister said he endured many hardships during his political career. Also, he said a grave injustice had been caused to districts such as Puttalam and Matale as no one from these areas had been picked as Cabinet Ministers.

Whats SLs role in Security Co-operation in the Indian Ocean
	

elivering the keynote address at yet another Indian Ocean conference, titled The Indian Ocean  Defining our Future at Temple Trees last week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asked a very pertinent question: Is it relevant to talk about freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean where relative calm prevails, and freedom of navigation has largely been respected Given the importance of the Indian Ocean, he said, the question should be whether we can leave its security and stability to chance. Shouldnt we take advantage of the benign strategic atmosphere that exists to create a maritime order in the Indian Ocean that can withstand challenges that may emerge in the future
A pivotal geographic location has made it incumbent on Sri Lanka to assert itself in dialogues relating to the Indian Ocean (IO). In these discussions Sri Lanka seems to be taking a lead role in the area of safety and security. But even as the Indian Ocean-related conferences become more frequent, and regional formations like BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) and IORA (Indian Ocean Rim Association) come to the fore, it becomes evident that for smaller states, achieving the goal of economic integration and advancement alongside peace and security in the IO, is easier said than done.
One reason is that while the goals of the smaller states mainly relate to the trade, investment, technology etc., this is not the case with big powers. For them there is inevitably a contest to gain strategic advantage for themselves, and to rally regional support in that exercise. Adding to the familiar tensions between big-brother India and its neighbours, the IO has now become the locus of intense contest for influence between extra-regional powers, China and the US. In this situation smaller states will need to guard against being used unwittingly as a cats paw by any big power against its rivals. Some of the most forthright questions relating to security in the IO came from students of the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) last Wednesday during the Q&A following a talk on Shared Vision for the Indian Ocean through IORA by Prof. Anil Sooklal, Deputy Director General, Department of International Relations and Cooperation, South Africa, at the BCIS, Colombo. Students, unlike politicians, dont have agendas. One question was, given the fact that IORAs dialogue partners belong to different camps, Are we not subjecting the organization to the same power rivalry (IORAs dialogue partners are Japan, Germany, China, UK, USA, France and Egypt.) Other questions related to IORAs response to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project under Chinas Belt and Road initiative (causing tensions with India), how will IORA be affected by the maritime expansion of China and Japan, and why is Pakistan excluded from IORA (will India take a leadership role)There were no ready answers to these questions. Hostility has been there throughout history, we need to rally to the challenge Prof. Sooklal said. With regard to the possibility of power camps emerging his response suggested that IORAs policy of working through consensus had enabled the organisation to withstand pressures better than others. Pakistans application for membership was opposed, so it was turned down he said. Sooklal who was a panelist at the conference at Temple Trees the next day, worried about the increasing militarization of the Indian Ocean space, saying we have been slow to shape the narrative. In the maritime sphere, Sri Lanka has a lot on its plate. Last month member states of IORA met in Colombo to finalize the Terms of Reference for a Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security, that Sri Lanka is to coordinate. Meanwhile BIMSTECs sector on Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime, led by India, has assigned Sri Lanka as lead shepherd of it sub-group on Intelligence Sharing. This raises some interesting questions, if not dilemmas.
Some vital issues in relation to Sri Lankas role in BIMSTEC were raised by a researcher at the Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) at a round table on Sept. 20. Natasha Fernando started her presentation by asking Does it make sense to speak of security cooperation in BIMSTEC Differentiating Intelligence from Information, she said Intelligence sharing  should be for the organization, not for extra-regional powers. She said that currently, intelligence equipment and technology are provided by Israel. She noted that the term used in the BIMSTEC Convention on Cooperation in combatting International Terrorism and Transnational Crime and Drug Trafficking is Information sharing, and not Intelligence sharing. Earlier, spelling out her concerns in a INSSSL paper on Security Cooperation through BIMSTEC she wrote:
By virtue of this strategic position, Sri Lanka has immense potential to become a strong base for intelligence coordination provided advanced technology, equipment and resources are in place. Currently India and USA are looking into a Joint Agreement on obtaining advanced military equipment for sharing of encrypted military intelligence. In light of such bilateral security arrangements, there is a question regarding the role that BIMSTEC play in intelligence sharing and how symbiotic the arrangement is for the member states. There could also arise some skepticism on whether intelligence sharing (under a covert arrangement) could occur with an extra-regional power.Fernando was presumably referring to COMCASA  the major defence agreement signed by the US and India last month that would give India access to sophisticated communications security equipment to facilitate interoperability between their forces. India attaches high priority to surveillance of the Indian Ocean, and according to reports plans to use drones for the purpose. Its worth noting that a senior Sri Lankan minister is on record having told PTI in Beijing last year that the Indian Navy is assisting Sri Lanka Navy to track submarines. Indias major security concerns revolve around Chinas maritime expansion extending into the Indian Ocean, and Pakistans alleged sponsorship of cross-border terrorism. India, China and Pakistan are all considered friends of Sri Lanka. As a state that has no beef with any of these parties, Sri Lanka needs to consider whether there is a risk that intelligence shared with India could potentially end up with the US, and/or be used against China or Pakistan  both of whom are outside BIMSTEC. Since controlling the narrative inevitably becomes a part of the game for big players like US and India, Sri Lanka would also need to be mindful that the IO-related discussions it hosts are structured so as to be genuinely inclusive, if peace is the objective. There appears to be a tangled web of security concerns and arrangements among the powers engaged in the IO region. Those arrangements and their motivations are not always clear. Against such a backdrop, Sri Lanka would need to be cautious about taking on undefined roles in maritime safety and security and intelligence sharing.

Will lodge bribery complaint against Buddhika: ASP Liyanage
	
Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage today said he would lodge a complaint against Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana with the Bribery Commission for allegedly aiding corrupt officials.
The Ambassador said at a media briefing that the deputy minister was aiding and abetting the Sri Lankan school in Qatars former management, which he said was corrupt.
He said he would also file adefamation case against the deputy minister.
Previously, Deputy Minister Pathirana said at a media briefing, that the Ambassador was running the Sri Lankan school in Qatar for money, instead of executing the diplomatic duties.
Ambassador Liyanage in return said Deputy Minister Pathirana had surrounded himself with corrupt officials.
The previous officials of the Sri Lankan School in Qatar are corrupt and they receive the blessings of Buddhika Pathirana. I will complain to the Bribery Commission against him over this. I have not defrauded anyone as they claim, Liyanage said.
If I have done any wrongful act, I will leave my post right away. But the deputy minister should resign from his post as he was supporting the corrupt officials, he said.
Meanwhile, he said they were paying a monthly rental of 0.2 million Qatar Riyals to the building complex of the school and added that they had plans to relocate the school at one of their own lands.
Yes, we receive about 1.1 million Riyals (Rs. 50 million) as monthly income from the school and the school management is saving the money so that they can relocate the school at one of our own lands in Qatar. We have a land, he said.
Attempt to contact Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana was failed as he was out of the country.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
