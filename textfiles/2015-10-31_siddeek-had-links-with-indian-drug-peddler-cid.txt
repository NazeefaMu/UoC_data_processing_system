The CID informed Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya that drug kingpin Mohammed Siddeek had connections with an top Indian drug peddler named Gunasekeram, who had raised funds for the LTTE.
The CID requested the Magistrate for more time to investigate the bank accounts of the suspect as they had faced many impediments in their efforts to track down the bank documents of those suspected of involvement in the case.
Siddeek was arrested in Pakistan on charges of engaging in international drug trafficking on a confession made by Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda, who himself was sentenced to death on drug charges.
