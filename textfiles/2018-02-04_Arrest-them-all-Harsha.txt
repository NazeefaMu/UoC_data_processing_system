Welcoming the arrest of Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius and others, Deputy Minister of Development Policies and Economic Affairs Dr Harsha De Silva today said the Attorney General should go ahead and immediately arrest those named in the 34 reports of Presidential Commission looking into serious crimes (PRECIFAC) as well.

Also, Dr De Silva said the arrest was welcomed but he wished that it happened earlier, when the AG’s Department was first informed by the Prime Minister in 2016.

“Glad it has happened. All those who robbed the public must pay upon conviction. This is the change people voted for in January 2015. However, I wish it happened earlier when the AG’s Department was first informed by the Prime Minister in 2016. If so, crooks would already have been in jail,” he said.

The Deputy Minister said it was he who first revealed in Parliament in 2011 as to how the ring was engaging in massive securities fraud in the equity market.

“It was I who first revealed, starting in 2011, in and outside Parliament how a rogue ring was engaging in massive securities fraud in the equity market. But the regime along with the then CBSL Governor instead of investigating them went ahead and issued them an additional license to trade in the debt market,” he said.

“I hope the authorities would at least now support the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission by providing necessary technical support for forensic investigations to reveal the totality of the fraud that took place since then in both in the equity market and in the debt market.

“I hope that the AG will go ahead and immediately arrest those named in the 34 PRECIFAC reports as well. The future of our nation depends on it,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
