UNP MP Navin Dissayanayake said yesterday a common candidate would be fielded by the United National Front (UNF) at the upcoming presidential election.

He said this when a group of UNP MPs met the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwathu and Asgiri Chapters in Kandy yesterday.

The MP said the UNF was ready to face a presidential election if the Supreme Court ruled against the holding of a general election.

He told Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter the Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladharma Thera that it was possible to hold both presidential and general elections at the same time and added that even the incumbent president could contest the election.

The MP said it was not advisable to go for an election because of the prevailing chaotic situation in parliament and said how a peaceful election could be held in the country when a vote could not be taken in parliament. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
