Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that he was happy to note the decision of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) led by MP Wimal Weerawansa to function independently in Parliament.

“I am indeed thankful to Mr. Weerawansa and his party for this decision, as it means that he cannot work with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he said.

He said there was no provision for the JNP to function as an independent entity in the House. He said each member of the JNP could function individually (according to the procedure) and not as a party. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
