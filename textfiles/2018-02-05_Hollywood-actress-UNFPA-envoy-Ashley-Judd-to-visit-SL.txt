Hollywood actress and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Goodwill Ambassador Ashley Judd would arrive in Sri Lanka next week, the Government Information Department said today.

It said Judd will engage with women and girls from different backgrounds to learn about their livelihoods and views on gender-based violence during her visit to Sri Lanka.

She will also meet with stakeholders from the public sector, private sector and donor community to highlight the importance of investing in the reproductive health and rights of people.

“Judd was appointed as a UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador in March 2016, and is a passionate advocate for ending all forms of gender-based violence around the world. While she is best known for an ongoing acting career spanning more than two decades, she has increasingly become involved in global humanitarian efforts and political activism,” it said.

Judd has had leading roles in films including Ruby in Paradise (1993), Norma Jean & Marilyn (1996), Kiss the Girls (1997), Double Jeopardy (1999), Where the Heart Is (2000), High Crimes (2002), De-Lovely (2004), Bug (2006), Dolphin Tale (2011), Divergent (2014), Dolphin Tale 2 (2014) and Insurgent (2015).

In 2010, she earned a one-year mid-career master’s degree in public administration from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.
