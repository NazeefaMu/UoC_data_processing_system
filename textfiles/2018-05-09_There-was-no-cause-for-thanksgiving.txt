A Green party Diyawanna politico representing a constituency north of the city renowned for pearls in ancient times, had been seen carrying a tray of flowers inside the most sacred Buddhist shrine in the hill country almost daily in the recent past.

 


The politico had been praying to deities after worshipping the sacred relic that he be given top team status at least at the reshuffle close at hand, they say.


The politico had not been seen in the sacred city after the reshuffle of the pack.
