The entire country should urge the government to hand over the SriLankan Airlines to the AirAsia which is a low-cost Airline as the national carrier is a financial burden to the country, Minister Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.

Responding to a question raised at a press conference Minister Ranawaka said SriLankan Airline is continuously making heavy losses.

He said it lost millions in several operations including when purchasing aircraft and it incurred a loss of Rs. 28 billion last year as well.

Minister said that only Rs. 15 billion was spent to construct the Aruwakkaru sanitary land fill to address city's grabage issue and the SriLankan Airline's loss was even greater than the garbage project.

Minister said the present government’s first move was to remove three aircraft purchased during previous government and later approved to remove another four aircraft.

Therefore Minister Ranawaka said that he doesn’t believe that it could be profitable to maintain the SriLankan Airlines further as such a strategic move is required to make a viable business venture.

“Both the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka became a burden to the country and the previous government should be held the responsible for it,” minister added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
