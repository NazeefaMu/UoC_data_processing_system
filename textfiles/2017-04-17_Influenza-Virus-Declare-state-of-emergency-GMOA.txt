Influenza Virus: Declare state of emergency - GMOA


	

The rapid spread of the influenza virus necessitates the declaration of a state of emergency but Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has neglected it, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today.

GMOA Secretary Naveen De Zoysa told a news conference that the minister should consider this step on a priority basis instead of intervening in the SAITM issue.

He said the virus had reached epidemic proportions while the hospitals have run out of medicine.

“The minister should concentrate on this matter without occupying himself with other unwanted issues. There is a shortage of Tamiflu medicine to treat patients affected by the Influenza virus,” Dr. De Zoysa said.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath said it was the government's responsibility to supply the necessary medicine to government hospitals.

“There is an attempt to register another foreign cigarette company. Without inviting other cigarette manufacturers the minister should import a sufficient stock of medicines to treat patients suffering from the influenza virus,” he said.

Meanwhile, Dr. Herath said the GMOA has set up an emergency service at the Colombo National Hospital to treat those affected by the catastrophe at Meethotamulla. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
