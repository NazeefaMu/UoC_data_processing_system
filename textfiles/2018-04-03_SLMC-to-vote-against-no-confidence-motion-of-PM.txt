Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem said today his party decided to vote against the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Mr. Hakeem told Daily Mirror that the SLMC took the decision after lengthy deliberations. He said though the motion had been aimed at the Prime Minister, the end result would be the defeat of the entire government. “We don’t want to defeat the government which we installed,” he said.
