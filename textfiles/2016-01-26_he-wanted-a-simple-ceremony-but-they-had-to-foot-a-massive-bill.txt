The new Big Boss had issued precise instructions that the celebrations to mark his first year in office should be simple and the expenses involved should be restricted to the minimum possible. 
The organizers of the event first submitted to the new Big Boss an estimate for Rs.6 million for constructing the stage and other works involved and he had immediately pointed out that the estimate was too high. 
The celebrations were held and every one said that the event was a big hit.
A few days later, a white collar bigwig of a key office had received a bill for all expenses incurred in connection with the ceremony.  And he was stunned to find that the bill was for a whopping Rs.12 million. The official had immediately stopped payment and reported the matter to the Big Boss and the latter too had expressed his amazement.
An inquiry into the high costs incurred in connection with the celebrations was soon launched, they say.
It had transpired later that the contractor had billed even for services rendered by the armed force personnel.
