Daily Mail, 3 July 2018 -A senior Catholic Church official has avoided jail and will spend six months in home detention for concealing child sex crimes.   


Adelaide Archbishop Philip Wilson, 67, was sentenced to 12 months of home detention for keeping quiet about paedophile priest Father James Patrick Fletcher for more than four decades.   


Wilson, who has shown early stages of Alzerimers, will serve a six-month non-parole period under the watchful eye of a supervising officer from his home, Herald Sunreported.
