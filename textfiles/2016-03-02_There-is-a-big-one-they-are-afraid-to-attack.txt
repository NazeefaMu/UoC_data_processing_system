There is a big one they are afraid to attack


	



 

Several ‘joint opposition’ heavyweights were having a confab in the House lobby the other day. 

 


 They were bragging about how they tore the government high ups to smithereens at a recent media briefing.  Meanwhile, a few government members who passed by also stopped for a while to hear what they were saying.


The ‘joint opposition’ ones kept on gloating over their political exploits with much relish.  One of them proudly announced that that they were ready to expose some spicy stories about the ‘Reds’ as well.
At this stage a talkative yahapalanaya member who was quietly listening   butted in: “You boast that you are not afraid to attack any big guy in the government. But aren’t you mortally afraid to take on …

Only that twosome from the minor parties with you have the guts at least to mention his name…!”


The ‘joint opposition’ ones greeted this challenge with sardonic smiles. The government member continued: “Even your big mouth from the South who often talks big at your media briefings has never uttered one word against him.  You always target only one person. If you people are such great heroes, I challenge you to attack this big one.” 


Then the quorum bell was heard ringing and they all made their way towards the chamber.
