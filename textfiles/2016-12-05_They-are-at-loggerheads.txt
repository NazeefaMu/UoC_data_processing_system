They are at loggerheads!


	



A cold war going on between a senior purohita and the chief executive of a statutory body coming under his purview is one of the main topics being talked about in political circles these days.
The duo has got into the habit of turning down each other’s official requests out of sheer spite, they say.

 


The purohita had rejected on two occasions the application for leave abroad submitted by the chief executive while the latter had rubbished a list of candidates for recruitment to the institution sent by the purohita in a tit for tat move. 


The chief executive had also purchased four vehicles for official use of the institution against the instructions of the purohita. 


The duo carefully avoids any eye-contact with each other at the official conferences they have to attend, they say.
