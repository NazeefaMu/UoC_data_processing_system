	Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake had made an open request to batting great Kumar Sangakkara to reconsider his retirement.
	Sangakkara, 37, who has already bid adieu to limited-over cricket, is expected to hang up his gloves from Test cricket in August, ending a glittering career.
	“I would request Kumar to come out of retirement to serve the game for one more year. You all know that Kumar and Mahela had constant issues with SLC and now that a new committee has taken over I request Kumar to reconsider his decision,” the Minister said.
	Sangakkara is the second highest scorer in the ODI cricket 14,234 runs with 25 centuries and 53 half-centuries. He is the only Sri Lankan to amass over 12,000 runs in Test cricket.
