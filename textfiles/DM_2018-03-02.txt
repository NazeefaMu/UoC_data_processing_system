A typical political appointee!
	

The female head of a revenue collecting department who recently harangued a subject clerk for failing to add a Rs. 750 allowance to her monthly salary, had been remiss in her duty to provide uniform material and shoes to a certain category of employees in her department for two consecutive years, they say. 

By the way, this white collar bigwig had got her appointment to the high office thanks to her connection to a very high political authority.
The uniformed staff of the department are entitled to two sets of uniform, one pair of shoes and three pairs of shoelace once a year, they say.

avoiding missile defences
	

MOSCOW - Russia has developed nuclear weapons that can avoid any missile defence systems and plans to bolster its arsenal with nuclear-powered cruise missiles capable to hitting any point on the globe, President Vladimir Putin claimed in his annual address to lawmakers Thursday. 
Putin claimed that late last year, Russia had successfully tested a cruise missile that was propelled by a nuclear-powered engine. This engine gave the cruise missile practically unlimited range, distinguishing it from existing cruise missiles. 
The missile would be able to fly close to the ground and follow an unpredictable flight path, rendering existing missile defences useless, Putin said. Tests of the technology will allow the development of a complete new type of weapon - a strategic complex of nuclear arms with rockets fitted with a nuclear-propulsion engine. 
Putin said the United States had failed to take Russias nuclear might seriously or to adequately negotiate arms control. U.S. efforts to contain Russia, he said, had failed. No one listened to us, Putin said. Listen to us now. 
He also warned that Moscow would consider any nuclear attack, of any size, on it or its allies an attack on Russia that would lead to an immediate response - adopting Cold War-style overtones that appeared to ramp up Russias posturing against the West and its allies. Putin did not specify any of Moscows allies that it would defend or cite any immediate threats.

Book reviews of Sunanda Wijeyalatha Munasinghe
	
The latest works of Sunanda Wijeyalatha Munasinghe, Kutumbini and an anthology of childrens poems Kaviyen Kurulu Witthi Ran Ran Ran Rattaran have been released recently. 
Published by Fast Publishing (Private) Ltd, the novel  Kutumbini is a nice portrayal of the problems facing a traditional family in a Sinhala village, when the parents seek a suitable partner to give their young daughter in marriage. The main protagonist of the story Sewwandi is a well educated young woman of a middle class family from the dry zone who comes to grief due to the ill treatments of her In-laws and her struggle to avoid a family breakdown. 
Sunanda has given a perspective of the trials and tribulations facing Sewwandi with equanimity. The slow tempo of characterization is in allusion to the theme of the novel. The writer has attempted to portray the eroding traditional social values interwoven with the caste system, the upcountry and low country social differences and the patriarchal family system. Sunandas message on the social values upheld by a traditional complex family although they serve as a negative component of a happy wedded life of a young couple is explicit in Katumbini. It is the 18th novel by Wijeyalatha.
Kaviyen Kurulu Witthi, (About birds in poems) is an anthology of childrens poems which is intended to educate children on the life of endemic birds in Sri Lanka. The poems would inculcate in children during their formative years the habit of loving animal life that adorns the environment. Sunanda Wijeyalathas long experience in writing poetry and composing songs for children is indicative in the anthology Kaviyen Kurulu Witthi. 
Sunanda received several awards for her works including the State literary award held in Mahiyangana in 1992, State literary festival held in Nikaweratiya Maha Vidyalaya in 1993, at a short story competition organised by the Ministry of Cultural and Religious Affairs in 1994. At the felicitation ceremony for writers held at Polonnaruwa Navodya Maha Vidyalaya in 1999, and the Sambhawana Pooja Kala Prasadini award in 2012, and the Kalabhimani Silver Award at the North Central Province Arts Festival held at Anuradhapura in 2014.

British PM meets EUs Tusk
	
LONDON AFP March1, 2018- British Prime Minister Theresa May hosts EU President Donald Tusk for Brexit talks Thursday, on the eve of her keynote speech on future trade ties and amid a row over Northern Ireland. 
Their meeting at Downing Street comes as the European Union prepares its position on negotiations on the future relationship with Britain once it leaves the bloc. May is due to set out her plans in a long-awaited speech on Friday, but it has been overshadowed by a dispute with Brussels over the status of the Irish border after Brexit. 
The EU this week published a draft law codifying the divorce terms struck with Britain in December, which includes plans to avoid any customs checks on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. May reacted angrily to the proposal that Northern Ireland --part of Britain-- stay in a customs union with the EU if there is no better solution.

Events in life are not accidents
	
There is a diversity of religion-based beliefs relating to the origin of the universe and life.
Nevertheless, there is a general acceptance that both the universe as a whole and whatever part of it be it micro or macro owe their existence to a certain natural plan.
Natural plan and law of periodicity
There is also a general acceptance that whatever natural phenomena that occurs confirm not only to a natural plan but also a natural regularity which numerologists refer to as the law of periodicity.
Man is part of the universe
Numerologists in particular have been from ancient times doing research studies in a bid to advance theories and principles to explain away not only the regularity of the occurrence of cosmic phenomena but also the regularity of occurrence of events in the life of an individual. Because they have presumed if there is a natural plan or law governing the operation of the universe, there should be a natural plan or law governing every individual as well as man too is part of the universe. In other words, whatever happens to an individual, any event in his life is not an accident, but an occurrence confirming to a natural plan or law already in operation.
Year Cycles
Hindu Numerologists have worked out several year circles in accord with the theory of Regularity of Occurrence to predict future happenings both natural phenomena like earthquakes and tsunamis and events in the life of an individual.
Two of the year cycles are based on the Destiny Number and one of them is based on Basic Number series and the other on the multiple series.
Examples for the Basic Number series:Destiny Number 8
Say your Destiny Number is 8. All numbers following it which can be reduced to the basic number 8 form the Year Series e.g. 8, 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 71, 80 and so on.
12- year and 19- year cycles
The 12 year and 19 year circles are also popular among the Hindus. Choose a year when a very important event - a watershed  in your life had occurred and keep track of the 12 year circles following that significant event to check whether similar effects have been experienced at the subsequent 12 year-circles or intervals in your life.
Say something fortunate happened in the year 16, similar good events are to be anticipated in years 28, 40, 52 and so on.
Another circle believed in is 19-year series. If a happy event in your life played out at the age of 5, a similar happy event may occur at the age of 24. Of course, there can be a big difference between the nature of two events. But there could be some similarity in the overall effect produced by the two events.
30-year cycle of catastrophic events
The Hindus also believe in the 30-year cycle, but this cycle is generally applied to prognosticate catastrophic events like earthquakes, deluges and tsunamis. This is also in accord with the theory of the regularity of Occurrence.
It has been observed the Nature acts in a certain regular pattern or a natural plan. If some calamity occurs in a particular year, you can anticipate a recurrence in another 30 years.

## Title: Feeling detached from your body

Feeling detached from your body
	
Do you know that certain people during certain times feel various bizarre changes in their self-awareness where they tend to feel that their thoughts and actions are not their own, but somebody elses (Depersonalization)
On the other hand there are some people who may tend to feel dissociated from their environment, perceiving objects as unsolid, diminished in size or two-dimensional and their own self residing inside some glass-like container or peering at the world through a fog with the outside world seems unreachable and meaningless (De-realization)
Sounds strange for sure, but these situations arent uncommon at all in the modern world. In fact, certain research studies have shown that up to 50% of normal adult population go through one or both of these problems occasionally and that as a psychiatric condition it could affect up to 3% of the general population.
Depersonalization and De-realization are two types of dissociative disorders, which are often used interchangeably, owing to the several similar features they share and confusing factors of differentiation. However, most healthcare professionals consider these two conditions as a single diagnosis called Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder and by this article we are going to identify the characteristic properties owned by each of them, for the sole purpose of making an accurate diagnosis and deciding on the modality of treatment.

What is Depersonalization
Being a type of dissociative disorders, which result in disruptions in ones memory, consciousness, identity or perception, Depersonalization is defined as a condition where a person experiences detachment from his own self as if he is not the person consisting of a set of feelings, thoughts, emotions and physical activity. The affected individual will have feelings about a set of properties that are normal to any human being, but does not belong to him anymore. For an example, a depersonalized person will often have complaints like I know that it is my arm which is moving, but this is not really my arm, but someone elses.
Even though the exact etiology of this condition is not very clear, traumatic situations and negative life events (war, abuse, and accidents) are known to be playing major roles in the predisposition. Also, substance-induced depersonalization is known to occur as a result of Alcohol, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-Anxiety medications, Benzodiazepines, Caffeine, Carbamazepine etc.
Most affected people will present with feelings of distorted perceptions of the body where he will feel as if he is a robot or living in a dream where some people may even complain of symptoms suggestive of depression, anxiety, or panic attacks. Some cases of depersonalization can be mild and last for a very short period of time where some can be chronic and give rise to recurrences which will often result in disturbances in day to day activities.
Additionally, depersonalization is usually associated with other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorder, schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder.
The diagnosis of Depersonalization will often be made with a complete history from the patient along with a thorough physical examination where imaging and laboratory tests might be helpful to rule out medical conditions which may give rise to similar signs and symptoms.
Most cases of depersonalization will get resolved spontaneously over time where severe or recurrent cases might need medical interventions including psychotherapy (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy) and medication such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and anxiolytics.
In addition to that, Clinical hypnosis might be indicated in some patients to achieve relaxation, concentration, and focused attention, making people to identify their thoughts, feelings, and emotions which might have become suppressed in the level of consciousness.

What is Derealization
Derealization, is defined as a sensation of detachment and experienced by certain individuals as if the environment around them does not exist. This will often result in a continuous struggle between a persons mind and body which may sometimes lead to a chronically disturbed mind and body connection (detachment from the reality).
As far as the etiology of this condition is concerned, short-term de-realization usually occurs as a consequence of substance abuse, drug-withdrawal or as a symptom of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or dissociative identity disorder.
Often accompanied by abnormal visual and auditory sensations, the affected person will complain of visual distortions such as widened or narrowed visual field, blurriness or two-dimensional views where the world around will seem to be like a living dream or a movie projected on a screen.
An attack of de-realization will usually last for about 15-20 minutes, but can recur without any prior notice and persist even for hours to weeks.
The modality of treatment for Derealization is similar to that of Depersonalization which mainly includes anti-psychotics, anxiolytics and anti-depressants based on the other associated mental conditions.

Summary
The line of differentiation in these two conditions lie in the aspects of the type of detachment they cause, their social application and how the disorder is connected to physical injuries. In fact, Depersonalization is a state of hyper awareness of ones own body where the affected individual behaves as if he is a spectator watching himself, being outside the body whereas De-realization is a state where a person feels as if he is detached from the entire world around him
Furthermore, being a psychological condition, depersonalization often accompanies anxiety disorders and is associated with various physical symptoms such as excessive cold sweating, but as a rule does not originate in central nervous system-related injuries. 
On the other hand Derealization can be a result of various physical injuries to the central nervous system including trauma to the head.
A person suffering from feelings of depersonalization is not usually socially alienated whereas the one with Derealization will often be noted as a socially alienated individual. In fact, a person with symptoms of depersonalization is fit enough to maintain various social relationships where the ones with Derealization can hardly maintain any social relationship because of the perception that the outside world is thought to be detached from their body.

Govt. should review PC delimitation: SLMC
	
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC)yesterday said the Government should review delimitation done in view of the Provincial Councils as otherwise, it would reduce the number of members to be returned from the minority councils.
SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem told the Daily Mirror that the Government decided to introduce a mix of the First Past the Post and the Proportion Representation to the Provincial Councils as at the Local Government Elections.
Along with that, a committee was appointed to carry out delimitation of electorates in the nine Provinces. Mr.Hakeem said his party could not accept the recommendations by this committee.
Instead, he said it would be advisable to revert to the old electoral system.
He said there was a lot of confusion arising from the new electoral system, introduced for the local bodies.
If it is applied to the Provincial Council Elections, it will run into further confusion, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

It has now come to light that a certain politico while occupying a position of authority had collected a huge amount of money as kickbacks from contractors to whom tenders for numerous development projects at the periphery were awarded.

However, the work on these development projects have now ground to a halt due to the failure on the part of government authorities to release funding for them.
The development projects thus virtually abandoned have become eye sores while the politico who had made a fortune out of them is enjoying a good rest in the lap of luxury, they say.

Healthy food choices that should be made
	

By R.M.R.V.Samarakoon
Every stage of life is very important for a persons well-being or the quality of life. If someone opines that the nine months during pregnancy and the period of lactation are most critical among other things, it is an uttermost truth, not only for the baby, but also for the mother. The success of this process depends on many factors, most of which are modifiable. Maternal nutrition is one of the most important factors for well-being. 
Based on research, 12.5kg is considered as the physiological norm for average weight gain for a full-term pregnancy lasting 40 weeks. On average, this level of weight gain shows to be associated with optimal reproductive outcome and was used as the basis to estimate the component of weight changes in healthy pregnant women. Given this reason women must eat sensibly during pregnancy and lactation. The fetus acts as a parasite within the mother and some nutritional deficiencies of mother will have adverse effects on the fetus. With sensible diet and an adequate supply of nutrition, a mother will not suffer from any deficiencies throughout pregnancy. Ideally, a pregnancy must be planned and a part of the preparation should be to ensure the normal weight of the baby.
When talking about a healthy diet during pregnancy, the amount of food a pregnant woman should consume varies according to her level of physical activities and her body weight. There is only a minor increase in nutritional needs during the first three months of pregnancy (first trimester) and this keeps on increasing steadily to reach a peak in the third trimester (after 28 weeks of pregnancy). In that case diet is very important to fulfill all these nutrition needs during pregnancy. During this period the diet should include sufficient energy giving food to ensure weight gain at a desirable rate. An adequate amount of fluid (minimum of 8-10 cups/day) should be taken and a sufficient amount of fibre rich food should be included in the diet to prevent constipation. At least one glass of milk product should be consumed each day. Also remember to avoid alcohol and active or passive smoking. When talking about the requirement of micro nutrients during pregnancy, lack of micronutrients can have adverse effects on the pregnant mother and the new born baby. 
The intake of iron should be increased during pregnancy to meet the need to increase red blood cell production. This condition helps the growth of the baby. 
Iron-rich food is also recommended. Also recommended is vitamin C rich fruits and vegetables. But the Sri Lankan diet lacks iron rich foods. In such instances its recommended to take iron supplements daily during pregnancy and lactation. Iron supplements should be continued for six months after delivery to replenish the stores and to prevent future iron deficiency anemia in mothers. 
When talking about Folate, it helps to prevent neural tube defects in the fetus. Its intake should be increased before conception to achieve maximum benefits and continued through-out pregnancy. There are plenty of food items rich in folate such as Dark green and other vegetables-Thampala, Curry leaves (karapincha), Ladies fingers, Lima, Spinach, Beets and most vegetables.
The consumption of iodized salt will satisfy the pregnant mothers Iodine requirement. Its better to add moderate amounts of salt after cooking to prevent loss of Iodineduring cooking. 
As pregnancy period and lactating period is very important in terms of nutrition, the above mentioned dietary habits can be very helpful for a healthy life. The careful selection of a diet which covers all bases of general and additional nutritional needs will ensure that you and your baby will be healthy and strong.

Intl community welcomes Govt. activating OMP
	
The international community praised and welcomed the move by President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint seven commissioners to the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) on Wednesday, two days after the 37th UNHR Council session commenced in Geneva.
A number of foreign ambassadors in Sri Lanka yesterday tweeted expressing their optimism over the move.
US Ambassador in Sri Lanka Atul Keshap said the establishment of a robust and independent OMP is an important step forward for enduring peace, non-recurrence, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans, especially those citizens who seek answers about their loved ones.
While welcoming the move, British High Commissioner James Dauris said it was a step forward which families of the disappeared persons from around Sri Lanka have long been waiting for.
I share the hope of many people from all communities that the OMP will be given all the help it needs to be effective and become fully operational quickly, he said.
Meanwhile, Ambassador of the Netherlands Joanne Doornewaard said the appointment of the OMP commissioners was good news. Hope theyll start working right away, she said.
Canadian High Commissioner David McKinnon said This is welcome, if long overdue. Those committed to ensuring a peaceful, reconciled, and prosperous Sri Lanka know that much more needs to be done. Canada is pleased to be a partner on this journey, but the real progress has to be driven by Sri Lankans themselves".
The appointed Commissioners of the OMP are Saliya Pieris, PC (Chair) Jayatheepa Punniyamoorthy, Maj. Gen. (Rtd.) Mohanti Antonette Peiris, Dr. Nimalka Fernando, Mirak Raheem, Somasiri K. Liyanage and Kanapathipillai Venthan. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

IVF: The miracle of conception - What, when and for whom
	

In vitro fertilisation (IVF), commonly known as test tube babies, is a scientific marvel that has helped many couples with difficulties in conceiving. The technology that was first invented in Cambridge, United Kingdom over 40 years ago, has undergone many advances during this time. It is estimated that over 6.5 million babies have been born through IVF worldwide. Furthermore, the demand for IVF continues to grow as many people seek such treatment. However, in some countries, including Sri Lanka, the public awareness among people on IVF remains to be low and hence there is delay in seeking treatment. 
To educate our readers more on the subject we decides to ask some of the common questions raised regarding IVF to Dr. Thilina S. Palihawadana, Senior Lecturer, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Kelaniya.

QWhat is IVF
IVF is a treatment process that helps a couple to conceive, that would have been otherwise difficult or unthinkable. It has many steps that may be modified according to the abnormalities in each couple, but the basic steps are as follows. 

1. Pre-procedure screening and optimisation 
The couple will be investigated for any diseases, hormonal abnormalities and infections prior to commencement of treatment and these will be adequately treated in order to maximise the chance of a success. 

2. Ovarian stimulation and monitoring 
The woman will receive hormones in the form of daily injections to facilitate development of multiple eggs rather than one single egg, that is usually seen in a natural cycle. The amount of hormone and the regimen that will be used will be determined for each patient. There will be serial ultrasound monitoring and checking of hormone levels during this time to assess the response to treatment. When the eggs are adequately developed, a single trigger injection will be given to achieve the final maturation of the eggs. 

3. Egg collection 
Around 36 hours after the trigger injection, a small surgical procedure would be undertaken to collect all the eggs. This is usually done either with a light general anaesthesia or under local anaesthesia and sedation. The surgery will involve passing of a small needle to the ovaries through the vagina under ultrasound guidance. This will not result any skin cut and does not require the patient to get admitted to hospital or be away from work for any length of time. 

4. Processing of sperms 
The day of the egg collection the husband will be asked to produce a seminal fluid sample and through a thorough processing method the good sperms will be isolated to use in the insemination.

5. Insemination 
The meeting of the egg and the sperm is facilitated in very strict laboratory conditions. This may be either by incubating the egg with sperms overnight or by directly injecting the sperm in to the egg by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The latter allows us to use even immotile or immature sperms, such as that is harvested by surgical sperm aspiration in men with problems in sperm transport. 

6. Embryo development 
Once the embryos develop they are allowed to grow in incubators under very strict laboratory conditions up to 5 days. This will allow us to identify the good embryos and improve the chance of success. The embryos will be graded according to their appearance by the end of this period. 

7. Embryo transfer 
Once the embryos are 4 to 5 days old the good embryos will be transferred in to the womb through a simple surgical procedure under ultrasound guidance. This often does not require any form of anaesthesia and the woman will be able to return home after 4 hours. The attachment of the embryo to the wall of the womb will be facilitated by treatment with hormones and the woman will be advised to rest for up to 2 weeks till a blood test is done to see if she is pregnant. 

8. Embryo freezing 
At a time only a maximum of 2 embryos are transferred to minimise the risk of higher order multiple pregnancy and the remaining embryos will be frozen for storage. Once frozen the embryos can be stored safely up to 10 years. If the treatment is successful these embryos can be used on a later date when they wish to have another child whereas if the treatment fails the remaining embryos can be transferred in the next cycle, without going through all the other steps of the treatment.

QWho would benefit from IVF
Due to the various steps employed during the IVF procedure, it can help couples with a wide range of abnormalities. The common reasons where IVF is used in treatment include: 

1. Tubal disease where both fallopian tubes are either blocked or diseased. 
2. Sperm abnormalities since IVF and ICSI can be performed with even very low sperm counts such as 0.5-1 million/ml where other treatment modalities are not possible 
3. Endometriosis since the tubal functions are not required in IVF 
4. Obstruction causing absence of sperms where the sperms aspirated from the testis will be immature 
5. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) where it is difficult for a woman to produce eggs with simple treatment modalities. 
6. Unexplained infertility, where the investigations fail to identify the abnormality, with failure in other methods such as Intrauterine insemination (IUI) 
7. Women with advanced age or poor ovarian function where donor eggs are used 


QWhen should one think of IVF
While rushing in to IVF too soon is not wise as it will result in additional cost and unnecessary interventions, it also should not be delayed. Such unnecessary delays can reduce the chance of a pregnancy since the success of IVF is directly related to the age of the woman. Also with time diseases like endometriosis and sperm abnormalities can get worse and hence such treatment may not be possible. Therefore, finding the correct time to undergo IVF is very important. 

While some conditions such as severe endometriosis, bilateral tubal block and severe sperm abnormalities will need IVF from the very onset others may need it only when other modalities have failed. In the latter it is important that the couple does not spend too much time in one treatment modality if it is not yielding results, but move to a more advanced treatment modality. 

New advances in IVF has improved the success rate of treatment significantly and also has been able to make it simpler and less expensive. Furthermore, introduction of programmes such as egg donation has made it possible for women with advanced age and poor ovarian functions to become mothers. However, it is important couples seek treatment without delay and select the best treatment modality for them.

LG 'elects' want more time
	
The political parties and independent groups that contested the Local Authorities Elections had sought more time for the nomination of their woman representatives, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday.
Mr Deshapriya told the Daily Mirror that the Commission would decide whether to grant the extension or not at its meeting scheduled for today.
According to the new law governing the Local Authorities, 25 percent of representatives in each council should be reserved for women.
Members are elected under a mix of the First Past the Post and the Proportional Representation system.
Asked whether there were errors in the calculation of members elected to 36 local bodies under Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), he said it was a mere allegation by one MP.
However, he said the Commission decided to stand by its calculation.
A political party form an administration in a local body only if it had got more than 50 percent of the total membership. Otherwise, there has to be political alignment.
Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said a single party had got more than 50 percent of members at 138 councils.
Therefore, the party concerned could nominate chairmen and mayors.
However, none of the parties has been able to get such a higher percentage at 170 local bodies.
Any party can form the administration at these local authorities only in alliance with others. There are 34 local bodies where a single party has got exact 50 percent of members elected on its ticket.
According to PAFFREL, no party can form administration at any local body without the support of other parties in the districts of Polonnaruwa, Mullaithivu, Mannar and Vavuniya. (Kelum Bandara)

Mistaken identity caused stranger to lose her hair
	
A nineteen-year-old youth, whose love affair with a girl from his school ended after a girl from the same school sneaked about them, was arrested for allegedly cutting off a length of hair belonging to a woman he saw on a bus in a classic case of mistaken identity.
This incident had taken place on Wednesday (28) afternoon. The young man was still grieving from the break-up caused by another girl spreading vicious rumours about him and his love. He had been keeping a watch out for her to take revenge for what she had done. On Wednesday he had spotted a young woman, with features similar to those of the woman he was searching for, boarding a bus going towards Elpitiya. Armed with a pair of scissors, hurriedly purchased from a nearby shop, he had got into the same bus. After sitting behind her he proceeded to cut off a part of the woman's hair in order to exact revenge for the pain of mind she had caused him.
Unfortunately for him however, it turned out to be a complete stranger whose hair he had cut off. Officers of the traffic unit of the Payagala Police were on duty in the Payagala North area when a bus halted next to them and the driver informed them that a youth had cut off the hair of a 21-year-old woman who was travelling on the bus for no apparent reason and had jumped off the bus and was on the run. The Police had acted swiftly and had been able to apprehend the youth. The police had also taken into custody a pair of scissors and a 19-inch length of hair from the possession of the suspect youth.
During the interrogation which followed the suspect had revealed that he had been a student of a leading college in Balapitiya and had developed a love affair with a fellow student. This affair had ended abruptly as a result of a young women spreading rumors. He had been on the lookout for this woman to exact revenge for what she had done.
The suspect was to be produced before the Kalutara Magistrate yesterday (1). (S S Thanthiriarachchi)

How your food has been grown has a major impact on your mental and emotional health. The term Organic refers to the way products are grown and processed. It is believed that organically produced food items are nutritious and free of pesticides.
Organically produced food items are slightly superior and healthier than food items you usually find in the market. Organic food items are usually grown without adding any pesticides, but whats the guarantee that all organic food products are 100% pesticide free I think its better that people opt for more organic foods because they are healthier said nutritionist, Doctor Damayanthi Perera.

National List MPs destroyed UNP: Ravi
	
At least two or three MPs who were elected from the National List had drawn the United National Party (UNP) to its destruction, UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake said
He said that because of the minority parties that did not have voter base, the UNP had gone back to the point of no return.
While addressing media at a ceremony in Modara yesterday afternoon he said with this situation there should be a radical change in the party and that change should be done from the youth.
There should be a procedure to protect the party members, he said.
A lot of things need to be done for the backbenchers. The party should be restructured. We had made that statement earlier. The restructuring the party should be done, not only the in the UNP but also in other political parties as well.
What former President Chandrika Bandaranaike did was the best example. She retired as President and again contested the Attanagalle electorate. She came third at the recent Local Government elections.
She formed the Marapana Committee because of me.
How can people, who have no mandate, take action against me who has no voter base These are the things people laugh at.
I have done a lot of work to the people. The whole country was insured through the National Insurance Trust Fund, introduced a special insurance coverage for school children.
A concessionary loan scheme was introduced for low-income people and small, medium and large-scale entrepreneurs. Had taken steps to give tab computers to A/L students and teachers.
Now, there are many people to claim the right to, which is like obtaining birth certificates to children of others," Minister Karunanayake said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Port City worse than Uma Oya: Environmentalist
	
According to the current situation, the Port City project will cause worse environmental hazards than the Uma Oya project, said the Peoples Movement Against Port City on Wednesday.
Commenting on this, environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara said since 2011 they had been educating the civil society on the possible environmental damage this project could bring.
The adverse environmental impacts we forecasted are taking place now. The coastal belt up to Ratmalana and Negombo is damaged and the waves and sea current have been irregular along these areas. However, the government has allocated a staggering Rs. 1,500 million from last years budget to prevent sea erosion. Water sources in Gampaha and Kalutara Districts are drying out as granite is supplied to the project. The Chinese company that has undertaken the project violates sand mining procedures. The government should intervene and bring this project to a halt at least now, he said.
Meanwhile, Systems Ecologist Dr. Ranil Senanayake said the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) would be increased by 25 to 30 times due to this project and that would lead to severe health issues.
The construction of skyscrapers and use of cement and other material contribute to the increase of fine particulate matter. Even now, the PM2.5 value is three times in Colombo. This spike will lead to cancer and respiratory problems of people. However, the project will surely be a tourist attraction if we can construct a green park in the project site, he said.

## Title: Putting into practice quota for female reps impossible

Putting into practice quota for female reps impossible 
	

Where few or no women have been elected and where that party has an overhang the obligation to implement the quota falls on the next party.
Inconsistency in as the law requires 25% women for a local council to be formed while exempting certain parties
The whole debate that the quota cannot be fulfilled is also a matter of political will
Uncertainty looms over fulfilling the 25% quota allocated for female representation with some parties being exempted by the law from appointing females and some parties unwilling to appoint female members. In certain councils no female candidates have been elected. Further, the Election Commission has received complaints that the number of women to be appointed has been determined excluding the overhang seats in certain councils. 
Earlier last year the Local Authorities (Amendment) Act, No 16 of 2017 was amended requiring each local authority to comprise not less than 25% of female representation. Under the mixed electoral system, under which the Local Government Elections were held, 60% of the total number of members to a local authority were expected to be nominated from wards (first nomination paper). They contested under the First Past the Post system (FPP). Forty percent of members are to be returned from the additional nomination paper. The law requires that 10% of the nominees in the first nomination paper to be women. Fifty percent of the nominees in the additional nomination paper should be women. This is envisaged to fulfill the 25% quota. 
When the number of women elected from all wards in a local authority area does not equate the allocated seats for women to fulfill the quota in a council, the law requires the shortfall in the number of members to be returned from the women candidates in the first nomination paper or the additional nomination paper. However, political parties or independent groups which have received less than 20% of the total votes and less than 3 members (elected or returned), are exempted from appointing women.
But if political parties decide not to nominate women and say they are exempted, this creates a problem. So how the matter will be resolved depends on how the EC acts
Head of Political Research at the Verit Research, Janeen Fernando
Further, if a political party wins its ward seats with an overhang it will not have vacant seats allocated to them proportionately for females to be appointed. Therefore, apart from the female candidates who have won wards, political parties with overhangs are unable to appoint females. Under the mixed electoral system the number of seats allocated for a party in a local authority is determined proportionately to the votes polled. Then the number of seats won by winning wards (FPP) is subtracted from the seats allocated proportionately. For instance, if the party is allocated 10 seats proportionate to their votes, and if they have won 7 wards, the three seats that remain are the additional seats.
However, in an overhang the number of seats obtained through FPP exceeds that of the seats allocated for the party proportionately. For instance, in the Kotte Municipal Council Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) was allocated 15 seats. However, they won 18 seats through FPP. Therefore the 3 seats which constitute the difference are the overhang seats. Head of Political Research at the Verit Research, Janeen Fernando said that the allocation of votes as 60% for FPP and 40% for PR enabled political parties to win more than 60% of the seats with less than 60% of the votes, thus creating overhangs. Overhangs can occur in mixed member proportional systems, he toldDailymirror . 
According to Feminist Researcher, Chulani Kodikara, currently doing her PhD at the University of Edinburgh, in areas where few or no women have been elected and where that party has an overhang the obligation to implement the quota falls on the next party. 
For instance, in the Dickwella Pradeshiya Sabha the SLPP has an overhang and only one woman has been elected from their party. The United National Party (UNP) has been allocated a total of seven seats while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP)and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) have two each. Due to the exemption that parties with less than three seats are exempted the SLFP and the JVP are not required by the law to appoint women. Therefore, the obligation falls on the UNP to select females for six of their seven seats of which one was won by an elected candidate. Experts and activists pointed out that it was against the principles of democracy to ask an elected male candidate to step down so that a female can be appointed to fulfill the quota. Therefore the SLPP cannot appoint females other than the female candidate who has been elected.

Inconsistency in the law

Fernando said there is inconsistency as the law requires 25% women for a local council to be formed while exempting certain parties. On one hand the law is very clear that local authorities should constitute 25% women. But the law doesnt say what happens if they dont fulfill this quota. But if political parties decide not to nominate women and say they are exempted, this creates a problem. So how the matter will be resolved depends on how the EC acts, he said.
He added that political parties that are exempted are not forced to nominate only men, and therefore can nominate women. The whole debate that the quota cannot be fulfilled is also a matter of political will, he noted. 

But the question is what happens if these political parties dont appoint women If you take the Dikcwalle case again, if the UNP appoints say five woman and one man, they are flouting the law
Feminist Researcher, Chulani Kodikara
Low Percentage in the first nomination list
Further, he pointed out that parties were required to nominate only 10% of female candidates from the ward level, which was a low percentage for women to be elected to fulfill the quota.

Overhang seats excluded
Meanwhile the Election Commission has also received complaints pointing out the Election Commission has overlooked the number of overhang seats when determining the number of females who should be appointed. Prof. S. Rathnajeevan Hoole, a member of the Election Commission said, in the Walikamam North Pradeshiya Sabha the total number of members to be returned was 35. However, there is an overhang of 4 seats, thus raising the total number of seats to 39. The complaint states that only eight women have been requested to be appointed. But it says that when the overhang seats are counted, the number of seats for women should be nine. My view is that members include the overhang, he said speaking to theDailymirror .
 
Similarly, in the Valvettithurai Urban Council the total number of members to be returned is 15. The Election Commission has requested 3 women to be appointed. This is excluding the 2 overhang seats which raised the total number of seats to 17. If the two overhang seats are added the Urban Council should include 4 women.

Unfair
Responding to the contention that certain parties were treated unfairly by the obligation to appoint females in instances where other parties were exempted, Prof. Hoole said that it was neither a burden nor unfair. Whats the harm in a woman taking a place These are the nominees of parties. The parties chose these women and put them on the list. How can they then say its a burden In no way is it a burden. 

The complaint states that only eight women have been requested to be appointed. But it says that when the overhang seats are counted, the number of seats for women should be nine. My view is that members include the overhang
Prof. S. Rathnajeevan Hoole, a member of the Election Commission
Kodikara said the Local Authorities Elections Act was a strange law as the obligation to appoint women does not fall equally on all parties. In that sense I guess you can argue it is unfair, for example in the case of Dickwella, where the UNP has to appoint six women out of the seven seats, while five political parties are represented in the council. 
However, she pointed out that the Act was debated and discussed in Parliament, and therefore it was now too late But the question is what happens if these political parties dont appoint women If you take the Dikcwalle case again, if the UNP appoints say five woman and one man, they are flouting the law. But we dont know whether the Election Commission will reject such a list, and send it back to the party.
Compromises needto be made
Meanwhile, theDailymirroralso learned that some candidates who are senior and popular have lost by a very small margin. This is a dilemma that parties are facing- that certain senior popular members who may have lost at the ward level with a very low margin or even one vote, are completely blocked from coming to the council from the PR list in cases such as Dikwella where all the candidates from the PR list should be women. This is a huge problem because they would have invested a lot of time, money and energy, Kodikara pointed out.
However, she stressed that compromises need to be made to implement the quota. So the fact that some people are affected in this way cant be helped. Its unfortunate, but thats what a quota of this nature does, she said stressing that the quota tried to address the historic discrimination and marginalization of women. People will also say that a particular man couldnt get in, but some useless woman who has no experience in politics got in through the list. That woman has no experience in politics because of how the political parties have worked in this country. People should understand this, she said. 
She also said womens groups are prepared to go to court if the quota is not implemented as promised. 
No women elected
At a recent press conference Election Commission Chairman, Mahinda Deshapriya said that 535 women candidates have been elected which was a positive sign compared to the low female representation before, which stood at 1.9%. However, in certain areas such as the Batticaloa Municipal Council and Manmunaipattu Pradeshiya Sabha in the Batticaloa district; Karaitheevu Pradeshiya Sabha, and Thirukkovil Pradeshiya Sabha in Ampara; Velanai and Neduntheevu Pradeshiya Sabhas in Jaffna no female candidates have reportedly been elected.
Discouraged from contesting
Apart from the flaws in the law the Daily Mirror has learned that women have been discouraged from contesting. As reported by the Daily Mirror in a previous article some female candidates were subjected to violence. Certain female nominees raised concern of how they were added to the additional nomination list when they could have contested from the ward list. Some female candidates were nominated in areas where the opposition was weak. The sole focus of certain party organizers have been to fulfill the 10% mandatory requirement in terms of the law to nominate women. Leaders say that they conformed to the 10% quota. They say that the party lost in those areas because of women, said Activist Shreen Saroor. She claimed that it was likely that male candidates would take the seats allocated for women, as the number of seats was increased to allocate the quota. Saroor argued that if the quota cannot be implemented in certain councils, the shortfall should atleast be fulfilled by appointing women for other councils, so that when the total number of members is calculated from the country as a whole, the 25% quota is implemented. 
Closed list
Saroor suggested a closed list with a male and female member positioned alternatively would have addressed the situation to some extent. However, currently there is no closed list in place and parties have the discretion to decide whom they select to hold office from the additional list. Many women nominated in the additional nomination paper are unsure whether they will be appointed. In a closed list the order of members is decided beforehand and cannot be changed later. Members get the opportunity to hold office according to the positioning in this list. 
Response from the Elections Commiss
Can Form Council without Quota
The quota cannot reportedly be fulfilled in 10 local government bodies. When queried about the consequences of a council not fulfilling the quota when the law mandates a 25% quota for women, Prof. S. Rathnajeevan Hoole, a member of the Election Commission informed that there is now consensus that the council can be formed. At a meeting convened last month at the Parliament where the Election Commission met all the party leaders, the legal officer to the Ministry of Provincial Councils & Local Government has pointed out that Municipal Councils Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No 15 of 1987 do not invalidate a council which is improperly constituted. The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment)Act of 2017 states local authorities should constitute 25% of women notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Ordinance(The Local Authorities Elections Act). As the Municipal Councils Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act have not been rescinded and as the provision on the 25% quota in the Local Authorities Act does not exclude them, the contention was that the councils can be formed, Prof. Hoole said.

Reconditioned car registrations surge in January
	
Sri Lankas pre-owned or reconditioned car registrations hit a 2-year high in January amid slightly eased interest rates and banks and finance companies racing to grab the largest share of the vehicle leasing market with very attractive offers. 
According to the monthly vehicle registrations tracked by JB Securities Private Limited, a leading stock broking and research firm, pre-owned car registrations shot up to 4,466 units in January from 2,638 units in December and significantly up from 1,149 units 12 months ago.
Suzuki accounted for 2,777 units of which 1,883 were Wagon R followed by Toyota which accounted for 1,257 of which 760 units were 1L Vitz.
Financing share was 56.6 percent down from the mid 60s the previous month indicative that much of the growth is being funded through cash purchases or non-collateralized financing, e.g. personal loans.
Eighty four percent of volumes are in small cars with engines less than 1L indicative of the distortion of the playing field due to the unit method that favours small engines irrespective of value, said JB Securities Managing Director Murtaza Jefferjee.
Meanwhile, the brand new cars saw 840 registrations, up from 756 units a month ago but down from 1,149 units a year earlier.
The segment is dominated by small cars, which account for 88 percent of the total; Suzuki/Maruti accounted for 252 units of which 114 units were Wagon R imported by the agents. Toyota is showing steady growth with its Wigo model registering 55 units, which is a 1L petrol engine small car that is manufactured in Indonesia and marketed locally for Rs. 3.4 million, Jafferjee added.
In a notable development, premium car registrations surged to 206 units in January from a mere 53 units in December and 67 units 12 months ago.
Meanwhile, electric cars recorded 18 units in January up from 6 units in December but significantly down from 40 units 12 months ago. Nissan Leaf accounted for 16 units.
TheCentral Bank in February eased the loan-to-value ratio for electric vehicles and several other categories of vehicles up to 90 percent. The total vehicle registrations during January reached 5,306 units, significantly up from 3,394 units in December and 3,487 units 12 months ago.

The decision arrived at during Sri Lankas Presidency of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to resume substantive work and the role played in this regard by Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha, has been commended during the High-Level Segment of the CD held in Geneva this week.
In his address to the Conference on Monday, the UN Secretary-General (UNSG) Antonio Guterres, referred to the recent Decision of February 16 as an effort to find ways to break the long-standing stalemate in this Conference.
At a follow-up meeting held on the sidelines of the High-Level segment, UNSGs High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said she was deeply impressed and grateful for the leadership offered by Ambassador Aryasinha in adopting the decision which is a contribution not only to the CD, but also towards the overall objective of disarmament.
She requested Sri Lanka to help with the immediate next steps in the implementation of the recent CD decision.
The Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organsation Mr. Lassina Zerbo said the decision taken by the Conference has sent a very encouraging message to the international community.
The Foreign Minister of the current CD Presidency  Sweden, Ms. Margot Wallstrm observed that, It is in these times of hardship that we must multiply our efforts and show that the conference on disarmament, as a platform for diplomacy, can achieve results that bring us closer to our common goal of disarmament. During the past weeks, intensive consultations have been conducted under the able leadership of the Ambassador of Sri Lanka. During these consultations we sensed that there was an emerging will, underpinned by a spirit of compromise, to get the CD back on track. That sense proved correct. The CD eventually managed to adopt a decision that paves the way for structured discussions.

SLFP CC to decide on no-confidence motion against PM
	
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said the Central Committee of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was to decide on the No-Confidence Motion, which was to be brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Addressing the media following an event held in Colombo, Minister Amaraweera said the SLFP would take a decision with regard to the No-Confidence Motion, which would be in favour of the country as well as a decision which was expected by the people.
The No-Confidence Motion against Premier Wickremesinghe was proposed from the United National Party (UNP). The SLFP, as a democratic party will take a reasonable decision on it considering the well-being of the country, he said.
While referring to the recent Cabinet reshuffle, Minister Amaraweera said it could be better if it was done in a more scientific manner and added that more changes would be take place in coming week with regard to the positions of the SLFP in Cabinet.
He said the recent Cabinet reshuffle was basically made on the the side of the UNP and added that the authorities could not satisfy each and every person following a Cabinet reshuffle.
He also said it was obvious to face some sort of confusion after a Cabinet reshuffle; Accordingly, several changes have been made to the Cabinet. It would be better if it had happened in a more scientific manner, he said.
However, we cannot say the recent changes made on the Cabinet are bad. It is better if there are some more changes, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: The Library at Sri Dalada Maligawa
## Section: News Features

The Library at Sri Dalada Maligawa
	

The re-birth of this library really came after the LTTE Bomb Blast. The Octagon was literally buried in debris and the books were strewn all over
The Lake was also created by King Rajasinghe, without which Kandy would have been just another town in the central hills

Unknown to thousands who visit the Sri Dalada Maligawa, hidden in the third floor of the new building is a library of international standard to be used by scholars. It has the rare copy of the Thai Triptiaka published in Thai language, Siamese ( now Thailand ) during the 25th Anniversary of the reign of the King of Siam or Thailand and the only copy now available to the world, other than what is perhaps available at the British Museum.
The King of Siam was Somdetech Phra Paramindo Maha Chuladolnkara Phra Chula Chom Klao - who on his 25th Anniversary on the Throne of Siam., printed 500 copies of the Thai Triptiakaya in Thai language and distributed the copies to a number of countries including the United Kingdom. One was to the Oriental Library housed at that time at the Octagen.
In the same manner one of the most rare books of World History printed in the United Kingdom, which is claimed as the only book outside the British Museum  Illustrated Panorama of the World published by A.H.Walkers, is also at the Maligawa Library.
There are nearly three thousand valuable and rare books and also around three thousand Ola Leaf Books collected over the years. The Library at the Maligawa is an International Library which had fallen into decay over the years and had been revived to its old glory with modern State-of-the-art technology.

Pathrippuwa (the Octagen) butting out of the Sri Dalada Mailgawa, which withstood the bomb blast of the LTTE was the creation of the last King of Kandy Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe. This was created and built by the craftsman par excellence Mulachara Devendra.
There are nearly three thousand rare books and also around three thousand Ola Leaf Books collected over the years
Looking back, the Pattirippuwa or the Octagon was built after demolishing an old building that stood on this site at the request of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe in 1802. The word is derived from the Tamil word Parthu to see and Irripppu to be seated. The King is said to have viewed martial arts being played on Maha Maluwa. Devendra Mulachari is the creator of the building on the orders of the King and he is said to have created a model using the stems of Plantain leaves, the creator Devendra died under tragic circumstances after this creation.
The Pathrippuwa building was also the centre of the administration in the Kandyan Era and was also used by the King to relax with his queen of the day, chosen from his Harem which is now the Kandy National Museum. This queen had also the opportunity to visit the Sacred Tooth Relic, which according to records of the British was visited by the King daily. The Sacred Tooth Relic at that time was the Kings personal property.
Looking back, the Pattirippuwa was built after demolishing an old building that stood on this site at the request of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe in 1802
Apparently continuing the Kandyan administration and tradition the Resident of the Kandyan Kingdom Sir John DOyly used this building as the administrative arm after the country was ceded to the British. Again this building according to records was used in 1868 during the tenure of office of the Government Agent Braybooke as the Kandy Kachcheri or the hub of administration.
 
The Lake was also created by King Rajasinghe, without which Kandy would have been just another town in the central hills.
Apart from the often related role of this Octagonal shaped building Pathruppuwa, also had a lesser publicized role - to encase the historic library, simply called the Oriental Library but the librarys history within the Octagon commenced from the beginning of the British administration.
In fact, as records show, the library was under the Government Agent, as much as the Sacred Tooth Relic Chamber. As a result the library shot into fame and it received large collections of rare books. Even first editions were sent to this Library from all over the world.
But when the keys of the main Shrine were handed over to the three custodians, the interest in the Library waned
Some of the Ola leaf books were from the British soldiers themselves who returned them to the Library. They had been given by the locals as a token of friendship or for favours
It is here that the British have a good word. The British unlike the Portuguese and other colonial rulers who plundered the Kandyan Kingdom and destroyed all its heritage, the British, understood the value of Buddhist heritage and spared some of the valuable assets of the Kandyan Kingdom, thanks especially to the efforts of John D Oyly, though at first he was considered a spy of the British Crown. The British first formed the library as a collection of precious Ola Leaf books, plundered and hidden away in various regional temples and feudal places, which were discovered by British soldiers. Some of the Ola leaf books were from the British soldiers themselves who returned them to the Library. They had been given by the locals as a token of friendship or for favours.
The value of the knowledge of these books were first noticed by DOyly as the then first resident of the Kandyan Kingdom. He contacted with Venerable Karatotoa Thera at Hambantota, while serving as the Matara Magistrate. Therefore DOyly commenced the collection of the Ola Leaf books, which were scattered all over the Kandyan Kingdom.
The oldest Ola Leaf Book that is found in this Library is the Ola Leaf written by Venerable Sangharaja Weliwita Thera known as Bessage Manjusawa according to the Librarian Ms. Prema Mutuwatta, who was the Assistant Archivist of the Kandy Archives, who is presently the librarian of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. Incidentally, she is the only woman on the staff of the Sri Dalada Malgiawa.
This large collection of Ola Leaf books totalling around 3000. Out of which only twenty five per cent are distinctive to the history of this Library. The other Ola Leaf Books are donations from villagers in bundles which have Buddhist scriptures such as the Satpiattana.
The re-birth of this library really came after the LTTE Bomb Blast. The Octagon was literally buried in debris and the books were strewn all over and the cupboards had come down. Into this came the proposal that the Octagon should be pulled down for it to be rebuilt. Thanks to the University of Peradeniya Civil Engineer Professor Ranaweera and the then Diyawadana Nilame Neeranjan Wijeratne.
It was Ms. Prema Mutuwatta, the Assistant Archivist, who came across this valuable collection of books. Then she advised Diyawadana Nilame Neeranjan Wijeyaratne as to what had to be done. In the course of surfing through the books, Mrs. Mutuwetta came across an unparalleled multi-language collection and appeared to be a South Asian Regional Archive stemming from the Kandyan era, thus transforming from a mere Oriental Library to a home of historical significance. Some of the first were found dating back to 1800s

It was also discovered that there was an exact index of the books prepared by Venerable Mahanayake of Malwatta Panditha Sirimalwatte Ananda Thera, as the one time Librarian of this  gold mine of books. Here it must be remembered that Panditha Ananda Thera used to walk to the Temple four times a day and never for a moment used any vehicle until he became the Mahanayake.
The monks who were looking after the Library as a part of the Maha Sangha in Service of the Maligawa were there only to show to the people the Ola Leaf Books inside the cupboards. There were no scholarly research except from the Venerable Mahanayake Sirimalwatte Ananda Thera.
In this impasse, it was left to the then Diyawadana Nilame Neeranjan Wijeratne to retrieve the books with the help of Ms. Mutuwatte. The Diyawadana Nilames had come and gone but this Library was of no interest to them, until the French educated Neerajan Wijeratne who put his hand on the library after the blast.

Unlike in other fields, Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilange Dela took up the Library from where it was left by Diyawadana Nilame Neeranjan Wijeyaratne and had re-organized the Library, first employing Ms.Mutuwatte with her retirement from the Archives Department. So, Ms Mutuwatta told me that her work is now over and that she should retire and let people like Ajantha Samarakoon her assistant to continue the work.

## Title: The real and unreal

The real and unreal
	

When I read doomsday prophecies and warnings against the Rajapaksas by those who believe in the (relative) goodness of this government and the (absolutist) totalitarianism of the previous government, I am inclined to consider them as something out of a dystopia, post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror flick.
Its like the ending of The Terminator where Sarah Connor is told of an impending thunderstorm and she bluntly says, I know, not with respect to that thunderstorm, but with respect to THE FUTURE. We have so many Sarah Connors among our commentators: they look at one political prophecy and create something ineffably profound out of it while missing the wood for the trees. The thunderstorm is there, but the writers are looking elsewhere.
The February Local Government elections gleaned three reactions from these commentators: disbelief, apathy, horror. They had hedged bets on Rajapaksa winning but they had underestimated just how terribly dissatisfied the people were (as they continue to be) with the present regime. Its rather laughable if not downright ridiculous to suggest that power obtained from the periphery this way is enough for a Rajapaksa Restoration, but that is what these (prophetic) commentators are already ranting and raving about.

When Kumar David suggests that the populist backlash would be enough for the government to backtrack on the grievances of the Tamil people (They are better off buying real-estate from Elon Musk to settle on planet Mars than to expect justice from the Sinhalese) and when Tisaranee Gunasekera portends a worse contingency than a Mahinda Restoration  a Gotabaya Presidency (oh, the horror!)  they are acknowledging that for the people, the lack of accountability by the government over real and economic issues (like the price of coconuts) has overridden their earlier concerns over bringing to justice the criminals and looters of the past. In other words, for the people and according to these writers, it would seem as though the LG polls was a litmus test on whether we were concerned with issues of reconciliation and natural justice.
They had hedged bets on Rajapaksa winning but they had underestimated just how terribly dissatisfied the people were with the present regime

Not that the detractors of the Rajapaksa Cabal are entirely in the wrong. When R. Sampanthan, in parliament, contends that the Eelam bud will grow out of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramunas lotus bud, he is not engaging in mischievous conjecture, he is pointing out that the populist wave on which the Rajapaksas are riding (which for Dayan Jayatilleka has replaced the Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist wave they used to ride on during Mahindas presidency) might very well congeal into a racist, lunatic fringe in the future. Theres of course a difference, a whole world of a difference in fact, between chauvinism and electoral populism, but what commentators are missing out is the fact that in Sri Lanka, the one has historically tended to transform (or be transformed) into the other. Probably thats where Mr Sampanthan is correct.
The LG polls was a classic case, in the most simplified sense, of economic and racial issues winning over constitutional concerns. For the people in the periphery, outside the big cities, only two things mattered: the rising cost of living, and the fear of a minoritarian elite controlling their future. The latter of these was tempered by a racist outlook, to be sure, and that racist outlook (the fear of Eelamism coming out of a parliament in which the official opposition was headed by the TNA) was added to and supplemented by the unbearable cost of living. When these twin issues remain un-addressed, when all you have is an indifferent government brushing off the concerns of the people with the simplistic excuse, We are better than the politicians you used to have! the people get tired. And when they get tired, even issues which do not border on economics, like power sharing and devolution and constitutions, become the Rosetta Stone on which they assess the policies of the government. On that count, the government lost, and the Joint Opposition won. Wildly.
The LG polls was a classic case, in the most simplified sense, of economic and racial issues winning over constitutional concerns
To put it in perspective, hence, constitutional amendments and legislative enactments cannot and will not be accepted by the people if the economic backdrop to them is not met.

For the people, in other words, the real is economic and substantive, the unreal is immaterial and theoretical.
When the price of a coconut soars, when fertiliser subsidies are never enough for the farmer, and when the Ceylon Electricity Board and University students engage in strike after strike in the name of correcting anomalies, the people get tired and mistake the governments inability for its unwillingness to address those anomalies. Its difficult to suggest that the Bond Scandal had anything substantive to do with the backlash against the government, but the way it was marketed, by both the government and the JO, ensured that it too was seen by the people as evidence of this unwillingness of the ruling coalition. The people did not vote for Mahinda out of a love for his peculiar and inimitable brand of populism, but they were voting for his troupe because they preferred the old order, which rode on continuity without change, to the new, which rides on change without continuity (as Dayan Jayatilleka noted years ago with respect to Maithripala Sirisenas bid for the presidency).
When R. Sampanthan, in parliament, contends that the Eelam bud will grow out of the SLPPs lotus bud, he is not engaging in mischievous conjecture, he is pointing out that

The woods are there, and so are the trees. How long will it take for the politician to try and bring the two together How many more ignoble defeats at the hands of the Rajapaksas will it take for us to wake up to this clear and present danger
For the truth of the matter is this: the more you harp on about the supremacy of the immaterial (constitutions, laws, the need for national reconciliation) over the material (the affordability of food, the availability of fuel, the supply of electricity), the more likely it is that you will be seen as an ivory tower elitist who has no regard for the latter. I think, therefore, the first step in recognising this is acknowledging that there are worse things that can happen to this country and polity than a Rajapaksa Restoration, or for that matter a Gotabaya Presidency. Worse things that may well transpire in the near future.

Trump backs tougher gun control laws
	

Anne Gearan, Mike DeBonis, Seung Min Kim (c) 2018, The Washington Post Mar 01, 2018 - WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump upended modest Republican gun-control proposals and defied the National Rifle Association during a freewheeling session with lawmakers Wednesday that the president said should yield comprehensive restrictions on the strong side.
But in the televised meeting at the White House, Trump sent so many mixed signals about what he envisioned for a package on firearms and school safety that he left Democrats gleeful and Republicans tight-lipped amid doubts that Congress would produce any legislation.
We want to pass something great, and to me the something great has to be where we prevent it from happening again, Trump said, referring to the shooting deaths of 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14.
Sitting with a group of Democrats and Republicans, including some who are backed by the NRA, Trump made what sounded like an extraordinary break with the powerful gun-rights organization. He accused lawmakers of being so petrified by the NRA that they have not been willing to take even small steps on gun control.

Wickramasuriya was arrested for misappropriation of public funds while serving as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to the USA from 2008 to 2013
	Wickramasuriya was residing in the US and engaging in the business of Tea Export, at the time he was appointed as the Consular General to the Sri Lankan mission in Los Angeles in 2005

	Through thee-mail, a request had been made from Wickramasuriyas Counsel to treat the sensitive information provided as confidential. However, it has found its way to the Rajapaksas

B report page



In a new twist in the saga of Sri Lankas former Ambassador to the United States of America, it has emerged that the US Authorities were in communication with the former Ambassador, Jaliya Chitran Wickramasuriya, about becoming a prosecution witness in an U.S. investigation into allegedly dubious financial transactions made by persons connected to the former First family. 
Surprisingly, the development came to light in a highly confidential e-mail sent by Wickramasuriyas lawyer, in the US, to one of his lawyers in Sri Lanka. Through means that have yet to be ascertained, this confidential and legally privileged communication got into the hands of allies of the Rajapaksa family within a few days after it was received in Colombo. 

The information led to efforts by affected parties to persuade the Sri Lankan Government to assert diplomatic immunity for Wickramasuriya to prevent him from testifying in the US against the Rajapaksa family.
As a part of this process, an eminent Presidents Counsel was tasked to file a Writ Application in the Court of Appeal to legally compel the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to reverse its decision not to assert diplomatic immunity. 
Filing a Writ Petition, the accused Wickramasuriya, was seeking an order to quash the decision to issue a letter waiving off his diplomatic immunity. 
However, when the Writ Petition was taken up in the Court of Appeal on February 6, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appearing for the Attorney General, raised a preliminary objection, stating that seeking the decision to withdraw immunity was taken by the President in his official capacity and the only Court with jurisdiction to reverse such decision is the Supreme Court according to the Constitution. 
When the petition was taken up for support last week, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda who appeared for the Attorney General, as well as Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner, were given time until March 5 to make their final written submissions. Considering the submissions, the Court of Appeal is expected to take a final decision on whether or not the case can proceed further. 
Wickramasuriya, who is a cousin of the former President, and now Kurunegala District MP, Mahinda Rajapaksa, was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport on November 18, 2016 while going through immigration at the Departure Lounge after a vacation in Sri Lanka, by the Officers of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). Wickramasuriya was arrested for misappropriation of public funds while serving as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to the USA from 2008 to 2013. 
According to individuals briefed on the matter, an investigation was initiated against Wickramasuriya after the FCID was established in 2015 based on several complaints, and the investigation had been conducted in a most secretive manner. When the investigators came to know that Wickramasuriya was to leave the country, a Court Order had been obtained to arrest him, sources told the Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity. 

Wickramasuriya was residing in the US and engaging in the business of Tea Export, at the time he was appointed as the Consular General to the Sri Lankan mission in Los Angeles in 2005. Three years later in 2008, he was appointed the Sri Lankan Ambassador to USA. 
According to the B Report (B 21/2016) submitted to the Fort Magistrates Court by the FCID, the former Diplomat is accused of having pocketed US$ 322,027.35 out of US $ 6.6 million (approximately Rs. 1 billion as per the present exchange rate) that was deposited to the Escrow account maintained by the Embassy of Sri Lanka, to purchase a building to house the Sri Lankan Embassy at No: 3025 Whitehaven Street, Washington DC 20008. 
According to the Settlement Statement issued to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development by Allen Randy, who was in charge of the Embassys Escrow account, the purchase price was US $ 6.25 million. The Settlement Statement further states that the purchaser (the GoSL) owns the remaining balance of US$ 332,072.35. 
In a confidential addendum to the Settlement Statement it had further stated that the balance of the Escrow account US $332,027.35 had been paid to two companies on Wickramasuriyas instruction. These two companies  Washington Fine Properties and DCRE Company had been paid US$ 166,013.68 and US$ 166,013.66 respectively as broker fees by the property seller. Later, the Escrow account had been closed on January 13, 2016. 
Broker fee not documented 
According to the B Report, although the e-mails exchanged by the then Acting Ambassador and the property seller says that a broker fee had been paid to Washington Fine Properties and DCRE Company, this had not been documented in any of the Embassy documents. 
It was later revealed how this money had been paid to an American Company  Paper Crown LLC and PPP International (Pvt) Ltd., which is a Sri Lankan Company. These two companies had been paid US$ 82,027.35 and US$ 250,000 respectively by Wickramasuriya although these two companies were not nvolved in a legitimate transaction. 
Paper Crown LLC is owned by Vinod Basnayake  a close associate of Ambassador Wickramasuriya. According to the B Report, both Basnayake and Wickramasuriya were meeting constantly at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington during the latters tenure as the Ambassador. 
PPP International (Pvt) Ltd., of No. 11 Mansion Place, Negombo is owned by Allansis Brendon Sosa who is a Sri Lankan. Out of the money remitted to PPP International, Rs. 18 million had been deposited to Ceylon Royal Tea and Supplies (Pvt) Ltd., owned by Jaliya Wickramasuriya. The investigations meanwhile had found out that on six occasions, PPP International had paid Rs. 10.196 million each to Ceylon Royal Tea. 
Although Wickramasuriya had made the Embassy shut down the Escrow account when withdrawing US$ 6.6 million to purchase the building, there is an in-depth property report including tax and deed history of No. 3025 Whitehaven Street, Washington DC 20008. The house had cost the country only US$ 6.25 million. According to the transfer document, the ownership of the building had been changed from Bodman, Samuel E & M Diane to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on January 16, 2013. The 6,135 square feet building consists of seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms. The building had been built in 1951 and the land value of the property was US$1.924 million in 2016. 
Allegedly evaded paying taxes 
Following the transaction, Wickramasuriya is alleged to have evaded payment of taxes in the US which led relevant departments in the US to start investigating him. 
The investigations brought to light how Wickramasuriya had violated the US laws by not declaring money in his possession and evaded paying taxes. As it was an offence in the US, the US Government had requested the GoSL to recall Ambassador Wickramasuriya. Later, career diplomat Asela Weerakoon was temporarily posted to the US as the Sri Lankan Ambassador till a permanent replacement was made. 

The investigations refer to how the Rajapaksa Government remained tight lipped about the US Governments request to the GoSL to remove the Ambassador and how Wickramasuriya was once again posted to Canada as the Sri Lankan Ambassador. 
The US and Canada have strong links with regard to Sri Lankan politicians and the citizens who are accused of fraud. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent the credential details of Wickram
asuriya following his appointment to Canada as the new Sri Lankan Ambassador, the Canadian Government refused to accept the appointment. 
According to the B report, Wickramasuriya, maintains that he was not involved in any fraud, but had received a commission that had been paid to two companies that were involved in the purchase. However, on the instructions of Wickramasuriya, this money had been transferred to PPP International (Pvt) Ltd and Paper Crown LLC which are owned by two Sri Lankans, sources said. 
Since the allegation for swindling this money was first levelled against the Embassy official, in order to defend himself, the officer had spilled the beans to prevent any action being taken against him, it is learned 
Wickramasuriya who was released on bail on March 18, 2017, later made a request from Colombo Fort Magistrates Court to grant him permission to travel to the US for three months to undergo treatment for one of his eyes, which appeal the Court turned down and ordered a report from the Director Eye Hospital Colombo to determine whether the illness can be treated in Sri Lanka. It is alleged that the report had been given in favour of the former Ambassador stating that the said treatment cannot be given here. After reviewing the report, Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne allowed the accused to travel to the US for eight weeks and he was ordered to deposit two cash securities and a property he owns in Sri Lanka.

Be that as it may, now it is more than seven months since Wickramasuriya left for the US. His lawyer in America had send an e-mail to his Counsel, on September 24, 2017. 
Through the e-mail, a request had been made from Wickramasuriyas Counsel to treat the sensitive information provided as Confidential. However, it has found its way to the Rajapaksas. 
According to reliable sources, the reason why the Government is coming under pressure to uphold diplomatic immunity on Wickramasuriya is to prevent the US from forcing the former Ambassador to testify against the former first family. 
Although Colombo Fort Magistrates Court has issued an open warrant for the arrest of Wickramasuriya and issued notice on the defendants four bailsmen, including his wife who signed for the bail, to appear before the Court on February 16th, neither the accused nor his wife was present in Courts when the case was taken up last week. Meanwhile, the Court Registrar was ordered to issue Open Warrants on Wickramasuriya in English and Sinhala languages and to send copies to the Controller of Immigration and Emigration for necessary action. 
It is now clear that Wickramasuriya is not returning to the country to appear before Court. The Court lifted the Travel Ban and granted Wickramasuriya permission to travell overseas for medical treatment on the recommendation of the Director Eye Hospital Colombo, who confirmed that the accused cannot be treated in Sri Lanka, sources claimed. 
Meanwhile, an e-mail was sent to Wickramasuriyas Counsel by this writer requesting information as to how the confidential correspondence between attorneys had gone to the hands of the Rajapaksa family and whether the Court was informed that Wickramasuriya would not appear in Court, as stated in the e-mail he received. There has been no response for this e-mail has so far. 

Attorney-client privilege defined
Senior Attorney Upul Jayasuriya PC when contacted to find out what is meant by attorney-client privilege in Sri Lankan law and what the legal basis is in Sri Lanka for attorney-client privilege, Jayasuriya replied as follows:
Confidentiality and Attorney Client relationship concern the information received or obtained from the client and the lawyer is required to keep it private and protected in order to maintain clients ability to confide freely in his lawyer.
It is a fundamental principle embodied in the lawyer-client relationship that in the absence of clients specific consent that the lawyer must not release the information relating to communication or any information obtained in the process of representation. This is a hallmark of the client lawyer relationship.
However, in case such confidential communication is received by outside third parties it would be best left with discretion to the holder of such information. However, if such information is used in any legal proceedings the same could be objected to on the basis of the admissibility of such information on the basis that the same is confidential, Jayasuriya added.

UK assures trade agreement with SL post-Brexit
	
The UK Government said it intends to provide continuity and stability to Sri Lankas current trade agreementswith the EU, even after the Brexit comes into affect.
Minister of State for Trade and Investment Greg Hands said Sri Lankas exports to the UK are made under the EU's unilateral trade arrangement, the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) at present.
The Government intends to provide continuity and stability whilst leaving the EU, which includes maintaining the effects of our trading relationships as we leave. This includes the EU's GSP scheme, and our trading terms with Sri Lanka, including human rights. When the UK has left the EU, we can look to improve on those trading agreements, he said as responding to questions raised in the House of Commons this week.
Liberal Democrat Spokesperson Edward Davey asked whether the British Government plans to negotiate a trade agreement with Sri Lanka that replicates the existing agreement between that country and the EU after the UK leaves the EU.
He also asked whether the Secretary of State for International Trade plans for human rights monitoring and co-operation to bepart of any future trade agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
