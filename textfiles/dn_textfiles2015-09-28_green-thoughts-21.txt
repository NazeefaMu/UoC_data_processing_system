Green thoughts at 21!

Her life is an open book for all those who love and admire her. Today at the age of 88 years one of the country’s acting legends, Iranganie Roxanna Serasinghe, says that if she were 21 years-old today she would spend a few minutes to sit down and contemplate on how to make the world a better place for all living beings.
“The world is a beautiful place, physically. However the most intelligent creature living on this earth is also the cruelest and most disruptive being. Man does not realize that by destroying the natural beauty and environment he is destroying himself. I would ponder over the fact how I could possibly change this situation,” she said.
She believes that she can put her new-found energy to good use by spearheading environment conservation projects. She notes that she will gather many other individuals whose hearts lie in the subject to create an environment conservation movement.
“Conservation of natural resources is immensely important for the survival of Sri Lanka as well as the world. We are so negligent about this fact. Throughout the ages we have destroyed many things. The British destroyed all the central hills to plant coffee and tea by burning acres and acres of land but when we took over, we did the same thing. Even people in power have a hand in selling trees that have been cut down and are making money out of it,” she repents.
“Everything is interconnected and interdependent. To destroy nature is like committing suicide! I would use my energy and young blood to get the message across to the society. Our country is blessed with beautiful places but people ruin the beauty through anti-social behaviour. There are enough rules and regulations to protect nature but no one obeys or enforces them. That is the tragedy,” she notes.
She is aware that many consider 21 years as the ripe time to think about marriage but Serasinghe notes that she has not yet recognized the difference between how the man and woman thinks.
“Marriage is supposed to be a beautiful partnership but it is truly the saddest and most disappointing liaison. Many marriages end in divorce today. There are many people who are staying together due to various reasons. It is sad that they are forced to be together when they can lead a peaceful life away from each other,” she says.
She still loves the idea of having children and considers the most cherished moment in her life as the day she set eyes on her first born.
“Environment conservation work comes before marriage for me. Therefore I would not focus on marriage at 21. I would postpone it. I would do my best to make the world a better place to live, environmentally,” she mused.
“Human beings are so greedy! They are not satisfied with what they have. Even those who have so much – too much in fact – want more! They engage in inhuman acts like cheating, stealing and murder to extend their wealth. They grab onto more material things,” she said.
She suggests that meditation is the healing balm for the society.
“I engage in vipassana meditation daily. It helps me to get to know about myself and the world. I believes that it sets me on the right track,” she said.
She would also like to be a healing touch for the distressed.
“Little things count for sad and lonely people. Stretch out a hand and help the distressed. If you cannot provide funds at least spend a little time listening to their grief,” she requests.
Though she had never dreamed of becoming an actress and never thinks of herself as one, Serasinghe has grown to love her profession and believes that she would get into acting even if she was 21 today.
“Though I prefer stage dramas, cinema is the ‘in thing’ at the moment. I would to love to work in both. I enjoy acting and entertaining masses with a purpose. You can send a positive message across to the society through art productions,” she said.
