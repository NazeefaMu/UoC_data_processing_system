Perpetual Treasuries files writ petition against Monetary Board


	

Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, a primary dealer specialising in the intermediary government security market, filed a Writ Petition before the Court of Appeal seeking an order quashing the directions of the Monetary Board imposing restriction on it.

It claims that, in the absence of a formal violation of procedure by it in the purported bond scandal, the true intentions behind the issuing of the said directions are mala fide, and ultra vires the regulatory powers of the Respondents.

It bemoans that the impugned directions were issued for extraneous reasons in order to satisfy the media and political agendas.

It laments that if the said impugned directions are in force the Perpetual Group of Companies would suffer grave and irremediable financial loss and be driven to bankruptcy.

In the petition filed through Attorney-at-Law G.G.Arulparagasam, the Petitioners, Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Ltd cited the Central Bank, the Monetary Board and 11 others as Respondents.

The matter is to be taken up before Court on February 20.

Some of the directions are that (1) Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd shall not bid at any primary auctions exceeding 12.5% of the total amount offered at such auction and shall not bid exceeding 20% of the offered amount of each item representing different maturities; (2) the daily aggregate of the secondary market transactions by it in government securities shall not exceed Rs 1 billion; (3) It shall not, except with the prior written approval of the Monetary Board, distribute its profits, retained earnings or reserves; (4) It shall not enter into any transaction, for consideration or otherwise, except with the prior written approval of the Monetary Board, in respect of anything not connected with the activities of a primary dealer.
