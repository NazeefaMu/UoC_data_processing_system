Prisons Spokesman T.N. Upuldeniya said prisoners who had been convicted for minor offences under the Penal Code had been granted Presidential pardon.

“Inmates jailed for minor offences including those who were jailed for not being able to pay fines have been released. Seven female inmates were among the released prisoners,” he said.
