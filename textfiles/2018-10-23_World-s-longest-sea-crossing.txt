Chinese President Xi Jinping has officially opened the world's longest sea crossing bridge, nine years after construction first began. ncluding its access roads, the bridge spans 55km (34 miles) and connects Hong Kong to Macau and the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai. In the past, travelling between Zhuhai and Hong Kong would take up to four hours - the new bridge cuts this down to 30 minutes.
