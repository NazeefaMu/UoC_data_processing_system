KDU emerges champs at inaugural National Moot Court Comp


	



 

he Moot Society of Sri Lanka Law College successfully hosted its inaugural ‘National Moot Court Competition’ on March 11 and 12, with the presence of all state and private institutions teaching law including the Jaffna, Peradeniya and Colombo universities and several private institutions including General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), the Horizon Campus of Business and Technology and the British College of Applied Studies.   
Administrative Law expert 
Dr. Sunil Coorey drafted the compromise for the competition. It is noteworthy that his doctorate thesis ‘Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka’ -- often referred to as the ‘Bible of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka’ -- is currently used by practitioners and judges. 

 

 


However, the first day saw the completion of preliminary sessions. It was held in two rounds. At the end of the second round, the Colombo and Peradeniya universities, the KDU and the Horizon Campus of Business and Technology qualified for the semifinals. Following yet another enthralling set of arguments in the semis, Colombo University and KDU made their way to the finals. 
While both sides put up strong cases for their clients, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University emerged winners, with the adjudication of Supreme Court Judge Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare PC along with Judges of the Court of Appeal Justices A.H.M.D. Nawaz and Lakshman Dehideniya.  The awards for the Best Mooter and Best Runner-up Mooter were won by Nath Gunawardena of KDU and Vikum Jayasinghe from the Colombo University respectively. The duo received their awards from Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC. 
The prestigious championship shield ‘H.V. Perera Memorial Award’ was presented in memory of Queen’s Counsel Herbert Victor Perera, a prominent lawyer Sri Lanka has ever produced. 
The Runners-Up trophy was sponsored by Sri Lanka Law College Principal 
Mrs. Indira Samarasinghe PC in memory of her parents Mary Therese and Reginald James Senaratne. 

 

 


The Moot Society was happy to have been joined by Dr. H.V. Perera’s granddaughter in this endeavour. 
The society hereby expresses its profound gratitude to the high-profile personalities -- officers of the Attorney General’s Department, attorneys of the unofficial bar and Judges of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal -- for making themselves available at the event despite their busy schedules.  Furthermore, the organisers are grateful for the patronage extended by legal professionals and corporations to make the competition a reality. The Moot Society of Sri Lanka Law College looks forward to continuing creating opportunities for prospective legal practitioners.
