Batsman Kusal Janith Perera, who crashed into the advertising boards, while fielding during the second innings of the West Indies in the ongoing test match, is cleared of any serious injury, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said in an official statement a short while ago.

“He is cleared of any serious injury, but we will have to wait and see, how he will come up tomorrow morning, before making a decision on whether to bat him or not,” said Asanka Gurusinha, the Team Manager.
