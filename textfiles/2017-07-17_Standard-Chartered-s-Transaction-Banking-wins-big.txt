Standard Chartered Sri Lanka was awarded the following awards in the Best Service Providers category for ‘Supply Chain Solutions’, ‘Cash Management’, ‘Trade Finance’, and ‘E-Solutions and Technology Partner’.


Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Transaction Banking Country Head Roger Norton commented: “This is an important encouragement to the team to be recognised for the service and solutions we bring to our clients. The Asset awards are Asia’s preeminent recognition for those organisations that have excelled in their respective industries, and we are delighted to be the recipients of four awards.”


The awards recognised Standard Chartered’s accomplishment of mandates in the apparel, and oil and gas industry where the bank has helped clients reduce their cash conversion cycle, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. Clients now enjoy a greater benefit as the automation of current processes has facilitated reduction in manual work and proactive risk management. The bank has achieved a mix of both payment and collection mandates reinforcing Standard Chartered’s ability to offer bespoke solutions to address client needs. The awards also acknowledged the bank’s differentiated trade finance capabilities such as offering structured receivables financing.  
Standard Chartered Sri Lanka has won ‘Best Cash Management Bank’ and ‘Best Trade Finance Bank’ for the second consecutive year, reiterating the bank’s exemplary capabilities in the cash and trade management space.
