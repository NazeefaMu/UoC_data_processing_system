Kicked out for not helping his sidekicks!


	



 

A powerful politico had used his clout to transfer a Divisional Secretary out of his area for not allowing his sidekicks to engage in illicit sand mining.

 


Earlier, the politico had abused the Divisional Secretary concerned calling him ‘booruwa’ (Donkey) for ‘harassing’ his sidekicks, who had been mining sand illicitly. Angered by the politico’s conduct, a group of employees had booed at the politico, when he was leaving the scene.


The person who succeeded the Secretary who was transferred out is said to be a hand-picked one of the politico, they say.
