The company acquired the latter for a sum of Rs.3.2 billion in October 2015. The resulting expansion of customer base and growth in employee numbers will further reinforce Janashakthi’s position in the general insurance industry where it will now account for a market share of approximately 17.5 percent with an estimated gross written premium (GWP) of Rs.11 billion.

“The acquisition of AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited marked a significant step in our long-term growth strategy. Capitalizing on the operational synergies of the two entities, we have been working diligently towards ensuring a swift yet smooth consolidation to deliver on customer service excellence.

We are also working with renewed vigour on expanding our product portfolio and are delighted to announce that we will be unveiling several innovative, customer-focused solutions in the near future,” said Janashakthi Insurance PLC Chief Executive Officer Jude Fernando.

In line with the amalgamation process, Janashakthi Insurance PLC has fully absorbed the employees of AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited into the organisation, maintaining its credibility as a responsible employer. Further, the general insurance operations of the 40 AIA branch offices have been relocated to the nearest Janashakthi branches, enabling all customers to now have access to the 110 Janashakthi branches located islandwide.
