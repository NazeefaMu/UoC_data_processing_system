All Ceylon Private Bus Workers Association (ACPBWA) said that the ongoing private bus strike will continue today as well unless the President himself intervenes to solve their issues.

They also condemned the Transport Minister's decision on new spot fines system. Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva told at a media briefing yesterday that no one could oppose the new traffic fines once they were passed in Parliament and gazetted.

“We only need the President’s intervention, not Minister Siripala’s intervention,” ACPBWA convener Kumararatna Renuka told the Daily Mirror. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
