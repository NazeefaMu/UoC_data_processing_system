Bribery charges: SIU to conduct initial probes against police officials


	

In a bid to expedite disciplinary action and ensure transparency, IGP Pujith Jayasundara said yesterday that the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) would conduct initial investigations against police officials who were arrested by the Bribery Commission on offences under the Bribery Act.

He said the decision was taken as there had been a delay in carrying out initial investigations to take disciplinary action against such police officers earlier because investigations were carried out by the ASP or a higher officer who supervised the police station or unit the accused police officers were attached to.

Accordingly, initial investigations to conduct disciplinary action would be done by the SIU and not by officers at divisional level.

Police said that the Bribery Commission had also agreed to provide its fullest cooperation in this regard. (Ajith Siriwardana)
