A group of leading Buddhist Monks today called for the ban of school big matches saying that the matches acted like a platform for promotion of alcohol among students leading deterioration of social values.

Addressing a news conference held at the Government Information Department, Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera, the Founder of the Sri Bodhiraja Foundation, said that the big matches should be banned in the name of morality.

“The Principals and authorities, including past students should take the responsibility and ban these matches. If not, the law enforcement authorities should ban them. Big matches and related events had become public nuisance today. Students consume alcohol and then damage public properties,” the Thera said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
