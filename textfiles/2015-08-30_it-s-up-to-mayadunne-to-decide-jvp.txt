The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today there was some doubt about former Auditor General Sarathchandra Mayadunne accepting his appointment to parliament from the JVP national list after he expressed reservations about it.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said Mr. Mayadunne, though had not officially mentioned anything about it, appeared reluctant to work with those appointed to parliament by other political parties through their national lists.
“In case he resigns we will appoint another sutiable member through the JVP's national list. But no decision has been taken yet because Mr. Mayadunne is still our nominee,” Mr. Silva said.
Apprehensive about an opposition made up of a political party representing the government functioning as the opposition, Mr. Silva said the JVP would do its best to function as the real opposition in the 15th parliament which would meet for the first time tomorrow.
Mr. Silva told Daily Mirror the JVP would support the UNP-led unity government to pass all people-friendly Bills but would not hesitate to speak out and oppose any Bills that would be detrimental for the country and the people. (SAJ)
