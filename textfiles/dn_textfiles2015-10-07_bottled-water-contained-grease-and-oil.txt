Bottled water contained grease and oil

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) officers in a recent raid confiscated bottles of water which were found to be contaminated with grease and oil, Consumer Affairs and Information Director Chandrika Thilakarathne told the Daily News yesterday. "The CAA confiscated the bottles of contaminated water during a random raid," Thilakarathne said.
"Chemical and microbiological testing were done to check the amount of chemical and micro biological parameter contained in the water. It was detected that water in the bottles were less than the standard Ph value," she added.
Thilakarathne said that CAA checks the standard by conducting frequent raids.
We have informed all the bottled water manufacturing companies that action will be taken against them if they do not comply with the provisions under the Customs Affairs Authority Act.
"The CAA has issued a gazette stating that the PET bottle manufacturers should comply with the relevant SLS standard and it will be effective from September 2016. Bottled water manufacturers, PET bottle manufacturers and Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) had a discussion with the CAA recently to make all the manufacturers aware of the standards and to maintain the quality of the water," she added.
