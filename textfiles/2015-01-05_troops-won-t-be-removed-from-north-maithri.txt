Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena today said the administration he would form on Saturday if elected to power would not remove the security forces from the North.
He said his administration would not devolve power either but would initially focus on the 100-day programme under which social and political reforms would be implemented. Mr. Sirisena said the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) had also assured its support for these reforms.
“We will never allow the LTTE to raise its head again,” Mr. Sirisena said and added that the new government he would form would give Buddhism the foremost place while upholding and safeguarding the rights of the other religions.
He denied allegations of having entered into an agreement with the Tamil Disapora to divide the nation after taking office.
“It is the present regime which is hobnobbing with the Tamil Diaspora and had devised a sinister plan to prevent the Tamils in the North from voting,” Mr. Sirisena said.  (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
