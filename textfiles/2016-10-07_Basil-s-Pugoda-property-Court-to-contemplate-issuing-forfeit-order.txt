Basil’s Pugoda property: Court to contemplate issuing forfeit order


	

Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige requested the Pugoda Magistrate’s Court to issue an order to forfeit the property in Malwana which former minister Basil Rajapaksa rejected ownership.


The case was filed by the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) against Mr. Rajapaksa on charges of purchasing a land in Malwana and building a house there by misusing State funds.


The Presidential Counsel who appeared on behalf of Mr. Rajapaksa today informed the court that his client had ownership neither to the land nor the house.


He also told the Court that the land has been registered under the ownership of architect Muditha Jayakody.


However, the Lawyer appeared for Muditha Jayakody had informed that even though the land registration, his client had no real ownership to the land or the house and therefore Court can take any further action with regard to the property.


The Court’s decision whether to forfeit the property is to be given on October 14. (Tony Karunanayake)
