Modi’s visit: Ousted wasps grab international spotlight


	

The ouster of two large wasp nests from a tea plantation ahead of Indian Premier Narendra Modi’s visit has grabbed the attention of the international media while Sri Lankan officials busily prepare for the visit which is to take place this week.  

Several media outlets highlighted the painstaking measures taken by the Hatton Police to clear the area of the tiny and often dangerous ‘locals’ from the premises, going so far as to rope in a private bee protection organization to evict thousands of bees to prevent a possible attack on the visiting leader.  

Articles described wasps as commonly found insects in tropical Sri Lanka known for its formidable sting.  “Wasp attacks are often reported in the island’s tea estates, where workers are most vulnerable,” one media outlet stated.  

While another reported that the area had been cleared and was now safe for VVIP’s. “The winged evictees were removed humanely and relocated to a nearby jungle. A team will remain on site to ensure those kicked out do not return before Modi touches down,” the international media outlet reported.
