Utilizing Birth Date, Destiny and the Name Value Number for success in life

We have in our previous articles discussed the Birth-date Numbers, Basic Numbers, Destiny (Compound) Numbers and Name Value Numbers.

 

The Birth-date Number is the number of the birth date, leaving aside the month and the year.  For example, if a person has been born on July 5, 1985, his/her Birth Date Number becomes 5. 

Basic Numbers are numbers from 1 to 9.  We have already learnt how a number with two or more digits is to be reduced to a Basic Number.    For example, take 583. It is to be reduced to a Basic Number as follows:  5+8+3 = 16 and again 1+6 = 7. 

 

When we were discussing the birth date numbers, we found the need to reduce the two-digit dates into a Basic Number as follows:

 

Birth date: August 18, 2005. The number has to be reduced to Basic Number 1+8 = 9.

We later discussed how to reduce an entire birth date (with the month and the year as well) to a Basic Number which we have described as a Destiny or Compound number. For example, take, 08.10.1979 as the birth date. We have to add the digits in the 

deleting zeros.

 

8+1+1+9+7+9 = 35 = 8

In fact, no matter whichever way you add, you will get the same Basic Number. So let us follow two other formulas to add up the digits to arrive at a basic Number.  

 

Formula 1                                                       

Day 08                                                                           

Month 10                                             

Year 1979

1997

=1+9+9+7

=26

2+6 = 8

Formula 2

Day 08

Month 10

Year 19

79

116

= 1+1+6 =8

                      

 

Thus we have arrived at the Destiny or Compound Number reduced to a Basic Number by different formulas.

 

We also have discussed the ‘name value’ numbers. We hope readers may remember that we learnt that every letter in the English alphabet has a vibrational value ascribed to it and the Name Value Number represents the vibrational value of the name converted into a Numerical Value. We have also discussed the Name Value Numbers and their significance in detail. 

 

What we have already discussed so far is only a preface to the new subject we are to discuss in this article. 

 

Numerical principles and formulas are there not for academic interest alone, but for us to apply them in our day to day life. And the Birth Number is the easiest to use in our daily life. 

 

Most of us usually plan out our day-to-day activity or rather draw the day’s agenda and note down each item in our diaries.

 

The day’s agenda may mostly make up of certain routine matters which you have to attend to as a matter of course.  However, there may be very important events among them. There can be events which you yourself can decide as to when to happen.  For example, in case of an event where you can exercise your discretion as to when it should take place, you can be guided by your Birth number. For example, if you were born on the 2nd of a particular month, you can pick the 2nd, 11th or 20th for the event. 

 

Your Birth Date Number is definitely your lucky number. Naturally you want whatever event you plan or whatever project you embark on to be a success.  You can ensure the success of your event or your project by launching it on a date which is in harmony not only with your Birth Date, but also the Destiny and the Name Value Number.
