Between the devil and the deep blue sea!


	



 

A senior top team member had the other day summoned the district level high-ups of a leading State-Owned Financial Institution for a conference held to discuss a Ministry project. This political authority hailing from a remote area in the country also holds a top post in the Green Party.

 


On the very day of the conference, the head of the financial institution had tried to contact over the phone a district high-up for an urgent matter.
Finding the high-up missing from the office, the institution head had inquired about the cause for his absence and learnt that he was attending a Ministry conference in Colombo.


Livid that his district-level subordinates had attended a conference summoned by a Ministry sans his permission, the institution head had asked them to show cause, why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for deserting their posts, they say.
