The countrywide bus strike to be launched tomorrow was called off after discussions with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said a short while ago.

The private bus operators had earlier warned they would launch the strike from tomorrow if the government did not rescind its decision to impose a minimum penalty of Rs.2,500 for traffic offences.

Mr. Wijeratne told Daily Mirror that the finance minister assured them he would decide on this matter after he takes it up at tomorrow’s Cabinet meeting.

He said another meeting has been scheduled with the finance minister tomorrow evening. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
