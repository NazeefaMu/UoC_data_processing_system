We earlier in this column told our readers the story about the Foreign Ministry seeking a rental of Rs.90,000 a day for the release of one of its limousines for the use of former Indian President Abdul Kalam during his three-day visit to the country. 
Irked by this seemingly unfair demand, Minister Ranawaka who invited the Indian scientist to grace an energy symposium here organized by his Ministry, complained about it to the new Big Boss. 
“Although, the yahapalanaya government has taken office, Vaas policies and Vaas rates continue to operate in the Foreign Ministry,” he told the Big Boss. 
The Big Boss’ decision was instant. “Don’t hire the Foreign Ministry vehicle. Take the best vehicle from among the ones available for my use for the use of the Indian visitor.” Finally they placed at the disposal of the former Indian President, the best vehicle available in the President’s Transport Division with no cost at all instead of a Foreign Ministry vehicle at a daily rental of Rs.90,000!
