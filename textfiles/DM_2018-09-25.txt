In response to Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjiths remarks that human rights had become the religion among the Western nations, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the Cardinal seems to got things wrong in trying to be a populist.
In a tweet, the Minister said, The need for Human Rights was an outcome of the marauding religious zealots of the Inquisition and the Crusades,where non believers were massacred "En-Bloc". Pity, the Cardinal always seems to get things wrong in trying to be a populist,
The Cardinal had expressed his views while attending the morning service of the St. Matthews Roman Catholic Church in Ekala on Sunday.

Cry for  democracy Drowning calls for economic  development in the Maldivian Elections
	


With the opposition uniting behind an acceptable face like Solih, Yameen felt even morethreatened. He devisedmethods to rig the election


Maldivian democracy was rather unstableif not chaoticfrom 2008 to 2013
	If the opposition had been divided, Yameen wouldwell have won
	There were 565 sports infrastructure projects in 160 islands

In the Maldivian Presidential election held on September 23, the Joint Oppositions impassioned plea for the restoration of democracy secured an overwhelming response from the voters. 
The electorate decisively rejected incumbent President Abdulla Yameens call to vote for rapid economic development and its attendant benefits, suppressing the foreign-inspired craving for political, constitutional and individual rights.

The Joint Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih had secured 58.4% (134,143) of the votes polled as against 41.6% (95,626) secured by President Yameen. 
Polling was a high 88.8% in an election billed as a referendum on democracy. 
Opposition Supremo and Leader of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) Mohamed Nasheed, who is in exile in Colombo, told The Hindu:This is a clear victoryand a vote for the country to return to the path of democracy. Destiny has a habit of always choosing the right and the good. When history is on the march, you cant stop it.
 Yameen isolated himself
If a united opposition had defeated Yameen, the blame would have to be placed solely and squarely at his door because he had persecuted each and every notable opposition leader and dissident in his own party, the Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM). 
Yameen had made all his arch rivals come together to form a grand alliance sinking their individual ambitions. He had in other words transformed, what might have been an ordinary Presidential election with the incumbent facing a divided opposition, into a grand duel between himself and a united opposition candidate. 
Yameen made the election a referendum on democracy at a time when Maldivians, emerging from Maumoon Abdul Gayooms extended dictatorship, were yearning to live under a modern democratic system ushered in by the epoch making 2008 Constitution. 
True, Maldivian democracy was rather unstable if not chaotic from 2008 to 2013 when Yameen was voted to the Presidency, but the people had not lost faith in the system. The seeds of democracy had been planted in the minds of the masses and had created a deep yearning for it. The yearning did not dim even when dictatorial Yameens developmental agenda was enhancing the common mans lifestyle. 

Yameens developmental efforts
To give the devil his due, Yameens achievements cannot be under-estimated. This is the reason why he got 41.7% of the votes despite a uniformly hostile press and constant international denigration. If the opposition had been divided, he would well have won. 
According to official statistics, Yameens Government had completed 2757 projects costing US$ 5.7 billion since it came into being in 2013. 
There were 565 sports infrastructure projects in 160 islands totally costing US$ 240 million.The Government had spent US$ 1.04 billion on 212 projects in the health sector in 137 islands. 
The Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH) had expanded its capacity to 500 beds. There are now facilities in the Maldives to treat kidney, cancer and heart patients. A cardiac centre had come up in the IGMH. A 100-bed tertiary hospital was going to come up soon in Addu Atoll. Regional hospitals were being upgraded and refurbished. Health Centres had come up in the smallest islands. 
The Government had given much importance to education. The 174 educational projects in 114 islands had got a total allocation of US$ 1.69 billion. Books had been replaced by tablets. Virtual classrooms and libraries had been established. The Government had created 22 new schools with a total of 792 classrooms. 
The Governments 34 social housing projects spread over 20 islands were being executed with a budgetary allocation of US$ 1.3 billion. The ongoing HIYAA Social housing project would solve the housing problem of 160,000 people. This massive project was expected to be completed in 2019. 
Land was reclaimed from the sea to meet emerging requirements. 240 hectares of land were reclaimed under the Hulhumales Phase 2 scheme and 493 hectares were reclaimed in another four islands.

The Government put up 82 sewerage systems in 57 Islands. There are 193 waste management projects; 83 harbour development projects; and 61 clean water projects. 
Road development has been completed in 22 Islands. It is ongoing in 13 other islands. Domestic airport construction, the Velana International Airport expansion was on. And the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge was completed. 
Hopes dashed
Yameen was hoping that these achievements would impress the mature sections of the electorate, though he was aware that younger Maldivians looked upon Mohamed Nasheed, the ebullient and indefatigable campaigner for democracy, as their hero. 
Yameen had not noticed that the youth are a significant section in the Maldives, and realised that their inner needs should be addressed. The median age in the archipelago is 28, and 68% of the population is between 15 and 54. 
One would imagine that the young would be enamoured of rapid economic development and the jobs these would create, but it turned out that they did not want jobs at the cost of hard won democratic rights under the leadership of people like Nasheed who had a long history of challenging authoritarianism. 
Cost of Ignoring Democracy
The mistake that Yameen made was that he did nothing to co-opt democracy into his development agenda. He brooked no criticism and was intolerant of opposition. 
He also packed all constitutional institutions, including the judiciary and parliament, with yes men. Those who dissented were sacked. Among them were his own party MPs who refused to vote against a no-confidence motion moved by the opposition against the Speaker. 
After losing majority in parliament through his own action, Yameen used special provisions to get his orders passed by the House. The extension of the State of Emergency was passed in this questionable way. 
The incarceration of Nasheed and other top leaders on various charges, including terrorism and corruption, was deemed to be controversial by international rights organisations. But when the Supreme Court itself declared the sentencing as improper, ordered a re-trial and sought the reinstatement of unseated MPs, Yameen acted even more controversially. He declared a State of Emergency, curbed political rights and extended them controversially. 
The Supreme Court Chief Justice and a judge were sacked and imprisoned after being accused of taking bribes from a jailed politico to give the order to release jailed leaders. Yameen said that the judges had given the ruling without taking the view of the top Government law officer. 
Since opposition stalwart Mohamed Nasheed was disqualified from contesting (as he is a fugitive from the law, having left jail on leave and not returned to complete his 13-year term), Ibrahim Solih was nominated as the Joint Opposition candidate for the Presidential election. Soli was an experienced politician, and a non-controversial one at that, unlike Nasheed. 
The opposition parties together promised to restore all democratic rights; liberate constitutional structures like the Supreme Court held captive by Yameen; release all falsely implicated political prisoners; and hold fresh elections to the Presidency after 18 months, in which, those unfairly barred from contesting the September 23 election could contest. 
Attempt to vitiate election
With the opposition uniting behind an acceptable face like Solih, Yameen felt even more threatened. He devised methods to rig the election and prevented international journalists and independent monitors from observing it. 
He changed the rules governing the vote counting process to prevent opposition polling agents from monitoring it vote by vote. And as per the new rules, complaints could not be made there and then, but only much later after the announcement of results. 
But all this was of no avail, as the popular tide had turned against Yameen, and there was no way he could stem it. As Nasheed told The Hindu: Destiny has a habit of choosing the right and the good. When history is on the march, you cant stop it.

Don't blame Trump; strengthen economy: MR
	
The government should take steps to strengthen the economy instead of blaming US President Donald Trump for the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
He said in a statement that the role of a government was to keep abreast of worldwide developments instead of complaining that a foreign leader has strengthened his own economy and that our currency was collapsing on that account.
Mr. Rajapaksa said President Trump has strengthened the US economy through a policy of giving incentives to indigenous businesses and imposing tariffs on imports to encourage local production.
My government also had a policy of producing whatever we could locally and reducing imports such as diary products, maize, soya, sugar, onion, potato, fruits, vegetables, poultry and certain industrial products. This government in contrast believes in limitless liberalization and free trade without a clear strategy to increase exports and reduce imports, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the governments task is to manage crises and not to complain about them.
If we have a government that requires foreign countries to underperform so as to enable us to maintain the value of our currency, then this country is in deep trouble, he said and added that the present mismatch between the low price of crude oil and the high retail prices of fuel in Sri Lanka is due largely to the depreciation of the fupee and the government tax on fuel.
The reason why the government is keeping the fuel pricing formula a closely guarded secret is because it will reveal to the public both the incompetence of the government as well as the taxes they are charging on fuel, Mr.Rajapaksa said adding that the government has been trying to downplay the depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee by claiming that the Indian Rupee has depreciated even more.
The Indian economy however is growing at nearly twice that of Sri Lanka and they are better able to weather the shocks. We are paying a heavy price for shifting from an emerging production economy under my government to a trading economy under UNP policies. What we are faced with now is slow growth below 4%, increasing inflation, increasing imports even of items that can easily be produced locally, huge repayments of short and medium term foreign commercial consumption loans taken by this government and a Rupee that is depreciating by the day,
The emerging economic crisis is the outcome of the ill-conceived economic policies of this government and the lack of a home grown economic management strategy, Mr. Rajapaksa said.

## Title: Early Obeyesekere From   Ves Gaththo  to  Palagetiyo 
## Section: News Features

Early Obeyesekere From   Ves Gaththo  to  Palagetiyo 
	
Pathiraja shooting Sakkarang

There is an extraordinary sense of mastery in Vasantha Obeyesekeres early films. Of them, I have not watched his first, Ves Gaththo. Walwath Wuwo, Diyamanthi, and Palagetiyo are representative of the kind of cinema he put into that work, which like Walmath Wuwo was about the dispossessed. Buttressed by a naturalism that never even once deteriorates into melodrama, and a wide canvas that lets us both empathise and criticise his characters, these four films belong to a different world. 
Even Diyamanthi, Obeyesekeres most mainstream work, displays a mastery over the medium which goes beyond just the physics of the camera. The fatal allure of youth, the exuberance of the dispossessed, the indifference of the idealist; these are the themes he visits again and again. Before Pathiraja, who would become the ultimate purveyor of the cinema of rebellion, Obeyesekere dissected the plight of the unemployed and the uprooted in ways that no other director could. 
Pathirajas cinema offers an interesting counterpoint to Obeyesekeres in this respect, because while both were aware of and open to the social upheaval that Sri Lanka and the young of the country experienced, they approached that theme in superficially similar, yet subtly different ways. In Pathirajas early work (Ahas Gawwa, Bambaru Awith, Para Dige), for instance, there is some form of release, never triumphalist, but nevertheless symbolic. The protagonists decision to turn to a strike at the end of Ahas Gawwa, the speech by Weerasena at the end of Bambaru Awith, and the departure of Chandare and his girlfriend (Chandare, koheda api dan yanne she asks twice, to which he replies, Danne naha.): these sequences do not vindicate the characters, nor do they absolve their weaknesses, but they provide a definite point of release for the director and the audience; almost a vindication, one could say.

Obeyesekeres early work does not display this kind of unsettled restlessness. The heroes of Walmath Wuwo do not turn to radicalism as easily as the protagonist of Ahas Gawwa, nor do the lovers in Palagetiyo, after a cathartic encounter over diner, resolve their differences, even in the negative way that Chandare and his girlfriend do. 
Part of the reason for this may have been the influences that each imbibed. Pathiraja, in his early years, was shaped by the theatre of Beckett, which provided an at times inexplicable detour for the crises and plights that his characters face; the endings of both Bambaru Awith and Para Dige are intensely and insanely symbolic, and they reek of the political so much that in them, as with the plays of Beckett, we see the confluence of the real and the inexplicable. 



In Pathirajas early work (Ahas Gawwa, Bambaru Awith, Para Dige), for instance, there is some form of release, never triumphalist, but nevertheless symbolic




Theartre of cruelty
Obeyesekere, on the other hand, was shaped more by the theatre of cruelty. Though he may not have been influenced by Artaud, there are sequences in his early films which go beyond language (as with Artauds theatre). Many of his characters, especially the lovers in Palagetiyo, repress their destructive feelings until the very end. The release as such that we witness at the end of these films are, therefore, not the kind what we expect. The rift between fantasy and reality, which in the directors hands refracts the rift between the rich and the poor, is in that sense more complex than the bourgeois-proletariat tracts bordering on the Absurd we see in Bambaru Awith, and they depict the incapacity of the individual to subjugate his feelings. It is not a cinema of words and symbols; it is a cinema of thought and characters, of violence and madness. 
When Sarath brings Kusum, the woman who dreams of a life of ease after eloping with him, to a shack, and slowly laughs at the fact that their new abode does not have a kitchen, a bedroom, or even a washroom, there is despair, and at the same time intense poignancy. Kusums efforts at getting used to this new life are not unsuccessfully (the neighbours do take kindly to her), but even with this obstacle out of the way, there is a more unyielding issue: Sarath tries futilely to find a job in the city, only to be cheated out of the little money he has by an unscrupulous dealer, and while he is out, Kusum begins to feel for another man (Ranjan Mendis, who was the antagonist in Apeksha, a more conventional take on the rich-poor/fantasy-reality rift that Palagetiyo explored). In Obeyesekeres early work, the social and the personal cohabit in a way that they do not in Pathirajas films. The one does not really displace the other, as Kusum learns to herself, at the cost of her own life, towards the end. 
In an essay on Bambaru Avith, Regi Siriwardena observed that the final sequence of the film, where Weerasena makes that impassioned speech distilling the plight of the coastal peasants, was at one level unneeded. There are two ways of looking at this speech. (Wimal Kumar da Costa was probably channelling Rohana Wijeweera in his performance, since there are striking resemblances between the two.) The first, the easier way, is by considering it as a theoretical distillation, which is what it is. In this respect, it is a political expression of an actual experience. Siriwardena implies that this may have been what most audiences and critics read into the sequence. On the other hand, it can also be a critique of the attempt made by the character to distil what is otherwise a complex reality that rebels against political simplifications. 
Clash between tradition and order
You can argue that the speech is a failure on the part of the revolutionary to communicate with the peasants he sympathises with, but then, the clash between the traditional order (Anton Aiya) and the new order (Baby Mahaththaya) is portrayed through a political lens to such an extent that we cant help but view this speech itself through that same lens. It is not that the political is missing in Obeyesekeres work from this period, but the political, no matter how intrusive it may be at certain points (in particular, in Walmath Wuwo) doesnt intrude on the personal, at least not the extent that it does in a film like Bambaru Awith. Both Obeyesekere and Pathiraja were tempered by the political. The difference, as always then, was one of degree. In that respect, Pathirajas work is more intellectualised than felt, even in those sequences where the content, the experience, precedes and supersedes the form, the political. For the truth is that Pathirajas films are not the felt works of art they are made out to be, a contention I am willing to make at the cost of alienating a substantial readership. In fact it is less a contention than an argument, a point of view that can be borne out by a seod viewing of his early work. The uniqueness of these works is that they resist easy categorisation despite their Marxist veneer; certain sequences, like that of Weerasenas speech, are more anti-political than political. But then, these are more the exception than the rule. 
In Vasantha Obeyesekere, I noted more than a year ago, we come across a director who depicted in a fatalistic light both tradition and modernity. Pathiraja would have welcomed modernity while eschewing its capacity for exploitation. He would also have looked back to the past with anger, just as Mrinal Sen did, though unlike Sen, he did not transform from a political polemicist to a poet committed to incertitude (the words of James Quandt). That poet was Obeyesekere; none of his films, even the later films, depicts their milieu and their conflicts in politically clear cut terms. 
When Georges Sadoul referred to the films of Lester James Peries as models of poetry and honesty, he was not an inexact critic making arbitrary claims. He did not mean that Periess works represented the societies in which they were set. In that sense, demarcating the films of Pathiraja as political does no justice in summarising the cinema he stood for. But such claims, though arbitrary, are useful when assessing the artist in comparison to, and against, the parameters of his contemporaries. 
Periess films were models of poetry and honesty when viewed through a political lens. It was Pathiraja who made it possible for us to measure our cinema by resorting to such a lens. Viewed against it, then, Obeyesekere was less political than Pathiraja, and at the same time less personal than Peries. The latter believed, however much he denied it, in the overwhelming solace of traditionalism, while the former believed in the ravaging vicissitudes of rationality and modernity. Obeyesekeres greatness, which came out most prominently in his early work, was that he believed in neither.

FR petition inevitable on Fuel pricing formula: PHU
	
A Fundamental Rights (FR) petition would be filed in the Supreme Court if the fuel pricing formula was not disclosed, PHU Leader Udaya Gammanpila said today.
The MP said he requested for the formula from the Finance Ministry and it responded saying that revealing the formula could result in negative consequences to the economy of Sri Lanka.
He also said the government increases the prices of fuel in exorbitant amounts though the fuel prices in world market had only been increased slightly.
"Therefore, we have a right to know why we have to purchase fuel for enormous prices. If the pricing formula was not disclosed even after I make an appeal to the Appeals Board, I expect to file a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court," he told a news briefing.
He said there could be two reasons as to why the Finance Ministry is keeping the pricing formula as a secret. "One reason is that there is no such formula as mentioned and the other reason is whatever they have is unjustifiable formula," he said.
Meanwhile, he said that an impartial investigation on DIG Nalaka Silva cannot be expected as long as Pujitha Jayasundara remains as the IGP.
Therefore, the government should take steps to remove him. In terms of Removal Officers (Procedure) Act No 5 of 2002, the IGP can be removed only by Parliament. There are several grounds for such removal. Corruption, partiality, abuse of power, misconduct and mental infirmity are among them. As witnessed by the entire nation, all of these grounds are applicable to him. Hence, the government should take immediate steps to bring a resolution to remove the IGP, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Grooming for the impending vacancy!
	

Following a strong rumour that has gone viral in political circles that a deputy purohita is now on the brink of forfeiting his Diyawanna seat, the candidate immediately next to the latter on the preference list has already placed an order for a VIP suit with a master tailor, they say.

This Diyawanna aspirant is known to be a buddy of a high post holder of a body that supports holding the scales of justice.
By the way, some leading members of this prestigious body are reportedly holding regular powwows at a high-end hotel in a lagoon view-city north of Colombo these days in a bid to tighten the legal noose around the neck of the deputy in trouble, they say.

If the monthly pay of a staff member is Rs. 30,000, the purohita would pay him only Rs. 20,000 pocketing the balance himself,
they say.
The man has found it convenient to play out his staffers pay in this manner, as their monthly paycheck comes to him direct.
Although the employees know that they are getting a raw deal, they keep mum about it as they are keen to keep their job.

The host warmly welcomed the distinguished visitor and shortly afterwards he excused himself and went inside the house.
Presently, a young man in short pants wearing a dozen of multi-hued bracelet bangles and necklaces and sporting a typical hippie-style haircut appeared before the city high-up carrying a tray with a cup of tea.
The appearance of the hippie-type young man got his goat and ignoring the tea offered, he barked at him: Who are you What a spectacle you are! Cant you come properly dressed to greet guests here
Having thus vented his anger, the city high-up immediately walked out of the house, they say.

Lets celebrate the diversity in our democracy
	

The Cable News Network (CNN)s widely-respected analyst Fareed Zakaria in his programme Global Public Square on Sunday examined the response to the rise of populism or narrow-minded racist and religious thinking in Europe and said the United States and Europe should be celebrating the remarkable achievements of diversityin a democracy. 
Mr. Zakaria, a Harvard-educated millionaire quoted from the widely selling book Identity, saying he wanted the people to understand how Europe, a continent finally at peace after centuries of conflict, could be succumbing to the rise of populism and nativism. He said he wondered, whether this could be fuelling Europeans newfound Euroscepticism and hostility toward strangers, foreigners, anyone who is different. The books author said identity was important but to be wholesome we need to have a broad mind whereby while we practise our beliefs and cultural traditions, we also need to respect the beliefs and traditions of people of other religions or races. This paradigm shift is essential to bring about accommodation on the middle path where my beliefs in accommodation with the beliefs of another will produce what is called synergy. That means 1 plus 1 will make not 2, but three -- a new and broader picture on important issues such as religious and racial unity in diversity. 
These reflections come to mind as we commemorate tomorrow the 59th death anniversary of Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike who was shot dead by a monk at his Rosemead place residence on September 26, 1959. The Oxford-educated Mr. Bandaranaike who also held the prestigious post of Secretary of the Oxford Union, changed the course of Sri Lankas history when he broke away from the ruling United National Party (UNP) in 1951 and formed a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). 
While his positive achievements were many, apparently to win the 1956 general election, he highlighted the Sinhala only policy and on this popular measure went onto win the elections in a coalition known as the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, including the so called Boralugoda lion Philip Gunawardene. In one of the many steps he took, Mr. Bandaranaike made what we now see as a drastic or devastating move by taking away the English language as a medium of education in schools. Today we are trying to revive the English medium because without it young people or others could learn little from the marvels of modern technology including the search engines which are like press-button encyclopaedias.
To Mr. Bandaranaikes credit, it needs to be said that he moved fast to draft legislation for the reasonable use of Tamil also and the setting up of District councils to give more power to the minority communities. These DCs had far less powers than the existing Provincial Councils. But the populist and racist forces ganged up against Mr. Bandaranaike provoking the 1958 racial riots. 
Let us not forget that J. R. Jayawardene, later to become the first Executive President, also led a march to Kandy on the basis that Mr. Bandaranaike was trying to divide the country. Ultimately the populist or racist forces killed him when Somarama Thera shot him point blank in the head though most analysts believe there were others behind him. Ironically what Mr. Bandaranaike could not or was not allowed to do became the destiny of his daughter Chandrika Bandaranike Kumaratunga, who became the Executive President in 1994. During her term she drafted a Constitution devolving power to the minorities and strangely the main person behind it was Prof. G. L. Peiris who is now General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna which appears to be supporting nationalistic forces. Ms. Bandaranaike was not allowed to implement that constitution.
Now the coalition government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, is working out a new Constitution to celebrate the hallowed principle of unity in diversity. We hope broad-minded people will celebrate this concept instead of following the destructive trends that US President Donald Trump and some other European countries are following by isolating or marginalizing the minorities.

Lyceum on an educational tour to France
	
Sri Lanka in its pursuit to provide international exposure to its students sent a group of 55 students and eight teachers of French Language on an educational tour to France from August 18 to 29, 2018.
The educational tour was organised in collaboration with Education & Beyond Pvt. Ltd., a New Delhi based company specialising in educational tours to France.
This is the third tour to France organised by Lyceum Nugegoda.
However, the particularity of this tour is that this time, three other Lyceum Schools, i.e. Lyceum Wattala, Gampaha and Panadura, also participated in the tour.
The collaboration intends to bring the brothers and sisters of the school network closer together as well.
The tour was under the able guidance of the Coordinating Principal Mrs Kumari Grero, and the French Faculty, headed by Ms Udeshika Perera
The students attended French lessons in prestigious language schools in Paris as a part of the tour.
The students and the teachers stayed with host families carefully chosen by E&B so that the group may have a complete French experience.
Teachers and cultural guides accompanied the students to sustain the academic outlook of the programme.
The visits included, among many others, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, the Notre Dame Cathedral, the Fontainebleau Castle, the Sacr Cur Basilica, the Asterix Park, the Versailles Palace, the Luxembourg Gardens and a cruise on the river Seine.
The students also met the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to France Buddhi K. Athauda during a visit to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Paris.
Upon their return, the students are engaged in project presentations partly in French, partly in English, which is also an important part ofthe project.

Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith clarifies
	
Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has sent the following clarification:
My attention has been drawn to, two reports appearing in the 1st and 2nd pages of the Daily Mirror of Monday, 24th September under the heading "Human Rights is the latest religion of Western nations" and in page 6 under the heading "Beware of persons impersonating priests". In order to avoid any misunderstanding of what I stated, I wish to clarify these matters as follows:
Human Rights and Religions
What I basically intended to say on this matter was that if religion is truly practiced it could take us to achieve levels of justice, going even beyond the expectations of human rights and thus need not be such an issue for our Catholic community and so encouraged the flock gathered at that particular religious ceremony to, therefore, practice their faith truthfully avoiding turning religious values into something that is ephemeral. But I do accept that with regard to the essentially non-religious nature of the State, human rights as a common platform has its own role to play. Replacing religion with human rights is not what is to be done but human rights should be further strengthened through the good practice of faith.
Impersonating Priests
Here I was commenting on a communique issued by the Episcopal Vicar of the Negombo region in the Archdiocese of Colombo, published in the Catholic newspapers, "The Messenger" and the "Gnanarthapradeepaya" of the 16th September 2018, on the activities of a person in that area, who seems to be impersonating a Catholic Bishop, wearing the same type of official garb and celebrating what appears to be Catholic religious services. I did not speak about a Cardinal. All that I did was to reaffirm what was published in the communique and to state that the Catholic faithful should know that this person is not a Catholic priest or bishop in keeping with the Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church.
Similarly, I also cautioned the faithful from being misled by certain former Catholic priests who had left the Church giving up their priestly office. Now they are impersonating as Catholic priests, wearing their traditional uniform and going around offering all kinds of promises to the people and misleading them.
I wish to reaffirm that these statements of mine have been made purely in the exercise of my pastoral responsibilities towards my flock, to a limited religious gathering without any other purpose in mind.

New allegations of sexual abuse against Trumps Supreme Court pick
	

By Karoun Demirjian, Amy Gardner(c) 2018, The Washington Post Sept. 24, 2018 - 
WASHINGTON - Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called late Sunday for a delay in further consideration of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct. 
I am writing to request an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, Feinstein wrote in a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committees GOP chairman. 
Her letter came after the New Yorker magazine reported that Debbie Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaughs at Yale University, said he exposed himself at a party when they were both first-year students. Ramirez, who told the magazine that they both had been drinking at the time of the incident, acknowledged some gaps in her memory but said she remembered another student shouting Kavanaughs name. 
I would think an F.B.I. investigation would be warranted, Ramirez said.

President calls on world leaders to emulate Mandela
	
President Maithripala Sirisena called upon the world leaders to emulate Nelson Mandela, who showed the correct path by his humanitarian qualities and the love for the people.
Addressing the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit held on the sidelines of the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly at the UN Headquarters in New York on Monday, President Sirisena said Mandela was a great statesman and epitome of reconciliation.
He thanked the UN Secretary General and others for organizing the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit to honour such a great humanitarian leader who showed the path of true reconciliation to the world.
He said Mandela was a leader who showed how to use power for the benefit of the people and give up power without any greed for power.
There is a dearth of such leaders today. I wonder how many of the leaders have the qualities displayed by Nelson Mandela and I feel that it is for the leaders to emulate Mandela and enter the correct path displayed by him, he told the assembly of world leaders and other top delegates.
The Plenary Session of the Mandela Peace Summit will also adopt a Political Declaration covering policing guidelines for a gamut of areas including peace, democracy, rule of law and human rights.
President Sirisena is scheduled to address the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly today.
This years theme of the general debate is Making the United Nations Relevant to All People: Global Leadership and Shared Responsibilities for Peaceful, Equitable, and Sustainable Societies.

Presidents UN plea and misplaced obsession with war crimes
	

President Maithripala Sirisena who will address the UN General Assembly today, had earlier confided to the media bosses that he would, in his UN speech, seek a reprieve of war crimes against the government forces. 
I will also make a written request to the Human Rights Council to settle the allegations against our troopsI want to tell them to remove these charges. We can amicably resolve this issue,he said.
Though some sources suggest that the president is having second thoughts about this approach, chances are that he would stick to his earlier promise. 
The Presidents supposed comes in the wake of a proposal by the Jathika Hela Urumaya for a general amnesty for military personnel and the LTTE cadres, except those who were implicated in grave crimes inspired by personal gains.

An emerging China led global economic order, of which Sri Lanka is already a linchpin should further erode our dependence on the West
That is a fair deal, and should provide a much needed closure to an unwanted distraction of the national priorities. However, neither proposal is likely to please the diaspora Tamil organizations, local Tamil fringe, or the local and foreign NGO captains. Sinhala ultra-nationalist fanatics could well try to fish in troubled waters. Though some right violations did happen, which is inevitable in the total war that the Wanni was subjected to, due to the miscalculated military adventurism of the LTTE, the clamour for war crime trials is a ploy by the Eelam fringe to win a consolation price for losing the Eelam war. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the ex-president could have nipped this in the bud, if he investigated the most blatant cases of abuses, and made a conspicuous break from the arbitrariness of the war time past. Instead, he persisted on a culture of impunity and fostered a dynastic project. 
Mr. Rajapaksas egregiousness in the eyes of West and America was the primary driver behind their call for war crime investigations, as means to intimidate their nemesis of the Rajapaksa regime. Constituent pressure of the Tamil diaspora added venom, but they were secondary. Rather, those groups were emboldened by MRs repeated blundering through catering to a minority of Sinhaleseultra-nationalist fringe.
Since he vacated the office, the West lost much of its loathing towards Sri Lanka, yet, the veneer of sanctimonious pretense had to be retained for some time. That saw once in a while calls for reconciliation and accountability here.
However, much has changed since then. Donald Trump has pulled America out of the UN Human Rights Council, and threatened to sanction the International Criminal Court. Europe is going through an identity crisis, which would get worsened as those countries grapple with the rigours of diversity. Emerging nationalist right there has no pretense of liberal interventionism. 
Surely, these changes are disturbing for a majority, but some may find the unfolding political upheaval in the West as beneficial. In a dispassionate take on things, that should include us, who should now be able to use this opportunity to sort our problems out in our terms. 
An emerging China led global economic order, of which Sri Lanka is already a linchpin should further erode our dependence on the West, should such dependence come at the expense of our immediate national interests. 
Frankly, the world is too busy to be bothered about Sri Lanka. Worse things are happening from Syria to Palestine to Democratic Republic of Congo.
However, our obsession to flaunt before global forums, a problem that was already 10 years old, stems partly from paranoia and partly from a misplaced sense of self-importance, both born out of ignorance. 

There is a conspicuous lack of political will to implement crucial economic policy, be it multi-million- dollar investment projects, such as Hambantota free trade zone, or free trade agreements such as ECTA
Sri Lanka should find a solution to its war crime allegations within its shores, under its terms. The Presidents UN address would not help things. Instead, it traps the global attention on Sri Lanka even temporary on a problem that the country should have buried a long time ago. Instead, we would be better off if the president flaunts the Chinese funded Colomboport city, and tells the world that SriLanka is open to business. That is what Dr. Mahathir Mohamed (younger one, who built Malaysia, not necessarily the current one who seems to be a self -contradiction of his inner-self) would have done. However, Sri Lanka, among a long list of countries, has long suffered from the absence of a coherent set of national priorities. 
That leads to the distressing part of our predicament. The governments penchant to revisit war crimes, every other time a local politician meets a foreign leader is partly due to lack of anything else worthwhile to talk about and agreed upon. That explains the countrys pitiful economic existence at the moment. There is a conspicuous lack of political will to implement crucial economic policy, be it multi-million- dollar investment projects, such as Hambantota free trade zone, or free trade agreements such as ECTA. Economic consequences of flight of foreign capital, manifest in the rupee hitting its all- time low (US $ 400 million fled the country so far this year) has been aggravated by the governments failure to attract foreign direct investment. Instead, the government is sitting on investment proposals. We are going through the fourth lost years, economically speaking. 
That is the real problem that this country is faced with. A pro-active government would have prioritized on the economy, the rest is secondary. A government that fails to exhibit even the bare minimum political will to create wealth for its people, is unlikely to be trusted by the people, especially the Sinhalese majority who feel an elevated sense of urgency. Northern Tamil leadership may have other demands, but deep down in their hearts, the average Tamil folks know their priorities are not much different from those of the rest of the country. Effectively, the government fails both these people. And, the blunt truth is that it is unlikely to resolve any of the special grievances of Tamils, until it solves common grievances ofboth communities.

Rumble of death on the railroad track
	

Breathing its last


Usually the train drivers know the time when elephants cross over and their patterns
	So much is happening which is having a negative impact on our amazing elephants
	Beehive fences are another natural elephant deterrent creating a socio-economic boost to poverty stricken rural communities

Govt. officials and wildlife enthusiasts speak of new ways to curb elephant-train accidents after the Habarana incident
A few days ago, Sri Lanka witnessed one of the most heart-breaking train accidents. Although it did no damage to any humans, it did take away the lives of five elephants. One of the victims was a mother-to-be and the accident took away its foetus as well. While this isnt the first incident where elephants were hit and killed by a train, it does seem to be a case of neglect on the part of the authorities  or on a different note, a case of installing and using the latest technologies. However it is appalling to note that a 100-year old railway system still has no permanent solution to control or stop elephant-train accidents. As it is always a case of neglect, the future of elephants doesnt seem to be bright from a conservation point of view. However, in this particular instance, the Daily Mirror learns that all precautions were in place at the time of the incident. Investigations are already being done by the Habarana Police and the Department of Railways, but the damage caused is irreversible.
Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on the incident and a possible solution that could be implemented in the long run.
The incident
At around 4.30am on September 18 (Monday), three elephants were killed after a herd was hit by the Batticaloa bound train which was pulling eight oil tank wagons. The incident occurred at the 127th milepost between Habarana and Palugaswewa Railway Stations. According to the Railway Control Room the train engine and two oil tank wagons had derailed. One of the tank wagons had begun to leak. Hence the people in the area were more interested in collecting oil rather than checking on the status of the elephants. As a result two more elephants had succumbed to their injuries. However the derailed train had been removed and train services had been restored.
New solution needs to be in place
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife General Sarath Fonseka said that since it is a new problem, a plan for a new solution needs to be mapped out. There are vast jungle stretches on either side of the railway tracks and its not practical to put up electric fences on either side as they (elephants) need to move. I dont think the Railways is willing to take any precautions at this point, but we need a high-tech method to solve this issue. It needs to warn the trains regarding an animal that is there on the tracks. In terms of improving lighting conditions, again there will be practical issues since there are places with bends. Reducing the speed limit is also not an option, but we need to work on a solution soon. It may not happen immediately, but we are trying to work with a few interested groups to plan out a solution in the near future, said Fonseka.
Issue needs to be handled on a technical level
In his comments, Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation Secretary G. S Withanage said that several discussions had been already held with the Railway and the Wildlife Conservation Department and a few suggestions had been made regarding this issue on a technical level. There are suggestions to identify elephant passes and send messages to these elephants about an oncoming train. These projects could be implemented at a low cost. There were suggestions to attach sensors so that the train driver would know that there is an elephant within a distance of a kilometre. Hence we have requested the DWC to hand in these proposals and then we would conduct feasibility studies and implement them after weighing out the pros and cons. However we are trying to come up with a solution as soon as possible, said Withanage.
Its a question of whether the driver exceeded the speed limit

Beehive fences in East Africa

Airing his views to the Daily Mirror, wildlife enthusiast and Environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardana said that in this particular instance the DWC had already taken necessary precautions to prevent elephant-train accidents. They have installed boards and this is a place where the Railway Department has also set a maximum speed limit. Hence with all those precautions in place, I wonder how this incident took place. Therefore the DWC has to conduct a thorough investigation. According to the villagers the train had been travelling fast and this raises the question whether the driver exceeded the speed limit During the dry months elephants roam around more than usual in search of food, fodder and water. As far as Im concerned the DWC has conducted seminars and workshops for Railway officials on how to reduce elephant-train accidents and it could be that this driver was unaware of such a possible encounter. But the matter has to be investigated immediately, affirmed Gunawardana.

Bees and beehives :A viable solution
One maybe amazed to find out that a gigantic animal such as an elephant fears a tiny bee. Although a bees sting cannot penetrate through the thick hide of an elephant, a swarm of bees could sting the most sensitive areas of an elephant such as the trunk, mouth and eyes. As such, the threat of bees has been identified by conservationists as a mutually beneficial solution. Hence, researchers and advocates have persuaded farmers in many countries to capitalise on the elephants fear of bees and use it as a potential fence to protect crops from this animal.
As a result, beehive fences have been identified as another natural elephant deterrent creating a socio-economic boost to poverty stricken rural communities through pollination services and harvesting on elephant-friendly honey. As most elephant  train accidents take place in rural Sri Lanka, it could be an effective method to mitigate this issue on the long-run.
Several countries such as India and many African countries have been working on this idea and there have been positive results. For this purpose both old and new beehives could be used. It has been observed that elephants avoid both trees with full hives as well as empty hives. It is also a more cost effective method of tackling the issue rather than installing electric fences. In addition to that, beekeeping is an environmentally friendly industry.
Elephants not only keep away from bees, but they even avoid the sound of bees. This was proven during a pilot project carried out in Rangiya Division, India using an electronic buzzer with the sound of honeybees at a railway track to keep away elephants straying on to the tracks. Once installed, the number of elephant-train accidents has drastically reduced.
Sri Lanka could very well consider this option as beekeeping is not a new industry. In fact bee honey is used for medicinal and culinary purposes while the beehive itself is a delicacy. As such, by initiating this project, many farmers in rural areas could be empowered to invest in a sustainable source of income.


We deny the fact that the train was speeding
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, General Manager of Railways Dilantha Fernando said that initially there had been a herd of 25 elephants. When the driver had horned, the herd had dispersed, but these four elephants had returned to the tracks. We deny the fact that the train was speeding because it was a train transporting oil and the wagons were heavy. In addition there is a hilly area on one side and it is not a straight stretch where the driver can go at a high speed. But a researcher has come up with a new idea to fix a unit to the railway tracks and send a wave to the elephants when a train is approaching. We have already fixed a radar system in Mannar about a year ago and it has been successful. We have identified 83 such locations where elephant-train accidents are likely to happen, said Fernando.
At this point it is quite interesting to note that business tycoon Dhammika Perera, in one of his public speeches in March this year, had addressed the issue of elephant-train accidents. According to his observations, a trains horn and the hearing capacity of elephants are at different frequencies. So when inquired from train drivers they hadnt found a solution. When inquiries were made regarding the times of the day, they had said that they could see an elephant during the day, but not at night. In turn, thermal heat sensors were attached on to the trains which in turn contributes to slowing down the speed of trains. This is part from a DWC officer travelling in front. These precautions were only necessary during the dry season and the results were positive. Hence if a project at its experimental stage was successful, why it could not be executed in other parts of the country remains a question
4% of elephant deaths happen due to train accidents
Airing his concerns regarding the issue, Director General of DWC Chandana Sooriyabandara said that many authorities need to team up to find a solution. The Railway Department and the DWC have worked closely for the past 20 years and we have carried out awareness programmes on several occasions. We have placed signboards at locations where these accidents are likely to happen. We used to send a wildlife officer, but now it doesnt seem to be practical anymore. If the driver could be warned two or three kilometres ahead then this issue could be solved to a greater extent. We need to use technology more than manpower and we have identified several places on this track that need such equipment. However, 4% of elephant deaths happen due to train accidents, explained Sooriyabandara.
When asked about the sensor system which had been installed he said that since there were technical issues it had to be removed. Most of these are done as pilot projects and sometimes they fail to produce results. Since there is nobody to do the monitoring we have to remove if they dont seem to be successful, he said.
Most solutions seem to be negative than positive
Adding in her thoughts regarding this heartbreaking incident, wildlife enthusiast and Director of Passion, Otara Gunewardene said a similar incident happened a year ago. Even during that incident a mother and her babies were killed. The photos are horrifying. It is mostly horrifying because the innocent victims were probably going to get some water to drink or some food to eat. There were radars, train timings and speed limits spoken about then. Usually the train drivers know the time when elephants cross over and their patterns too, which can help to minimise accidents. These accidents do happen, but when the same thing keeps happening over and over again it becomes an issue. So much is happening which is having a negative impact on our amazing elephants. Even much of the solutions being discussed to apparently help them are more negative than positive. So much effort is put in to building facilities for tourism but so little effort is put in to protecting what the majority of tourists come to see, opined Gunewardene.
Allegations of drunk driving false : Habarana Police OIC
Speaking on this issue, Habarana Police OIC Jayalath said that allegations of drunk driving were false. When I spoke to the driver he said that since the train had eight oil tank wagons he had to travel at a particular speed since there was a bend. If the speed was reduced, he wouldnt have been able to control the train.
But due to its weight, the train wouldnt have gone at a high speed as well. If a train is stopped at once, there can be a huge damage. Accidents that happen on the road and on railway tracks are different. One can apply brakes on the road to minimise the damage, but this is not applicable on the railway tracks, said OIC Jayalath.

SL co-sponsorship of UNHRC resolution Time is ripe to invoke SC on  legality :Darshan Weerasekara
	
We submitted counter response to OISL report
	It can be done in terms of Article 129 of Constitution
	UN process against SL started after security forces defeated LTTE

Attorney-at-Law Darshan Weerasekara, who supports those working against the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka, speaks about the process that led to the current situation. He is the one who drafted a counter response to the UN High Commissioners report on Sri Lanka. Excerpts of an interview with him:
QHow do you look at the process that led to the adoption of the UNHRC resolution 30/1 on Sri Lanka in October 2015
On May 19, 2009, the armed forces defeated the LTTE. That was the beginning of the process. The very same day, 17 nations led by Germany asked for a special session in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to discuss whether the Sri Lankan Government committed serious crimes during the last phase of the war. That session was held on May 26 and 27, 2009, during which the said 17 nations introduced a resolution saying they believed Sri Lanka committed war crimes and that an international investigation was needed.
Then, Sri Lanka, with the assistance of another group of nations, introduced a counter resolution. It congratulated Sri Lanka for bringing the war to an end and lauded the efforts taken by the government to resettle its people. It basically said, Keep up the good work!
It was also tabled. The second resolution was adopted as more nations supported it at that time. However, it was absolutely disappointing to see some Sri Lankans endorsing war crimes took place. But the resolution was something different.
Later, the then UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon commissioned three experts to investigate the allegations and give him a detailed report -- which was called the Panel of Experts or Darusman report -- on the accountability in Sri Lanka. The report said there were many allegations claiming Sri Lankan forces committed war crimes. The charge is that the State, not individuals, is collectively responsible for war crimes. It is a system crime. The Darusman report is the first of its kind that has some connection to the UN claiming these types of crimes happened. The report came out in 2011 and later that year, it was indirectly submitted to the UNHRC. It became the basis for another resolution on Sri Lanka in February 2012. This resolution said there was a report in place that war crimes were committed. They requested the government of Sri Lanka to probe such purported offences. The UNHRC passed the said resolution in March 2012. This was the beginning of a series of resolutions that ended in 2015. Since 2012, the United States submitted resolutions every year in March sessions of the UNHRC -- each time claiming the government did not investigate these offences. Finally in 2014, they tabled the resolution 25/1 authorizing such investigations on the basis that Sri Lanka did not carry out any investigation. The resolution authorized the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake a comprehensive investigation into purported violation of the international humanitarian law and the human rights law. The High Commissioner undertook the investigation in August of 2014 and ended it in March 2015. It is called the OISL report.
It is the only report authorized directly by a UNHRC resolution to probe purported crimes.

As a citizen, I can read this report. When I perused it, I found serious problems. Citizens of this country never got a chance to present arguments. No matter what we say, the government has already agreed and committed to this resolution. The citizens were deprived of the opportunity to present the other side. The UNHRC never gave a chance to counter position to the charges levelled against this country
QYou countered the OISL report and worked out your own report instead. What are the main areas you touched upon
The OISL report said there was evidence that the State, meaning a chain of command, committed crimes. These are system crimes and not accusations of individual crimes. This falls into a special category. It has eight charges -- four on the international humanitarian law and four on the human rights law. This report was released on September 16, 2015. The Sri Lankan Government was given this report ten days earlier. On a date close to when it was released, Sri Lanka accepted this report. There is no evidence, whether or not, the government assessed it. That is to see whether the charges are proved or not. This report is a low-standard of proof. The government has accepted its conclusion though. The people of Sri Lanka got to read this document on September 15, 2015. By September 29 that year, the government co-sponsored this very controversial resolution 30/1, which, in its paragraph 1, accepts without reservation the conclusion of the OISL report. Nobody challenged the report because Sri Lanka co-sponsored it. The resolution was adopted by consensus. The government said it would implement the report.
QHow prudent is this action by the Sri Lankan Government
That is the question. As a citizen of Sri Lanka, I have personally benefitted from the armed forces defeating the LTTE. Today, I can live with peace and security in this country and enjoy the rights and privileges guaranteed by our Constitution. If one says the armed force committed war crimes, where is proof
In this case, proof is contained in the very specific report -- the only one authorized by the UNHRC. As a citizen, I can read this report. When I perused it, I found serious problems. Citizens of this country never got a chance to present arguments. No matter what we say, the government has already agreed and committed to this resolution. The citizens were deprived of the opportunity to present the other side. The UNHRC never gave a chance to counter position to the charges levelled against this country.
QHow difficult will it be for a future government to get rid of this dilemma
As I said earlier, the OISL report was tabled in September 2015. It was never subjected to any assessment. At the time Sri Lanka co-sponsored the resolution 30/1 in October 2015, the government, in its hands, had a very good domestic report by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC). Also, there were six reports commissioned by international experts to analyze whether the Sri Lankan security forces could have committed war crimes. They are all professionals. One of them is Sir John Homes, the Head of British Special Forces. He has said the security forces fought the war according to the highest standards of professionalism. That is his opinion. A person of such calibre is accepted in the House of Lords.
There is no evidence of system crimes according to these reports. The LLRC said there was evidence that some individuals had been involved in such crimes. There are seven isolated instances. They told the government to probe. They are very clear that no system crime happened. If the government accepted it, it should have some reasons for it. The government should have some reasons to believe that the LLRC report and other experts reports were wrong. The government cannot act like regular people. It has to follow some procedure. To the best of my knowledge, there is no such written assessment done by this government. What is the governments basis for accepting the conclusions of the OISL report

In our country, the only institution authorized to interpret the Constitution is the Supreme Court. Various others like ex-diplomats, ministers and advisors can say whatever they want. They can say the co-sponsorship is legitimate. Lawyers can also say it is legitimate or illegitimate. But the conclusive opinion that matters must come from the Supreme Court. The only person who can request for such an opinion from the Supreme Court is the President in terms of Article 129
If any future government is to challenge this report, they should go back to that original co-sponsorship. Then, it has to get an assessment by a competent authority whether the co-sponsorship is lawful or not.

It says, If at any time it appears to the President of the Republic that a question of law or fact has arisen or is likely to arise which is of such nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it.
I submit to you that the act of the government by co-sponsoring the resolution that might place Sri Lanka in a position of certain obligation to the UNHRC and thereby the international community almost in perpetuity is of public importance. This is perhaps the perfect occasion that would have called for the invocation of Article 129 to get a definitive opinion.
QEarlier, you submitted a counter-response to this resolution. What is the response from the UNHRC
We put out this report last year. It assessed the eight charges in the OISL report. We said they were unsubstantial. We have filed this report. We have continuously asked the UNHRC to give us a response but we did not get any.
We said in March this year that the UNHRC, permitting to adopt this resolution, had done irreparable damage. We asked the UNHRC to look into it. We filed that petition in March. Until now, we have not had a response. The important point is that the petition has not been dismissed either. This complaint procedure has been adopted by other countries to complain against their own governments. Petitioners in this petition have done an unprecedented job. They have used the petition to complain against the UNHRC itself. If there were any technical problem in the procedure we adopted, they could have dismissed it. It has been six months by now. There is no such dismissal. Have we raised significant legal issues which the UNHRC is facing difficulty with

The Darusman report is the first of its kind that has some connection to the UN claiming these types of crimes happened. The report came out in 2011 and later that year, it was indirectly submitted to the UNHRC. It became the basis for another resolution on Sri Lanka in February 2012. This resolution said there was a report in place that war crimes were committed. They requested the government of Sri Lanka to probe such purported offences
In June, the United States, the longtime stalwart, left the UNHRC in a huff accusing it of being a cesspool of political bias. Now, the council is under the spotlight. The UNHRC has to show the world that it is not something the US claimed it to be. In our case, petitioners have said the way the UNHRC treated Sri Lanka was unfair and unjust. All these resolutions were sponsored by the United States. If the US sponsors a resolution and calls the UNHRC a cesspool, then all these resolutions will be discredited.
We cannot take advantage of this situation because our government co-sponsored the resolution. The council is under pressure now to show the world that it is not biased.
QThe President said he would make some alternate suggestions. What is your view
Without knowing what the proposals are, I could not venture into anything. All I can say is what I told earlier. There is a question on the conduct of the government in co-sponsoring the resolution in October 2015. The issue is whether it is lawful or not. That question has to be answered.

SL says ready to welcome toppled Maldives strongman
	
The defeated strongman of the Maldives Abdulla Yameen is welcome in Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.
According to the Daily Mail, in a phone call on Monday, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe "informed Mr. Yameen that he is welcome in Colombo at any time,"
Mr. Wickremesinghe made the call after hosting Yameen's arch rival and former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed at a luncheon meeting on Monday.
Nasheed, the atoll nation's first democratically elected leader, was sentenced to 13 years in jail after narrowly losing the 2013 elections to Yameen.
He fled to London where he sought refuge and now lives in Sri Lanka.
Sunday's election was held with all key opposition leaders behind bars or in exile, leaving the little-known Ibrahim Mohamed Solih to challenge Yameen.
In a major upset, Solih won with 58 percent of the vote.
Sri Lanka has long been a haven for dissidents from the nearby Maldives over years of political upheaval, including for hundreds of opponents of Yameen since he became president in 2013.

Take prompt measures to stabilize rupee: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government to introduce short-term measures without delay so as to stabilize the rupee on the basis that the rupee depreciation against other currencies would lead to a severe economic crisis.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news conference that the rupee depreciation was the result of the governments botched economic policies and unfortunately it had no plans to rectify the situation.
The rupee is depreciating by the day with there being no plans to curb this situation. The Finance minister had recently claimed recently that the rupee depreciation did not amount to an economic collapse. But the rapidly depreciating rupee is a clear sign of such a catastrophe, he said.
Mr. Dissasnayake said the government claims that rupee was depreciating because of the strengthening of the US dollar was only half the truth because the rupee was not only deprecating against the US dollar but also against the other currencies as well.
Rupee has deprecated by 7.3% against the Euro, 10% against the Yen, 2% against the Australian dollar, 4% against the Singapore dollar, 4% against the Chinese Yuan, 8% against the Bangladesh Taka and 7% against the British pound. This is a clear reflection on the governments disastrous economic policies, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said it was not only this government but also past governments must take the responsibility of this unacceptable situation.
He said several reasons including the mounting trade deficit, contraction of the Sri Lankas share in the world market and selling of dollar earning state resources to foreigners had aggravated the issue.
We have lost dollar earning resources while increasing imports. We had a positive trade balance in 1970. Today we have a 100% trade deficit. We have sold 64% of the container terminal in the Colombo port. Countrys bunkering services was handed over to foreign companies. Sri Lanka telecom was sold to a foreign company. All these are lucrative dollar-earning business ventures, Mr. Dissanayake said. Our share in the world market which was 5 per cent in 1970 has now dropped to 0.045 while the countrys production sector had collapsed with Sri Lankas share in the world market dropping by tenfold."
He said it was vital for the government to introduce short-term measures to stabilize the rupee because the fluctuation of the rupee had restricted the inflow of dollars to the country while it was equally important to take steps to reduce the trade deficit and acquire a fair share of the world market as a long-term measure.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Tamils were discriminated by Vellalas: Sarath
	
Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera has told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that the Tamils were discriminated by the Vellalas and not by the Sinhalese.
In his speech on racial discrimination he said the majority Sinhalese are charged with discriminating the Tamil minorities but in fact it was a section of the Tamils who discriminated another section of the Tamils.
The high caste Vellalas kept away the low caste Tamils from Temples, schools, and Kovils. They did not share a drop of water with the low caste. In 1968, one C Sundaralingam went as far as the Privy council to defend Vellala supremacy denying low caste people from entering a Hindu kovil. Ponnambalam Ramanathan went to London to urge the colonial masters to legalise the caste system in Jaffna. In 1951, when Sinhala leaders brought social disabilities act to protect the rights of the low caste Tamils the Vellala Tamils travelled to Britain to demand the British government to annul the Act, he said.
Mr. Weerasekera said Vellalas could maintain their supremacy only if they could pose as saviours of the Tamils.
So it were the vellalas who manufactured anti-Sinhala Buddhist venom in the name of protecting the Tamils. If the majority Sinhalese were that bad how did the Tamil-speaking Muslims and more than 50% of the Tamil population peacefully co-exist with the majority Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran, after living among the Sinhalese for 65 years, ending up as a Supreme court judge, has the audacity to say Sinhalese have no right to live in the North. He generates hate against Sinhalese but yet when the Northern hospitals run short of blood, Sinhalese soldiers are the ones who give blood to the Tamils because Wigneshwaran and his fellow Vellalas do not like their blood mixed with that of the low caste people. It is high time the Tamils in Sri Lanka woke up to this truth, he said.

Trump says he expects second N.Korea summit soon
	

AFP, 24th SEPTEMBER, 2018-US President Donald Trump said Monday he expected to meet again soon with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying he saw tremendous progress in easing tensions. 
It looks like well have a second summit quite soon, Trump told reporters at the United Nations. 
As you know Kim Jong Un wrote a letter -- a beautiful letter -- asking for a second meeting and we will be doing that, added Trump, who met with Kim in Singapore in June. 
He said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- whose last planned visit to Pyongyang was abruptly scuttled by the White House -- would arrange the summit in the immediate future. Trumps remarks come one year after he stunned the United Nations General Assembly with a blistering attack on North Korea in his speech, threatening to totally destroy the communist state and mocking the projectile-building Kim as rocket man.
But Trump has since billed his diplomacy with North Korea as a key diplomatic success, saying that risks of a conflict have receded. 
Tremendous progress on North Korea, Trump told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York. 
That was a very dangerous time. This is one year later, a much different time.

We will only give foreign aid to "those who respect us and frankly our friends": Trump
	
President Trump said the US is "taking a hard look" at the foreign aid it sends to other countries and the financial support it provides to international organizations.
"Few give anything to us. That is why we are taking a hard look at US foreign assistance. We will examine what is working, what is not working and whether the countries who receive our dollars and our protection also have our interests at heart," Trump said. "Moving forward we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and frankly our  our friends. And we expect other countries to pay their fair share for the cost of their defense."
Promising to make the UN "more effective and accountable," Trump also vowed to change how the US funds the international body's various programs and where US dollars are spent.
"Only when each of us does our part and contributes our share can we realize the UN's highest aspirations," Trump said.
President Trump, claiming the U.N. Human Rights Council had become "a grave embarrassment to this institution," said the US would not return to it without real reform and would provide neither support nor recognition to the International Criminal Court for similar reasons.
He added, "We will never surrender Americas sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy."
In a play on his campaign slogan, President Trump said on Tuesday that a global migration crisis can be resolved by making every country "great again."
He said the US would not sign onto a global migration pact, saying individual nations should instead set their own policies.
"Only by upholding national borders, destroying criminal gangs, can we break this cycle," he said.
He said the US would "recognize right of every nation in this room to set own policy."
The only way to prevent people from leaving their nations is to "make their countries great again."
President Trump told world leaders on Tuesday "we are systematically renegotiating broken and bad trade deals."
Citing his bids to renegotiate trade deals around the world, Trump said during an address at the United Nations that "many nations in this hall will agree the world trading system is in dire need of change."
Singling out China for its trade abuses and theft of US intellectual property, Trump said "we will no longer tolerate such abuse."
"We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated," Trump said.
Stressing he still has "great respect and affection" for Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said "America will always act in our national interests."
President Donald Trump on Tuesday castigated Iran for sowing "chaos, death and destruction" in the Middle East and urged other countries to join the US in resuming economic pressure on the Iran.
The US President trumpeted his decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal, calling it "horrible," and noted that "many countries in the Middle East strongly supported" his decision.
"Irans leaders sow chaos, death and destruction they do not respect their neighbors borders or the sovereign rights of nations," Trump said.
"Irans leaders plunder the nations resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the middle east and far beyond. The Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran's treasury, seized valuable portions of the nations economyall to send out their proxies to wage war."
Trump said the US has launched "a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the funds that it needs to advance its bloody agenda."
He said additional sanctions will resume in the coming months and said the world must ensure that "the world's leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the worlds most dangerous weapons."
He vowed to continue to support "Iran's people." (CNN)

Youths post semi-nude pix on FB taken on Pidurangala Rock
	
A group of young men and women, who climbed the Pidurangala Rock belonging to the Pidurangala Raja Maha Viharaya in the historic Sigiriya, had allegedly taken their nude photos and posted them on social media.
These photos that have been taken by them within the sight of Sigiriya causing insult to these religious places have gone viral on the social media. The Sigiriya Rock and Pidurangala are located a few kilometres away from each other. The archaeologists say that the Pidurangala monastery had been built for Arahant monks and offered for their use before the construction of Sigiriya.
In response to this, the chief incumbent of Pidurangala Raja Maha Viharaya, Ven. Daniyagama Ananda Thera said an immediate inquiry should be held for this indecent act bring the culprits to the book because these photos have been posted on Facebook.
He added that it is disgusting how these people who come to see this world famous place had behaved. If they have understood history and the morality, they could not have behaved in such a manner, according to the monk.
When tried to inquire from the archaeological officer of Sigiriya in this regard, an officer of that office said that they might have behaved in that way because there was no archaeological officer in charge of this area. However, he said that he would report to the higher authorities concerned in this regard for necessary action.
A lot of local and foreign tourists visit Sigiriya and the surrounding religious places these days.
This is seen as a trend started on social media. (Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa)
