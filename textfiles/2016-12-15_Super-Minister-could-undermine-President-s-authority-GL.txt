‘Super Minister’ could undermine President’s authority: GL


	

The government’s move to create the post of ‘Super Minister’ with omnipotent-like powers could even undermine the authority of President Maithripala Sirisena, the joint opposition said.

It said if the Development (Special Provisions) Bill was enacted creating a Super Minister, then he or she would be able to take decisive decisions regarding the economy of the country, thereby manipulating authorities and departments, even bypassing subject ministers.

“The Super Minister will be able to control institutions such as the Board of Investment (BOI), the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA). If something goes wrong or the Super Minister makes an errant decision, then no one will be able to take action against him or her as this post will be vested with legal immunity. This is a serious situation. The powers of the President would be betrayed with the appointment of such a minister,” Professor G.L. Peiris told a news conference.

He said the Super Minister would even be able to decide as to which investor should be given tax concessions and which investor should not. “This is a responsibility of the Treasury, not a mere minister,” Prof. Peiris added.

He further stated that the United National Party (UNP) had openly asked the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers to leave the government if they had criticisms about it.

“The Super Minister will also absorb the portfolios of key SLFP ministers, leaving them with no other option but to exit the government if they didn’t quit willingly,” he said.

He also said they would challenge the Development Bill once it was tabled in Parliament. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
