Blues blast the proposed Bill
	

The Blue partys Diyawanna group informally met at the office of a party high-up the other day.

Their discussion centered on a proposed Bill designed to bring all major development projects in the country under one Ministry.
At the outset, a seasoned party senior had explained the dire consequences that could flow from the proposed concentration of power relating to the countrys overall development in the hands of one political authority. A vociferous one from Uva had next attacked the development operations under one umbrella concept. Several state purohitas who contributed their views expressed the fear that the proposed legislation will provide room for an outside authority to make inroads into their subject areas.
Finally, they reached consensus to take a decision on the proposed Bill at a special meeting of their Central Committee. Some of them had put their foot down saying they should not hesitate to oppose legislation of this nature.

Customs seizes 1.3 mn Chinese fags valued at Rs. 75 mn
	
The Customs Central Investigation Bureau officers seized 1.3 million cigarettes valued at Rs. 75 mn at Orugodawatte Rank Container Terminal (RCT) today, Customs Spokesman Dharmasena Kahandawa said.
The contraband had been imported into the country from China in the vessel MSC Erika on December 5 and the consignment had arrived in a 20-foot container hidden in 57 spring mattresses, he said.
Kahandawa said that it was the second time in the history that an illicit cigarette consignment packed in a 20-foot container was detected by the Sri Lanka Customs.
Previously two 20-foot containers had been seized in single detection few years ago, which held the record of the highest number of sticks, he said.
This time Customs sleuths found 1.3 million sticks of cigarettes of two Chinese brands.
Earlier, the largest single detection of illicit cigarette consignment in history, estimated to be over Rs.355 million in values, was seized by the Customs Post Clearance and Audit Division on January 9, 2015, the day following the Presidential Elections.
While addressing media the Customs Director General Chulananda Perera said that it was illegal to import cigarettes from other countries but cigarettes were not illegal in the country.
This consignment must have been brought to the country due to the need of the Chinese people, who live in the country, he said.
The importer had not submitted declarations to the Customs in this regard. We understand that a Chinese national residing in Sri Lanka is behind in this smuggle racket and has already been identified and he is being now questioned, he said.
Another Chinese national who was involved in a similar case had his visa to Sri Lanka suspended forever by the Immigration and Emigration Director General following a request from the Customs to prevent illegal cigarettes imports.
Due to several imports and raids the cigarette imports had increased in the country and a huge market had been created in the country due to the increment of the price of a cigarette in the local market, he said.
The Director General requested importers to not to resort to illegal routes to import their goods.
We have provided all the facilities to genuine importers and if importers continued to violate the law the Customs will tighten the facilities, he said.
Investigations were conducted by the Customs Superintendent G.B. Gnanaraj, Assistant Superintendent Ms. Wasana Rubasinghe, Prasantha Kumara and Dilina Srinatha on the direction of Customs Director General Chulananda Perera and K. D. Ruwanpathirana.(Chaturnga Pradeep)

Efficacy of any medication should be proved by  control experiments
	
Recently, the Daily Mirror published an article on an Ayurveda physician, Dr.D.D.A.Hettiarachchi who claimed he could cure dengue. Authentic Ayurveda inarguably contains healing properties. However the lack of research has underscored the value of Ayurveda.We spoke to two medical practitioners on their opinions on the efficacy of such treatment. They asserted that the proposed treatment should be clinically and experimentally proven to establish its efficacy and to protect the lives of patients who may otherwise contract unexpected and at times life threatening illnesses. 
Dr. Sarath Hettige- Specialist in Family Medicine
You have to be open minded; it could be true or untrue.
Dr. Sarath Hettige, a certified specialist in Family Medicine who discovered and proved the efficacy of the papaya leaf extraction in treating dengue said that instead of criticizing,the public should be broad minded to review proposed theories. 
You have to be open minded; it could be true or untrue. I am an MBBS doctor too. The only way to prove that an Ayurveda medicine or any medicine is efficacious is to conduct a control experiment. You have to divide a group of people into two factions. You administer this medicine to one group and not give it to another. At the same time the usual dengue guidelines should be followed. This was what I did to prove the efficacy of the papaya leaf extraction, said Dr. Hettige who won the Presidential Award for the best medical invention for 2013 this year. 
Dr. Hettiarachchis treatment includes an ointment applied on the head and ears, and a decoction to drink made with a powder, a piece of papaya leaf and king coconut flower nectar. Papaya leaf is definitely efficacious. There is no doubt about that. There are more than 20 randomized control trials done all over the world. We did a trial at the Kalubowila Hospital, said Dr. Hettige commenting on the ingredients of the treatment. However as the ingredients of powder have not been disclosed he could not comment further. 
When asked if he thought that any dengue patient could be cured within 18 hours as Dr. Hettiarachchi claimed in his interview with Daily Mirror, Dr. Hettige replied in the negative. You cant cure dengue within 18 hours. You have to first do the NS1 antigen test to diagnose dengue on the first day. Then you should give the papaya leaf extraction on the first day itself. Most people get cured within three to four days and they dont need hospital admission. But curing dengue within 18 hours is quite implausible, he said. 
Suggesting that Dr. Hettiarachchi should conduct clinical trials to prove the efficacy of his treatment Dr. Hettige said, You cant gauge its efficacy by giving the medicine to one or two people. The research could be done in an Ayurveda hospital. But dengue patients dont seek treatment from Ayurveda doctors. Therefore this doctor should link with a western doctor and conduct a trial. He should get ethical clearance, state what the ingredients are and the toxicity of the powder. There is a long process to follow.  
At a time when there was no cure for Malaria, Malaria patients were dumped in a jungle where one man consumed a piece from the cinchona bark when he was delirious. He got cured. Consequently quinine was discovered. Most of the western drugs stem from Ayurveda. But you need proper clinical research, he noted. 
Dr. Sarath Amunugama- Deputy Director General of Health Services
According to western thinking we will not administer such a treatment unless it has gone through the process of verifying its efficacy.
Commenting from the perspective of western medicine Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the Deputy Director of Health services said,Perhaps he is able to cure dengue according to Ayurveda. However in western practice if we are to say that something is efficacious there is a long process to follow. You need to analyze the components. Trials are conducted on animals and then there are small scale studies with people. If there are no complications further trials are conducted under the supervision of an independent body. It is only then that they decide to administer it to human beings. Unfortunately here we have an Ayurveda physician claiming to cure dengue. I cant say if its true or not. According to western thinking we will not administer such a treatment unless it has gone through the process of verifying its efficacy. 
He added that Dr. Hettiarachchi should conduct trials and reveal the scientific document stating the details of the trial so people could be aware of what he has done. 
When asked about how the Ayurveda doctor could conduct a research as he had claimed that the lack of funds prevented him continuing his research at IDH on HIV, Dr. Amunugama said, I dont know how he approached the Ayurvedic department. The Ministry of Health which Ayurveda falls under has enough of funds. They should not be concerned about funds. They should apply through the Ayurveda department. 
Stating that there was no treatment available to kill the dengue virus and cure the patient in western medicine Dr. Amunugama said, Around 90% of dengue patients get cured without treatment. In hospitals we monitor the patients to see if theres any bleeding or leakage through repetitive full blood count tests and other investigations. We treat the complications. We cant kill the virus because there is no such treatment.

Govt. should implement pledges: CV
	
The government should implement without delay the pledges made regarding the Tamil people while entering into pacts, said C. V. Wigneswaran, the Chief Minister of the Northern Province
He made this statement at a media briefing which followed a meeting of the Tamil National Council held on Monday at the Jaffna Library.
He said that, in 2009, the then President of Sri Lanka had made a promise to Ban Ki-moon that the government would undertake to ensure the welfare of the Tamil people in future. "It is good to examine whether the present government has honoured these pledges," he said.
"Another pact had been signed in Geneva and it is relevant to examine whether what was contained in that pact for the betterment of the Tamil people has been implemented. A third describes how our country should change by 2030 and what should be done for the people. It is prudent for the government to show what changes they would make and what they intend doing for the people," he said.
He said most of these promises could be fulfilled. "What has to be done in accordance with all these pacts has not been done, and that had led to various problems. If what needed to be done had been done, we could forge ahead in peace and harmony," he said. (Romesh Madushanka)

Govt. to set up Development Zone in Trinco with India's assistance
	
Along with the development of Hambantota under assistance from China, the government is to implement a development programme on similar lines in Trincomalee including the operation of the Port there with India's assistance, a Minister said today.
Minister of Development Policies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama said this in response to a question raised by journalists as to whether India will react adversely against the Private Public Partnership model proposed with China Merchant Holdings to operate the Hambantota Port. We are currently talking with India to get into a similar arrangement to run the Trincomalee Port and to develop an industrial zone. However, this government will actually work with all the countries including India, Singapore and Japan, the Minister said.
Referring to the arrangement with China Merchant Holdings, the Minister said a joint venture would be set up to run the Port. He said China Merchant Holdings will get an 85 per cent stake of the new venture and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority the rest. Referring to the statement made by Minister of Ports, Arjuna Ranatunga that a 51 per cent and 49 per cent stake would be more viable for Sri Lanka, Mr Samarawickrama said, it would be difficult to get a larger stake for the government given the situation regarding the outstanding debt amount. The government will however see that the best terms and conditions will be arrived at when it comes to the final agreement. At the moment the government had already signed a framework agreement, the Minister said.
He asserted that the 15,000 acres of land that would be released for the industrial zone on a phase by phase basis will depend on availability of them However, the industrial zone will spread to Hambantota, Matara and Moneragala he said.
The Minister said the 200 houses will have to be relocated, but decisions pertaining to it would be carried out only after negotiating with the land owners. He assured that forest reserves would not be used for the purpose.
He said the government was confident that China Merchant Holdings would develop the Port despite the turbulent period which the global shipping industry was going through and the global economy which is expiated to stagnate with a 0.8 GDP growth. Hambantota will flourish as manufacturing industries in Southern China, would be moved towards Southern Sri Lanka, he added. (Yohan Perera)

His obstinacy cost him his portfolio
	

A Southern Provincial Minister forfeited his portfolio when his Ministrys expenditure vote under the 2017 Budget was defeated recently.

The ruling party members had been at loggerheads with the ousted Minister for a long time over the latters negative response to their requests. And they had threatened to vote against his Ministrys expenditure allocation at the voting time, but the Minister had refused to soften his stiff attitude.
The Chief Minister, who made a consistent effort to save the situation, had made an eleventh-hour bid to get the Minister to sign a letter promising the aggrieved ruling party members to comply with their reasonable requests. But the Minister had curtly refused to sign the letter. And when his Ministrys expenditure allocation came up for voting, the ruling party members had joined the opposition in voting against it, they say.

I was told to sign or resign-Media ministry secretary
	
The agreement to provide vehicles on lease terms to 58 MPs holding chairmanships in Divisional Coordinating Committees has run into a snag with the Secretary of the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Nimal Bopage refusing to place his signature on the said agreement.

He said that his refusal was based on several issues and that he was told to, Sign or resign. He revealed this at a media briefing at the Ministry of Mass Media on Tuesday. 
Defending his position the secretary said this proposal had not received the approval of the Technological Committee and that repayment was to be made in 60 monthly instalments but the present parliament had only another 45 months to go and he had no right to burden a future parliament with the remaining instalments. 
He said a problem had also arisen regarding the ownership of the vehicles.
He said his refusal to sign was due to these reasons, he said. 
The president, too, does not seem to be in favour of this proposal and no final decision has been taken. However, he (the secretary) would not sign it, he said. 
He said, I have been told to sign or resign not as a threat but as a matter of course. The prime minister is a good statesman. What he said was correct; as my duty is to sign a document which has been approved by the Cabinet -- and if I fail to do so I should resign. I am correct and the reasons I give are justifiable.

InauspiciousNakatha given for the Sinhala & Hindu New Year 2017
	
It is said that time is the only true unit of measure. The indisputably valuable time should be utilized for the benefit of mankind. The Sun and time are inseparable. The Sun creates, sustains and destroys not only mankind, but everything on this cosmic world. Time is the evidence to that. The relationship between the Sun and time plays a major role in astrology. The Sun being the most important factor for the life on earth, is considered as the King of the solar system, ruling over all celestial bodies. Solar ingress is an important aspect in astrological studies. The Solar ingress in Aries, which occurs in mid-April each year, is a unique national, traditional & cultural festival for Sri Lankans. 
The concept of Kaalapurusha or the cosmic man is widely used in astrology. Kaala means time and purusha means man. According to Indian astrology the entire zodiac is supposed to represent the body of Kaalapurusha and the ascendant sign of this cosmic man is Aries. Predictive ability becomes easier when the concept of cosmic man is applied to horoscope reading in parallel to the natal chart. For instance, whatever the ascendant sign of a native is at the time of birth, his/her horoscope so cast can be studied by considering Aries as the ascendant in addition to the normal method of reading, especially when it comes to medical astrology. This concept of cosmic man also can be used for electional astrology which is a branch of astrology that is used to select auspicious times to begin new ventures or undertakings based on astrological considerations. Thus, if the horoscope cast for a particular auspicious time has Aries as ascendant, the results, whether good or bad as per that horoscope will be doubled since the ascendant is same as that of kaalapurusha chart. On such occasions if the Moon, is placed in the ascendant the results become threefold and the Sun too in the ascendant will only add to the negative or positive impacts depicted in the chart. 
It is with great enthusiasm that most Sri Lankans look forward to the dawn of New Year, which falls in mid-April depending on the exact time of ingress of the Sun from Pisces to Aries. This is called Mesha Sankranti in Sanskrit. The almanac for the relevant year gives the auspicious times pertaining to various traditional & cultural rituals carried out with the arrival of the Sinhala and Hindu New Year. 
The almanac for 2017 is already in the market and the auspicious times applicable to New Year celebrations are given thereby. Rituals are many and the most important of these is the ritual of commencing work, transactions and partaking of the first meal in the New Year which as per almanac 2017 is at 07:05 AM on 14th April. An auspicious time or in Sinhala what we call nakatha is calculated after considering many astrological factors. Basic rules and guidance in selecting a good Muhurta [nakatha] are given by ancient Rishis who possessed highly developed minds. 
Thus, let us analyze the time given above to verify whether it abides by the basic astrological rules that should be adhered to when fixing an auspiciousmuhurta. First and foremost the rising ascendant of the particular moment plays a huge role in deciding whether the time is auspicious or not. The horoscope cast at 07:05 am on 14th April 2017 for Colombo, Sri Lanka is as follows: 
Before going further let me state two basic rules that determine whether a particular horoscope is strong or weak. The first is that all natural benefic planets should be placed in quadrants [Kendra] and/or in trines [thrikona]. The quadrants in a horoscope, also named as Vishnusthaana [abodes of Lord Vishnu] are the 1st, the 4th, the 7th and the 10th houses. Trines or Lakshmisthaanas [abodes of Goddess Lakshmi] are the 5th and the 9th. It should be noted that the 1st house or the ascendant is also a trine as well as aquadrant. The quadrants are the pillars of a horoscope and the trines are the most beneficial houses in a horoscope. The second rule is that all natural malefic planets should be placed in upachaya houses or houses of growth. Upachaya houses, which indicate struggle, competition and activity, are the 3rd, the 6th, the 11th and the 10th house is a quadrant as well as an upachayahouse.Hence, natural malefic planets placed here possess courage, patience and stamina to overcome any adverse situation. If a natal horoscope or electional horoscope satisfies the above rules, the chart can be considered as very strong. Otherwise it is a weak chart on the face of it and may not give auspicious or expected results. One cannot change the karma of a native. Hence, we cannot expect a natal horoscope to have planets placed in the most ideal places. Yet, when fixing an auspicious time, the astrologer should use his free will to cast the best ascendant chart possible by giving due respect to ancient scriptures which stand the test of time. By doing so the effect of adverse cosmic forces could be minimized if not totally avoided. 
Natural benefic planets according to Sage Parashara are Jupiter, Venus, Mercury and strong Moon.Natural malefic planets are Saturn, Mars, Sun, Rahu, and Ketu. But out of these four benefic planets, the Moon and Mercury can become ineffective or malefic if they are in the company of malefic planets or come under their influence. The Moon is strong when it is not very near the Sun. 
The ascendant rising at the so called auspicious time given above, for the ritual of start work, transactions and partaking of the first meal, is Aries. The natural benefic planets are Jupiter, Venus and the Moon. Mercury is conjunct with the Sun, a natural malefic. Rahu placed in the 5th house inflicts its malefic nature on Mercury by its 9th aspect. Additionally, Mercury is the 3rd and the 6th lord for Aries ascendant and an enemy of the Aries Lagna Lord Mars. Thus, it becomes a dire malefic in this case. The Moon though waning, but in Krishna Paksha Tritiya tithi, is placed far from the Sun.Hence, the Moon is a benefic here. 
Jupiter is placed in the 6th house and Venus is placed in the 12th house. The Moon is placed in the 8th house, the most doomed house in a horoscope. The 6th, 8th and 12th houses in a horoscope are the most fearful houses and are calledtrika houses in Sanskrit. These houses are responsible for all calamities in life. Thus,when natural benefic planets are placed in these houses, as in this particular instance where all natural benefic planets are placed in trikahouses, the outcome can never be good or auspicious. 
The Sun and Mercury are placed in the rising ascendant, Rahu in the 5th house and Saturn in the 9th house. The only malefic in an Upachaya house is Ketu. The 3 trines in this horoscope are occupied by the most malefic planets and the benefic planets occupy trika houses. Thus, this electional horoscope rising at 07:05 am on 14th April 2014 is very weak. The situation is aggravated since the rising sign Aries, is the ascendant of the cosmic man or the Vishva Kendra. It becomes worse as the Sun is also placed in the ascendant. This electional chart completely ignores the basic rules that should be adhered to, in casting an auspicious horoscope. Any sensible astrologer would not cast such a weak horoscope for a ritual observed nationally from time immemorial. 
Another extremely weak placement in this horoscope is the placement of the Moon. The Moon signifies the people, masses, women in general, public opinion, quality of life, water& food supplies, health, natural resources etc. in mundane astrology. When afflicted it results in unrest and discord among people. It is a basic rule that the 8th house in an electional horoscope should be empty. On the other hand it is specifically stated that the Moon should not be placed in the 8th house in an electional horoscope at any cost. The Moon rules the mind and is the closest planet to the earth and transits faster than all the other planets. Hence, its position in an electional chart should be undoubtedly dignified. Defying this important rule, sadly, the ascendant rising at this so called auspicious time turns out to be inauspicious due to this unfavourable placement of the Moon in the most malefic 8th house from the ascendant. 
One more negative feature in the above chart is Gulika [also called as Maandi] placed in the ascendant itself. Like Rahu and Ketu it does not have any physical existence. According to astrological classics Gulika is considered as the most malefic entity in a chart. It denotes a certain segment of time controlled by Saturn.Dr. Suresh Chandra Mishra, a renowned Indian astrologer, author of many astrology books and a scholar in Sanskrit says, Gulika spoils the benefic significations of most of the houses by occupying them. Thus, all troubles ensue when Gulika occupies lagna. The classics explain the results of affliction by Gulika in conjunction with other planets. In our chart Gulika is in conjunction with the Sun and Mercury. In Mundane astrology, the Sun signifies the government, the head of the nation etc. Hence, affliction by Gulika may result in tension in these areas. Mercury signifies communication, media, transportation and travel, intellectual trends, education etc. Gulika in conjunction with Mercury may result in an increased rate of traffic fatalities, suppression of information, problems related to education etc.

In fixing an auspicious time importance is given to the Sun and the Moon and their relative positions.Panchanga or the 5 variable elements considered to fix an auspicious time are based on this relationship. Even if panchanga are beneficial, but the electional horoscope is weak, the expected auspicious results are denied. On the other hand a weak feature of a panchanga may be offset by a strong electional chart. One element of the panchanga is hora which is calculated by dividing the duration of the day [from sunrise to sunset] into 12 equal parts and similarly duration of the night [from sunset to sunrise] into 12 equal parts. The hora should be beneficial relative to the task and to the electional horoscope. Each Hora is ruled by a particular planet and again this hora is divided into 5 sub Horas, ruled by 5 different planets. These are ancient concepts given by highly exalted Rishis. The time chosen for the ritual above is 07:05 AM, which belongs to Mercury main hora and Mercury sub hora. Mercury is a functional malefic for the Aries Sign as it is the owner of the 3rd and the 6th house from the Aries ascendant.Besides, Mercury is the dire enemy of the ascendant lord Mars and being placed in the ascendant itself is harmful to this chart. Hence, the time given fails to stand as auspicious from this angle too. 
When a nation as a whole adheres to an inauspicious time to commence an important ritual, negative impacts will be felt by everyone. If the time given is inauspicious, the next step is to find a better time to commence this ritual. 
Let us consider Pisces ascendant rising at 05:53 AM on 14th April 2017. 
The ascendant is Pisces and two benefic planets, namely Venus and Jupiter are placed in the 1st and the 7th houses respectively. Benefic Moon is placed in the 9th house. Thus, all three benefic planets are well placed, giving strength to the chart. Three upachaya houses are tenanted by three malefic planets. They are Mars in the 3rd house, Rahu in the 6th house and Saturn in the 10th house. These are excellently placed. This enhances the strength of this electional horoscope. The Moon though debilitated in Scorpio but placed in the 9th house from the ascendant, is well dignified by being the 5th lord placed in the 5th from the 5th house.
The ascendant lord of Pisces is Jupiter which aspects the ascendant giving more positive energies to the chart. If the ascendant lord aspects the rising ascendant it is highly desirable. At this time the Sub Hora lord is Jupiter, the ascendant lord itself, giving its beneficial aspect to the ascendant. In the Pisces Sign ascending horoscope, Gulika is placed in the 11th house from the ascendant, the only place where Gulika fails to inflict its malevolence.Hence, the auspicious time for the ritual of start work, transactions and partaking of the first meal should be at 05:53 AM on 14th April 2017. The auspicious time for lighting the hearth for the preparation of the meal should be advanced to 05: 05 AM from 05:41 AM, the given time in 2017 almanac. 
Astrology should be used only for the welfare of the people. Electional astrology is the astrology of choice. Of course, there is no perfect chart. But it is the responsibility of the learned astrologers to cast the best horoscope minimizing afflictions as much as possible, in order to enhance the auspiciousness of the given event.

India accuses Pakistani Islamist over airbase attack
	
NEW DELHI AFP Dec19, 2016- India on Monday accused Pakistani militant leader Maulana Masood Azhar of masterminding an audacious attack on an air force base in January that led to a breakdown in relations between the two nuclear-armed nations. 
Seven soldiers were killed in the attack on the Indian air force base in Pathankot, which New Delhi has said could not have been carriedout without the help of theIslamabad government. 
It blames the Pakistan-based Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammed, founded by Azhar, who was released from an Indian prison in exchange for passengers of a hijacked Indian Airlines plane in 1999. 
Indias National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed formal charges on Monday naming Azhar, his brother Rauf Asghar and two other members of the banned group after concluding an investigation into the January attack.

The Pohottuwa political party founded by the clever sibling and nominally headed by the stranded professor, has placed some JO members on the horns of a dilemma, they say.

The main grouse of the unhappy JO members is that the politicos at the helm of the new party have no popular base in the countrys electorate.
Two prominent JO stalwarts, a talkative one hailing from Matara area and a Prince from Kalutara have expressed their displeasure at the founding of the new party. However, JO seniors have appealed to the two dissidents not to upset the apple cart as they should have a vibrant political party for their loyalists to contest at the upcoming local polls.

29 killed, 72 injured in Mexico fireworks blast
	
Explosions ripped through a fireworks market north of Mexico City on Tuesday, killing at least 29 people and sending columns of smoke into the sky.
Seventy-two people were injured, said Eruviel Avila, governor of the State of Mexico.
Three minors are expected to be transferred to a hospital in Galveston, Texas, for treatment of extreme burns after the blast in Tultepec, about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) north of Mexico City.
Video captured flashes of fire and what appeared to be fireworks exploding. A witness told CNN that people ran for their lives. The death toll climbed throughout the evening.
The cause was not immediately known.
Jose Luis Tolentino said he was in traffic and heard loud noises. Some of the people who tried to get away tripped in the frantic dash, he said.
Tolentino said the fireworks market is the size of a soccer stadium.
Pyrotechnics are a major industry in Tultepec. In 2005, a large explosion took place at the same fireworks market. That blast injured many people and caused enormous damage.
Emergency responders were at the charred scene and assessing the damage Tuesday, Luis Felipe Puente, coordinator of Mexico's national civil protection agency, told CNN affiliate FOROtv.
Photos from Red Cross Mexico showed the devastation and paramedics on the scene. (CNN)

Mahela tells officials to keep their hands off the Test cricket format
	
Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene has urged cricket officials to resist tinkering with the longer format of the game.
Jayawardene is currently playing with the Central Stags in the Twenty20 Super Smash competition.
And despite his days as an international cricket player being long gone, Jayawardene said that Test cricket wasn't broken so there was no need to fix it.
"I'm not a huge fan of having a lot of day night [Tests] but they may be a one off here and there which gives it a bit of flavour," Jayawardene told Newshub Sport.
"But four day test cricket is definitely a no-no, you need 5 days to get a result, 4 days is not enough."
During his Test career, the 39-year-old scored over 12,000 Test runs at an average of 49.84.
And he countered the idea that Test cricket is getting boring, suggesting that there's so much talent coming through and so many close results that it's not worth changing for the sake of viewer numbers.
"The whole Australian South African series, every test went to the fifth day.
"All the games had results and if we see the India, England series which is going on in the sub-continent, you need five days to get the results and theyve been getting results on the fifth day."
"There's a lot of young talent coming through which is exciting, why do you want to change that"
Jayawardene scored a classy half century in his first appearance with the Stags this season but failed to fire in his second match.
While he favoured Test cricket over the rest of the formats, he said he fed off the energy from the younger guys in the Stags during this T20 tournament.
"For an old bloke like me, I need some young guys around me to show that energy.
"It's good fun, at the same time I can contribute in a different way, try and give a bit back, not just skill wise but mentally to prepare for big games and how they need to improve."
Jayawardene also told New Zealand to be patient when it came to Blackcaps captain Kane Williamson.
"It's quite easy to scrutinize guys on one or two decisions... I think Kane from day one that he wore the Blackcap jersey, has been fantastic and produced some fantastic knocks and taken a lot of responsibility on his shoulders at a younger age.
"He obviously lost a lot of experienced players and Ross is the only one around now. So he needs time to get his team together and drive through for another 2-3 years to make it a bit more consistent but I think so far he's done a brilliant job."
Jayawardene will lead the troops into battle against the Otago Volts in New Plymouth tomorrow night.(Newshub)

Mother dolphin wails as its young one dies
	
A seven month old dolphin which had fallen sick had been carefully looked after by its mother. The mother had spent its time swimming about in the Ambalangoda fisheries harbour accompanying the young one, apparently seeking help from the humans.
The large crowd that had gathered at the harbour on Monday afternoon witnessed this pathetic episode. The mother dolphin had left the deep sea and come to the harbour probably thinking that human help would be available to save her offspring. She had been swimming restlessly from one end of the harbour to the other but no one had come to her aid.
The owner of a turtle breeding centre nearby had attempted to save the dolphin by calling for help from Wildlife Department officers and the Coast Guard without avail.
A fish trader named Dev Rohan Rajapakse had brought the dolphin and the sick baby ashore in a boat and attempted to treat the sick baby. Despite his efforts the dolphin had died, and the loud wailing of its mother was amazing; and the watchers were all in tears sharing the grief of the dolphin whose motherly love was something never before seen or heard.
The dead baby dolphin was removed Wildlife Department officers who took steps to release the mother dolphin safely to the sea. (M. Sunil Priyantha and Deepal De Silva)

Need of health literacy for public
	

Health literacy implies the achievement of a level of knowledge, personal skills and confidence to take action to improve personal and community health by changing personal lifestyles and living conditions. Thus, health literacy means more than being able to read pamphlets and make appointments. By improving peoples access to health information, and their capacity to use it effectively, health literacy is critical to empowerment. Health literacy is itself dependent upon more general levels of literacy. Poor literacy can affect peoples health directly by limiting their personal, social and cultural development, as well as hindering the development of health literacy (The Magazine of the United Nations, Vol. XLVI No. 1 & 2 2009). 
With the development of science and technology, the health as a field of caring is being developed rapidly, decreasing simply the mortality and morbidity in many developed as well as developing countries. But health literacy among public is rear yet when it considers the accessibility of medical care such as doctors, clinics, pharmacies, medical drugs as well as medical terms. For instance, when you got a medical prescription note from the consultant including drugs with the dose and the number of days, are you sure that you can understand all the details given by your doctor. Would you find interest in searching of what you are supposed to have as your treatments This is one way of dissemination of health information directly from an expert to a person who is probably unaware of the medical language. In this point, there is a gap between the knowledge of the experts and the patient though the patient is the one who use the advice given to him or her by the expert. The point is: just because individuals (a patient or general public who do not have the knowledge of reading their own body) are given information about health does not mean that they will simply adopt the information given, understand it or even read it in the first place! Thus, when it comes to using information dissemination as an approach to influence behaviour change to improve health, it is worth considering whether 1) the information reaches and is understood by its intended recipients 2) the recipients have the necessary skills to adopt the information 3) the environmental and structural conditions are supportive of the behaviours advocated. 
This is where the concept of health literacy comes in. Though there is no single definition on what is health literacy, my eye captured Kickbusch, Wait & Maags ,their book of Navigating helath: The role of health literacy definition on health literacy as very informative and comprehensive note. It says that the ability to make sound health decisions in the context of everyday life - at home, in the community, at the workplace, in the health care system, the market place and the political arena. It is critical empowerment strategy to increase peoples control over their health, their ability to seek out information and their ability to take responsibility. 
According to my point of view the definition underlines three levels of health literacy: functional health literacy, interactive health literacy and the critical health literacy. While functional health literacy refers to the basic reading and writing skills that can help individuals to function effectively in the healthcare context; interactive health literacy refers to the development of personal skills in a supportive environment to improve personal capacity to enable individuals to act independently based on knowledge. Critical health literacy refers to the ability to critically evaluate and use information to actively participate in health promotion. 
Thus, it is important to promote health literacy among the general public as medical knowledge is centralized within a particular group of people. General public need to understand what they know about health and what they are lacking. Think: do you search of the information of medical drugs you receive from the hospital or pharmacy. If no why Is it because you trust your consultant or you have poor health literacy. Think aloud! 
This note was developed referring to a book on Health Psychology.

Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya today said that all Chief Ministers of the SLFP will protest the Development (Special Provisions) Bill as the Bill proposes to snatch certain powers away from Chief Ministers vested in them under the Constitution (13th Amendment).
He added that they also could not agree to the creation of a Super Minister that violates the Constitution.
He expressed hopes that Northern Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran would also fall in line with other Chief Ministers.
The SLFP has no objection whatsoever for the reforms introduced to accelerate the development programme, the establishment of a new institution to attract Foreign Direct Investment, promote tourism and revitalise the industrial sector and new policy decision taken for the benefit of the country, Chief Minister Devapriya said.
Addressing the media at his office today, Chief Minister Devapriya said however, the Chief Ministers of any province could not agree to the move to attempt to transfer the Constitutional powers vested in the Provincial Councils to a newly established body under the proposed Development (Special Provisions) Bill.
Though the Western Province did not come under any new establishment, five Development Boards have been proposed under the new Bill to bring all other 8 Provincial Councils under them namely Central, Wayamba, Eastern, Southern and Northern Development Boards respectively which we cannot agree, Mr. Devapriya stressed.(Sandun Jayasekara)

Paneerselvam asks Modi to send 'firm' message to SL
	
Taking up the latest detention of seven fishermen, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to send a firm message to Sri Lanka over continued apprehension of the state's fishermen and said a permanent solution would be in restoring India's sovereignty over Katchatheevu islet.
Panneerselvam in a letter to the PM Modi said the boats and fishermen were reportedly taken to Karainagar in Sri Lanka by their navy personnel and were remanded in custody.
"It is the consistent stand of the government of Tamil Nadu that a permanent solution to this vexatious problem faced by our fishermen will be possible only by restoring India's sovereignty over Katchatheevu by securing the right to fish in traditional waters," he said.
The right of the fishermen is continuously infringed upon by the Sri Lankan's Navy "recurrent" actions of apprehension, the Chief minister said.
Demanding that the Centre send a firm message to Sri Lanka on the issue, he said 109 boats, including the two boats apprehended today, should be released by the island nation.
"The Sri Lankan strategy of not releasing boats of our fishermen is causing great frustration among the fishermen of Tamil Nadu. Without their livelihood base, fishermen are in a state of despondency," he said.
Panneerselvam requested Modi to direct the External Affairs Ministry to take up the matter with Sri Lankan authorities to ensure immediate release of 22 fishermen and 109 boats.
On Monday, seven Tamil Nadu fishermen were detained and their two mechanised fishing boats were seized by Lankan navy personnel for allegedly fishing near Neduntheevu in the island nation.
The fishermen from Jegadapattinam hamlet in Pudukottai district were taken to Kangesanthurai Port there, along with their boats.
The apprehension of fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy continues 'unabated' despite Indo-Sri Lankan fishermen level talks and Inter-Ministerial talks being held from time to time, he said.
Pudukottai Fisheries Department Assistant Director, Sekar told media yesterday that the Lankan navy also allegedly rammed the boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen against one of the mechanised boats and sank it leaving five fishermen on board to struggle in the sea till fellow fishermen rescued them.

Planning a head count change for a regime change
	

It was the former strongman who said the other day that a regime change could be brought about by a change in the head count in the Diyawanna council.

It appears that the Greens have taken a cue from the proposition made by the war horse. For there is talk that an enthusiastic group of Greens bent on forming a government of their own is busy trying all means of raising their present head count of 106 to 115.
Duggie from the North and the cockerels from the hills are said to be quite willing and are waiting for the Green signal, but the objections coming from the ones ruling the roost in the North-East now backing the government from the opposition have become a stumbling block to such a coalition.
By the way, moves by the Greens to go it alone have sent the former powerful madam into a flutter and she is marshalling all the wit and wisdom gained during her long career in politics to keep the unity government in one piece, they say. Meanwhile, all main political parties have decided to put on hold all their important political moves and manipulations pending the Shani Graha Maruwa, astrologically significant event of Saturns entry into a new zodiacal house on January 26 next year.

Police fear Berlin truck rampage driver still at large
	
A Pakistani asylum-seeker suspected of ploughing a lorry into a Berlin Christmas market and killing 12 people may not be the right man, police said on Tuesday, sparking fears the real killer could be on the run. 
As the shell shocked German capital reeled from the countrys deadliest attack of recent years, doubts emerged over whether the man detained overnight actually committed the atrocity.

Twelve people were killed and almost 50 wounded, 18 seriously, when the lorry tore through the crowd on Monday, smashing wooden stalls and crushing victims, in scenes reminiscent of Julys deadly attack in the French Riviera city of Nice. 
It is indeed uncertain he was the driver, Berlin police chief Klaus Kandt told reporters about the Pakistani man while forensic work and questioning continued. 
Berlin police tweeted that we remain especially vigilant, urging Berliners to do the same. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was later set to visit the scene near the iconic Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, said the deadly rampage was believed to be a terrorist attack. 
Merkel said if it was confirmed that the killer had been part of the refugee influx, this would be particularly sickening in relation to the many, many Germans who are involved every day in helping refugees. 
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere had said the top suspect was a Pakistani man who had arrived via the so-called Balkan route last New Years Eve and was staying at a Berlin refugee shelter.

SampathCards continues to take brand to greater heights
	

Mirror Business recently met with Sampath Bank PLC Consumer Banking Senior DGM Tharaka Ranwala to get his views on the banks and nations renowned credit card brand  SampathCards.
Below are the excerpts.

By Zahara Zuhair
What makes SampathCards special
Over the years, SampathCards identified that a card, whether debit or credit, is not just a plastic instrument that enables customers to carry out transactions. With the evolving trends and lifestyles, a credit or debit card has now become a vital component of everyones lives. With this in mind, the team at SampathCards continues to take the brand to greater heights, thereby creating the necessary bond between a cardholder and their card, whilst giving them the assurance of safety and responsibility, which align with SampathCards slogan The Responsible Choice.
The main concept driving SampathCards is that we want our cardholders to shop with confidence and responsibility while making full use of the benefits of SampathCards. In this light, with the season amongst us, SampathCards will enable any and every cardholder, despite the varying levels of income, to enjoy the assortment of offers, discounts and extended payment plans that SampathCards offers. SampathCards continues to introduce new concepts and promotions for all cardholders - encouraging individuals to use credit cards as a necessary tool, which is not only a convenient method of making purchases, but also a responsible instrument that facilitates expenditure within ones limits and capabilities whilst enjoying an abundance of privileges.
Another feature that adds to the uniqueness of SampathCards is that we are driven to give our cardholders the real value for money, without restrictions and hidden charges. This aspect greatly contributes to the experience of being a Sampath cardholder.

How successful have SampathCards seasonal offers been
SampathCards seasonal offers have been running for five years consecutively. Through this time, we have seen almost all our customers, irrespective of what type of cardholder they are, embrace the wide range of discounts that SampathCards has offered and continues to offer. Therefore, it is a season that they enthusiastically anticipate every year.
While SampathCards gives cardholders an experience of responsible shopping with great value for money, we are also driven towards giving our cardholders an unmatched experience each time the requirement of using a Sampath Card arises. As such, during the festive seasons in April and December, we ensure to grow and expand our offers in terms of the number of merchants we partner with, the products, services offered and most importantly the range of discounts and alternate payment plans our customers can benefit from. Therefore, this December, SampathCards has introduced Big Celebrations, Bigger Discounts and Biggest Offers, in order to give Sampath cardholders a joyous season of gifting their family and friends while also gifting themselves.
Meanwhile, Sampath Bank PLC Card Centre Chief Manager Achala Wickremaratne gave a snapshot on the seasonal offers this December. This December our seasonal offers revolve around the theme Big Celebrations, Bigger Discounts and Biggest Offers. With a maximum discount of up to 50 percent, we have over 150 merchants across categories such as retail, fashion, jewellery, supermarkets, electronics, furniture, baby care, fitness, bookshops, duty free, lifestyle, eye care, motor insurance, online shopping, hotel and dining and more renowned brands such as Kelly Felder, Cotton Collection, Emerald, House Of Fashions, Uptown Kandy  Liberty Plaza, Hameedia, CIB Shopping, Beverly Street, Adidas, Dilly & Carlo, Nills, Romafour, Samanmal, Nike, Galleria, Levis, Mango, Dockers, Splash, Mothercare, Giordano, Crocs, Pepe Jeans, Tommy Hilfiger, Damro, The House of Gifts, Samudra Book Shop, VijithaYapa Bookshop, Turret, Vison Care, Toyota, World Duty Free and many more.
Furthermore, we are the only bank this season to have all Apple authorised dealers for the recently launched Apple iPhone 7, offering an instalment plan to purchase Apple products.

What are your thoughts on the future of the credit card industry
Looking back about six years ago, the world had a credit card crunch and people did not want to use credit cards. During this time, Sampath Bank was growing in leaps and bounds in terms of usage, as well as in the number of cards. This was a result of the realisation that Sampath credit cards gave cardholders great value for money. Therefore, we believe, people are now trying to move out of using currencies and move in to plastics. In time to come, the use of cards will be higher, not just credit cards but debit cards as well  because the convenience, security and responsibility brought about by using cards together with the many privileges and offers cannot be compared to carrying cash.

What are some of the challenges faced
I think the biggest challenge we have faced is finding the right kind of mix and the balance in having a technologically driven platform, whereas at a lower cost you can reach a wider audience. By overcoming this challenge, the bank is able to compete within the industry, satisfy the evolving and dynamic needs of customers and also keep our customers constantly informed on the subsequent increase in turnover of potential customers.
So the challenge is to find that right model where you reach a wider customer base with a wide horizon on delivery and to achieve these objectives, many banks are using technology.

Could you tell us about SampathCards recent achievements
The biggest achievement for SampathCards is that we were the first bank in the country to launch Visa payWave  the near field communication (NFC)-enabled credit and debit cards that facilitate contactless payment when the customers need to make purchases at any merchant outlet with an NFC-enabled machine.
Its a very simple concept which gives NFC-enabled cardholders the advantage of simply tapping their card against the payWave reader to pay for their purchases and be on their way. While the limit on the purchase amount differs from country to country, this product gives customers a hassle-free experience that saves time and minimizes the risk of personal and sensitive card details being shared during transactions.
Sampath Bank recently won two accolades at the Visa India & South Asia Client Forum Awards 2015. One of the accolades was in recognition of Sampath Banks achievement for the highest growth in credit card portfolio among the banks in Sri Lanka. The second award was for the banks achievement of the highest growth in POS and e-commerce acceptance among Sri Lanka. Together, this achievement positioned Sampath Bank as the only bank among those in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Maldives and Sri Lanka to receive two main category awards.

What are the other trends you see in terms of technology
The most recent trend that is surfacing in the financial sector and the banking domain is the incoming technological companies called Fintex. These companies use their technological platforms to look at financing individuals. Therefore, a prominent trend in the future is the growing number of Fintex companies, which banks need to embrace, if not the entire company then even a segment of it, in order to prevent the banking business from being outdated or eliminated.
Another upcoming trend is the entrance of telcos into the financial sector. With an established platform where customers have their voices heard and the innovation of data and mobile platforms that enable transactions, telecommunication businesses are growing to become a vital component of the financial sector. Together, the entrance of Fintex and Telcos into the financial domain will set and provide healthy competition for all banking and financial institutions whilst adding value to total solutions offered to cardholders.

What are some of the new products or services that Sampath customers can look forward to during this season and the upcoming year
A few services are Credit Card Balance transfers, Extended Settlement Plans and Cash Instalment Plans (CIP), which are novel concepts. The Credit Card Balance Transfer service provides the opportunity to other credit cardholders to transfer their outstanding credit card balances to a Sampath Bank credit card for a low interest rate.
The Extended Settlement Plan service is applicable in instances where merchants either do not have any instalment plans or do not offer instalment plans. In this situation, the payment for purchased products or used services can be paid in instalments up to 36 months.
Finally, the Cash Instalment Plan (CIP) enables customers with a credit card limit to withdraw the balance of their unused credit as cash from their credit cards and pay in instalments at a minimal fee.
What are some of the unique features offered by SampathCards to their cardholders
One of the unique features to highlight is that SampathCards applies only four charges to credit cardholders and this includes an interest charge, a card fee, late payment fee and cash advance fee.
Additionally, we are one of the few banks who do not charge a late payment from two of our top range cards  Signature and Infinite. Reason being, this particular segment consists of top business people with busy lifestyles that may hinder their track records on payment due dates and so on. As such, to help this segment, the bank offers a complimentary service to this segment whereby Sampath Bank uses mobile technology to send payment reminders to the customers personal mobile phones without charging them with a late payment fee.
This is a practice placed at the forefront of all our banking operations, the practice to identify the evolving and dynamic needs and lifestyles of our customer base and accordingly, craft products, services and banking solutions that specifically cater to these aspects. This is yet another unique feature of SampathCards and the bank - we drive ourselves to be the integral force behind our customers at all times, paving paths of convenience, benefits and value additions that will continue to enhance their lifestyles and day-to-day activities.

Social media websites under Govt. threat: JO
	
The joint opposition today charged the news forecasting and social media websites including the Facebook were under threat of the governments several bigwigs due to their necessity to ban those websites in Sri Lanka.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition member and MP Dullas Alahapperuma said it was evident from the recent incident where a journalist had being assaulted by the Navy Commander at the Hambantota Harbour.
The government has come to power with the support of these news forecasting and social media websites. But at present the government is trying to suppress the same media institutions, he added.
He said the joint opposition has appreciated the Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministrys Secretary Nimal Bopages refusal to sign the agreement to provide vehicles on lease terms to 58 MPs holding chairmanships in Divisional Coordinating Committees.
He has been told to sign or resign by the Prime Minister. Despite of such a condition he has strictly refused to put his signature on the agreement. We highly appreciate his decision to stand firm on his decision as a government worker even though we had issues with him before, he added.
Meanwhile, joint opposition leader and MP Dinesh Gunewardena said the joint opposition would be prevailed as the force which would create the next government in future.
Throughout this year, we have stood for the people and have intervened in each and every significant incident as a responsible opposition party to the government, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Sugar import levy upped to Rs.13 a kilo
	
The Special Commodity Levy for a kilo of imported white sugar had been increased by Rs. 6 from last night, the Finance Ministry said.
However, the retail price would not be affected, Ministrys Media Secretary Sisira Wijesinghe told the Daily Mirror.
An importer would now have to pay Rs. 13. Earlier it was Rs. 7 per kilo. However, the price increment would not affect consumers because the government had declared a control price of Rs. 95 on white sugar, he said.
The Ministry took this decision to discourage sugar imports and to gain more revenue to the government, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Syria army tells remaining rebels to quit Aleppo
	

ALEPPO AFP/ Dec20, 2016- Syrias army on Tuesday urged the last remaining rebels and civilians to leave the besieged opposition enclave in Aleppo as it prepares to take full control of the devastated city. 
The evacuation of Aleppos rebel sector is seen as a pivotal moment in the nearly six-year war that has killed more than 310,000 people and triggered a major humanitarian and refugee crisis. 
Following a flurry of diplomatic activity, key regime allies Russia and Iran as well as rebel supporter Turkey agreed to act as guarantors in Syria peace talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. 
They also backed expanding a ceasefire, according to Lavrov, who said the evacuation of east Aleppo should finish within one or two days. 
At least 25,000 people have left rebel districts of east Aleppo since the operation began last week, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is overseeing the operation. 
Thousands more were still waiting to be bused out, spokeswoman Ingy Sedky said.

The Queen will step down as patron of 25 organisations
	
Daily Mail/20 December 2016- The Queen will step down as patron of more than 20 national organisations at the end of the month, Buckingham Palace revealed today. 
The Queen, who celebrated her 90th birthday in April, will relinquish her association with the bodies - just as the Duke of Edinburgh broke formal ties with some of his patronages when he turned 90 in 2011. 
The move is likely to be seen as a common-sense decision which acknowledges the Queens advancing years but Buckingham Palace stressed the monarch is still patron of more than 600 organisations. 
The patronages will be taken on by members of the Royal Family and organisations involved include Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, Barnardos, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Association. 
Buckingham Palace said in a statement: At the end of the Queens 90th birthday year, Her Majesty will step down as patron from a number of national organisations.

There is some truth in the audio: MR
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that there was some truth in the audio of a telephone conversation between himself and former Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickramatunga which is circulating in the social media. He said he could not remember whether he said exactly what was in the audio.
There is some truth. I frequently spoke to him. It was not a new thing. I cant exactly remember whether I said this. I know he had a habit of recording all his conversations, he said.
When asked if it was recorded by Mr. Wickramatunga, Mr. Rajapaksa said he did not know, and added that Mr. Wickramatunga was a reporter and he may have recorded it, as every reporter did that.
He is a reporter. You take a recording of the conversation and produce later if someone denies some of the statements he made, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

They had planned to boycott vote-taking on Third reading
	

A threat held out by the Betel-leaf politicos on board yahapalanaya not to say aye for the 2017 Budget had reportedly stuck to their guns until the issue was resolved minutes before taking the vote on the third and the final reading, they say.

The Betel-leaf group in Diyawanna had made this threat saying that some Diyawanna members of the government had criticized them at a media briefing and they wanted to boycott the vote on the Third reading as a retaliatory measure. However, the move was pre-empted at the eleventh hour through the intercession by stalwarts from both parties. Green partys secretarial one from Kegalle and his Betel-leaf party counterpart from Hambantota had made a concerted effort to make peace, Diyawanna sources say.
All rebels had later turned up to vote for the Budget. However, the flamboyant one from Badulla had said: This can be the last Budget of this government for which we may raise our hands!

Two attack three at wrong forum
	

Two powerful purohitas had taken up cudgels against three of their colleagues at a very important meeting held recently which was attended by the Top Two of yahapalanaya.

The irate duo -- one handling the public purse and the other looking after the health of the nation -- had charged that the three colleagues had become a liability to the government.
The two purohitas had even expressed their aversion to work in the same team with the trio responsible for key establishments like Police, law courts and kachcheris respectively which had drawn the Number Ones curt reply: Isnt this a party issue Why dont you sort it out at party level And that brought down the curtain on the issue, they say.

Was he too behind the chaos
	

There was widespread speculation in the recent past that a purohita in yahapalanaya too was behind the chaos that hit the harbour in Ruhuna.

Some people say that the particular purohita put his weight behind those who wanted to create the unrest because of a grudge he harboured for striking off the name of a foreign investor he sponsored.
The purohita is also said to be sulking over being kept out of the entire process of awarding the harbour management contract to the Chinese company.
The strike by the workers took a turn for the worse as he passively looked on without taking any positive step to resolve the issues involved, they say.
