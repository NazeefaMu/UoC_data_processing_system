A Cabinet reshuffle soon: Amaraweera


	

UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday a mini cabinet reshuffle was in the offing because the people and government members thought that a change in certain cabinet portfolios was necessary.

He told a media briefing that it was up to President Maithripala Sirisena to decide when it would take place.

When asked whether it was before the national New Year, the minister neither denied or confirmed it.
When asked about the remarks made by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa that the unity government would be toppled before the end of this year, the minister said it was wishful thinking by a defeated politician fighting for his survival.

“The UNP remained in the opposition for 21 years and kept saying the UPFA government will be toppled but it happened only in 2015. The unity government will remain in power until 2020 and no one can prevent it,” he said.

Commenting on the statement made by Mr. Rajapaksa that he would give the leadership to the joint opposition to contest the local government polls separately, the minister said it would be the biggest betrayal if Mr. Rajapaksa did that as the ultimate beneficiary in a SLFP split would be the UNP.

He said he hoped that Subject Minister Faizer Musthapha will gazette the wards based on the delimitation report.

“I have spoken to two warring factions and other members of the UPFA to unite at least till the elections but it did not work out. We must realize that if the SLFP splits into two and contested the polls against each other we do not stand a chance to win. The UNP will be the absolute winner. Therefore, on behalf of all SLFP supporters I ask that the decision to contest the LG polls poll separately and contest under the SLFP flag and symbol,” the minister said.“I have one thing to tell the joint opposition. If it contests any election separately, it will suffer a humiliating defeat and that defeat will be their political hara-kiri. But sadly, it will also affect the SLFP badly."
