Deafening silence about astounding prediction


	



 

An offspring of a prominent politico hailing from the South made a sudden visit to the Southern part of the neighboring country recently.

 


The politico, a purohita at state level is an intimate of a very high authority in yahapalanaya. 


The offspring had made this visit to consult a leading astrologer mainly to know his own future and that of the country. The astrologer who had had occasion to read the Natal Charts of several leaders of this country is on first name-terms with half the country’s top team, they say.


The offspring who initially had entertained some nagging doubts about the bona fides of the astrologer had suddenly turned a great faithful of his when he (the astrologer) made an accurate reading about a very personal matter which was a secret he had hitherto jealously guarded.  The astrologer is said to have made some astounding predictions about some political leaders in the country. And what had impressed him most is a predication about a dramatic political event due to come about in 2020. 
Now back in the country the purohita’s offspring is maintaining a deafening silence about the forecasts made by the astrologer, they say.
