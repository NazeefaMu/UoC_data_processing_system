The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee will take disciplinary action against members of the party who participated at the paada yathra organized by the joint opposition.

SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said that action would also be taken against “those who hooted at the headquarters”.

“We will take action against the people who participated in this march at our next Central Committee (CC) meeting. The behavior of those who participated was deplorable” he said.

The minister said the march was in no way a threat to the government which would continue to be in power for the next four years.

“This was a march organized to take revenge on SLFP party members and that is how we see it. Mahinda Rajapaksa doesn’t have a party and he wants to break the existing party, that is what this was all about and not about overthrowing the government,” he said.

The minister said the distinction between the former President and the current President was that the latter was focused on uniting the party while the former has repeatedly attempted to divide it. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
