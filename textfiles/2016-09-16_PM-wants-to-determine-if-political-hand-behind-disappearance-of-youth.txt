Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has ordered the intelligence unit to determine whether any political group is behind the disappearance of the youth in Bandagiriya, Hambantota.

Sources close to the Prime Minister said he had told IGP Pujitha Jayasundara to direct the intelligence officers to carry out an investigation to determine whether any political force was behind the disappearance.

The premier and the government are reported to be of the opinion that the disappearance has been organized to put the government in difficultly prior to the UN General Assembly sessions. President Sirisena is expected to address the sessions in New York.

Further the premier had told the IGP that the police had to take the responsibility if the Hambantota incident created an adverse situation for Sri Lanka at the UN sessions.

In addition he had questioned the IGP as to why the police had taken one week to apprehend the suspects.

The youth was found at a Temple in Dikwella yesterday. (Yohan Perera)
