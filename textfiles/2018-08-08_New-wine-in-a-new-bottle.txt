An envoy from a powerful European country based in Colombo called on the former strongman the other day.

 


The main purpose behind his courtesy call, was to discuss several political issues including the upcoming big poll, they say.


The diplomat asked the former strongman pointblank: “Do you propose to enter the fray with the same old team or have you got a new team? “


A seasoned politico, the former strongman decided it was good for his political health not to give a straight answer to this query. After a moment’s reflection, he replied: “Our wine bottle is new. Its label is new and the stuff inside it is too new!”


“O! I see! New wine in a new bottle! The label too is new!”  the diplomat echoed the enigmatic words and laughed aloud, they say.
