Sandra Bullock Adopts 3-Year-Old Girl

The 51-year-old actress revealed in a cover story for People magazine on Wednesday that she adopted Laila (pronounced Lila). "When I look at Laila, there's no doubt in my mind that she was supposed to be here," Bullock told the magazine. "I can tell you absolutely, the exact right children came to me at the exact right time."
In 2010, Bullock adopted her 5-year-old son Louis and says that her son was a big part of why she wanted a second child. "Louis spearheaded this whole journey," she said. "I knew Laila was scared, and all I wanted was for her to know Louis and I weren't going anywhere."
Bullock's other leading man, Bryan Randall, also took part in her big reveal. The actress' boyfriend, who's a Los Angeles-based photographer, snapped the family photos for the publication.
"My family is blended and diverse, nutty, and loving and understanding," she gushed. "That's a family."
Reports that Bullock had adopted a second child began to surface a few months ago. In October, a source told ET that there had been sightings of the Oscar winner out and about with a toddler.
"Unbeknownst to me, a photographer had followed us and taken a photo of us in line," Bullock told People. "The next day, I learned that a photo of her was being shopped around for sale to every outlet around the world. I had promised and legally agreed to protect her from something like this, and here I was chasing down lawyers - having them, begging them to keep her safe."
"You feel it's very much like witness protection," Bullock added.
One thing's for certain, the actress loves being a mom. When ET caught up with Bullock at the Minions premiere in June, she stressed just how much she adores her little Louis. "I mean, like people go, 'Your adopted son,'" she told Kevin Frazier. "I go, 'Please don't say that. He is my son!' I would give my life for him."
