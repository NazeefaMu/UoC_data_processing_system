A photograph showing an enormous crocodile caught in a popular fishing spot has been terrifying viewers from Australia to the UK and Africa.

The photo was posted on Facebook with warnings that people should avoid waters where the monster reptile was caught - but few clues to the actual location.

A woman in the UK posted the photo, which left thousands of people desperately trying to work out where the massive creature has come from.

In the photo three men can be seen standing on each other's shoulders to show just how big the crocodile is as it hangs from a tree. (dailymail)
