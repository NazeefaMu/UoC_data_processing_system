The CID and a team of experts yesterday searched the Laboratory belonging to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe for Wassim Thajudeen's body parts, which had gone missing after the initial postmortem examination.

They searched the campus on a search warrant obtained from Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris.

The CID sought Court permission to search the private campus based on the information revealed during the investigation that the former JMO Ananda Samaraseka had dispatched some of the body parts to the SAITM.

The Colombo Additional Magistrate directed the Forensic Faculty, Judicial Medical Institute and Lady Ridgeway Hospital to assist the CID.

The Magistrate also directed the prosecution to submit a report on the search on October 5. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
