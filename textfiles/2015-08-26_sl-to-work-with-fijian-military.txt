Sri Lanka is hoping to sign a defence cooperation agreement with Fiji, a South Pacific country, the Fiji Sun reported.
Major General Aruna Perera, who met Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama in the Fijian Capital Suva, had informed the Fijian authorities of Sri Lanka’s willingness to work with the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF).
Major General Perera said Sri Lanka was ready to welcome RFMF officers to get first-hand information about the military operations in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka has a highly trained and experienced military with a record of success in anti-terrorist operations.
RFMF Land Force Commander Colonel Sitiveni Qiliho, who was also at the meeting,said the two forces had been in touch through the RFMF rugby players currently playing in Sri Lanka.
He said RFMF would send rugby players to Sri Lanka while Sri Lanka had offered to help the RFMF in cricket.
