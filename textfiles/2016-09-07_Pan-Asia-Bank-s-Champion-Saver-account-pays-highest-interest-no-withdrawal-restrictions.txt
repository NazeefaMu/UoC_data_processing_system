Pan Asia Bank offers the highest interest rate of 8 percent (AER 8.33 percent) for savings deposits through its flagship savings product ‘Champion Saver’. A unique benefit afforded by Champion Saver to account holders is that they continue to enjoy the higher interest rate irrespective of the number of withdrawals made. Withdrawals could be made from any ATM which carries the ‘Visa’ logo. 


A Champion Saver account could be opened with an initial deposit of Rs.1,000. The account holder will receive 3.5 percent interest for deposits between Rs.25,000 to Rs.50,000 and a rate of 5.5 percent for deposits between Rs.50,000 to Rs.300,000. For balances above Rs.300,000 an interest rate of 8 percent is paid. 


With Champion Saver, the account holder can either opt for a pass book or a monthly statement. Apart from the higher interest rate, a Champion Saver account holder will also enjoy a host of other benefits such as a Visa debit card, SMS banking facility, Internet banking facility and standing order facility. Sri Lankan residents over 18 years of age or foreign personnel with resident visa status can either walk into any of the Pan Asia Bank’s 80-branch network spread across the country to open a Champion Saver account. Pan Asia Bank’s strong performance and stability is underscored by the BBB rating by Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited. Pan Asia Bank was also adjudged as the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka in 2016 by United Kingdom’s Global Banking and Finance Review.
 
At a time when the market interest rates are at all-time low, Pan Asia Bank’s Champion Saver provides an ideal investment opportunity with full flexibility of a savings account.
