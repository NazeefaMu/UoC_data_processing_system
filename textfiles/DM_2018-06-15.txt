A pub that has become a nuisance hub!
	

There is a pub run by a sidekick of a powerful politico in a Kandiya area in Digamadulla and the disorderly conduct of the tipplers who frequent this pub has become a nuisance to the children of two schools who must walk past this pub daily, they say.

Ugly scenes of drunken tipplers fighting and trading obscenities are a regular feature on the road opposite the pub and it is the school children who are mostly affected by this rowdyism.
Residents in the area say that those responsible for maintaining law and order in the area have turned a blind to this blatant public nuisance.

Anagarika Dharmapala : Shedding away  the invective
	

		Dharmapala claimed anyone could participate in the religious life
		

Anagarika Dharmapala is the worst thing that happened to Sri Lankan history. He was a racist, a political pamphleteer, a propagandist who, at the end of the day, served the interests of the bourgeoisie by providing an antidote to the proletariat. He was a betrayer, a peddler of myths, and a demagogue. He was hence the definitive ancestor to S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and Mahinda Rajapaksa. He might have been a German or Japanese collaborationist or spy and his comments on the vileness of non-Sinhalese people are enough to rank him alongside Hitler and Mussolini. He did not present a nation-building project, rather a half-baked project that favoured the Sinhala Buddhist businessman, whose interests brought him more into conflict with his Muslim and Tamil competitors than with imperialism per se. Ostensibly anti-imperialist, he was less concerned with combating the exploitative structures of colonialism than with constructing a grand unifying myth for the Sinhalese, of course to the exclusion of every other race. 
Thats one way of looking at it. 

Very few people have attracted revulsion, censure, and praise the way Dharmapala has. Not even Mahinda Rajapaksa comes close

Dharmapala was the sole saviour of the nation. He rose up against the establishment and became the first member from the bourgeoisie to combat the British. He was the closest to a Mahatma Gandhi or, more relevantly, a Subash Chandrabose that we could have had. At a time when people were compelled to be cowards in the face of the British, he had the guts to get up and, despite the cost to his family business and fortunes, rant against imperialism. More than anything, however, he was a unifier, in that he recognised the Number One problem which was ailing our society; the absence of a proper industrial sector. He visited Japan, understood the importance of building up such a sector, and returned to call upon the members of the Sinhala Buddhist business class to build up an economy which would lead the way towards independence. He was greater than most of those hailed as national heroes today. He was a hero on his own right. 
Thats another way of looking at it. 

Facts that escaped historians
Very few people have attracted revulsion, censure, and praise the way Dharmapala has. Not even Mahinda Rajapaksa comes close. I dont think he was a saint. People tend to depict human beings as the angels and the saints they are not, and the popular culture, particularly in a country as small as Sri Lanka, has a tendency of turning individuals into icons and legends. When you take away the rhetoric of legend, you see those individuals for who they are. I believe the same can be said of the Dharmapala and I believe that there are aspects to his life which have escaped the historian and the compiler. In this respect, I also believe that Sarath Amunugamas attempt at sketching out this ambivalent figure deserves more than a cursory newspaper review. Such an attempt was called for. Clearly. Not because he was not a racist, not because he was not someone who tried to bring together the country in a bid to industrialise it, but because he was both and because human beings are hardly the monuments we worship. This is not a review, therefore. 
There were certainly two sides to Dharmapalas campaign; the ethno-religious, and the economic. But as with William Blake, the mystic and the social revolutionary, and Ananda Coomaraswamy, the cultural renovator and the believer in the caste system, it is impossible to isolate the two and consider them separately (which is what scholars do). Rather, as historians have pointed out, it is the intermingling of these seemingly opposed sides and aspects to his character which reveal the true face of his national project. To understand Dharmapalas economic stances, one must therefore understand the brand (if you may) of his faith which he propagated in the 19th and 20th centuries. George D. Bonds insightful, exhaustive account The Buddhist Revival in Sri Lanka (1988) distinguishes between two Buddhisms: this-worldly and other-wordly. It was Dharmapalas overwhelming belief that Arahantship was possible in ones present life and that it need not be deferred to a future life. It was a strongly rational interpretation of the faith, which meant that he frankly deplored the worship of gods: No enlightened Buddhist... would ever care to invoke a god. (notice the use of a simple G).

Path of the Sotapannas
While being rational, it was also reformist, just like his reformism when it came to the economic and social sphere. Traditional Buddhism argued that the supramundane path, or the path of the sotapannas, the once-returners, and the non-returners, was not possible for laymen. Dharmapala effectively wiped away this distinction by claiming that everyone and anyone could participate in the religious life. While this is tentatively comparable to the efforts made by Calvin and Luther in Europe during the Protestant Reformation, as Regi Siriwardena has argued, there was no real radicalism underpinning this new and revolutionary variant of Buddhism; it still thrived on a fundamentally conservative base. Be as it may, one cant really discount Dharmapalas attempts at opening the path to the lay devotee. He emancipated that devotee by arguing, controversially at times, that there was no real need to defer the achievement of Nirvana to a future birth. Naturally, this was on the other extreme of the traditional monastic elite, who preferred a more otherworldly interpretation of their faith in which higher states of consciousness were reserved for those who had donned the robes and passed through several stages in Arahantship. 

It was Dharmapalas overwhelming belief that Arahantship was possible in ones present life and that it need not be deferred to a future life

The traditional monastic elite had as their patrons the traditional elite, the Nobodies who had become Somebodies through capitalist accumulation. They too subscribed to the a more mundane interpretation, arguing (perhaps to protect their own vested interests in this birth) that the chief aim of a Buddhist was to procure enough merit to enjoy a happier, more meritorious next birth. While this interpretation had not been birthed by the Theosophists, it grew out of those who followed Theosophy (which even Dharmapala subscribed to, until differences between him and Henry Steel Olcott made them part ways). D. B. Jayatilake, for instance, in an essay titled Practical Buddhism, contended that the efforts of one life were not enough to attain complete renunciation. It required a preliminary course, the preparation for a future life. The chief aim of ones present life, on the other hand, was to observe precepts, support ones family through right livelihood, and do good in this world. Herein lies the subtle but fatal rupture between Dharmapala (the reformist) and his opposing group (the neo-traditionalist): the former was fiercely advocating the shattering of distinctions between the present and the future, while the latter conversely advocated the maintenance of those distinctions, and of various other distinctions which approximated to the views of those in the group who believed, inter alia, in the liberal ideal of a secular state, with a separation between the government and the temple, between faith and personal life: in short, between precept and practice.

It is difficult, then, to draw up imaginary lines dividing Dharmapala the national figure from Dharmapala the lay preacher

It doesnt take one much time to ascertain that the overwhelming support for this school of thought came from the new bourgeoisie, because in part at least, they were seeking ways to rationalise their business interests through a new interpretation of Buddhism. Dharmapala too was an entrepreneur, but was hardly of the sort that the new bourgeoisie were. One can contend that it was his line of family businesses, which involved manual labour and the transformation of material into industrial products, which spurred him into his nationalist crusade. One can also contend that it was the nature of those businesses which compelled him to strike out on his own when it came to a radical re-evaluation of Buddhism. Years later, when Kumari Jayawardenas father, A. P. de Zoysa, would join that battle against the new bourgeoisie, who by then would become leaders of the independence movement, the political landscape had bifurcated between a left movement which sought to industrialise this nation and a rightwing movement which remained complacent with the petty, primitive nature of their form of capitalist accumulation. 
It is difficult, then, to draw up imaginary lines dividing Dharmapala the national figure from Dharmapala the lay preacher. In an essay on Buddhism, published at the turn of the 20th century, for instance, he implores the British to let industrial and technical schools be started in populous schools and villages. Perhaps more than anything else, if we are to chart Dharmapalas ascendancy as a crusader and a radical wielder of his faith, we need to consider that it is the intermingling of these two strands, rather than the separate analysis of each of them, which can best help us understand the man beneath the robe, and the robe and the enigma which made up the man. Free from all those invectives.

BIA Customs thwart attempt to smuggle chameleons
	
Customs officers monitoring the Courier Services at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), found 32 dangerous reptiles, Customs Spokesman and Deputy Director, Sunil Jayaratne said.
He said the reptile species was an intermediary breed of Geckoes and Chameleons found in Sri Lanka.
These reptiles packed into four white bags were found in a shipment declared as computer CPUs, Mr. Jayaratne said.
He said the shipment had arrived from Australia via Singapore and the Customs declaration form was addressed to a person in Kalutara, but it was found to be a fake.
"We have sent our officers to locate the owner of the reptiles," Mr Jayaratne said and added that quarantine officers had recommended that the reptiles be deported as soon as possible.
This is the first time that this kind of reptiles had been smuggled into the country. Customs officers monitoring courier services had done a great job. With no prior experience the officers had a problem identifying the species. Sending them back is not the solution, but there should be a proper method to identify such animals by relevant authorities attached to the Customs Department. The Customs Officers do not know everything and as such, they only detect unauthorized and non-related things coming into the country, Mr. Jayaratne said.
The detection was made by Customs Superintendents Vipula Fernando and S. Ranasinghe.
Investigations were carried out by the BIA Directorate of Revenue and Services and Bio-Diversity Control Unit of Customs, as a joint programme under the supervision of Customs Assistant Superintendents Jayalal Fernando, Superintendent and Buddhika Prabhath. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Conviction of Gnanasara Thera a victory for HR defenders: AI
	
The conviction of a Buddhist monk who had threatened the well-known campaigner against enforced disappearances, Sandhya Eknaligoda, is a victory for human rights defenders in Sri Lanka, Amnesty International (AI) said today.
A magistrates court in Homagama handed down a six months sentence and a heavy fine to Galagodatte Gnanasara Thero for threatening Sandhya Eknaligoda in court, when she appeared in 2016 to pursue justice for the enforced disappearance of her husband, the famed Sri Lankan cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda.
This is an important verdict for all people who fight for human rights in Sri Lanka. A clear message has gone out to those who seek to intimidate, threaten and silence people seeking justice, said Omar Waraich, Amnesty Internationals Deputy Director for South Asia.

Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara at FCID today
	
Nalin Bandara Jayamaha who assumed duties yesterday as the Deputy Minister of Law and Order and Public Administration and Management, is to give a statement at the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) today.
The FCID summoned the Deputy Minister to record a statement over a complaint which he lodged with the FCID in July in 2016 in connection with an alleged financial misappropriation that occurred when purchasing two ships from the Shipping Corporation during the previous regime.
The FCID earlier summoned Mr. Bandara to record a statement in connection with the complaint but he was unable to report to the FCID. Deputy Minister said he would give the statement to the FCID at around 10.00 am today.
Earlier, Mr. Bandara alleged that about USD 30 million financial fraud occurred during the previous regime by purchasing two ships at a cost of USD 70 million in 2014 though it actually cost only USD 40 million in the market. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Dont abolish Executive Presidency without amending 13A'
	
The Buddha Sasana Karaya Sadhaka Mandalaya comprising around 15 prominent Buddhist organizations in a statement on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution has urged all political parties not to abolish the Executive Presidency without amending the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
The statement signed by venerable Diviyagaha Yasassi Thera, Tirikunamale Ananda Thera and Agalakada Sirisuma Thera said: While we strongly oppose any move to dilute the unitary state or to introduce a federal system, we request all political parties not to abolish the Executive Presidential system without amending the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
The Karaya Sadhaka Mandalaya includes prominent Buddhist organizations such as the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, Dharma Vijaya Foundation, Colombo YMBA, All Ceylon Womens Buddhist Congress, Maha Bodhi Society and Shanthi Foundation.
The full statement follows:
There have been media reports of a move to abolish the Executive Presidency through a constitutional amendment. We would like to point out that such an amendment to the constitution would be dangerous without repealing the 13th Amendment.
Before the 13th Amendment all functions and powers of the Republic of Sri Lanka were carried out by the Government of Sri Lanka. Through the 13th Amendment the Legislative and the Executive functions of the government were bifurcated and as a result the executive functions of the Sri Lankan Government could be exercised only on the functions included in the Reserved List and the Concurrent List. This Executive function is exercised by the President through the Cabinet of Ministers. The Executive Powers for the subjects included in the Provincial Council List is exercised by the Provincial Governor on the instructions of the Chief Minister and the Ministers of the Provincial Councils.
Although the Governor should normally act on the instructions of the council of Ministers of the Provincial Council, according to section 154(B) (2)of the constitution the Governor should exercise his powers in accordance with the powers of the President. This has been accepted by the Supreme Court as well. If the Provincial Ministers exercise their powers in a manner that is illegal or detrimental to the State, in such an instance the President can intervene and give necessary orders to correct them. If the Presidential system is abolished while maintaining the provisions of the 13th Amendment, in such an instance the Central Government will not be able to intervene as before.
Therefore our understanding is that it is not wise to abolish the Presidential system without repealing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. It is quite obvious to anyone when looking at the current action of the Chief Minister of the Northern Province and the Tamil National Alliance that the Sri Lankan State should have the powers act against any untoward acts of a provincial government. The Tamil National Alliance says in public that no Buddhist temples should be constructed in the Northern Province. There opinion is that Sinhala people should not be settled in the Northern and Eastern provinces. By now a large number of Buddhist archaeologicalsites have been destroyed in the North and the East. Under section 25 of the Provincial Council List, the museums and historical sites had been included in the Provincial Council List. The subject of police, powers concerning lands to a certain extent, the subject on religious organizations are also included in the Provincial Council List. The result would be that the Northern Province Chief Minister and the council of Ministers would be able to exercise powers prevailing to these subjects. Therefore the Sinhala Buddhist public living in the Northern and Eastern province is in an insecure situation and it is the Presidents Executive Powers functioning over the Provincial Ministers powers that had given some sort of a protection to them.
That is why it is the opinion of the Buddhasasana Karyasadhaka Mandayala that there should not be a division of the peoples executive powers between the Cabinet of Ministers and the council of Ministers of the Provincial Council. If the Council of Ministers of the Provinces is maintained under the 13th Amendment it should be done subject to the powers of the President and the Cabinet of Ministers.
The rights of the minorities living the North and the East will not be protected by only having the power to dissolve a provincial Council on a special occasion with the President. We can imagine how some Provincial Councils would act when the Executive Presidency is abolished by looking at how some of the Provincial Councils are acting now.
The President should have full powers to control any untoward action of the Northern Provincial Council and its Chief Minister. Since the Cabinet Ministers cannot exercise powers on subjects mentioned in the Provincial Council List, the President should be able exercise those powers when a necessity arises.
It is with sadness we note that needs of separatists who want to establish a federal state in Sri Lanka and the Western Powers influence certain decisions of the government. The current constitutional drafting process is a good example for this. While we strongly oppose any move to dilute the unitary state or to introduce a federal system, we request all political parties not to abolish the Executive Presidential system without amending the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.

Effects Venus produces when combined with other planets
	
The planet of Beauty and Love  Part 4

Venus with Mars: makes the subject lascivious
	Venus with Jupiter in 9th Bhava confers great prosperity
	Venus with Mercury in 9th Bhava bestows wisdom, learning and happiness

There is no malefic planet that afflicts Venus so much as Mars. Marital happiness comes under threat when Mars occupies the Kuja-Dushsthana (2nd, 4th, 7th and 8th) from Venus.
Mars-Venus conjunction imbues the native with much energy and vitality as well as a great sexual urge. This conjunction occurring in a good sign and a good Bhava produces a wealthy person endowed with business acumen. He would attract the attention of the fair sex wherever he is. He would be very generous and easy going, but would have a sense of moral rectitude. However, if this conjunction is afflicted, the native would become a person of loose morals, who would stoop to any low means of satisfying his sensual desires. This interpretation holds good for a female native as well.

A nymphomaniac
If there is a Parivartana or a mutual exchange of Rashis between Mars and Venus in a female horoscope, she would become a nymphomaniac. If Moon joins the Mars-Venus combination in the 7th, she would become promiscuous.
If Mars is conjunct with Venus in the 9th Bhava, the native would have a second wife. However, the native would be a great diplomat - a member of the Foreign Service.

A great statesman or a ruler
Native would become a great statesman or a ruler, if Venus is Swakshetra or exalted in the 2nd House and the Lagnadhipati is strong in the Lagna, the 9th or the 10th House.
Jupiter with Venus in the 9th confers great prosperity and Mercury with Venus in the 9th bestows wisdom, learning and happiness.
Venus with Saturn in the 9th gives high status and marital happiness. A Pisces native would rise to the position of a ruler if Venus is posited in the Lagna and the Pisces Navamsa.

Malavya Yoga
The powerful Malavya Yoga is formed when Venus occupies a Kendra (quadrant) or a Kona (trine) identical with his own sign or the sign where he attains exaltation. This Yoga bestows on the native great wealth, authority, good meals, vehicles, learning and a good spouse and children. This is the best of all Yogas produced by Venus.

Venus with Sun and Moon
Venus with Sun in the 9th makes the native a sickly person. Venus-Sun-Moon combination in the 9th produces a person of loose morals.

Two marriages
Native gets vehicles, wealth and ornaments when there is a sextile (60 degrees apart) aspect between Venus and the Moon which is free from malefic affliction.
If Venus is in the Vargas owned by Mars and Saturn or is aspected by them the native would have affairs with the wives of other people. If Venus and Moon are in the 7th House from Mars or Saturn, the native would not marry. Two marriages and several love affairs are indicated if Venus is in Gemini, Virgo or Sagittarius.

A faithful husband
If the Lagna in the Navamsa Chart of a woman is Taurus or Libra, she would get a handsome and faithful husband.
Moon-Venus combination in the Lagna of a female would make her jealous and malicious. She would be desirous of leading a life of luxury. Venus-Mercury combination in the Lagna produces a charming woman skilled in arts and sciences. She would be loved by her husband. Venus- Mercury-Jupiter conjunction in the Lagna confers wealth, happiness and noble qualities on a woman.

Good results in Dasas
Those born in the Berana, Puvapal and Puvasal constellations come under the Maha Dasa of Venus which runs for 20 years. Favourable results relating to the Houses where Venus is strong or his beneficial influence is felt, would become manifest during his Antar or Maha Dasa under the Vimshottari Dasa system.

Eid ul-Fitr : Standing shoulder-to-shoulder in gratitude
	
With the first sighting of the moon for the new month of Shawwal, the Muslims here in Sri Lanka will celebrate the Ramadan festival upon the completion of 29 or 30 days of fasting. They engage in various religious observances and rituals on this special day, with the foremost being performing Fajr prayers, taking a shower, donning new clad and applying perfume before setting out to the mosque for Eid prayers.
This festival is indeed an opportunity for the followers of Islam to express gratitude to Almighty Allah for giving them the will and strength to fast during the holy month. Muslims strongly believe that unless for the mercy and blessings of Almighty Allah, they would never have been able to accomplish the 30 days fasting in seeking His profound satisfaction and forgiveness. They assemble shoulder-to-shoulder in rows in an open area to offer their Eid prayer (Salathul-Eid) in congregation, which indicates the universal brotherhood and unity.
After prayers, they exchange greetings, and wish each other Eid Mubarak (Have a blessed Eid) with the traditional hug of comradeship. The Muslims generally feel at the end of Ramadan, the profound grief of being deprived of spiritual blessings associated with the holy month. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, If my followers were to realise what Ramadan really was, they would wish the whole year to be Ramadan.
Thereafter, they visit the burial grounds to convey salaams (greetings) and invoke the mercy of Allah and His forgiveness for the dead. While visiting the grave, one should say, Peace be upon you, O people of the grave. May Allah pardon you and pardon us. You are forerunners and we are in your footsteps. This visit will urge the mankind to keep away from all forbidden nefarious activities and fun and frolic entertainment by provoking the spiritual thought of life after death.
They then visit their parents, relatives, acquaintances, family and friends and share the joy and happiness on this special day. It is mandatory in Islam to pay Sadaqadul Fitr (charity) to the poor and the needy before they perform the Eid prayer because Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said no one should be in hunger on this special day of celebration and it is the duty of a Muslim to fulfil the aspirations of the poor and the needy, particularly at this unique moment of Eid ul-Fitr.
It is a common sight that every house is filled with sweets and delicacies which they serve among family and friends and lay a table with special foods in their homes. Muslims are also encouraged on this special day to forgive and forget any differences with others or grudges and animosities that may have occurred during the year. This noble act is preferred by Allah. It is reported that when Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) went to perform the Eid prayer, he used two different routes to go to and return from the mosque, with the sole purpose of meeting different people so as to share his joy and blessings on this special day.
This festival will extend for three days and people in villages will engage in traditional sports such as bullock cart, boat and motorbike races to enjoy this joyous occasion. People often grab this rare opportunity to invite their Sinhala and Tamil friends to enjoy a tasty lunch and sweetmeats which will pave the way for national unity among communities which is always highlighted in Islam.
Hence, let us all show our kindness to the less fortunate and enhance humanity to demonstrate our love of God.

Giving life to those in need
	

Blood keeps us alive. Without blood survival is impossible and the only way we could get blood is through another human being. Although the practice of donating blood has existed for decades, the need for safe and quality blood still exists. The National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) located at Narahenpita was launched as a special campaign under the purview of the Ministry of Health. The need for donor blood was felt during the assassination of late Prime Minister S.W.R.D Bandaranaike and at the time the blood bank was a single room located in the heart of Colombo.
Fifty nine years later the NBTS continues its mission as the centrally coordinated blood transfusion centre. With over 90 hospital based blood banks affiliated to 70 cluster centres, the NBTS invites more donors to engage in this
humanitarian cause. In view of World Blood Donor Day (WBDD) held yesterday (June 14) the NBTS organised events to appreciate donors and organisers. Speaking to Mirror Health Capsule, NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa highlighted the significance of WBDD, the screening process and the importance ofdonating blood. 

Significanceof WBDD
World Blood Donor Day is one of the major global events hosted by the World Health Organisation apart from other seven global days they celebrate. They have declared eight events including WBDD which we celebrate annually on June14th. This day also marks the birthday of Karl Landsteiner who founded the ABO blood grouping system, said Dr. Saranajeewa. This day has been honoured since 2004 and global celebrations take place in some country each year. Sri Lanka hosted the global event back in 2014. On this day the authorities appreciate and thank the people who donate blood to save the lives of others. It also aims to raise awareness among people as to how they could contribute in saving a life by donating this valuable gift. This years theme- Be there for someone else. Give blood.
Share life -gives the idea that you are always there for someone else. At the same time you are encouraging people to help one another and give a positive message to the community to unite in the cause to save lives. Actually not all countries boasting of good health systems could engage in voluntary, non-remunerated blood donations. But we are very proud that Sri Lanka stands among the 60 countries that engage in such donations, Dr. Saranajeewa said. 
Blood that is donated should be safe and meet quality standards since there is a high risk of transmitting diseases. In terms of donations last year, the NBTS collected 424,000 units of whole blood. In some other countries there are donors who are paid, but here blood donation is100% voluntary. The NBTS of any country has to make available sufficient, safe and quality blood supply to be used as and when required. At our national blood centre we are always maintaining 2000-3000 stocks of blood samples in all blood groups, she added. 

Procedure to donate
In Sri Lanka, the NBTS is the sole agent for the Ministry of Health in voluntary blood donation and they also maintain the national blood centre here in Narahenpita along with another regional blood centre in Kamburugamuwa, Matara. Speaking further Dr. Saranajeewa said that apart from that they have disseminated their services through cluster centres. This means that this centre is the teaching or the general hospital where there is a consultant transfusion physician. Under that consultant there are other base hospitals to that particular cluster centre. They conduct their own blood donation campaigns to accommodate the requirements of all hospitals in that cluster. NBTS Narahenpita is the cluster centre for Colombo and we provide blood to all teaching hospitals around in addition to the Army Hospital, KDU Hospital and the Neville Fernando Hospital along with all private hospitals. The requirement for a day lies between 300-330 whole blood units which are required for emergencies, therapeutic and surgical procedures, maternal care, paediatric patients and even the cancer hospital.
In all those blood samples the main components are platelets which are the by-product. We do a processing out of the whole blood units where we prepare red blood cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate. This is done in the component laboratory. Apart from that, before transfusing this product to the patient we do a Transfusion Transmitted Infection (TTI) screening. We screen the donors before collecting blood, but sometimes they may not understand what we ask for or they may conceal information and in order to avoid the consequences we conduct the second screening as well. We screen the blood for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, malaria and syphilis, she said. 
In the past, only cross matches were done. But today, in Sri Lanka, we also have gone in to automation and State of Art Technologies. Traditionally blood banks were involved in collection, processing and storage. But now we have stepped into cellular therapies such as bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, cord blood banking and organ transplantation and sample archiving. At National Blood Center , there are specified laboratories in Transfusion Medicine to help clinicians to find the best option to trat their patients. For example, National Reference laboratory at NBC helps clinicians to identify the proper red cell to be transfused to the patients with antibodies against red cells after a previous transfusion or pregnancy. HLA Laboratory (Human Leukocute Antigen) does the tissue typing for organ and bone marrow transplantation . Transfusion Medicine also performs therapeutic apheresis procedures where we do separation of blood in to components, removal of one component and return of the remainder to treat patients with neurologic, kidney and blood diseases.
Another procedure is Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) treatments which are mainly conducted on dermatological and orthopaedic patients.


Eligibility criteria
Not everyone can donate blood. The following basic requirements have to be fulfilled before a donation is done ; Age : between 18  55 (a healthy, regular donor can donate until 60 years of age)Weight : not less than 50kg Haemoglobin : not less than 12 g/dL 
In addition to that, donors with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, pressure cannot donate blood, Dr. Deepa added. Those with a history of having infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, syphilis, malaria and hepatitis too cannot donate blood. If a donor has travelled abroad, they have to wait for three months before donating blood. Another aspect we focus on is the aftercare of donors once they have donated blood. We have a donor care programme where they go through a biochemistry screening and are then able to donate blood every four months. Apheresis donors on the other hand donate platelets while others donate whole blood. They can donate platelets once in two weeks because platelets have a short life span of five days. Sometimes donors, in-house donors- walk-in and donate blood at our cluster centres and we also obtain blood from mobile donations organized by individual groups,she said. 
Before a person donates blood he or she should have a good meal and sleep for six hours, warns Dr. Saranajeewa. It is good if they are not intoxicated as well. After donating blood, one shouldnt drive. They should have adequate rest, she said. Speaking further Dr. Saranajeewa expressed her concerns about the reduction in donations during certain seasons. During the festive season there is less number of mobile donations taking place and during the rainy season these are usually cancelled. We however maintain a registry and in case of an emergency we call the donors and request for a donation,the doctor added. 
The main event in Sri Lanka recognized and appreciated 600 blood donors and 400 organisers who made the event a success. If a problem exists the public health inspectors (PHIs) are informed. In her concluding remarks Dr. Deepa said that people should be aware of these habits which are common among the older generation. We need people to support us as we have a mission to collect quality blood and save as a many life as possible. The younger generation should start donating blood and make a conscious effort to avoid unhealthy practices such as smoking and drinking,she said.

His rant sent her into a faint!
	

A female teacher who called on a political chief of a province regarding an official matter, had collapsed in a faint when the latter barked at her in a frenzy of anger, they say.

The teacher had got highly frightened when the political chief started shouting at her and she had gone into a swoon as she was leaving his office in a hurry.
The teachers mother had been waiting for her outside the office with the teachers child, a toddler and when the woman collapsed in their presence, the child had started crying, Amma Mala! Amma Mala! and its cries had drawn the employees to the scene who had taken prompt action to give her first aid.
This provincial chief though pretends to be a soft-spoken mild-mannered person is a veritable terror to his staffers as well as his visitors, they say.

India expresses deep dismay over Maldives prison sentences
	

NEW DELHI (AP/Daily Mail) 14 June 2018 -India said Thursday it was dismayed by the 19-month prison sentence given to a former leader of the Maldives for failing to cooperate with a police investigation.
A Maldives court sentenced Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to one year, seven months and six days in prison on Wednesday for failing to hand over his mobile phone to investigators. Two Supreme Court judges arrested with Gayoom were given the same sentences.
Indias foreign ministry said in a statement that New Delhi learned of the sentences with deep dismay.
The three men were sentenced to long prison terms without fair trial, it said. This casts doubt on the commitment of the government of the Maldives to uphold the rule of law and will also call into question the credibility of presidential elections later this year.
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Indian Ocean archipelago state for three decades, is the second ex-president jailed under President Yameen Abdul Gayoom. He was arrested in February on charges of attempting to overthrow Yameen, his half brother.

Indian President rejects TNs plea to release Rajivs killers
	
President Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the Tamil Nadu governments request to release the seven prisoners convicted for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991, The Hindu reported today.
Mr. Kovind conveyed to the government that the Centre does not concur with its view to release the prisoners. The President is bound by the advice of his Council of Ministers in such matters.
In the last four years, the State government has written twice to the Home Ministry to pardon the convicts and release them on humanitarian grounds.
The President has rejected the Tamil Nadu governments plea to free the prisoners on the advice of the Home Ministry. This has been conveyed to the State. The assassins of the former Prime Minister of India cannot walk free under any circumstances, a top official told the Hindu.
Earlier, following the Supreme Courts directions, the Ministry of Home Affairs sought details on eight grounds from the State to facilitate further its request to release the convicts.
It asked the State to furnish details such as the physical and mental status of the convicts, their economic and social background and the previous cases registered against them.
The convicts are V. Sriharan alias Murugan, A.G. Perarivalan, T. Suthendraraja alias Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, Ravichandran and Nalini.

Influenza claimed lives of 20 infants, now under control: Rajitha
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne claiming that the influenza had claimed lives of nearly 20 infants in the south and elsewhere, was now being brought under control, added that the influenza virus changed rapidly and therefore the same vaccine could not be used to control the disease all the time.
Therefore, the reluctance of doctors to inject anti  influenza vaccine on patients is understandable, Dr. Senaratne said.
The influenza fever has been controlled and it is not spreading as reported by certain media. You must not count deaths occurred from other diseases as influenza deaths, he told reporters.
Seasonal influenza viruses circulate and cause diseases every year. In Sri Lanka, in the past few years, it has been generally observed during April to June and again in November to January. It spreads from person-to-person through sneezing, coughing, or touching contaminated surfaces. Seasonal influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and even death, particularly in some high-risk individuals.
Persons at increased risk for severe disease include pregnant women, the very young and very old, immune-compromised people, and people with chronic underlying medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes mellitus and heart diseases. Seasonal influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can get infected multiple times throughout their lives. Therefore the components of seasonal influenza vaccines are generally reviewed bi-annually and updated periodically to ensure continued effectiveness of the vaccines. Recently, the National Drug Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka has given licence for the use of seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine.
There are three large groupings or types of seasonal influenza viruses, labelled A, B, and C. Type A influenza viruses are further divided into sub types according to the specific variety and combinations of two proteins that occur on the surface of the virus, the hemagglutinin or H protein and the neuraminidase or N protein. Currently, influenza A (H1N1) is the commonly circulating seasonal influenza A virus subtype in Sri Lanka. During the current season, it has been observed to generally cause severe disease. This seasonal A (H1N1) virus is the same virus that caused the influenza pandemic and it first appeared in Sri Lanka in two waves during 2009/ 10 period.
In addition, there are two type B viruses that are also circulating as seasonal influenza viruses, which are named after the areas where they were first identified, Victoria lineage and Yamagata lineage. Type C influenza causes milder infections and is associated with sporadic cases and minor localized outbreaks. As influenza C poses much less of a disease burden than influenza A and B, only the latter two are included in seasonal influenza vaccines.
Meanwhile, Dr. Prabha Palihawadana, top Epidemiologist and Director Health Promotion Bureau yesterday issued instructions to school teachers on how to act in controlling influenza.
Dr. Palihawadana wants teachers to immediately inform parents if a student is identified as an influenza victim at school, separate the student from others, give the patient Paracetamol and if fever persists admit the child to a hospital.
"Don't mix up influenza with dengue and take the child to a doctor immediately and give the child nutritious food and ample rest," Dr. Palihawadana stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

A Sri Lankan travel agent had beenarrested in Mumbai on Wednesday for allegedly trying to fly to Sri Lanka with three Bhutanese women, the Times of India reported today.
The womenhadtold cops that the accused had promised them high paying jobs in a mens spa in Iraq. Cops suspect he may have intended to force the women into the sex trade.
Sahar police caught Mohiuddin Fayaz (41) from the international airport after immigration officials got suspicious and checked his papers to find that he was trafficking the women using fake Indian passports.
The victims had paid Rs 6,000 each for the supposed jobs. Mumbai cops have provided for their food and accommodation and informed the Bhutan embassy in India so that the women can fly back to their homes.
Fayaz confessed to having arranged passports and visas for the women after getting in touch with a female agent from Bhutan. The woman agent introduced him to the three women in Delhi. She told them that they would be paid well for working in a mens spa. They were also promised payment for the first six months of their training period, said a Sahar police station officer.
Cops are investigating how many women have been similarly trafficked by the accused in the past. The accused got the women to Mumbai and was to fly to Sri Lanka en route to Iraq.

National harmony Spirit of Ramadan
	

Controversy and confusion reign among Sri Lankan Muslims over this years Ramadan festival day, as there is a possibility of some Muslims completing only 28 days of fasting. Had the New Moon for the Islamic month of Shawwal been sighted last evening, they will then be celebrating the festival today.

This is a problem faced by those who started their fast last month according to an announcement made by the Jamiyyathul Ulama, the Islamic Theologians Council in the country and the Colombo Grand Mosque. It would not be a problem for those who argue that Ramadan fasting has to be started once the New Moon is sighted anywhere in the world, on the grounds that the boundaries of countries are man-made.
The festival signifies the end of a month-long fasting season by the Muslims in the month of Ramadan. Though it is called Ramadan, it is celebrated on the first day of the month of Shawwal. It is a day for Muslims to appraise the fast they performed and to celebrate their hard-earned merits during the holy month.
From a religious perspective, Ramadan festivities are confined to only a congregational prayer at mosques or open grounds participated in by men, women and children, and to hosting relatives and friends. Some people also engage in giving alms to the poor on this day.
As aforementioned, this is a day for the appraisal of ones fast. While some would be able to be happy over their meritorious abstention from eating, drinking, entertainment and from sexual intercourse while fasting, some would not. The reason is that fasting does not solely mean avoiding the said practices for some 14 hours -- more than 20 hours in the North-most and South-most countries if Ramadan falls in summer -- but it is rather a spiritual exercise for devotees to lead a life preferred by Allah and the society.
It is an opportunity for one to train him or herself to be in command of language, deeds and mind without harming others but towards their well-being. If one does not attempt to have control over his or herself during fasting, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) had pointed out that Allah would not be interested in his or her fast. Therefore, if one were to reap the benefits of fasting, he or she should contain desires; endure hunger and thirst; refrain from vituperation, lying and badmouthing; not consume intoxicants; not harm creatures; refrain from lustful acts and so forth.
This is an arduous mental exercise as we are in the habit of committing either one or more of these evils, intentionally or unintentionally, and for reasons avoidable or unavoidable.
We are so inured to these sins that we do not feel or care about the depth of their repercussions on us and on others.
One has to pay serious attention to ones own deeds and engage in soul-searching to identify and abstain from evils. It is the hunger and thirst that holds back a person from not thinning out his or her attention on his or her own acts, as they are reminded of the fact that fasting necessitates of being virtuous.
As in any religion, Islamic rituals such as fasting are meant for the moral and spiritual elevation of its followers. But the ritual helps followers only if they are genuinely putting in efforts to achieve merits. Thus, the hunger and thirst felt by an individual who is fasting will help him or her not to drop the caution towards his or her own acts.
Holding on to this caution and acting accordingly for a month is a tremendous spiritual training towards righteousness. However, it would be fruitful only if one attempts to continue the practised way of life throughout the year. Yet, man is prone to make mistakes. His interest and caution might thin out with the passage of time.
He therefore needs another round of spiritual training the following year; during the next Ramadan.
It was during a month of Ramadan that the first verses of the Holy Quran were revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and it along with the traditions of the Prophet shapes the character of a Muslim. Here again, it is not an automatic process but depends on his or her genuineness and interest in using the Quran as his guide.
Therefore, Muslims are advised to associate with it more and more during the month of Ramadan.
Today, there are so many misgivings about the Quran not only among non-Muslims but also among Muslims, leading to conflicts between communities and Muslim sects. The Quran contains a lot of contextual verses which have to be understood in their real contexts.
For instance, since Islam approves self-defensive wars, verses on such affairs are often taken out of context to vilify the Muslims and their scripture.
Interactions by Muslims with the other communities with the spirit of the teachings of Ramadan would greatly help allay such misgivings and bring in much-needed reconciliation to the country and the worldat large.

Northern fishermen shouldnt be neglected
	
Desperate cries of Jaffnas fishermen demanding solutions to issues connected to their industry continue to echo despite the Government reducing the price of kerosene toRs 70 per letre.

The price reduction in kerosene came as the result of lengthy protests by these fishermen who have time and again complained that there is intrusion into their profession by outsiders, especially Indian fishermen. 
Given that this is a country where people have to stage protests to obtain even some of their basic rights, this small win by the fisherfolk must be lauded. It was heartening to see that the Jaffna fisher community-represented by the Jaffna District Fisheries Organization-also received the support of Jaffna Private Bus Owners Association, Students of Jaffna University, Trishaw operators and Jaffna Traders Association during these protests. 
But this win, which will help them cut costs in their business, doesnt solve their biggest grievance. Since the war against Rebel Tiger separatists ended in 2009 these fishermen have been complaining about Indian trawlers encroaching into their waters. 
The large Indian trawlers present in Sri Lankan waters force the islanders using small boats to move away and fish in shallow waters. 
The northern fishermen also complain about the Indian fishermen using illegal fishing equipment and also netting sea cucumbers, a product that grows in the sea and is legitimately theirs. 
These fishermen are also displeased with the illegal tents that have been put up in some areas by migrant fishermen. There are also concerns about the destruction of fisheries resources by these migrant fishermen. 
This problem where Indian trawlers enter Sri Lankan waters has a long history. In 1970 a maritime boundary spanning 463 km was agreed upon by both states. But Indian fishermen still consider Sri Lankan waters as their fishing grounds. The migrant Indian fishermen have found strength for their activities in Sri Lankan waters largely because of the support they have from the leaders of the Tamil Nadu State Government. The late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Dr. J. Jayalalithaa championed their cause, but what stood in good stead for Sri Lanka was the non-committal stance taken by the Indian Government. 
For the record the two Navies and the Indian Coastal Guards patrol the region. But it seems that a solution to this problem can be brought about only through a change in laws. 
In 2011 the two Governments set up a joint working group. But the Tamil Nadu State Government often makes claims of incidents and attacks featuring the Sri Lanka Navy during which Indian fishermen have become victims. The Tamil Nadu politicians maintain that these waters that the Indians fish in are traditional fishing waters.
 
Indian trawlers cruising along the Southern Indian fishing ports Rameshwaran and Nagampadam use the Sri Lankan waters. These fishermen also head to Palk Bay, known for its rich fishing grounds. 
What the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) must fathom is that it needs to look into the grievances of its own fishermen with the view of strengthening them. 
This is a time when China is hell-bent on expanding its authority in the sea and has competition from India. Sri Lankans are quite aware of the interest that these two nations have shown in getting involved in development work in the island. 
GoSL should under no circumstance neglect its Northern fishermen and take its eyes away from the waters they fish in. This is because the war is over and the Sri Lanka Navy should maintain its vigil on the Northern sea 24X7. 
The Northern fishermen felt let down by the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, a constituent part of the Tamil National Alliance, in their struggle to find solutions to existing problems in the fishing sector. Its Leader Mavai Senathirajah seemed unwelcome when he tried to join the fisherfolk who were protesting. 
In this backdrop the Northern fisherfolk have found some solace to their problem thanks to the GoSL and not Tamil politicians. This augurs well for the future because the GoSL working closely with the Tamil community is so important in the reconciliation process.

73.4% of children between 1 and 14 subjected to corporal punishment in SL: UNICEF
	
About 73.4% per cent of children aged one to fourteen experience corporal punishment at home by parents in Sri Lanka, the UNICEF Sri Lanka said yesterday.
Issuing a statement, it said only 48.7% of three to five-year olds in Sri Lanka attend pre-school, which when of good quality helps to foster cognitive and language development, social competency and emotional development.
It said an estimate 17% of children under five are at risk of poor development due to stunted growth, resulting from poor nutrition and 15.1% of children under five are suffering from wasting (low weight for height) which if untreated can lead to chronic malnutrition.
Children in Sri Lanka are at risk of entering adulthood at a disadvantage to their peers, because they have not benefited from the good nutrition, stimulation and protection - known as eat, play and love - that enable a brain to grow to its full capacity by the age of 5 years, warned UNICEF.
The statement said advances in neuroscience have proved that during the early years of life a childs brain grows at an astounding rate which is never again repeated.
A childs brain grows and develops to 85 per cent of its full capacity by the age of 5. In these early years brain development depends on good nutrition, play and stimulation in the home environment and in preschools and love and protection from harm including violence, abuse and neglect. These can be provided by parents through simple actions, and can make a lasting, positive difference to a childs development, UNICEF said.
Meanwhile, marking the run up to Fathers Day (17th June), UNICEF said it has launched a new digital campaign to celebrate and inform parents how they can support their childrens optimal brain development.
UNICEF Sri Lanka representative Tim Sutton said the first five years of life are absolutely critical to a childs whole future.
This means that if we dont enable every child to reach their full brain capacity by age five, we are robbing them, and Sri Lanka of its most valuable resource  the brains of its next generation. At present, too many children are at risk of entering adulthood at a disadvantage. Thankfully, parents can make all the difference. Through eat, play and love they have the power transform their childs future, he said.
To ensure that every child under 5, irrespective of their wealth or location can benefit from at least one year of quality pre-school, giving them the best possible chance to succeed in school and life, UNICEF has launched an online petition at www.unicef.lk/eatplaylove, open to all that will be presented to decision makers in the future. We urge all to sign.

One Indian, 2 locals nabbed: PNB seizes Rs.24 mn worth Kerala Ganja in Welisara
	
An attempt to transport a large stock of Kerala Ganja worth over Rs.24 million from Mannar to Colombo was thwarted by Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) sleuths in Welisara this evening.
The PNB on information searched a small lorry that was transporting the cannabis in the pretext of carrying fish from Mannar and apprehended three men who were also in the vehicle.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily Mirror the stock was believed to be containing over 200 kilogrammes of ganja, which was still being weighed at the time this edition went to press.
Amongst the arrested suspects were an Indian national and two locals residing in Pesalai in Mannar.
The suspects had reportedly left Mannar today early morning and were bound for an unknown location in Colombo, where the narcotics were suspected to be delivered to a secret third party.
SP Gunasekara said the bundles of neatly wrapped ganja had carefully been concealed among Rigifoam boxes containing fish immersed in ice.
The stock of Kerala Ganja is suspected to have arrived in the country through a sea route connecting between a South Indian location and Talaimannar, where mostly the drug smuggling is carried out.
Kerala Ganja, which is considered as an Indian variety of cannabis is presently holds a underground market value of Rs.120, 000 a kilo, SP Gunasekara said.
PNB is conducting investigations on the instructions of Police Chief IGP Pujith Jayasundara and Senior DIG M R Latiff in charge of Range Police Special Task Force (STF), Crime and PNB.
All three suspects are being detained for further interrogation. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Plan your diet and prevent  kidney stones
	

Among urinary disorders the formation of stones is the most prominent type of disease in our country. A large population of the country suffers from kidney stones which are formed due to the deposition of calcium, phosphates and oxalates. Presently, the incidences of kidney stones are rising in urban societies due to changes in lifestyle and dietary patterns.


Formation of kidney stones
When calcium oxalate concentration is four times higher than the normal solubility, a crystal starts to form. In low urine volume, the presence of high calcium and high oxalate, increase the super saturation of calcium oxalate. Citrate in the urine forms soluble complex with urinary calcium. If urine has low citrate concentration super saturated calcium oxalate is promoted to form calcium oxalate stones. If urine pH is > 6.5, proportion of divalent and trivalent ions are increased then super saturated calcium phosphate is favourable. The levels of urinary super saturation of the different solutes determine the specific types of stones.


Types of stones
Approximately 70-80% of kidney stones are calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate; 10% struvite; 10% of uric acid; and less than 1% are cysteine. However, according to the research studies, approximately 86% of renal stones in Sri Lanka are occupied by Calcium Oxalate stone.

1Calcium oxalate stones- This is the most common type of kidney stone experienced by males. They tend to form when the urine is acidic. Some of the oxalate in urine is produced by the body. Calcium and oxalate in the diet make a significant contribution toward the formation of this kind of stone, but these are not the only factors that aid the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Dietary oxalate is an organic molecule found in many vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Calcium from bone may also play a role in the formation of kidney stones.

2Calcium phosphate stones-  These stones are common in females than in males. Calcium phosphate stones tend to form when the urine is alkaline.
3 Uric acid stones  This is a common type of kidney stone that forms in both males and females. It is more likely to form when the urine is persistently acidic. At a urinary pH of less than 5.5, uric acid is poorly soluble. A diet rich in animal protein, due to its high purine content, produces uric acid in its catabolism which may increase the risk of forming uric acid stones.

4 Struvite stones  They are referred to as triple phosphate stones or infection stones. These stones result from the presence of upper urinary tract infections with urease-producing bacteria. The bacterial urease is essential for the development of struvite stones since it leads to an elevation in ammonium, carbonate and urinary pH all at the same time. And given this situation, phosphate combines with ammonium, magnesium and carbonate to form a stone composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite.

5 Cystine stones- These stones form equally in males and females, although males are more severely affected. Cystine stones are a result of a rare genetic disorder that causes cysteine an amino acid; one of the building blocks of protein to leak through the kidneys and into the urine to form crystals.

Risk factors for Kidney stones
1. Family history
2. Dehydration
3. Certain diets
4. Obesity
5. Digestive disease and surgery (Ex: inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea and gastric bypass surgery can cause the absorbing of calcium and water)
6Other medical conditions (Ex: renal tubular acidosis, production of amino acids and cysteine in the kidneys and bladder, urinary tract infection and the increased production of parathyroid hormones level in blood)


How does diet influence the formation of kidney stones
Diet is one of the most prominent factors which plays a significant role in the formation of kidney stones. Our body uses food for energy and tissue repair and afterwards the waste products in the bloodstream are carried to the kidneys and excreted as urine. Certain food creates waste that may form crystals in the urinary tract. In some people, the crystals grow into stones.


1Certain beverages
Soft drinks have increased the risk of stone formation due to effects of glucose and fructose on increasing urinary oxalate. Some researchers have reported that drinking 2 Litres of regular cola increased urinary oxalate. Regular tea, both black and green tea, also contains substantial amounts of oxalate while herbal tea has much lower oxalate contents. In addition to that, high consumption of grapefruit juice is associated with increased risk of kidney stones in both men and women because certain research studies have proved that drinking of 240 ml of grapefruit juice three times per day increased urinary oxalate from 41 to 52 mg/dl.


2Salts in the diet
When excreted the sodium in salt by the kidneys, causes more calcium to be excreted into the urine. High concentrations of calcium in the urine combine with oxalate and phosphorus to form stones. Some food (Ex: hot dogs, processed frozen food, fast food etc.) have such large amounts of sodium that a single serving provides a high amount of the daily intake.


3Animal protein
Animal proteins such as meat, eggs and fish contain purines, which break down into uric acid in the urine. Food that are especially rich in purines like animal liver fall in this protein category. People who are suffering from uric acid stones should limit their meat consumption to recommended daily intake. Nondairy animal proteins may also increase the risk of calcium stones by increasing calcium excretion and reducing the citrate excretion into the urine. Citrate prevents kidney stones while the acid in animal protein reduces the citrate in urine.


4Dietary calcium
Calcium in the digestive tract binds to oxalate from food and keeps it from entering the blood, and then the urinary tract, where it can form stones. People who are suffering from calcium oxalate stones should limit their daily calcium intake. A cup of low-fat milk contains 300mg of calcium. Other dairy products such as yogurt are also high in calcium. Some research studies indicate that calcium supplements increase the risk of forming calcium oxalate stones.


5Dietary oxalate
Some of the oxalate in urine is made by our body. But the consumption of certain foods (spinach, wheat bran, nuts etc.), which are high in oxalate, can increase the amount of oxalate in the urine, where it combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate stones. Consuming food which contains calcium also reduces oxalate in the urine. Calcium binds oxalate in the digestive tract so it is not excreted into the urine.


6Food supplements
Food supplements containing vitamin C or D may contribute to the formation of stones. Vitamin C can be converted into oxalate by our body. Calcium supplements should be taken with meals, so the calcium can bind with the oxalate in food.

In conclusion, kidney stones are a major threat to our society due to unhealthy feeding habits and questionable lifestyles. There are 05 major types of kidney stones when getting to know about kidney stone types. This information is helpful to determine what kind of dietary changes may be needed for the individual. The diet is a prominent factor which can effect the formation of kidney stones. Other than diet, body weight, alcohol consumption and certain medicines also make significant contribution toward the formation of kidney stones. The most important factor is the daily consumption of water.
The consumption of enough water has a higher affinity to minimize the formation of kidney stones.

## Title: Political Ifthars and Rajapaksa hunt for Muslim vote

Political Ifthars and Rajapaksa hunt for Muslim vote
	

The Rajapaksas, who ruled the roost in the country some three years ago are seen now luring the Muslims, especially by appearing at Ifthar events, the events organised by various Muslim and non-Muslim groups for the Muslims to break their Ramadan fast.
Large gatherings of Ifthar, which should be meant for helping the poor to break their fast, are becoming frequent events with increasing political colouring.
However, going by this years Ifthar events attended by the Rajapaksas, one can argue that it is the various Muslim groups that are eager to associate with Rajapaksas, rather than the latter going behind the former.
Two Ifthar functions held recently and attended by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, an official much hated by the Muslims three years ago, had drawn much attention of the electronic and print media in all three languages. And the Rajapaksas were seen making use of the events to the hilt.
The interest shown by Rajapaksas and the Muslims in each other these days is not without reasons.

Despite some Muslim organizations have started to approach the Rajapaksas, the question remains whether Muslims at the grassroots level have changed their mind to support Rajapaksas

The former had started to show their keenness in getting along with Muslims in late 2016, which was first indicated by a meeting convened by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with his Muslim friends, where he assured the safety and security of Muslims in a future Government led by him.
Some Muslim groups new found love for Rajapaksas can largely be attributed to the outcome of the February 10 Local Government Elections, at which the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party unofficially led by the former President swept the electorate.
The SLPP came first in 231 out of 340 Local Councils for which elections were held. (Election for one council was suspended on legal grounds.)
The two main political parties in the Government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) on which the Muslims reposed their total trust until the recent anti-Muslim riots in Ampara and Kandy Districts, suffered a humiliating defeat at these elections.
The UNP came first in only 41 councils and the SLFP, which contested for some LG bodies under the symbol of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) was able to defeat the other parties only in around 10 councils.
The erosion of the UNP vote bank was incredible. The party that defeated the then undivided SLFP, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, bagging around five million votes at the 2015 August Parliamentary Election, lost about 1.5 million votes at the Local Government Elections.
In spite of the two coalition partners in the Government managed to collectively get more votes and seats in an overall perspective, it is the number of councils that are being dominated by each party that matters in deciding the winner.

They made a very serious blunder in calculation after the war victory, where they thought they could win all future national level elections without the support of the minorities
Thus the SLPP became the dominant party in all 17 Sinhalese dominated districts in the country.
It is obvious that the Local Government Election-results brought to the surface the political trend that had gradually been created for the past three years as an undercurrent, among the people in the Sinhalese dominated 17 districts.
With the two ruling parties wasting time in fighting each other while having no tangible economic or political programme to win over the voters in the rest of their tenure and the UNP, the main party in the Government having tarnished its image with the Central Bank Bond Scandal, one cannot expect the trend to turn.
Yes, a comeback by the Rajapaksas in 2020 is most likely in the eyes of the general public.
It is in the light of this likelihood one has to understand some Muslim groups interest in the Rajapaksas.
Both genuine aspirations, as well as mere opportunism, could be inferred as the driving force behind this interest.
There are leaders of Muslim organisations who are seriously concerned about the safety and security of their community and they feel the necessity of a dialogue and interaction with the possible future leaders of the country.
Also, it is not a naysay that there may be people, who attempt to develop a rapport with the possible future rulers, with the sole purpose of gaining political or economic mileage, using the cravings of the Rajapaksas to win the hearts and minds of minorities.
There may also be another group, who are frustrated with the Government due to its inaction in general and particularly owing to its lethargic attitude during the recent anti-Muslim riots.
This was the backdrop against which Gotabaya Rajapaksa was invited for an Ifthar event in Beruwala, ironically one of three adjacent areas that came under attack by extremist groups in June 2013, during Gotabaya Rajapaksas tenure as Defence Secretary under his brother, President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Large crowds attended the event and Rajapaksa was awarded a colourful welcome before he made an inspiring speech. As his brother did in 2016, the ex-Defence Secretary assured to the gathering the safety and security of Muslims under a future Rajapaksa Government.
Gotabaya might have been preferred over his brother in this event and in another such event held at a luxury hotel in Colombo in the light of his recent activities, which point to a preparation for the next Presidential Election.
He has formed an organization called Eliya (Light) and held a very successful seminar under the theme Viyath Maga at the Shangri- La Hotel in Colombo where he elaborated on his economic vision.
However, Gotabaya Rajapaksa seems to be in the plan B of the Joint Opposition as their main concern has been to create a situation where the Parliamentary Election would be held first.
According to Plan A, Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to be the next Premier who might manipulate the situation so that he would be able to ascend to the Presidency after re-amending the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
Whether it is Plan A or B, Rajapaksas critically need the support of the minorities.
They made a very serious blunder in calculation after the war victory, where they thought they could win all future national level elections without the support of the minorities.
They arrived at this wrong conclusion in the light of the 2010 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections but only to wake up to the reality with their humiliating defeat in 2015.
In an interview with the Japan Times during a visit to Japan in 2016 former President Rajapaksa confessed that he was defeated as the Muslims who constitute around 10 per cent of the population did not support him. He had told this in several local media as well.
Yet, despite some Muslim organizations having started to approach the Rajapaksas, the question remains whether Muslims at the grassroots level have changed their mind to support Rajapaksas.
It is not clear if they have forgotten the last three years of the Rajapaksa regime when they were harassed by various extremist groups with the apparent support of some Ministers of the Government.
Muslims for reasons - real as well as perceived - strongly believed then that those groups had the blessings of the top leaders of the Government.
It must be recalled that it was the ordinary Muslims dissociated themselves from Rajapaksa regime before their leaders did so, after these unpleasant happenings.
Hence, Rajapaksas must develop a mechanism to address the ordinary people, not necessarily the leaders, in a convincing manner, if they were serious about a lasting support of the Muslims.

## Title: Problems associated with slow growth

Problems associated with slow growth
	

Growth of a child in the first few years after birth is of crucial importance. This is because any defect in growth, during this period, will have a lasting impact throughout his life. Delaying of growth can be due to multiple causes, many of which are correctable with no lasting harmful effects. Thats of course if they are identified early. In todays Health Capsule, we have consulted Dr. Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician at Apeksha Hospital Maharagama, regarding growth retardation in young children.


Monitoring growth
A childs weight, height and the circumference of the head are the main determinants of its growth up to the age of two years. After the baby can stand on its own, length is replaced with height in medical calculations. Initially, the weight and the height should be monitored monthly, and in the case of growth retardation, which is usually referred to as failure to thrive, the underlying cause should be investigated in order to take corrective measures. All these values are dotted in the Child Health Development Record (CHDR), and monitored for any slopes in the rate of the childs growth, explained Dr. Perera.

Malnutrition
Malnutrition is one of the major causes for growth retardation, explained the doctor. This can happen due to deficiency of major or minor nutrients that the body requires. Major nutrients are proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. Minor nutrients are vitamins A, B, C, D, E, K and minerals Iron, Zinc, Calcium and Iodine.
The group of conditions that occur due to the deficiency of major nutrients, especially protein, in childhood, is called Protein - Energy Malnutrition. If there are lower amounts of protein in the body than required, the child usually gets swelling in the body. If the baby doesnt get adequate calories in the form of carbohydrates or lipids, this will cause muscle wasting as the body will try to produce energy by breaking off muscle proteins. Both of these will impair weight gain, and in some cases there will be loss of weight. If the malnutrition continues for a long time, causing chronic malnutrition, the child may see its height being stunted. This means that he will be short for his age. In the condition called acute chronic malnutrition, where the child is having unresolved malnourishment issues, which lasts for a long duration until the present, both his height and weight will be impaired.

A childs weight, height and the circumference of the head are the main determinants of its growth up to the age of two years

Other causes
When asked whether malnutrition is the only cause for growth retardation in children, he answered in the negative. He explained that a delay in growth can be due to a variety of underlying factors or a collection of multiple etiologies. Growth retardation in children of less than two years may be due to thyroxin deficiency. This condition, in which the hormone thyroxin, which is a major contributor to a childs growth and development, is inadequately secreted due to the absence or the malfunction of the thyroid gland since birth, is called congenital hypothyroidism.
After two years, height gain will be affected if the growth hormone is deficient. In any age, iron deficiency can cause growth retardation. Genetic or congenital diseases like Dwarfism, Turners syndrome which has abnormal growth and development will naturally have abnormal growth parameters when compared with other children of the same age.
But short stature or reduced weight is not always due to an underlying cause, explained the doctor. Sometimes, the child will be small due to his genetic conditioning. But to come to this conclusion, other underlying causes of growth retardation need to be excluded first.

Mental growth
Another important area that needs attention when it comes to childhood growth and development is the mental growth of a child. Mental retardation can again happen due to nutritional deficiencies like iron deficiency, congenital causes like congenital hypothyroidism and in some genetic disease conditions like Downs syndrome. Psychological stimulation also plays a crucial role in mental development of a child, stresses the doctor. Parental disharmony, minimized interaction with the child, also can affect a childs mental growth negatively, he explained.

Maintaining CHDR
In the CHDR, where the childs growth parameters are charted, there are specific colour coded zones that represent the average weight, height parametres of the general population of that age. When it comes to weight, green zone is the average weight range of the majority of population. Red zone is considered underweight while the purple zone is overweight. Charting is usually done by the Public Health Midwife.
When charting a childs weight, Dr. Perera advises the parents to seek medical advice if the progression of the chart becomes unusual. For an example, a child suddenly losing weight or not gaining adequate weight after around 6 months of age may be due to some defect in the way of how his complementary feeding is carried out. Certain other chronic illnesses like frequent urinary tract infections, congenital heart disease or poorly controlled asthma or low blood hemoglobin can also cause poor weight gain and sloping of the growth line in the chart. By seeking early medical advice, any underlying cause can be identified early and corrective measures can be taken. Further investigations like FBC, urine cultures, blood thyroxin levels ultrasound scans and CT scans may be needed to confirm the cause.

After two years, height gain will be affected if the growth hormone is deficient. In any age, iron deficiency can cause growth retardation

Over nutrition
Over nutrition can be dangerous too, advises the doctor, stressing that it can lead to health issues like hypertension, diabetes and joint problems later in life, and advises parents to seek medical help in case of children being overweight or obese. Weighting a child at the allocated frequency for the childs age, maintaining the CHDR, and getting medical help in case of a child not gaining adequate weight or having unexplained loss of weight is very important in maintaining the healthy growth and development of a child, he concluded.

Summit of the century: Will there be substance from the showpiece
	
Commenting on the meeting between the United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, most analysts said they had to pinch themselves to realise that what they were witnessing was real. As if he was responding to these shocked analysts, the North Korean leader told Trump this was not any fantasy or science fiction. Such was the significance of the believe-it-or-not political event on Tuesday in the Singaporean island of Sentosa, which means peace and tranquillity in Malay.
Yes, what seemed only a few months ago impossible has happened. Just a few months ago, the two leaders were heaping insults on each other.
The Singapore summit is now a landmark in post World War II history, perhaps rivalled only by US president Richard Nixons meeting with Chinese leader Mao Zedong in 1972.
But wait a minute. It is too early to proclaim that peace will dawn soon over the Korean Peninsula, ending 65 years of hostility. The path ahead is paved with many a hurdle. But before that, a little bit of history:
The Korean War that began on June 25, 1950 has not technically ended, though the parties to the war have been observing a truce since July 1953. The war ended with no clear victor, but the moral victory belonged to North Korea. It could have won the war, if the United States had not entered the war in support of the South.
Although North Korea has been portrayed as an evil state by the United States, which itself is being accused of committing war crimes, North Koreas eternal leader Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the present leader, was a visionary. Within three years after the then cold war politics divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1948 into the Soviet-and-China backed North and the US-backed South, Kim Il-sung made North Korea a prosperous state through a series of socialist economic reforms. In 1950, North Korea invaded the South with the ambition of uniting the two Koreas and liberating the southern peasants.
With a series of rapid gains, the North Korean troops reached Pusan, the southernmost tip of Korea. The US forces, under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, who was also overseeing the post-WWII occupation of Japan, held off the North Koreans at Pusan. Meanwhile, manipulating the UN Security Council and misleading the Soviet delegation, the US worked out an international intervention force to enter the war. This turned the tide. In three years of war, the US forces and allied troops almost annihilated North Korea, wiping out 20 percent of its population. But the direct intervention of China at the last stages of the war, helped work out a truce and restore the 38th parallel ceasefire line which has since been the de facto border between the two Koreas.
Since then, the North Koreans have been looking at the US as an enemy, responsible for their misfortunes.
Yet, at the summit, Kim Jong-un, now being honourably referred to as by the US President as Chairman Kim, told Trump: It has not been easy to come to this point. For us the past has been holding us back, and old practices and prejudices have been covering our eyes and ears, but we have been able to overcome everything.
Easier said than done. If a half days summit could cut a key from seven decades of animosity to open the door to peace, it will be a world wonder, though some may say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. True, the ice has been broken. But, the question is: Has the thawing process begun
The Singapore summit is not a kiss-and-make-up affair. Both Trump and Kim are hard nuts. The summit appeared to be a battle of wits  a battle, according to Trump-thrashing US media, Kim has won. Against the backdrop of handshakes, pats on the backs and diplomatic niceties, the air of mutual suspicion and one-upmanship was perceptible to the discerning mind. The looks from the corner of the eyes -- especially those which Kim secretly and quickly cast on Trump --and the vaguely worded post-summit communiqus symbolised the undercurrents. Kim has pledged to work for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula while Trump has given security guarantees. There was little or nothing concrete and specific.
The pledges contained in the communiqu are nothing new; similar pledges were made during the six-party talks in 2005, only to be broken even before the ink dried. Hours after the summit ended, the two sides upped the ante, giving different interpretations. North Korea on Wednesday interpreted what it had agreed in Singapore as a step-by-step denuclearisation process subject to conditions.
Though, the US side took no decision to immediately lift the economic sanctions on North Korea, the survival of the summits momentum depends on concessions each side will make. As far as North Korea is concerned, lifting of the sanctions is a top priority. Now who will make the first move
By pointing at last months dismantling of the nuclear test site facility, North Korea may insist that it has already taken the first step. It may now urge the US to lift at least a few sanctions. But following a meeting with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said yesterday North Korea would not see any economic sanctions lifted until it had demonstrated complete denuclearisation.
The Pompeo comments were in sharp contrast to sentiments expressed by Twitter-happy Trump. Upon returning home, he tweeted, Just landed -- a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.
The contents of the tweet indicate that Trump is more concerned about his domestic vote base than international peace. The Singapore summit has raised his stocks among his supporters. They say he has displayed courage to do what other US presidents have shunned to do. He took a similar hardline position at last weeks G7 summit in Canada where he stood by his America first policy, despite pressure from his G7 allies to relax tariffs and trade terms.
The Singapore and Canada adventures may help Trump face reelection with confidence in 2020, but his posturing does not make him a man of peace. His Jerusalem move  shifting the US embassy to Jerusalem in breach of international law  was certainly not what a peace-loving leader would do.
North Korea is not nave to give away its strategic weapons for a few billion dollars or onTrumps assurance to scrap US war games with South Korea, unless the gains are much more than the losses. The stakes are high. North Korea gets all the respects because of its nukes. It will continue to play hardball with the Trump administration. At the same time, it is desperate to improve its economy.
The US-North Korea summit cannot be seen as rapprochement because it comes at a time when the US-China cold war is seen to be intensifying in the Indo-Pacific region. With China being North Koreas only trusted ally, Pyongyang is unlikely to move into unchartered waters with the US, abandoning the lifeline China has been offering it.

(Daily Mail), 14 June 2018-The UN General Assembly on Wednesday adopted by a strong majority of 120 countries an Arab-backed resolution condemning Israel for Palestinian deaths in Gaza and rejected a US bid to blame Hamas for the violence. The resolution deplores Israels use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force against Palestinian civilians and calls for protection measures for Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

UN HR Chief calls for probe into Kashmir abuses
	

The UN Human Rights Chief on Thursday called for a major investigation into abuses in Kashmir, as his office released its first-ever report on violations committed by both India and Pakistan in the disputed territory. Zeid Raad Al Hussein said he would urge the Human Rights Council, which opens a new session next week, to consider establishing a Commission of Inquiry (COI) to conduct a comprehensive independent international investigation into allegations of human rights violations in Kashmir. A COI is one of the UNs highest-level probes, generally reserved for major crises like the Syrian conflict.

The UN report, which is particularly critical of India, highlights chronic impunity for violations committed by security forces. 
Indias foreign ministry rejected the report, blasting it as fallacious and tendentious. However Islamabad welcomed Zeids request for a probe, saying in a statement that it was consistent with Pakistans several calls to this effect since 2016. The findings, described as the first-of-its-kind for Kashmir, come after months of deadly clashes along the border that divides Kashmir into zones of Indian and Pakistani control. 
The findings accused Indian troops of being responsible for some 145 unlawful killings, far surpassing the 20 people estimated to have been killed by militant groups during that period.

Waiting for Development
	

We have initiated as a Government an impartial development programme this country needs. As we have already initiated Gramashakthi National Movement, in a few weeks we would initiate the Gamperaliya Development Programme, that would include all Grama Niladhari Divisions in Lanka, said President Maithripala Sirisena in an advertisement aired a few days ago in the Sinhala Channel of Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.
The Prime Minister has also been talking of development both in Parliament and outside on numerous occasions.

A complete breakaway and go after new and clean Presidential candidates-none is possible within this free market economy
The term development perhaps is the most hacked term both in English and Sinhala languages, after socialism faded off from vogue in recent decades.
Maybe it is less so in the Tamil language, for during the past 30 years and more, they were caught in a brutal conflict that did not allow the Tamil society to know what development is, other than development of the armed conflict.
Meanwhile, in the Sinhala South, though every Government promises development, it still remains as elusive as Yahapalanya of the present (dis)unity Government.
The irony is, though starved of development that is promised at every election, as I discussed in my article last week, there is no mention of development in the mad search for a 2020 Presidential candidate either.
Thrown about quite freely by both politicians and economists, there is no explanation or definition given to what development is.
At most, one would know of development that is talked of, is restricted to the two word attributive adjective socio-economic. That does not lead us to any complete and real understanding of what development is, in this unrestricted free market economy.
What is nevertheless meant by innuendo is that with development comes more money and better buying power.
But for whom is yet another important question that is vaguely answered or left out without answering.
It is always economics and money that is discussed as development in Neo-Liberal economies.
It is all about measuring economic growth with the growth of the urban middle-class. This urban growth that comes with expanding and increasing consumer choice has turned people into consumers with an insatiable appetite.

Life is slipping through a cesspit of errors and follies, wholly created by inept political leadership still revered by the majority of the Sinhala Buddhist urban middle-class, sponsored by the filthy rich
Chasing after they have made most urbanites sick and living on a dozen pills a day for more than half their lives.
That again has been turned into a peripheral but lucrative industry in urban middle-class life with fitness centres mushrooming and a very health conscious urban population creating one of the most profitable private sector industry; the private curative health sector dominated by the medical profession.
None discusses all that as ailments of this unrestricted free market economy.
Apart from the growth of this mostly sick urban middle-class, development is talked in terms like, per capita income, inflation, GDP, a balance of payments, increase in exports over imports etc. and with year on year comparisons.
The addition of the Eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) that range from halving extreme poverty rates to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education have not solved any major issues; people in the world have been struggling with, in this Neo-Liberal world.
Their extension in 2016 as 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will not mean anything more to the poor in this world. In Sri Lanka, they are not mentioned even in passing by the leaders of this Government in any of their development programmes or statements.
As argued many times before, free-market economy not only provides space for majoritarian extremism and is inherently corrupt; it is also a wholly city-centric consumer market.
Therefore development is reduced to a growth of a market economy that thrives with urban life and is measured accordingly on economic data per se.
This leaves out the larger majority of the rural society and the urban poor.
Poor also has a much-distorted count in national data. Poverty line drawn every month and has a national average was calculated as Rs. 4,532 for 2018 April and is said to be enough for a person to fulfil the basic needs during the whole month, according to the Department of Census and Statistics (DC&S).
The not-so-implied-assumption is that a family of four with two adults earning a total of Rs. 9,064 per month in April, is not a poor family in Sri Lanka.
The contradiction is, this same DC&S in its 2016 Household Income and Expenditure survey calculates the percentage of income spent on food as 34.8 per cent and would, therefore, mean, a family just above the poverty line would live with Rs.3,154 for food in a single month.
This thus raises the serious issue, what is poverty
Is it simply about how much a person or a family earns to live with Rs.3,154 spent on food per month
If that is the income necessary to keep a family above the poverty line, Sri Lanka should be the cheapest country on this planet to live in.
It was 64 years ago in 1954 Darrel Huff, a journalist authored the bestselling book on statistics titled How to lie with Statistics.
Huff tells us how all these numbers, pie charts and bar charts are used to paint fantasies.
Talk about the reduction of poverty and about economic growth. In this Sri Lankan, free market economy poverty is now said to have dropped to 5.4 per cent.
To break off from all this Neo-Liberal jargon on development we need to redefine poverty and development.
Poverty is not about how much money a family should earn to meet their meagre food budget. Poverty is about the poor quality of life and development is about creating access and space for continuous improvement in living a quality life.
Apart from adequate food with a minimum required nourishment, decent housing with basic facilities, health, education, cost of daily commuting and clothing, a decent human life is also about recreation and right to cultural engagement as individuals and collectively as a community.
Development therefore is about planning to provide people access to such socio-economic and cultural life without inequalities. Without discriminations in opportunities and without any bias or partiality on gender, caste, age, geographical location, religion or ethnic differences.
The most unpredictable and hard to think issue in Sri Lanka is, how and who would initiate such policy and programme. In a recent Tweet that I got engaged with, Prof. Siri Hettige stressed the need for planning development.
Which Govt. institution in Sri Lanka should initiate and lead a programme on the development and implementation of strategic plans for all State institutions
This I guess can be done within months he tweeted. The fault line there was his stress on Government institutions. What we fail to understand is that 40 years of this unrestricted free market dynamics have not only eroded the quality of the politician and his political party but has also corroded the finer mettle in our professional services.
Together, all of them have become unseen drivers of extremely corrupt regimes, whatever face and name are given to a Government.
State institutions, therefore, have no creative, intellectual and independent resources left with them.
They have Neo-Liberal experts, specialists, consultants and administrators, expected to keep the system going in tow with IMF, World Bank, ADB thinking.
For that expertise, they are well cared for within this system. That is how statistics are used as Darrel Huff explains, to paint that elusive development picture the people are told can be achieved.
Thus no State Institute or Agency would ever begin a new discourse in defining poverty and development that needs to break off from the diatribe on free-market capitalism and socialism.
Nor is there a political leadership capable of such intellectual discourse.
Despite the PhDs, LLBs and Attorneys-at-Law, CIM and CIMA professionals, Medical Doctors and other professionals, what they in Parliament are capable of is well exhibited every time the Parliament is convened.
Sadly, the Universities too dont intellectually function as Universities should.
The responsibility for this new discourse in first defining poverty and development and then framing a National Development Policy Paper for public debate and discussion thus falls on those who want an end to this socioeconomic and political tragedy.
It becomes the responsibility of those who are willing to accept, life in Sri Lanka is slipping through a cesspit of errors and follies, wholly created by inept political leadership still revered by the majority of the Sinhala Buddhist urban middle-class and is sponsored by the filthy rich, thats growing within this free market economy.
It needs a complete breakaway from comfort zones that make noise over mega corruption and go after new and clean Presidential candidates.

None is possible within this free market economy.

Why carry the white mans baby at cricket
	
		
			ICCs rules to restrict the movements of players outside the field might see fans distancing themselves from their cricket heroes
			
		
I walked in to witness the first days play of the Test Match at Trinidads Queens Park Oval, after flying 23 hours, from Colombo. I was directed to the Gerry Gomes Press Box merging with the colors of the Caribbean sky.
A voice unknown boomed with an assuring Hi Gomin, here are your papers threw a tag at my direction while I searched for the passport to prove my credentials. The big man, who was a towering 6 feet and 8 inches tall, bellowed, We know all about you, Man, dont bother anymore. The West Indian cricket administration looks tough and talks rough, but anyone of its officials is as gracious as the lady dressed in purdah. These officials, leading the journalists to the Press Box, are the kindest and friendliest of all! 
A few days ago, since my passport was stuck in the British High Commission in Chennai, the West Indian Cricket Authorities had only a photograph sent by theDailymirror Editor to help me get accreditation. Therefore they had flashed my Googled image around the grounds for identification purposes and to make entry easy. Most officials at the Oval knew me as a lawyer than a freshly incarnated cricket correspondent- a title of small value in Sri Lanka. However this is a label that takes a person a longer distance in the Windies. Ironically in the Windward Isle of Saint Lucia working on the Google/Yahoo introductions had bloated me high. It also helped me earn an honourary visa at the the point of arrival, unannounced. 

Meeting Gurusinghe

I made arrangements with Asanka Gurusinghe (Manager) - we had never met in person before- speaking terms on telephone via Mohan De Silvas kind intervention. We later caught up on events over a meal in Trinidad  talking not necessary on cricket. 

In the Press Box I was informed by the West Indies Press that they had complied with the regulations to the full, whether lawful or otherwise on matters of human rights

When I went to extend the invitation during play to the players enclosure a foreign white guy, holding out to be from the ICC corruption outfit told me politely to step back. I duly complied with the request and notified him the purpose of my mission. Asanka came out and informed from a distance, to the hearing of the white gentleman, that he cannot speak to the Press. Here was I wearing the press tag and identified as a representative of theDailymirror and not as one of the black sharks. Fair enough, went back to the Press Box thinking of safeguards employed by the ICC to save young cricketers from the betting community. 
The next day I saw from the Press box a Lion flag fluttering in a brewers stand. I decided take a walk there and found a twosome from Sri Lanka based in Toronto/Los Angeles. They sought my assistance to take a photograph with the team in the background during the break. I undertook to seek Chandimals permission and made the request in public gaze in front of the Joey Carew stand filled with past players to the brim. Chandimal agreed to the request after my appearance was made in the full view of hundreds of spectators in the Brian Lara Stadium and not in the slimy, sly and surreptitious mode of a bookmaker. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) knows me as their lawyer during the time of Ian Pieris and Ana Punchihewa before the 1996 World Cup. 
Nevertheless the white mans burden followed me to the car park on that day. He nastily warned - not being polite this time- that if I did not stay confined to the Press box he would throw me out of the grounds after removing my badge. I told him that I am a lawyer and that infuriated him more. He probably thought that a cheeky bookmaker had sent a lawyer to stifle the ICC! 
In the Press Box I was informed by the West Indies Press that they had complied with the regulations to the full, whether lawful or otherwise on matters of human rights. I decided to lie low since there was no support forthcoming my way. 

Negative response by players

The West Indian Cricket Authority in view of the titles of my articles gave me a complimentary ticket to the stand to which the entry of darker acolytes was prohibited. On arriving at that stand I learned from the handful of Sri Lankan visitors that they had expressed dismay after our players had ignored their arrival. This was the players response to the arrival of these visitors who had travelled a great distance at high expense to cheer them. Mendis had allowed the visitors to take photographs of him, while posing alongside with them. These are acts which make cricket fans fans proud of their Sri Lankan cricketers. This team was different from the ones in the past and tried hard to disassociate themselves with the Sri Lankan expatriates. Is this the result of the work unwittingly done by the white nations under the cover of the ICC because these same cricketers are a friendly bunch at home 
A Sri Lankan lady living in the USA, who had witnessed my encounter with the ICC representatives, expressed sympathy at my misfortune of falling foul with the ICC in trying to promote goodwill towards our team!

Tamils abroad should not wait without supporting the mother country

At the time the members of the press were given an opportunity to meet the two captains, Chandimal walked away pretending not to hear me call out to him. Maybe did not hear me, but he did walk away alone prematurely. The local press did not pursue him as they had congregated around the winning skipper Jason Holder. 
I informed Gurusinghe that I wanted to speak to him as I knew he would be more expressive with a wider vocabulary at his command compared to a player. I sent him a message via an official spokesperson, our lady dean of the Press Corp. She was informed that the team meeting may take a while more and was told that there was no use waiting for it. So I left for the car park where I encountered the white man whom I previously bumped into. He heard my name being called and found out that Gurusinghe was being bold enough to respond to a call from this cub reporter from his own country. I posed Gurusinghe the questions I prepared, but warned him of possible perils and told him to exercise caution. However he responded to each prudently with wisdom. Helping is the least I can do to overcome problems, but not if the ICC keeps out proved patriotic countrymen due to brass stupidity! 

When I went to extend the invitation during play to the players enclosure a foreign white guy, holding out to be from the ICC corruption outfit told me politely to step back

He stated that players stick with the ICC guidelines. He said that some things were beyond the team management and they are helpless too. At least we have able men functioning as manager and coach and as the selector on tour. 
Are the competent authorities or the relevant minister taking necessary action to ease the suffering imposed by the ICC Some of the ICC decisions have changed the character of our cricketers. Before long they may displease their supporters and clubs and might vanish into thin air.
Are the Sinhala supporters correct in their assessment that Diaspora Tamils do not support Sri Lankan cricket teams abroad except for a few individual Tamils This is an issue for the local cricket authorities to consider because cricket is a great leveler and helps in bonding communities. Cordiality abroad can evaporate easily as the Sinhalese abroad can become bitter with time if they see support from Tamils not forthcoming. Tamils abroad should not wait without supporting the mother country when its representatives take to sport. 
There is a difference in the outlook between black and white cricketers. This is due to the actions of the ICC. It seems that the West Indians, due to proximity to the USA, are still holding a colonial mentality and loving the British. 
I will keep the public posted of the proceedings from Saint Lucia by watching the games with interest in the coming weeks. I am no mans slave here in the Caribbean.
