The Sri Lanka Air Force yesterday said it was unaware of an agreement signed with Pakistan to purchase eight JF-17 fighter jets, although Pakistan media had reported of such a move.
When contacted by the Daily Mirror, Air Force Group Captain Chandima Alwis said they were unaware of any such arrangement.
“From the side of the Sri Lanka Air Force, we have not decided as yet in this regard. And also I have not been informed of the matter. So, I don’t have any information on the matter,” he said.
He said the Air Force was reviewing a number of suitable aircraft to be purchased and that the Pakistani JF-17 fighter jet was one such fighter jet that was being looked at. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)
