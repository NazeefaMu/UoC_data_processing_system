Building, renovating or buying one’s dream home or 
land is overwhelming especially when it comes to the current market rate.
Many individuals opt for a home loan even though it is generally perceived as a tedious and time consuming process. NDB understands this and is ready to give its customers the support they need regardless of the status of their employment to purchase their dream home or apartment.
With NDB, a home loan approval can be received within just three days and can be obtained at a competitive interest rate, whether the customer is a job holder, entrepreneur or a Sri Lankan employed abroad.


Home Loans are usually granted on the approval based on legal aspects as well as the re-paying capacity which would depend on an individual’s salary.
