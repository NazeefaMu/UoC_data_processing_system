The Department of Marketing, Faculty of Management and Finance, at the University of Ruhuna, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), are engaged in a bold endeavour to organize an event, “Fish Bonanza”, with the aim of amplifying the performance of the fishing community in Matara. 
Moreover, the Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Ruhuna has extended their support to make this event a resounding success,by providing the required technology tothe entrepreneurs to produce various types of value additions to fish products. Accordingly, fortysmall scale entrepreneurs were selected and trained to add value to fish, which enabled them to innovate and introduce a new product into the market. They were also empowered with the required marketing skills which are essential in a profit seeking enterprise, to create mutually satisfactory situations for the customer as well as the entrepreneur.
Highlighting the importance of the event, Prof. H. S. C. Perera, Dean, Faculty of Management and Finance, University of Ruhuna, said: “Most of the universities in the world develop their status as entrepreneurial entities for the purpose of developing entrepreneurs who would contribute positively to the national growth of their countries. Universities should not limit their duties to teaching and research only. They should also engage in such activities as an important element of corporate social responsibility”, he further said.
A. C. Karunaratne, Head of the Department of Marketing, University of Ruhuna stated that he is very proud to be a part of this worthy project. He reiterated that it is our duty and responsibility to uplift the economic and socio-cultural standards of entrepreneurs engaged in small scale enterprises, since they have now become a major component of a country’s national growth and revenue.
Stating a fact that was prevalent in the industry, Ruwan Liyanagamage, President of SLIM said, “Even though the fish harvest is rich in the southern part of the country, the fishing community is not financially stable. They utilise traditional technology and systems in harvesting and processing, and value additions have not been given due attention. The SLIM “Fish Bonanza” gives them a great opportunity, to proactively engage in a project where their skills, knowledge and profits are enhanced, which leads them towards a sustainable livelihood”. 
Dr. Nilantha Liyanage, Head of the Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Ruhuna, who is also actively involved in this project, stated that with the initial preparatory trainings conducted by various NGOs, Agencies, and educational institutes such as SLIM, as also the University of Ruhuna, the fishing communities have begun to employ the new technologies they have learnt, which goes beyond their traditional ways and means. He admired the enthusiasm displayed by the trainees at the workshops that were conducted. He urged that this joint endeavour not stop at “Fish Bonanza” – Matara, but continue with the momentum that it gained, to the next level, which is National.
The final event of “Fish Bonanza” is scheduled to be held at the Matara beach on 5th September, where the organizers have gone “all out” to put together an event which will be unforgettable for all.
All ‘food lovers’ and ‘fish lovers’ are invited to venture on a gastronomically enticing and adventurous event, which in the style of SLIM, is unlike any other.
