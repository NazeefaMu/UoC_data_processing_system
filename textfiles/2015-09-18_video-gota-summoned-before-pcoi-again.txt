Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi giving evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate serious acts of fraud, corruption and abuse of power, state resources, and privileges said today that the proper system had not been adopted with regard to the issuing of weapons to the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited.
Commission Secretary Lacille De Silva said Mr. Hettiarachchi in his statement had told even though the approval of the Defence Ministry should have been obtained when issuing weapons, it had not been followed when issuing weapons to Rakna Lanka.
Former Defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi and Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited Chairman Victor Samaraweera were summoned to the Commission yesterday with regard to the floating armoury issue of Rakna Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited.
Mr. De Silva said evidence was recorded from Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi and Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited Chairman Victor Samaraweera from 9.a.m. yesterday.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Duminda Silva and seven others were summoned to the PCoI on Thursday with regard to the same issue and evidence was recorded from former Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Damayanthi Jayaratne and Rakna Lanka Ocean Security Unit in-charge Balasundaram Premachandra.
The Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Ms Jayaratne on Thursday accepted that proper procedure was not adopted with regard to the issuing of 3473 arms to the Rakna Lanka and that only 89 arms had proper licenses while the other 3384 arms had issues with regard to licences.
