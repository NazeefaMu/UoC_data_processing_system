Right to Information Bill to Parliament in January

The Right to Information Bill will be presented to Parliament in January, Mass media and Parliament Reforms Ministry Secretary Wajira Narampanawa said.
The right to information is enforced in several countries. It is considered as a fruitful sight of democracy. The government promised to strengthen the right to information during the 100 day programme, Narampanawa said.
He said the Right to Information Bill will have to be passed in Provincial Councils before being passed in Parliament. The Southern Provincial Council has passed the Bill. It will be presented to the Western Provincial Council on January 5.
