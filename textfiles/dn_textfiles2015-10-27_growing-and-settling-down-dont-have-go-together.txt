'Growing Up' and 'Settling Down' don't have to go Together

Gloria Steinem's fight for the equality and empowerment of women began decades ago, from her co-founding of the National Women's Political Caucus to her launch of the iconic Ms. Magazine, to her more recent honor of earning the Presidential Medal of Freedom. At 81, the feminist champion continues to travel the world, fighting for the rights of women -- and shows no signs of stopping.
Steinem's frequent travel actually began long before she became involved with women's rights. The self-described "vagabond child" spent years crisscrossing the country in the family trailer rather than attending school, as her parents considered travel to be an education. Eventually, however, Steinem rebelled against this idea.
"I, of course, wanted to be like other kids," Steinem tells Oprah during an interview for "SuperSoul Sunday." "I wanted to go to school like other kids."
As she matured, Steinem maintained this rejection of rootless wandering and instead began believing that she would someday stop and settle down. Then Steinem experienced yet another shift.
"I got rid of the myth that we're supposed to grow up and settle down -- that those two things go together," she says.
Steinem had instead realized that her own urge to settle down was far more than just the rejection of her parents' lifestyle.
"I thought I was rebelling against a traveling way of life, but really what was happening was I was finding my own and, also, something my father never did, which is making a home," she says. "My discovery is, really, that we all need both."
