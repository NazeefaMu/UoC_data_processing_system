Former JVP leader and present leader of the Janatha Sewaka Party, Somawansa Amarasinghe today said he would join with any political party or any politician including Wimal Weerawansa if they have a definite agenda to defeat ‘national challenge’ of the resolution adopted by UNHRC.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said he intends to have discussions with any politician before teaming up to defeat the investigative mechanism proposed by UNHRC resolution.
He said it is high time to create a national push against the so-called UN resolution that leads to a separate state in the country.
“We need a proper and certain agenda based on democracy and equality to defeat the UN resolution which has violated even the UN convention. This propaganda is handled by separatists because such global organisation is not supposed to adopt country-specific resolutions violating the country’s sovereignty and Constitution. But, in our case, they have proposed to amend the Constitution and Judiciary of our country. I can’t remain silent when such resolution is destroying our independent state,” Mr. Somawansa said.
