Responding to social media reports that Roshan Mahanama would be contesting the upcoming elections, former Sri Lankan Cricketer said that he has no intention of contesting any election.

He said in a statement that he would never get himself involved in any kind of political activity.

“To my surprise, I have been informed that a false news item is circulating on social media stating that I will be contesting in the upcoming elections. Please note that I have no intention of contesting any election and I am very disappointed that incorrect information is being published in social media,” he said.

He said he had served the country to the best of his capacity as a cricketer and he wants to be very clear that he would never get himself involved in any kind of political activity.

“I will always support valid charities as a responsible citizen, as I feel that one should not try to make a difference in someone’s life by using political means. I also wish to emphasize that my reputation matters and I have certain principles and values in life that I treasure. Therefore, I am making a polite request to all social media users not to mislead the public and harm my reputation,” the statement further stated.
