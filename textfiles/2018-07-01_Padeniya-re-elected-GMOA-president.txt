Pediatric Neurologist, Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya was unanimously re-elected for the 8th consecutive year as the President of the Government Medical officers’ Association (GMOA) at its AGM last evening.

Meanwhile, 11 key office bearers including the Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge were also unanimously re-elected for 2018-2019.

Soon after his re-election, Dr. Padeniya told Daily Mirror, the GMOA would take measures to take up the post-graduates medical officers’ issues.

He said that the Professional National Front (PNF) led by the GMOA would prepare an action plan without party politics to draft a national trade policy for the country and that the GMOA would conduct a one-day workshop at the ‘Bauddha Mandiraya’ on national policy to reveal the Government’s bogus trade policy.
