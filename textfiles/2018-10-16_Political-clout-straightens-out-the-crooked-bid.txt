Political clout straightens out the crooked bid!


	



A consignment of goods of a kind produced using artificial raw materials nabbed by authorized officials by thwarting a bid to smuggle it out in three trucks the other day had been summarily released allowing the culprits to go scot-free, they say.

 


The shipment is said to have been imported by a firm with close ties to a leading political authority.


Soon after the consignment was caught by the authorized ones, the powerful politico had asked the high-ups concerned to quietly release it after levying the normal duty and the latter had readily complied, waiving the normal procedure of holding an inquiry after sealing the shipment.


The high-ups who authorized the release of the shipment had assured their subordinates, who had expressed their concern that an inquiry would be held, but the inquiry is yet to be held though the goods released have already reached the retail outlets, they say.
