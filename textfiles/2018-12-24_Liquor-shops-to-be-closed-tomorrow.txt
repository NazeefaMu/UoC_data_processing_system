All liquor shops across the country would be closed tomorrow in view of the Christmas, the Excise Department said today.

It said legal action would be taken against those who keep their shops open by violating the laws.

“All the Excise carders have been instructed with regard to the strict enforcement of the law on possible malpractices by the licensees and on illicit trafficking of liquor through out the country,” Deputy Commissioner of Excise Kapila Kumarasinghe said.
