Dispense ad hoc ratios and bonus seats for PC Elections


	



 

It is reported in the press that the Delimitation Commission has proposed to introduce a 50:50 ratio and increase the number of bonus seats to tide over the issues of stability and minority representation in the Provincial Councils. At the outset, it is pertinent to mention that applying such ad hoc ratios and bonus seats changing with every election, amply proves that they are not scientifically founded on empirical evidence and research. Let me briefly deal with the said issues which unfortunately seem to be still entrenched in the minds of some of our leading politicians, political pundits, academics and civil activists in a parochial sense.

 

Stability in Provincial Councils
 

This outmoded concept founded on maintaining an absolute majority in the Council for all purposes is not in keeping with the principles of a modern democracy where all parties should contribute to arrive at the best solution favouring the Council/country after a healthy debate. 

It is the expectation of the sovereign voter. Maintaining an absolute majority by one party, will in fact lead to misguided, dictatorial decisions. ‘Hung’ or ‘unstable’ Councils/Parliament should become misnomers when professionals with country at heart deliberate and decide on the best fine-tuned options for the Council/Parliament/Country. 

To ensure advent of political professionals, the Election Commission should stipulate stringent eligibility criteria for prospective candidates by Rule of Law as the present day voters wish to have political professionals as their representatives. The writer’s proposed criteria and procedure has already appeared in the press.


  

Minority Representation

The question here is, why should a section of the population imbued with a ‘minority’ feeling downgrade themselves and beg preferential treatment on the one hand and why should the ‘majority’ feel good by giving preferential treatment to their fellow citizens on the other? 

It is very unfortunate and sad that we are still not ready to think as ‘Sri Lankans’ having equal rights and duties. If we adopt the short sighted ‘Bonus seat and Ratio’ method and continue to be afflicted with this parochial ‘Majority Vs Minority’ syndrome, our country will perpetuate the ethnic conflict like the beggar’s wound and will never ever come out of it.  

Therefore, it is high time that, at any level of elections, all votes be considered as cast by ‘Sri-Lankans’ attaching equal value to every valid vote. Only this concept can iron out the elusive issue of voting based on ethnicity, religion, cast etc. The application of proportionate arithmetic in a ‘cut and dry’ scientific manner, to determine the no. of seats won in a District by each party, will ensure an ‘equal value’ for each Sri Lankan vote in a District.  

 

 

Promotion of ‘Sri Lankan’ concept

As stated above, the electoral process will surely ‘trail blaze’ this elusive paradigm shift towards a cultural and attitudinal change of treating all citizens as ‘SRI LANKANS’. 

No doubt, the mass media shall play a crucial role in this effort through suitable programmes and Tele Dramas facilitated by the Ministry of National Integration as well as Education.
