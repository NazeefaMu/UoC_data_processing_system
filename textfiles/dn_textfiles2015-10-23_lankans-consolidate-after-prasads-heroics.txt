Lankans consolidate after Prasad's heroics

An inspired spell of bowling from Dhammika Prasad brought Sri Lanka back into the game on day two of the second Test match against the touring West Indies team for the Sobers-Tissera Trophy continued at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo yesterday.
The dynamic opening bowler successfully spearheaded his team's attack with another four-wicket haul as the home side made amends for their batting failure by bundling out the opposition for 163 runs in the first innings.
Sri Lanka with a lead of 37 runs started their second innings disastrously while losing opener Dimuth Karunaratne in the very first ball.
However Kaushal Silva and debutant Kusal Mendis consolidated the position with a determined second wicket stand of 65 runs. Mendis looked confident stroking seven boundaries before he edged one to the wicket keeper.
The home side eventually reached 76 for two at stumps which gave them an overall lead of 113 with eight second innings wickets in hand.
Earlier Dhammika Prasad masterminded a superb Sri Lankan comeback by producing a hostile spell of bowling .
Prasad would have loved to have picked up his second five wicket haul in his career and he would have achieved that had wicket keeper Kusal Perera stretched more to his right to a snick from Kemar Roach.
But yet, this was a fantastic effort from Prasad who seem to be enjoying a great year having already made his presence felt during the recent home series against Pakistan and India respectively.
In fact he produced a similar effort against India with a much stronger batting line-up in the second innings in a Test match in August at this same venue.
Even then the pressure was always on Prasad who has now emerged as the country's main strike bowler having fully recovered from a series of injuries.
The good thing about Prasad is that he responded whenever his captain called in to bowl given the situation and also he enjoyed the role of performing his task in short spells.
In the morning he broke the heart of the West Indies batting line-up with a fiery spell which ensured that the visitors would struggle to reach a modest total throughout the day.
West Indies went into lunch at 77 for four and Prasad once again struck during the second session while having the key wicket of Jermaine Blackwood that further strangled the batting side. In between Sri Lanka had a couple of excellent supporting acts from Dilruwan Perera and Milinda Siriwardena who was able to claim a wicket in his very first over of the innings.
Quite stranglely Rangana Herath managed to claim only a solitary wicket but Dilruwan Perera probably performed that role to near perfection by polishing off the tail and claiming the last three wickets of the innings.
Opener Kraigg Brathwaite of course offered some kind of resistance while battling for 101 deliveries for his top score of 47 which included three boundaries.
In addition skipper Jason Holder also made a desperate attempt to bring some respectability to the West Indies total by smashing a 37 ball 21 with the help of one six and two boundaries.
