Fijian firepower for Lanka Lions at Dubai Rugby Sevens
Roger Rodrigo to play in tournament for 27th year

Lanka Lions will be boosted by Fijian firepower at the Emirates Airline Dubai Rugby Sevens this weekend as they make a serious bid to win the elusive Gulf Men's Open title.
Cup runners-up in 2013 and semifinalists last year, Lanka Lions are bubbling with confidence after romping to victory in the Eden Park Sevens Series Dubai leg a fortnight ago.
"We are going win the cup. I have confidence in the side because of the way boys are playing. We have worked hard and the commitment that they showed this year is tremendous," said former Arabian Gulf and Sri Lanka rugby great Roger Rodrigo.
The two Fijians Vito Tuivione and Ranato Tavite could hold the key to success for the Lankans.
"The boys learnt from every game and they went up a level," said Tavite of the Lanka Lions performance in the Eden Park tournament.
"We are carrying two Fijians to make it more open, a little more flair to the side," said Rodrigo who is set to play for a record 27th time at the Dubai Sevens.
"The Fijians coming in makes us more stronger and gives us more confidence," added Madisha Silva who will be leading out Lanka Lions for the third year at the Dubai Sevens.
Lanka Lions coach Richard Murcott said the Fijians would be used to cause more impact though they were not short of firepower.
"Fijians coming in has brought a different dimension to the game. This is just an added bonus to the side. Adds a bit of flair but what we have noticed is the Fijians want to play the style we are playing right now," said Murcott.
"Definitely they will add more control to the game. We know that we are the fastest side. We have superb finishers in Ameen (Jamail), Dulanka (Gunasekera), captain Madisha (Silva) and Akalanka (Dabare)," explained Murcott who said the players were fit and raring to go.
"We were ready a week or two ago. They have recovered from injuries. Boys are fit and new (defence) plan seems to be sticking with them also. Not that we are overconfident, at the same time we are quite confident that we will put up a good show," he declared.
"We have been training on our defence. We have good attacking skills but since we are up against big boys, we need to have good defence lines," said Silva, a former Peterite Sevens captain.
Three players will be making their debut at the Dubai Sevens for Lanka Lions.
They are Gayashan Wijayasinghe, Dilshan Gamage and Akalanka Dabare.
"Gayashan and Dilshan playing in pack are making impact to the side. Big difference last year was we had smaller forwards," said Silva.
"I'm perfectly fine. I twisted ankle during the tournament but 100 per cent ready to go. Always wanted to play Dubai Sevens and we are playing to win the tournament," said Wijayasinghe, a former Royal flanker.
Lanka Lions were spoilt for choice when finalising their squad.
"This year, the talent that has come is really good than over the last few years. Choosing the final playing squad was a bit of a tough task for the management. Eden Park was a good start for this season. We are just hoping that the boys and veterans can take it forward from there and be able to lift the bigger one," said Roshan De Silva, manager of the Lanka Lions squad who thanked their sponsors.
The main sponsor is Aramex, Ice Watch Spectra, Fairway Holdings, Union Insurance with People's Bank, Sri Lankan airline, Beyond the Beach and Suren Agencies, being the support sponsors.
"Without sponsors we cannot afford to play this tournament because cost is so high. We have to provide medical insurance for 35 players," said Rodrigo, rugby co-ordinator of Lanka Lions.
Former Trinity centre Azarath Deen was confident the Lanka Lions Vets could also win some silverware.
"We have got very good opportunity to win something for Lanka Lions. Roger will be part of our squad and add on to punch as scrum half. This time we also have a few players who have come from Men's like Achala Silva," added Deen.
Lanka Lions squad for Gulf Men's Open:
Madisha Silva (Captain), Ameen Nizamdeen (Vice Captain), Mohamed Rilwan, Dulanka Gunasekara, Akalanka Dabare, Anura Perera, Philip Asinghearachchige, Tuan Zalique Jayah, Vito Tuivione, Hilmy 'Bebo' Mohammed, Ranato Tavite, Gayashan Wijayasinghe, Dilshan Gamage and Asif Akram.
