The Ministry of Public Administration and Management yesterday issued a circular changing the office hours of government institutions in the Battaramulla area to 7.15 a.m to 3.15 p.m. from September 18.

Secretary to the Ministry J. J. Rathanasiri speaking exclusively to the Daily Mirror said the steps were taken to support measures taken by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to reduce the traffic congestion in the area.

“This is a pilot project which works hand in hand with the priority bus lane project implemented by the Megapolis Ministry,” Rathnasiri said.

The project will also ensure employees arrive at their office under designated service hours which will be decided by the heads of departments. 9. 15 a.m to 3. 15 p.m are compulsory working hours, he said.

Meanwhile, Deputy Director of the Megpolis Ministry’s Transport Development Project P. Dissanayake said the main aim of the project was to reduce the number of office workers on the road during peak hours.

“Under this project employees go to work ahead of others and leave office before peak traffic,” he said.

The project will only be implemented in the Battaramulla area as of now as it is a pilot project, but officials are looking to introduce the new working hours to private sector as well in the future.

Various government plans have established the vicinity as the administrative center of the capital with government institutions to be shifted to the area soon. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
