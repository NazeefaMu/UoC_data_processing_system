	National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday that MP Hirunika Premachandra should have been arrested already over the Dematagoda abduction if the independent police commission was ‘genuinely’ independent.
	“MP Premachandra has still not been arrested and this proves that the police commission is not really independent. The government established these commissions to act without government or any other influence. But it seems that the word ‘independent’ holds no value as assured by the government,” he told a news conference at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Colombo.
	Meanwhile, he mentioned that the reins of the government were not in the hands of either President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but in the US, India and LTTE Diaspora.
	He pointed out that it was a requirement of these external elements which had made the government to introduce a new Constitution.
	“None of our citizens had asked for a new Constitution. The Diaspora wants it to decentralize the power of the State and execute their sinister agenda in the North and East, to merge them,” he said.
	He requested people to raise their objection against the government to rectify the mistake they had made an year ago. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
