In the wake of the no confidence motion submitted, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray asked Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to establish whether he enjoyed the majority support in the council within the stipulated time.

Fifteen members of the Northern Provincial Council has handed over a no confidence motion against the Chief Minister. Besides, this group which comprises members of the opposition seeks to rope in three more members to their side against the Chief Minister.

The Governor said steps would be taken to inform the Chief Minister to establish whether he enjoyed the majority support of the council.

He said so when asked about the no-faith motion against the Chief Minister that was handed over by a group of members of the Northern Provincial Council.

He said steps would be taken to inform the Chief Minister to prove this in due course and also said it was his duty to confirm the receipt of such a petition.

Accordingly, the Governor will take steps to get the affidavits from the members who signed the no-faith motion and to ensure the authenticity of the signatures placed by the members.

A meeting was to be conducted last evening to discuss the crisis triggered by the move to unseat the Chief Minister in this manner. (Romesh Madushanka)
