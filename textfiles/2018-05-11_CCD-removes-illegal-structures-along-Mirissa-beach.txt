Twenty one unauthorized structures along the Mirissa beach including Water Creatures Beach Guest Restaurant & Surf Bar where a group of Dutch tourists were assaulted were demolished today by the Coast Conservation Department (CCD).

CCD Director General B.K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi said there were no interruptions neither did any one intervene when the demolishing were going on under tight security.

More than 100 police officers, 24 Anti-Riot Squad personnel and a water cannon were deployed at Mirissa apart from several teams of Special Task Force (STF) personnel to prevent any protest against the action.

President Maithripala Sirisena ordered the removal on May 4 after the CCD backtracked under pressure from two powerful ministers. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
