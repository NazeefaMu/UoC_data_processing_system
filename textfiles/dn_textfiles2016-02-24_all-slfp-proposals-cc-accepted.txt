All SLFP proposals on CC accepted

Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday that all proposals of the SLFP for the proposed new Constitutional Council have been accepted.
Therefore, the two main political parties have agreed on the process to draft a new constitution and no disagreements surfaced in this regard, he said addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday.
The deputy minister said the SLFP and other political parties have presented many amendments with regard to the parameters of the powers.
"We have just discussed the formulation of the new Constitution and we will discuss it's contents later. We have laid the foundation for the formulation of the new Constitution for the betterment of the country and the people. It was decided at yesterday's Parliamentary party leaders' meeting that the proposal on the Constitutional Council should be debated in Parliament today and tomorrow. Accordingly the parliamentary agenda has been altered. The debate will commence at 1.00 p.m. in the afternoon. It will be further debated when Parliament resumes sittings at 9.30 this morning."
The deputy minister said the party leaders have also agreed to conduct a vote at 6.30 p.m. today. "Although initially the debate was to take place only for one day, we have decided to extend it for two days to give every member a chance to voice their opinions".
He said if about 40 to 50 members disturb the proceedings of a House which has 225 members, then it is not democracy.
"If the members of the joint opposition have problems it should be solved internally without disturbing the other 175 members. The Speaker has also acted in a very impartial manner in this situation. If there are members who seek to use rough tactics to achieve their aims , we will face them successfully. We will go on with our forward march," Perera said.
Commenting on objections of various parties on postponing the local government election, the deputy minister said the UNP always wants to hold the local government elections as soon as possible and consolidate the victory achieved on August 27 at local government level.
He said the Election Commissioner has informed that 57 amendments needs to be considered, while the SLFP has also called for the inclusion of all amendments before conducting the election.
"There are problems with regard to the delimitation which we hope to solve soon. We want to be fair by everyone and hold the election as soon as possible". Perera added that no secret agreement has been drafted and signed with India.
He requested the Opposition not to cause create unnecessary fears about an agreement which has even not been drafted.
"We do not do any thing which will harm the country and will always work transparently," he added.
