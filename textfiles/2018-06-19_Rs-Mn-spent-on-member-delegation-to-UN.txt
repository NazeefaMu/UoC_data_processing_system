It was revealed in Parliament today that more than Rs.120 million had been spent for the 60-member delegation which accompanied the President for the United Nations General Assembly sessions in 2016.

This was revealed in response to a question asked by MP Udaya Gammanpila on the cost incurred by the government. State Minister Niroshan Perera said the 60-member delegation included several ministers, media personnel and president's staff.

The MP asked whether it was a part of good governance to take a large delegation and at such a high cost.

The minister said the previous government had taken even larger delegations spending millions of rupees to which the MP said the present government was elected by the people to correct such bad precedents. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
