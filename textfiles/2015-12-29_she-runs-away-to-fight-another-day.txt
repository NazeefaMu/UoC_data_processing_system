This is an interesting episode that has not gone on record so far: Vote taking at the third reading of the 2016 Budget was underway. 
Names were being called out and members were verbally registering their ‘for it’ or ‘against it’. Suddenly a dainty fair one from the South quietly rose from her seat and walked towards the exit door. Several Betel leaf colleagues immediately surround her and inquire why she is leaving. “I am going out, but coming back later … I have to skip my turn…” she says.
“Why are you doing this?” a colleague asks.
“You all know my problem. They promised to make it ‘elastic’. If I voted against the Budget, they might change their mind. Aney! Sorry Honde!” she walks out before they could call out her name.
