Astrology vs. Astronomy
	
Is popular science capable of dismissing astrology as mumbo-jumbo

Two years ago, NASA published a blog post aimed at kids and against astrology, dropping hints that the astrological signs of everyone had been changed and that there are thirteen constellations in the zodiac instead of the twelve.
Ultimately the article boomeranged.
NASA is a sacred place of science in popular culture and many people are fond of quoting statements by NASA. The blog post was severely misinterpreted and quoted erroneously by the rationalists and enemies of astrology.
Therefore NASA had to state their position clearly again. Using its academic power and authority against astrology, so-called superstitions and religions is not just limited to NASA. Some popular science writers such as Richard Dawkins also use propaganda against religion and astrology.
Can we say astrology is completely a myth Is science really powerful enough to debunk astrology We have to reexamine the arguments that those who are critical of astrology present to justify their claim.
The common attitude of the people who follow science in the popular culture is that astrology is a fable of fools who think that the earth is flat and the whole universe rotates around the earth.
This is clearly a straw man argument.
In fact, Western astrology developed according to the theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy. Aristotle is regarded as the first person in the Western world who stated that the earth was a globe.
On the other hand when we take Eastern astrology, the 53rd verse of the 12th Chapter of Surya Siddhantha, a fundamental book of Indian Astrology, clearly states that the earth is a globe.
53. and everywhere upon the globe of the earth, men think their own place to be uppermost but since it is a globe in the ether, where should there be an upper, or where an underside of it

"If the behaviour of human society can be expressed mathematically in some aspects, then there would be periodical functions in human society. If these functions are coinciding with planetary motions then planetary motions can be used to predict the future"
 54. Owing to the littleness of their own bodies, men, looking in every direction from the position they occupy, behold this earth, although it is globular, as having the form of a wheel.
- Burgess, Ebenezer. Translation of the Surya-Siddhanta, a text-book of Hindu astronomy: with notes and an appendix.Minneapolis: Wizards Book Shelf, c1978. (1978).
Therefore it is crystal clear that the ancient astrologists knew that the earth is a globe. The word Bhu Gola (Earth Globe) was in Vedas and Puranas from very early time in India. The Buddhist text Milinda Panha also implies that the earth is a globe introducing the time differences between the countries.
Geocentrism (which says the sun revolves around the earth) is not a point to blame astrology either. Geocentrism and Heliocentrism (which says the earth revolves around the sun) is equally justifiable in a modern relativistic perspective. Astrology needs only kinematical calculations (calculations on the paths and not on the forces). Therefore even if we stick to Newtons classical physics, still theres nothing to denounce astrology.
Work of Aryabhatta, a famous Indian astrologer and astronomer shows that he used a heliocentric model and even ellipses for some of his calculations. According to the origin legend of Surya Siddhantha the inventor of astrology (Maya Asura) got that knowledge from a God who had lived in the sun and reincarnated in the city of Romaka.
A possible interpretation of the core of this legend is that the first theories of astrology were created with respect to the sun and then they were transformed with respect to the earth. Apparently if astrologists want to calculate the fate of people who are living on earth, by watching the night sky, they have to do calculations with respect to the earth. Therefore, it seems quite stupid to ask astrologists to do calculations with respect to the sun.
The next argument against the astrology is the one that was mentioned in the NASA issue mentioned above.
There are two kinds of astrologies in the world: Sidereal and Tropical. In tropical astrology the sign system is based on the vernal equinox of the Northern Hemisphere while the Sidereal sign system is based on the positions according to the fixed stars.
Those who reject astrology use this difference cunningly. They blame the tropical system saying the astronomical constellations are shifting gradually from sign boundaries while blaming the Sidereal system saying the Vernal Equinox is shifting.
However, a closer look at these arguments. The idea of the sign is something defined in the corresponding astrological system.
A sign is not a constellation. It is a different concept. Therefore scientists should not just criticise astrology by mixing up the terms sign and constellation.

"The Buddhist text Milinda Panha also implies that the earth is a globe introducing the time differences between the countries. "

Signs are given names of the constellations only because they are located close to that constellation. Therefore 13 constellations on the ecliptic do not require 13 astrological signs. 
On the other hand, astronomers also use a Sidereal System. Sometimes, you hear and read arguments of so-called Astronomical Pundits in Sri Lanka when we are about to celebrate the Sinhala New Year.
They show us diagrams and stellar maps to say that the sun goes to Aries on the 18th and not on the 15th.
They blame astrology and also the cultural values of Sinhalese while pretending they are to be the fathers of civilisation and modern knowledge.
Sinhala New Year is a mythical festival, most of them say. But most of these pundits have missed the crucial point.
Yes, both astronomers and Sri Lankan astrologers use Sidereal System. But this does not say that the two sign systems are equal.
The astrological system is not strictly based on constellations. They divide the complete 360 angle of the ecliptic into 12 equal parts which are called signs. Astronomers work according to IAU (International Astronomical Union) sign system where they divide the ecliptic into thirteen uneven parts. It is clear that boundaries are different. Thats the reason why they find the Sun entering Aries on 18th April when they surf the internet. This has nothing to do with astrology. In astrology the boundaries are different.
Another point made by those who criticise astrology is that there is no force which is strong enough to affect people considering the huge distance from the stars and planets.

"Therefore it is crystal clear that the ancient astrologists knew that the earth is a globe. The word Bhu Gola (Earth Globe) was in Vedas and Puranas from very early time in India. "

This argument is invalid because there is no need of such forces for the existence of astrology.
If the behaviour of human society can be expressed mathematically in some aspects, then there would be periodical functions in human society.
If these functions are coinciding with planetary motions then planetary motions can be used to predict the future. Therefore, science does not provide us a proper reason to reject astrology.
Early scientists, Galileo and Kepler were astrologers. Galileo had his chair in the University Padua to teach astrology to medical students.
Kepler tried to reform Western Astrology and invented a new astrology which he called Science of Harmonics.
He wrote a book on his new astrology. Giordano Bruno who is identified as a martyr of science by the popular culture never was a scientist but an astrologer and occultist.
I am not an astrologer. What I want to say is that the claims of  science in popular culture against astrology are mostly uninformed and we cannot reject astrology in such a simple manner.

IMFs Lagarde says market swings arent worrying, but wants reforms
	
REUTERS: Sharp swings in global financial markets in the past few days are not worrying since economic growth is strong but reforms are still needed to avert future crises, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Sunday.
Christine Lagarde, speaking at a conference on global business and social trends in Dubai, said economies were also supported by plenty of financing available.
Im reasonably optimistic because of the landscape we have at the moment. But we cannot sit back and wait for growth to continue as normal, she said in her first public comments on market movements since the latest round of turmoil at the end of last week.
Im ringing not the alarm signal, but the strong encouragement and warning signal.
Global stock markets were hit by wild fluctuations, with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 tumbling 5.2 percent last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. The volatility was fuelled by investor worries about rising interest rates and potential inflation.
Lagarde repeated an IMF forecast, originally issued last month, that the global economy would growth 3.9 percent this year and at the same pace in 2019, which she said was a good backdrop for needed reforms.
She did not give details of the reforms she wanted to see beyond saying authorities needed to move to regulation of activities, not entities.
We need to anticipate where the next crisis will be. Will it be shadow banking Will it be cryptocurrencies she said.

Mandate was to rectify January 8 mistake: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said the people have voted for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the Local Government election to rectify the mistakes they have made on January 8 Presidential election.
Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said the peoples mandate, which was given to the SLPP, was not a mandate given to deliver the promises made on January 8 when President Maithripala Sirisena assumed duties.
He said if the people wanted to get the January 8 promises fulfilled, they should have voted for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
"Ministers and even NGOs who analyse this election results say people have gathered around the lotus bud because the government has failed to deliver its promises given on January 8. This is an illogical statement. If people are disappointed and wanted to get those promises fulfilled, they should have voted for the JVP which stands for that mandate. Our mandate is not the January 8 mandate," he said.
He said people have rejected the United National Party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) along with the JVP by gathering around the lotus bud.
The MP said the people rejected the attempts made to divide the country, sign the ETCA and sell national assets to foreign countries. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Payable signs 2000 new merchants with Visa on islandwide promotion
	
Payable revolutionised cashless mobile payments in 2016, when it first entered the market with a mission to empower Sri Lankas micro, small and medium enterprises with the ability to accept electronic payments at a very low cost.
The company recently partnered with Visa Inc. on an islandwide promotion, signing on an impressive 2000 merchants over a period of two months.
In just over a year, the company helped the number of merchants accepting card payments in Sri Lanka grow by 30 percent and directly facilitated transactions in excess of Rs.1.5 billion. In December 2017 Payable marked a record month, with transaction volumes doubling to 2000 a day.
The Visa promotion was conducted in three stages, covering Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kandy, Gampaha, Matara, Ratnapura, Kurunegala, Jaffna and Nuwara Eliya. The first two stages saw the Payable sales team visit a total of 41 towns, while another 21 towns were covered in the Nuwara Eliya stage of the promotion. The team spoke to merchants, explaining the benefits of accepting cashless payments and how the ability to pay via credit and debit cards benefits customers. The promo was also designed to highlight Payables low-cost model and easily usable interface which is available in English, Sinhala and Tamil and usable anywhere in Sri Lanka.
The merchants were resoundingly positive in their feedback, noting that both Sri Lankans and tourists now prefer to make their payments via card. For merchants that work seasonally, Payables lack of monthly charges made it a favourable option. Moreover, the inbuilt automatic reconciliation feature on Payable eliminates the worry of maintaining hard copies of receipts as all the transactions are recorded on the application.
Our first partnership with Visa was a definite success and we are excited about our plans to empower more merchants around Sri Lanka in the second quarter of 2018, said Payable CEO and Co-founder Yohan Wijesiriwardane. The interest we saw around the country when we ran the promotion was amazing and we are extremely grateful to Visa for making it possible for us to execute a promotion of this calibre and look forward to more joint projects going forward.
Visa Sri Lanka and Maldives Country Manager Anthony Watson noted that the promotions success has set the course for more partnerships in the future. Findings from Visas recent payment attitude survey in Sri Lanka revealed that one out of two Sri Lankans are keen to adopt a form of digital payment solutions. This clearly validates the growing appetite for cashless payments in Sri Lanka. The high number of new merchants attained by the Payable team in the first two months further reinforces the potential for digital payments and cards in particular across Sri Lanka in times to come.

Mr. Ramanayake, who was voicing his opinion on the outcome of the 2018 Local Government elections, said the people had shown a red light as it did not keep its word on taking action against the corrupt personalities.
The Government did not arrest anyone who engaged in robbing public funds during the earlier regime, during the last three years and the people have protested against it.

A majority of anti-SAITM forces have agreed to a proposal by the GMOA which is in the process of preparing a common document to resolve this longstanding matter.
The GMOA is said to have held several rounds of discussions during the past two weeks with all the anti-AITM groups and had received positive feedback for its proposals.
Secretary Haitha Aluthge told a press conference today that apart from anti-SAITM groups, a majority of SAITM graduates and their parents had also joined the GMOA to work out a positive solution to this matter.
He said with the recent electoral defeat of pro-SAITM politicos, it is time to take another look on the SAITM issue.
With the new turn of events, the GMOA is hoping to talk to the Government to obtain a positive response to the SAITM controversy within a month.
Dr. Aluthge said according to the GMOA proposal there would be no SAITM M.B.B.S. degrees and SAITM students can only be awarded a degree by the Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy of Russia or the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University
We hope the power-hungry had learnt a lesson at the LG polls. GMOA does not intend setting up or toppling governments and it is now the Governments duty to implement the proposals. This matter should not drag any further, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Scooters make splash
	
The Ceylon Scooter Club had its annual gathering as usual on February 4. This year, more than eighty machines were on display, making it even more colourful than last years event.
As if to make up for last years low-key event, with its short run from the Mahaweli Centre to Independence Square, the organisers came up with a spectacular run this year  all the way from Borelesgamuwa to the culmination point at Gorakana, old Moratuwa Road.
The scooters came in almost all colours of the spectrum, with bright red, blue, green and orange dominating. The riders were mostly young, though most of the machines dated from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Long hair tied into buns were common enough to be a trademark, and all riders wore the black t-shirts with the club logo distributed free of charge by the organisers.

"The scooters came in almost all colours of the spectrum, with bright red, blue, green and orange dominating.The riders were mostly young, though most of the machines dated from the 1960s, 70s and 80s"
The parade went to Kalutara via Piliyandala and Kesbewa, turning back at the Kalutara clock tower to make its way along the Galle Road to Hotel Aqua Pearl via Panadura.
By noon, all the scooters were parked on a sprawling lawn by the picturesque Bolgoda Lake. Italian Vespas take pride of place in this setting, but beautifully restored Indian Bajajs looked like strong competitors. But the most distinguished visitor was a Lambretta 150cc which had arrived all the way from Galle.
Lambrettas, imported from Italy and assembled here by Upali Motors Corporation in the 1970s, were once a common sight but have become a rare sight today.
The CSC is an all-volunteer group run by a few enthusiasts. They are naturally short of money and fundraising ideas were discussed during the pre-launch meeting. The organizing committee made an urgent appeal for more volunteers to relieve their work burden, especially that of handling the accounts; unfortunately, they were no volunteers.
The event concluded at five pm. A club auction for April-May and an annual trip in August were mooted.

UNP has a duty to prevent return of Rajapaksa rule: Mangala
	
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today the UNP had a solemn duty not just to the 46% of the electorate who voted for it and President Maithripala Sirisena's SLFP last Saturday, but to the entire resounding majority of citizens of all 6.1 million of (55.3%) who marched to the polls last Saturday and voted against a return to the Rajapaksa rule.
The Minister, who compared the current election results with that of the 2015 Presidential Election, said it was evident that Mahinda Rajapaksa who in January 2015 commanded 5.77 million votes (47.6%) as his presidency waned week was not even able to muster 4.95 million votes or even 44.7% of voters this time.
Issuing a statement, the Minister said on January 8, 2015, fifty one per cent of Sri Lankans voted for the vision put forth to them by our unity candidate Maithripala Sirisena; that the time for dictatorship in our country was over, and that those committed to re-establishing democracy in Sri Lanka must unite to ensure that government serves all of the people, and not a single family and their loyal disciples.
On that day, the United Nations: Party, several stalwarts of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the People s Liberation Front, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the Tamil National Alliance, the Democratic Peoples Front. and all together over 30 political and civic bodies came together to prove that Sri Lankans shared their vision of a Sri Lanka that v/as ruled by law and not through fear.
We promised to amend the constitution to restore independence to the public service. abolish the executive Presidency, and enshrine the rights of all Sri Lankans into the legal bedrock of our legal system. We promised to bring those who robbed the coffers of the treasury to justice. We promised to hold accountable those who quenched their thirst for power with the blood of brave journalists and peaceful protesters Most of all, we promised you a government that would be free of the rampant Corruption that defined the decade that came before us.
Today, the people told us that we have not done enough. Despite the sincerest of efforts to inject haste and independence into a dilapidated justice system over the last three years and empower the police with the tools they need to successfully investigate complex crimes, murderers and fraudsters remain at large. Despite our government being the first in the nations history to insist that ministers must resign from the cabinet at the first sign of wrongdoing, and indeed the first to investigate allegations of corruption within its ranks with such vigor, justice is yet to be served
The message from the people has sunk deep into the UNP. and we are committed to taking drastic measures to fulfill the promises we made three years ago and maintain public trust. As we embark on this chapter in the story of our democracy, Sri Lanka can be proud of f two remarkable things we saw last Saturday,
Tie first is the conduct of an election under the auspices of an independent elections commission and police service. Never before has a government shied from manipulating public personnel. funds, resources and state media into an organ of their political ends. We hope that under these Independent bodies, Sri Lanka has seen the last of corruption, Intimidation and violence marring our elections.
The UNP has a solemn duty not just to the 46% of the electorate who voted for us and President Sirisena s SLEP last Saturday, but to the entire resounding majority of our citizens all 6.1 million of d (55.3%) who marched to the polls last Saturday and voted against a return to Rajapaksa rule. Our duty is to broaden our own voter base by delivering results. While joining hands with all honest and democratic political forces to uplift our motherland and assure that Sri Lanka never again returns to rule by the sword.
