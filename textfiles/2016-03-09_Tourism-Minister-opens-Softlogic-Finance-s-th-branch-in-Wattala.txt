Softlogic Finance PLC opened its 28th branch in Wattala recently under the patronage of Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Lands Minister John Amaratunga, thereby continuing the company’s efforts to enhance its presence across the island.


The fully-fledged branch is conveniently and centrally located at No. 180, Negombo Road, Wattala. It offers business loans, personal loans, group personal loans, gold loans, leasing and hire purchase, fixed deposits and savings and is open for business during weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
The opening of the Wattala branch of Softlogic Finance was attended by other dignitaries as well, including the company’s Deputy Chairman Harris Premaratne, CEO/Director Nalin Wijekoon and COO Indresh Fernando.

 
Commemorating the milestone in a meaningful manner, at the opening of the Wattala branch, Softlogic Finance launched its ‘Clean Zone’ community initiative, which seeks to improve public awareness on the importance of garbage segregation, proper garbage disposal and recycling. Staff members of the company were deployed to educate area residents through distribution of leaflets, etc. 


The 10 branches, which at present form the company’s Clean Zone network, displays separate bins dedicated for the disposal of plastics, bottles and non-recyclable material in front of their premises. 
Softlogic Finance also facilitates greater cleanliness in a 500m roadside extent to each side of the respective branch by entering into an agreement with the respective Municipal Councils for each area to be cleaned at shorter intervals. 


Softlogic Finance expects to open two more branches in March 2016, in Pettah and Kochchikade, extending its network to 30 branches.
