Colombo Fort Magistrate today refused the CID’s request to issue an arrest warrant through Interpol on one time Sri Lankan ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunge over the inquiry conducted on the alleged financial loss caused by purchasing Ukraine-built MIG-twenty seven aircrafts in 2006.

The magistrate made the decision based on the legal provisions vested in the criminal procedure court as Mr. Weeratunge was not named as a suspect to the inquiry by the FCID. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
