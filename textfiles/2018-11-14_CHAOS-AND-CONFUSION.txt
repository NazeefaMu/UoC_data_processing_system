CHAOS AND CONFUSION!!!


	


 





We are living in a democratic country, assuming that all is well with our world; sitting in front of the TV and suddenly late in the evening we are confronted with a new Prime Minister being sworn in!!! No notice, not even a hint that democracy had been shattered, torn to shreds and we were expected to acquiesce to the norms of decency and accept that in our democracy we have TWO PRIME MINISTERS!!!

 

 



 

Conundrum of the wretched

That school of thought is not correct though, it is the conundrum of the wretched EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY that created this chaos in our country!!! JRJ the architect of the Executive Presidency is no more but even from the grave, HE AND HE ALONE is ANSWERABLE FOR THE MESS OUR COUNTRY IS IN TODAY!!! True, he was a benevolent dictator but what followed??? When Executive Power is exercised and it has been done ruthlessly in the past also, the people have no voice!!! Even if they do, they are not heard, not listened to; so why are we talking about the unheard VOICE OF THE PEOPLE??? Not one of the learned Ministers of the past and we did have many of them then too, opposed the Executive Presidency; WHY??? SELFISHNESS!!! There were many Presidential hopefuls even then, but none of them thought of what this EXECUTIVE SCOURGE would do to the country, only of what he or she would do with it, if and when he or she became President, country be damned!!!

 

 



 

 

Compare and contrast

The pictures below leave me speechless!!! We wonder when our Presidents and Prime Ministers- or even any of our erstwhile Ministers- would decide to do away with all the glitz and glamour of their entourages, totally unnecessary appendages, and live like normal human beings as these great men do??? It is their simplicity that draws people to them; the greatness of their simplicity!!! A picture speaks a thousand words they say and our South-Asian leaders can certainly learn lessons from them!!! So much to be admired in the beauty of their leadership!!! Will our YAKKOS EVER LEARN???



 



ABOLISH PRESIDENCY  

Want to do away with CHAOS AND CONFUSION??? ABOLISH THE EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY!!! THIS WAS WHAT SIRISENA PROMISED TO DO IN 100 DAYS, PERHAPS HE HAS LOST COUNT OR IS POSSIBLY IN EARLY STAGES OF DEMENTIA, POOR MAN!!!
