Deepavali the Hindu Festival of Lights
Triumph of good over evil

Today is the ‘festival of lights’ in the Tamil Hindu Calendar; Deepavali.
Celebrations and pujas will be held throughout the day at temples and homes while the night time would be reserved for the lighting of lamps and firecrackers. The festival celebrates the triumph of good over evil, in the form of Lord Krishna vanquishing the demon Narakasura.
Hence this festival is celebrated with lights to showcase the ushering in an era of light after an era of darkness.
Narakasura according to South Indian and Sri Lankan Hindu mythology (there are other versions in other regions of India), is said to be the son of Mother Earth (Bhudevi) and Lord Vishnu in one of his incarnations as a boar (Varaha). He had boons and blessings from both his powerful parents forecasting that he would be a mighty and invincible warrior who would live a long and victorious life. Unfortunately, he fell into bad company and used the prowess invested in him for the propagation of evil rather than good.
Lord Vishnu
Having conquered the whole of earth, he then set his sights on Swarloga (heaven), making even that place hellish for its inhabitants. Indra, the king of heaven could not withstand the demon’s onslaught and sought the help of Lord Vishnu. Vishnu promised to take care of the matter in his incarnation on earth as Krishna.
Thus it was, long years later that Lord Krishna took on Narakasura who had been plaguing earth and heaven for eons and subdued him, eventually killing him. Before he died, Narakasura is said to have repented and asked that his death anniversary be marked; hence Deepavali.
The people of Earth and the devas (celestial beings) of Heaven are said to have celebrated with firecrackers and light as soon as Narakasura’s death was announced, and the tradition continues to this day.
Hindus observing this festival today would have got up before sunrise to have a traditional oil bath, complete with organic home-made shampoos of arappu or shikakai (in rural villages, this is still the practice. The shampoos are made of ground local herbs). There will be much making and distributing of sweetmeats and savouries during the day.
People would have spring-cleaned their houses over the previous days in anticipation of this event, which is supposed to harbinger brightness and prosperity. Hindu temples all over the country will be thronging today with people decked out in fine new clothes carrying puja baskets. Even those who don’t attend temples regularly will be making a point of paying their respects to God today.
Hindu houses
The rows of lamps lit for Deepavali is not so much a facet observed in Sri Lanka as it is in India. Here, it is the festival of Karthikai Deepam (dedicated to Lord Murugan) that is celebrated as the ‘festival of lights’, more prevalently. Karthikai Deepam this year is falling a few days from now on November 25.
Nevertheless, Deepavali which is much celebrated in India as the festival of light, is gaining prominence in Sri Lanka too with many Hindu houses now lighting rows of lamps in the evening. Firecrackers will be going off throughout the night, a facet that worries many elderly people and animal lovers. Youths all over Sri Lanka love to celebrate with firecrackers; vendors of the crackers would have been doing brisk business over the past few days. These are undeniably colourful and cheerful aspects of the celebrations but their side-effects also need to be considered. Pet owners out there, be careful of your pets’ well being today.
A community of people are happy and celebrating. May their happiness and well-wishes rub off on everybody. In this celebration of light over evil, may all beings be happy.
