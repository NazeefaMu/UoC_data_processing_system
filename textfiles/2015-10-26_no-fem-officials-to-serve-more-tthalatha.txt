Foreign Employment Ministry (FEM) officials attached to all embassies will not be allowed to serve for more than two years abroad, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said.
She said this when she met a group of FEM officials who went abroad recently.
The minister said though there were many FEM officials keen on working at our embassies they were not interested working for the betterment of Sri Lankans abroad.
She said approved period of service in foreign embassies was two years; some had served in the post for longer periods.
The minister said she was not satisfied with the work done by our FEM officials for Sri Lankans who faced problems while working in foreign countries.
She requested the officials to follow the instructions given by our Ambassadors. (Piyumi Fonseka)
