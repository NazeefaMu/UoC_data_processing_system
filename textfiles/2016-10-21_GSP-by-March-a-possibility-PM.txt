Sri Lanka will regain the GSP plus facility by March next year, if the government goes ahead with its economic plans without making changes, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.

Speaking to journalists after the conclusion of discussions with the European Union, the European Commission and the European Parliament in Brussels, the Prime Minister said there were positive responses from them with regard to GSP plus.

“We have only to resolve some technical issues to regain the status,” he said; adding that the European authorities were currently carrying out a technical application assessment.

He said Sri Lanka had been able increase its apparel exports by 87 percent since 2003 while Bangladesh had managed to increase its apparel exports by 406 percent taking advantage of GSP plus. “If Sri Lanka was able to increase its apparel exports by 300 percent, the country would not have become indebted to the world,” he said.

Mr. Wickremesinghe said Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and President Maithripala Sirisena would hold discussions with the European Union's member states shortly.

“It is high time we stopped talking and united for the sake of the country,” he added.
