Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila today challenged President Maithripala Sirisena to divulge the secrets he knew about opposition politicians.

Addressing the first anniversary celebration of the national unity government on Friday, President Sirisena said he would disclose the secrets about some opposition politicians if and when they formed a new party.

The MP said the nondisclosure amounted to aiding and abetting in the wrongdoings.

“As far as we know, there is no relationship between the formation of a new political party and the nabbing of thieves. If anyone has committed a crime, action should be taken against them regardless of forming a new party. The President has given an assurance to protect the secrets of wrongdoers as long as they listen to him. Is this good governance,” he asked at a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
