Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today denied former Minister Tissa Karaliyadda’s claim that a UNP minister had forced him to relinquish his deputy ministerial post.
Minister Senaratne said Tissa Karaliyadda had not been satisfactory with the portfolio given to him.  “He himself told me that he was a senior politician and therefore the deputy ministerial post was not enough,” he said.
Buddha Sasana and Democratic Governance Deputy Minister Tissa Karaliyadda today charged he resigned from his Deputy Ministerial post because he could not work with the UNP and that a UNP minister had compelled him to leave.
