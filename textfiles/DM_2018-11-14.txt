Accept the SC ruling:EC Chairman
	
With the submissions made before the court, all would have to accept the decision of the Supreme Court, the Chairman of the National Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said in Matara today during an awareness programme.
In the event of an issue in the Constitution regarding the dissolution of Parliament, the Elections Commission is bound to carry out the decision of the Supreme Court, he said.
The workshop was conducted for the Matara District Government Officials and civil activists regarding elections.
He said that during the present Political change only one unfortunate incident was the shooting at a State organization and no other serious incidents occurred.
But in early 2,000s, at the end of an election, there were incidents of arson, killings and State property destruction were observed. We are thankful to the public and the political leaders for avoiding such situations, he said.
Democracy means respecting the right of others to hold onto their beliefs, and also putting into effect the majority view without harming the minority.
Even if 175 out of 225 in Parliament remain in one block, the views of the 50 should be allowed without having it bulldozed by the majority. The main feature of Democracy is implementing the wishes of the majority without harming the wishes of the minority.
What is going to be implemented could be now known by making an inquiry. Presently it is so simple by resorting to sending an SMS. An election is another form of finding out ones preferences.
There are many who refers to Elections as a gimmick bestowed on us by the West. Human Rights, Democracy, Socialism, Fundamental Rights, Good Governance, Discussions, Conventions and Decision making were all ideas that had been cherished by people from the time of the Buddha.
In the coming year, we have to face three elections. They are Provincial Councils, General Elections and Presidential Election. Despite there been no signs of Provincial Council Elections in the near future, the dates for holding other elections are now nearing. With all these a referendum also might take place.
However, amidst all these challenges we are geared at any time as the Elections Commission to conduct an election, he said.
While we were in the process of preparing for Provincial Council Elections, there was this sudden outcry for a General Election. It was not an issue for us as we were ready for sudden situations of such nature. We would readily implement any decision of the Supreme Court.
Every citizen has the right to plead before the Supreme Court if he or she felt that their fundamental rights are been threatened. We are not certain whether the intention was personal or for the benefit of the general public. It is always better to act in accordance with once conscience, and I do not wish to comment beyond that point, he said.
The Director Legal of the Elections Commission Attorney Nimal Punchi Hewa, the Senior DIG of Southern Province Ravi Wijegunawardene, and GA of Matara Pradeep Rathnayake too attended the programme.(Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)

## Title: Amicable solution to present crisis paramount

Amicable solution to present crisis paramount
	
Last week, when horse-trading was at its peak, we, the Daily Mirror, editorially told that it was advisable now for both the groups in the power struggle to amicably agree upon a process to bring in a new composition of Parliament forthwith, through a fresh election. We had come to that conclusion as the cause of the confused political situation in the country had stemmed mainly from the fact that no political party had the absolute majority in the Parliament to form a government. Both the main political groupings had to coalesce with others who in someway have differences with them. 
After the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) withdrew from the United National Party (UNP)-led government on October 26, no party had the capability to form a stable government. Although the UNP could have shown the majority with the support of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the latter was unlikely to join a government formed by the UNP.
Also it was no secret that the new Prime Minister too did not have the confidence of the Parliament. It is unethical and undemocratic on the part of both the parties either to hang on to or grab the power without the necessary numbers. Also it is useless, as such a government cannot pass a single Bill or a motion in the House independently, without giving in to the demands of other parties.
Hence, the best and only option for a stable government was to go for a fresh election. We were of the view last week that political parties must compromise their hard stances in the name of the country and its people and arrive at an agreement to request the President, by way of a resolution of the Parliament, to dissolve the Parliament.
Now that the President has dissolved the Parliament using his executive powers, a new situation is in the making with a new set of problems emerging. The UNP, TNA and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) are preparing to resolve the problem through a legal process.
However, there are only two options left with the country which are not in the best interest of the people, unless the judiciary points out a third one which could resolve the crisis amicably. One is to proceed with the current developments while the other being to go back to the situation that prevailed on November 9 where two groups had been challenging each other to show their majority power in the Parliament.
One option would create a precedence where incumbent or any future President would be able to dissolve the Parliament anytime he or she wished, without considering the four and a half year restriction laid down by the Constitution. The other one would create an immediate chaotic and dangerous situation where the showdown in the Parliament might spill over to the supporters of the two main groups outside, as we pointed out in our editorial last Wednesday. 
The current crisis is very clearly a power struggle with extremely selfish motivation of politicians which does not involve the interests of the people at all, despite the groups on either side of the current political divide screaming at the top of their voices that they are fighting for democracy. Besides, with the crisis dragging on, politicians are spreading hatred among the people each minute with their rhetoric which is dangerous.
Unless the politicians cast away their selfish ambitions, at least for the moment, to put their heads together to find an amicable solution which could produce a stable government, they will have to take the responsibility for the repercussions of the current impasse. Surely, You can use your enormous privilege and opportunity to seek purely private pleasure and gain. But history will judge you, as Robert F. Kennedy once said.

As sun sets on the Constitution and Democratic Governance 
	
Right and wrong is not limited to only that which is stated in the (US) Constitution
-Leland Lewis
(Random Molecular Mirroring)
As this article is being inked, the Fundamental Rights petitions challenging the dissolution of Parliament by the President are being considered by the Supreme Court. If the apex court was to hold the said dissolution to be unconstitutional, it would yet again be back to the Parliament as to who commands the majority, i.e.the ousted yet adamant Ranil Wickremesinghe or the appointed yet not tested Mahinda Rajapaksa. In the event the Executive order of dissolution is not reversed, we all will be going to the polling booth on January 5 next year. 
A by-result of all this hullabaloo is the predicament, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) finds itself in now, in the wake of the decision taken by MR to join the Pohottuwa (Lotus bud) or the SLPP, run by his sibling Basil. As the gleeful UNPers were quick to point out, this could very well be the beginning of the end of the SLFP, the second largest political party that had produced Two Prime Ministers and three Executive Presidents from its ranks and ruling the country since independence alternately with its main rival UNP. Besides, it had been the counter weight against neo-liberal economic and centre right political dispensation of the UNP, standing for social democracy oriented policies it pursued from the out set, sometimes with success and at others with disastrous results.
Death knell of the SLFP
Yet the bottom line is that the tempering and moderating effect the SLFP has had on the local political scene is going to be missed when it eventually dies unless the defectors as well as those who remain, strike out some kind of consensus. 
What we are undergoing is not merely a constitutional or a politcal crisis. It is much more than that. It is a deep and incisive stab in to the very fabric of democratic governance adhered to since independence. Admittedly, we have very little to boast of in 70 years of post indepenent history as a sovereign nation. Economically we have gone no where. Socially we are confused and stagnant. In terms of international recognition we have a chequered history. But in terms of representative democracy, we can stand as upright and proud as any other nation including UK and western democracies. Despite set backs and aberrations, government change has occurred only through the ballot. Although many rulers have found ways and means of getting round the constitutional restrictions on their powers to rule, none, up to now, has taken the constitution head on, breaching it.
Yet the unbelievable chain of events triggered on October 26 by the Executive action of the President in removing the constitutionally elected PM and replacing him by the former President has now culminated in dissolution of the Parliament in blatant violation of constitutional provisions i.e. Article 70(1). Legal experts, most of them of various political inclinations are either denouncing or defending the move as the citizenry who in the first place, are not learned in the nuances of constitutional interpretation and secondly, have never been too inquisitive with anything to do with the constitutions remain clueless and aghast.
The Crisis Continues
Hopefully the FR applications before the SC will be a victory for democracy and parliamentary norms of representative governance. Yet whichever way the decision heads, it hardly solves the acute political and constitutional crisis in itself. In case the dissolution being held as violation of the Constitution, then we would be on ground Zero with the two PMs having to garner a majority to show their strength. If not, it would be back to the polling booth on January 5, 2019. Either way the nation would be bruised, scarred, humiliated and besieged by the delusions of power that afflict mainline politicians. 
The 19th Amendment has loopholes which are starting to look glaring; such things happen when politicians attempt to do tinkering work to a constitution already abused many a time in its 40 years of existence. For a constitutional frame work that was top heavy, i.e. with a power equilibrium concentrating all power on the Executive, such tinkering creating a rival repository of power in the PM without laying the structural framework to underpin such a shift, tends to be very fragile and dubious. Yet technicalities aside, there is no gainsaying the fact that it did create an atmosphere, constitutionally, to curtail the unbridled power of the Executive by strengthening the PM and the Parliament, creating independent Commissions and making the President responsible to the Parliament. Undeniably it was an endeavour to revert to principles of representative governance through parliament without giving in to the whims and fancies of one figure at the top. 
Salutary achievements
We saw the results of such constitutional breakthroughs in the area of media freedom, independence of the judiciary, a citizens right to information as well as the expanded right to dissent. Quite unlike the preceding decades, journalists criticized the government,sometimes ridiculing the leaders of good governance. The judiciary was able to summon and question ministers and even the PM in a manner which was unthinkable previously. Entire political culture changed from a Stalinist era cult like atmosphere, in to one more in line with a liberal democratic hue. Despite many failures and disappointments it seemed that we were on a march, albeit slow towards being counted a serious and fully fledged democracy, a process that would have taken years if not decades for consummation. Yet we were on the correct path.
I am no fan of the neo-liberal economic module and liberal democracy; my personal preference being towards a social democracy with fair distribution of national wealth and policies oriented towards local production. There is little doubt that the ultra liberal policies resorted to by the Ranil Wickremesinghe government were seriously being under a cloud of doubt as to its position in a society like ours. Yet, despite where you are placed in the Politico-Economic spectrum, it had to be a struggle for power within the Parliamentary system of governance with universally accepted norms. The constitution was the foundation of that mode of governance.The battle lines are exclusively within the parliamentary system however, imperfect it may be. 
Champion turns traitor
On the night of October 26, the President, not only viewed as a champion of the silent revolutionaries who defied all odds in ushering in change which seemed very unlikely two months prior to January 8, 2015, but also as the trustee of that repository of democratic governance, himself became a tool in the hands of nationalist authoritarian agents hellbent on power. 
Little did he realize that it was not the death knell of ultra liberalism that he was always at odds with , but the demise of social democracy, too, the brand of democracy that the SLFP has been championing all these decades. Liberal democracy has been on retreat globally, alright, but what is raising its ugly head is not its legitimate and organic rival , social democracy but a right wing nationalist authoritarian power centre that gives a tuppence worth about constitution.
The sun is setting on the Constitution and Constitutional governance based on democratic norms. We lost more than we realize on the night of
October 26, 2018!

CHAOS AND CONFUSION!!!
	

We are living in a democratic country, assuming that all is well with our world; sitting in front of the TV and suddenly late in the evening we are confronted with a new Prime Minister being sworn in!!! No notice, not even a hint that democracy had been shattered, torn to shreds and we were expected to acquiesce to the norms of decency and accept that in our democracy we have TWO PRIME MINISTERS!!!



Conundrum of the wretched
That school of thought is not correct though, it is the conundrum of the wretched EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY that created this chaos in our country!!! JRJ the architect of the Executive Presidency is no more but even from the grave, HE AND HE ALONE is ANSWERABLE FOR THE MESS OUR COUNTRY IS IN TODAY!!! True, he was a benevolent dictator but what followed When Executive Power is exercised and it has been done ruthlessly in the past also, the people have no voice!!! Even if they do, they are not heard, not listened to; so why are we talking about the unheard VOICE OF THE PEOPLE Not one of the learned Ministers of the past and we did have many of them then too, opposed the Executive Presidency; WHY SELFISHNESS!!! There were many Presidential hopefuls even then, but none of them thought of what this EXECUTIVE SCOURGE would do to the country, only of what he or she would do with it, if and when he or she became President, country be damned!!!




Compare and contrast
The pictures below leave me speechless!!! We wonder when our Presidents and Prime Ministers- or even any of our erstwhile Ministers- would decide to do away with all the glitz and glamour of their entourages, totally unnecessary appendages, and live like normal human beings as these great men do It is their simplicity that draws people to them; the greatness of their simplicity!!! A picture speaks a thousand words they say and our South-Asian leaders can certainly learn lessons from them!!! So much to be admired in the beauty of their leadership!!! Will our YAKKOS EVER LEARN

ABOLISH PRESIDENCY
Want to do away with CHAOS AND CONFUSION ABOLISH THE EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY!!! THIS WAS WHAT SIRISENA PROMISED TO DO IN 100 DAYS, PERHAPS HE HAS LOST COUNT OR IS POSSIBLY IN EARLY STAGES OF DEMENTIA, POOR MAN!!!

## Title: CT invented  a new pop idiom
## Section: News Features

CT invented  a new pop idiom
	
C.T. Fernando and Rukmani Devi

C. T. Fernando, pioneer pop singer and one of the most original artistes this country has ever produced, remains evergreen, with his songs in great demand 41 years after his death. He would be proud to know that his musical talent now runs into three generations, with grandson Tisara Fernando too, making his presence felt as a singer.
Tisaras father, Priyantha Fernando, was born in 1952, just when C. T. was making a name as a singer. After C. T.s premature death in 1977 (at age 56), Priyantha began singing his fathers songs; but his repertoire includes several original songs too, including Werale Muhudu Relle and Niranjala Katada Adare Den. CT died a month before Tisara was born.
Talking to C.T.s grandson was akin to time travel. He was accompanied by Priyantha Fernandos wife Piyaseeli; she too, can sing but chose to be a beautician. Together with them was Chulaka Paranayapa, a guitarist of that 60s-70s generation which made Sinhala pop music mainstream and not a disdained distant cousin of the Sarali Gi stream which dominated our state-owned radio broadcasting at the time.
Chulaka is a Kandyan, but was a teenage friend of Clarence Wijewardena, spending time with him in Ratnapura, studying music together and dreaming of pop stardom. Clarence was born in Haputale, and schooled in Matale because that was his mothers hometown, and the family lived in Ratnapura in the 60s. Their teacher was Kingsley Perera, a pioneer guitarist who died last year, and both became very young members of Kingsley Pereras Ratnapura band.

Priyantha Fernando

But step back to the early 50s when there was no Lankan pop music as such except for the bands in Colombo, dominated by the Burgher community playing jazz, blues and rock n roll at night clubs and events. C.T.s was a startlingly original new sound in Sinhala music because of the way he fused Western pop idiom with the exhuberance of jazz and the mellow tone of the Sinhala song. His voice was happier in the higher register, but you can always sense him restraining it.
The Sinhala Sarala Gi started with Sunil Shantha, and he certainly wasnt shy of pitching high. But the pitches got lower and lower after that, till the low-to medium pitch vocal flow of all those famous post-60s singers  Victor Ratnayake, Sanath Nandasiri, Haroon Lanthra, Dayaratna Ranatunge et al  came to characterise the Sinhala Sarali Gi. All of them, classically trained, could pitch high.
Among the female singers, Neela Wickremasinghe, Nirosha Virajini and Uresha Ravihari excelled at pitching high within the Sarala Gi tradition.

New kind of song
C. T. saw things differently. He was interested in neither baila nor sarala gi as his medium of expression. He took elements of both, mixed it with Western pop beats, melodies and cadences, nuanced with jazz elements, and fashioned a new kind of song for us, all of it backed by Western instruments. This was at a time when Western instruments were disparaged by the broadcasting elite. No one had heard anything like it before, and no wonder C.T.s songs became such hits. He was recording as early as 1951. Chulaka recalls Kingsley Perera playing guitar for a CT recording. By the 60s, he was too big for the broadcasting puritansto ignore.
Rukmani Devis voice was the perfect match for C.T.s. She had no worries at all about pitching high, and her high strung soprano blended beautifully with C.T.s voice, closer to baritone than tenor. Both of them look classy standing in front of those Sure mikes which were the industry standard back then. If the conditions had been right, Rukmani could have been a very good opera singer. Or she could have been the Lankan Julie Andrews. But conditions for such talents have never been right in this country, and that was the tragedy of Rukmani Devi, both in films and in singing. Fortunately for her, and us, she had that flowering with C. T. Fernando when both of them were artistically at their peak, and she had a brief second wind later with the late Neville Fernando. The best song to come out of that partnership was a re-working of the legendary C.T.-Rukmani duet Malbara Himidiriye.

Priyantha with wife

C.T. Fernando was a very good showman. Despite the Western sophistication of his approach, many of his hits are rustic at heart, with imagery that a villager would recognise and respond to  bees feasting on flowers, or evoking the lullabies of childhood. It was his successor M. S. Fernando who expanded the imagery to the urban, with an eye towards the cosmopolitan  taxi karaya, rikshaw karaya, Hello girl, Galkisse Muhudu Verale. Though branded a baila singer, M. S. too (again close to baritone), just like C.T., created songs which really are exuberant extensions of the Sinhala Sarala Gi blended with pop.

C.T.s was a startlingly original new sound in Sinhala music because of the way he fused Western pop idiom with the exhuberance of jazz and the mellow tone of the Sinhala song.

Back to C.T. and those Ratnapura days. C.T. visited Ratnapura to sing with Rukmani Devi when the very young Clarence Wijewardhane was cutting his musical teeth, meeting his girlfriend on the sly and falling in love with electric guitars. Clarence knew intuitively that the future of Sinhala pop lay with the electric guitar, when leading pop groups tried to look Latin and swore by acoustic. Chulakas family owned a sprawling big upstair house in Ratnapura, and it became a regular haven for singers and musicians. C.T., Nihal Nelson and Ivor Denis were frequent visitors, while Clarence with Chulaka and other friends would visit his girlfriend on the sly surrounded by pastoral beauty.

Thisara with Priyanthas wife Piyaseeli Fernando

That clandestine love episode inspired some of our best loved pop, as Annesley Malawana too, got into the act with Clarence  Mango Nanda, Maame Ape Kalu Maame and Kageda Gong Wassa all came out of that. Ask Chulaka and hell reminisce all day about Oh, those were the days. Clarence, along with Charles Seneviratne and another friend, studied music under Kingsley Perera and joined his band after hearing the latter performing Christmas carols at a Ratnapura playground. Chulaka had an Akai magnetic tape recorder at home and some of Clarences earliest attempts were recorded on this machine.
No wonder many of Clarences songs have that pastoral feeling  Gamen liyumak Ewilla or Malata Bambareku Se. The latter rings a bell whenever I listen to C.T.s Piyumehi Peni Bothi Wana Bambaru. C. T. was born in Moratuwa (a denizen of Moratuwa recently referred to the town as mage gama  my village  so there really isnt any difference. Its all in the mind). C.T.s parents lived in Nawalapitiya for a while and he started school there, even winning an award for his work in a choir, but he later attended St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa.

Grandson Tisara
Self taught in music, C. T. played the guitar, but his passion was for singing. He composed his own melodies, but the music was superbly arranged by the capable Patrick Denipitiya and his orchestra. With all that fame, C.T. still had to work at the Land Registry for a living. C.T. met his wife-to-be, Dhanawathie Gunasekara, the daughter of a prominent politician, in Diyatalawa. She was a radio fan of his and wrote letters to him. Her father and Chulakas were friends who worked for the Survey Department. Son Priyantha worked for the Building Materials Corporation. He was the first to start the father-to-son singing trend in this country.

Chulaka Paranayapa.pix Damith Wickramasinghe

Grandson Tisara too, is determined to make his mark as a singer. He has trained under Victor Ratnayake and Swarnalatha Kaveeshvara. Its hard to think of any other family of singers running into three generations, and we should wish him luck. Today, as it always happens, there are people who come out of nowhere to capitalize on the musical heritage of these musical giants. But the talent in this family lives on.

Fairway English Creative Writing Workshop 2018
	
The Fairway English Creative Writing Workshop for 2018 drew a large crowd of amateur writers and enthusiasts for a two-day workshop, conducted by an eminent resource panel focusing on novel writing, short story writing, poetry, script-writing, editing and publishing. Few of the participants shared their thoughts at the conclusion of the workshop.
I was blessed to have been surrounded by so much knowledge, talent and passion on the part of both the resource panel as well as the participants. Words fail in my attempt to express what I experienced for it can only be felt by the heart and therefore I encourage anyone with the flair for writing to take part in this truly inspiring event.
1. Stephanie Peries, Teacher of Classical Ballet, Deanna School of Dancing
This workshop honestly inspired me to pursue writing once again as I was struggling to do so before. The resource panel was an absolute delight. My heartfelt gratitude goes to Fairway Holdings for supporting the arts and providing us with an opportunity to tell the world of its importance.
2. Rithmaka Karunadhara, Student, Ananda College
I felt that my knack for writing immediately scaled up thanks to the inspiration I received at the Fairway creative writing workshop. It was a massive platform that allowed and inspired many people to express their thoughts as words on paper. Fairway has taken a highly anticipated step to fill in a clear vacuum in the space of creative writing.
3. Dilin Peiris, Duty Manager, Hilton Colombo
I attended the Fairway English Creative Writing Workshop 2018 and this workshop introduced me to the art and practice of creative writing. It also offered me the opportunity to meet like-minded people and learn a variety of techniques, develop craft and expand my knowledge of editing and publishing. Writers and speakers who facilitated the workshop provided a wide range of information. This workshop also gave me the opportunity to explore my creativity and examine the works of others.
4. Saradha Somaratne, Country Manager, Bookbridge Sri Lanka
The stories the resource panelists shared about their journey of writing truly lit a spark of inspiration in me and I believe the event itself was a call to adventure. Thank you Fairway Holdings for creating this amazing platform that helped all those present to improve their writing skills.
5. Chamari Fonseka, Assistant Director, Ministry of Finance and Economics
The Fairway English Creative Writing Workshop was very interesting and we learnt a lot, but more importantly we were inspired to try out new styles of writing and to write more in general. I thank Fairway Holdings for organizing this much needed workshop for budding authors.

Writing, like life can feel really uncomfortable and overwhelming. As a Southeast Asian American student, the world of literature can be intimidating because of the lack of relatability but the world also evolves; the Fairway English Creative Writing Workshop reminded me that I can create an entire world out of words and that my different perspective is greatly valued. The resource panel did a sublime job in conveying their knowledge and inspiring us all to pick up our pens.

I enjoyed being a part of the workshop organized by Fairway Holdings since it was a fresh opportunity for all English literature enthusiasts to improve their talent, no matter how deeply buried it was. The inclusion of almost every aspect and every person within the workshop shone through in many circumstances and made it very informative, expressive and timely. Thank you Fairway Holdings.

Find a peaceful solution, respect democratic institutions: MEPs
	
The MPs of the European Parliament (MEPs) on Tuesday called upon all relevant parties in Sri Lanka to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the current impasse and to respect the democratic institutions.
The Chairs of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, David McAllister and the Delegation for Relations with South Asia, Jean Lambert, have expressed concern as regards the decision of President Sirisena to dissolve the Sri Lankan parliament.
In a statement, they said Sri Lanka's commitment to the rule of law, good governance and human rights is key to its prosperity and international reputation, and a fundamental pillar of its relations with the European Union.
National reconciliation and accountability is key for Sri Lanka's future, they said.

Former confidant gets the cold shoulder!
	

There was a prominent whiz kind in the days of the R-regime, who had a greater say regarding foreign matters than the top team member holding the portfolio.
Following the fall of the R-regime, the man had to go into oblivion. However, having once tasted power and perks, he could not remain a nonentity for long. So, it was rumoured in political circles that he tried his best to warm his way into the graces of the new powers that be by turning traitor to his former master.
When his former master suddenly became the countrys Number Two, the whiz kid had decided that his malefic period was over and paid a visit to the latters official residence at Wijerama Mawatha.
The security men at the former masters residence gave no warm welcome to the whiz kind but allowed him to remain at the doorstep.
However, the former master who betrayed his surprise with an ah! ignored the former confidante got in the waiting car which sped away.

Minister AHM Fowzie, Piyasena Gamage and Manusha Nanayakkara crossed over to the opposition in Parliament.
MP Manusha Nanayakkara who crossed over to the Opposition said he did so because he did not want to participate in any action that was against the mandate given by the people in 2015.
The present administration tried to buy over MPs and work against the mandate given by the people in 2015. It was an undemocratic move. Therefore I decided to stand up for democracy, he said.
MP Piyasena Gamage who also crossed over said he did so because of his love for the nation.
I did not want to work against the sovereignty of people, he said.
I was always striving to form an SLFP led administration but I decided to sit in the opposition today to defeat a move which was against the democratic norms.
Minister of Tourism Vasantha Senanayake also said he would resign from his Ministry shortly.
I will resign from my ministry shortly. I have realized that the present administration has no majority in the House, he said.
I have not left the UNP though I accepted a ministry in the new government and will remain with the party, he added. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said today they were prepared to form a stable government after rectifying their previous mistakes if they were given a two-thirds majority at the general elections.
He told a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) head office that they were drafting a manifesto to bring about a huge transformation in Sri Lanka.
We are only asking the people to give us a 2/3rds majority at the election. Today, the people understand that the country cannot be taken forward without a stable government. We made several changes but there were allegations against us in certain sectors. We will rectify our mistakes and provide the people a better administration, Mr. Abeywardena said.
He said they had appointed a committee to prepare a manifesto aimed at the general election and the committee would come up with ways to revive the economy.
Our main focus is to revive the economy. Sri Lankas tea production is today ranked fifth in the world. We have to change that. Without giving into IMF demands, we will strengthen our rural economy, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. has no majority in Parliament: Karu
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today announced that the no-confidence motion brought in against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse and the Government passed in Parliament.
However, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) of Mr Rajapaksa declined to accept the Speakers ruling.
After the Supreme Court issued a Stay Order suspending the dissolution of Parliament, it was reconvened yesterday.
Secretary-General of Parliament Dammika Dasanayake read out the Statement by President Maithripala Sirisena as it was a ceremonial sitting after a period of prorogation.
Meanwhile, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran, referring to Standing Order 135, asked for the suspension of the Standing Orders to carry out the businesses for the day according to an agenda to be decided by the House on the same day.
The leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardane said everyone, including the Speaker, was bound by the Constitution.
He said the Standing Orders could be implemented only in conformity with the Constitution.
After reading out the Presidents statement, only the adjournment of the House is scheduled for the day, he said.
Despite his repeated requests, a vote was taken for the suspension of the Standing Orders.
It was hurriedly moved by Mr Sumanthiran to be seconded instantly by JVP MP Vijitha Herath.
The suspension of the Standing Orders enabled JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who moved a No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on the basis that his appointment of October 26, 2018, was not constitutional.
Mr Herath seconded it, and then the Speaker asked for a roll call amidst the chorus of protesting shouts by the Government members.
Housing Minister Wimal Weerawansa said nowhere in history had a No-Confidence Motion been taken for a vote in this manner.
Once a motion is handed over, it has to be placed on the Order Paper. Then, a date has to be agreed upon by the party leaders for the debate. We have never seen the procedure being flouted in this manner, he charged.
While the Government members persisted with their bout of shouts against the moving of the motion, the Speaker proceeded with the vote.
All Opposition MPs stood up in favour of the motion.
As there was no call for a division by the Government side, the Speaker declared the motion passed by voice vote.
Also, he announced that the new Government had no Parliamentary majority.
The UNP MPs were wearing black Satakaya, which said, For democracy.
Two MPs Manusha Nanayakkara and Piyasena Gamage crossed the floor of the House before the vote and joined hands with the UNP amidst applause from its MPs.
Besides, MP A.H.M. Fowzie, who joined the UNP earlier, remained seated with the Opposition right from the beginning.
During the vote, some Government MPs, including Prasanna Ranaweera, Padma Udayasantha Gunasekera, Sanath Nisantha and Janaka Wakkumbura rushed to the Well of the House and shouted at the Speaker calling him the most partisan Speaker Sri Lanka ever had.
Some UNP MPs such as Chaminda Wejesiri tried to run into the Well to confront them. But, he was prevented from doing so by UNP MP Dr Harsha de Silva ostensibly fearing that any untoward incident would reflect badly on them internationally.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Halting rise of T2DM means ensuring health of the girl-child
	
The battle against Non communicable diseases [NCDs] will be in the spotlight at the 3rd High-Level Meeting as part of the United Nations General Assembly on NCDs in September 27, 2018. It is hoped that progressive, evidence-based methods towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030 will be accepted by over 50 Heads of States for accelerated implementation. Diabetes, often considered the mother illness of most NCDs, will be tabled for discussion to reduce the global burden of disease. What is needed immediately is a strong political commitment to ensure the meaningful prevention and support of people living with or at risk for diabetes in the response.
Incidence and prevalence is progressively rising in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A few decades ago it was clearly defined that type 1 diabetes is mainly seen in the under 20s age group and T2DM in the over 40s. However, now we see the age of onset of T2DM younger, more so in low- and middle-income countries such as Sri Lanka.
We have already established the aetiology of T2DM. One hypothesis could be that younger onset is due to nutrition in-utero being inadequate and consequently the presetting of insulin resistance. In an undernourished child growing in the womb, the compromised nutrition is directed to the maintenance of life through the supply to the brain at the expense of the rest of the body. This usually occurs through a process of insulin resistance so that organs like the liver and musculature remain underdeveloped up to the point of birth. Low birth weight that results in children of this category are thought to be more prone to the development of T2DM in later life. Postnatal enhanced degree of feeding makes them gain weight exponentially mainly through deposition of fat. This produces early onset of T2DM due to pre- setting of insulin resistance.
In these nutritionally compromised individuals the musculature is underdeveloped and hinders adequate exercise which escalates weight gain. As the spread of the T2DM in the world is mainly in the low- and middle-income group, this could be a very important factor that can be corrected through adjustment of maternal nutrition in the stages of preconception and pregnancy. This highlights the value of the girl child and its nutrition through the life circle approach. This makes it essential for pregnancy to occur at an optimal period between 20 and 40 years so that full development and nutrition is more likely to be guaranteed at this time. Early pregnancy is best avoided less than 20 years of age and the girls should be preferentially treated where nutrition is concerned.
According to the Sri Lankan Demographic and Health Survey 2006/2007 data, low birth weight occurs in approximately 17% of new births while prevalence of dysglycaemia occurs in approximately 21.8% of the population.
Interaction of all aetiological factors namely foetal origins, lifestyles, stress and genetics have a major impact of the onset of the pathology.4 Modern lifestyles of sedentary and unhealthy fast food, addictions due to increased stress in children and adults, rapid urbanization leading to increased air pollution and unsafe water acts as a catalyst decreasing the age of onset of illness. In addition, inadequate nutrition predisposes people with T2DM to the development of depression as they have been deprived of a desire to fulfill their nutritional requirements in early life. State of undernutrition in-utero leads to a stressful situation before birth and a tendency to develop endogenous depression in later life.
To illustrate, I quote a true-life situation where a young girl living in Colombo, Sri Lanka was diagnosed with T2DM at the tender age of 9 years. She was found to have a high glucose level on a routine screening and was treated as T1DM. She had a low birth weight and nutrition compromised in-utero. She was found to be obese and showed signs of insulin resistance such as acanthosis nigricans where her insulin was gradually reduced and eventually stopped. At present, she is managed well on oral hypoglycaemic agents and a modified lifestyle.
The resultant pandemic of T2DM can only be halted through proactive measures of primary prevention highlighting wellbeing of young females in our society.

He shuns everything his predecessor touched except his portfolio!
	
The King Rooster from the estate domain who had to go through a bad patch without the high office was a beneficiary of the sudden regime change.
The powers that be, wise to the politics of the estate domain offered him the portfolio he long coveted, which had greatly appreciated in value being the one earlier held by his arch-rival in the estate sector.
Later, the King Rooster who happily assumed duties in his new office, addressed his Ministry Secretary: I detest whatever my predecessor laid his hands on. I dont like to sit at his desk nor touch even the phone he used. Get rid of everything he used and bring in new things for me. Remember I dont want to use the car he used either. I want a new vehicle.
But he was using a brand new expensive car, Sir, the Secretary replied.
The King Rooster immediately waved off the implied suggestion.
Nothing doing! he told the Secretary. I want a new car!
The Secretary is busy procuring new furniture and new office items for the new boss these days, they say.

A certain public statement made by the Pohottuwa Secretary caused a pandemonium in the Blue Camp.
He had told the media that their candidate for the race for the big poll round the corner would be none, but someone from the Pohottuwa itself.
The former strongman, now Number Two had gone into a rage when he heard about this statement. He had immediately given the Secretary an earful for talking out of turn at a very sensitive moment in their political manoeuvrings.
Meanwhile, those close to Number One too had panicked. And they had lost no time bringing this into the notice of Number One.
As tensions were rising in the Blue Camp, the Political sibling aka Pohottuwa theoretician had lost no time in calling on Number One to explain that their Secretary had made the damaging statement without consulting the party leadership.
As soon as this round of talks was over, the Blue Party secretary issued a media communique clarifying that the candidate of the new UPFA- SLPP alliance would enter the fray at the upcoming big poll on the Betel Leaf ticket.

Judiciary is  the only hope  Mangala
	
Former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera speaks about the current political impasse and responds to the allegations made by President Maithripala Sirisena against the United NationalParty (UNP).
Excerpts of the interview:

President is upset as he could not get through, the tenders of his daughter and son-in-law
	Butterfly is better than leech
	There is no truth in allegation about the plot to kill Prez
	Presidents burning desire to be presidential candidate created this problem
	When he joined us at the presidential election, Ranil Wickremesinghe was a well-known politician

Q What do you think about the dissolution of Parliament
I would say it is the worlds first. The President has violated the very constitutional amendment he introduced. It was passed by the Cabinet and approved by Parliament with a majority of two-thirds. It has led the country into a serious constitutional crisis. The judiciary is, perhaps, the only hope we have to stop this country from sliding towards dictatorship.

QOtherwise, how ready are you for a general election
As I said, as a party that has governed this country for a longer period than any other party since Independence, we are always ready for an election. It is nothing to do with our readiness to face elections. It is about the fundamentals of democracy. If we allow the President to violate the constitution in such a manner, he can dissolve Parliament again when he does not want to see the face of the Prime Minister-elect.
I think Sri Lanka is facing one of the gravest political crises since Independence. It is a unique political crisis not only in Sri Lanka but also in the world where the Head of State himself instigates a coup against his own government. It has now led to a constitutional crisis. Despite the fact that we had clearly shown a parliamentary majority, he refused to resolve it as early as possible. As a person who played an active role in electing this gentleman, I really feel despair at the tragedy which is unfolding before us.

QYet, the President said he still did not want to reappoint UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. Then, wouldnt it have compounded the crisis if not for this action
As the Prime Minister (Mr Wickremesinghe) correctly pointed out in the interview with the Hindu newspaper, a constitutional crisis could not be solved according to the personal whims and fancies of the Head of State. If Parliament says that they have faith and trust in Mr. Wickremesinghe to continue, he is obliged to appoint him. With regard to the no-confidence motion brought against Mr. Wickremesinghe, it was his first attempt to unseat him constitutionally. It failed. I still remember, in one of the discussions we had with him, he lost his marbles at one point and banged on the table. He said, If I have to leave, I will leave. Before I leave, I will set the country on fire. There were about ten other witnesses. He was trying to set the whole country on fire
.
QIn his televised address to the nation, the President made a whole lot of allegations against the UNP leadership. He talked about the lack of transparency in tender deals. What is your response to those allegations
First, there was the allegation about a plot to assassinate him. I have studied the case. I have seen the B report based on what was put out by the person who made this allegation. He was one of the paid employees of one of the Presidential units. In that statement, nowhere does he talk about an attempt to kill the President or former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. It is nowhere to be found.
He said he offered the prime minister post to Sajith Premadasa and Karu Jayasuriya some months ago. That is a long time ago before these allegations were made. It, again, shows that he had this enormous jealousy and inferiority complex regarding Mr. Wickremesinghe. That this allegation about someone trying to kill him is totally fabricated.
As for his allegation about corruption, every single Cabinet paper was discussed at the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM). It was a transparent, open process where the line ministers, officials were present. If it is a controversial tender, all the parties concerned were brought before it. The final decision was referred to the Cabinet. It was a very successful way of working.
His family- his daughter, son-in-law, - was very upset that they could not get these through. That is because we have such a tender process. Then, the National Economic Council was formed. It was an utter failure. Actually, it was not Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe who brought this Cabinet paper for a railway line in the Polonnaruwa district. It was not Mr. Wickremesinghe who brought a Cabinet paper to buy aircraft for Sri Lanka Airforce, built in 1968. These are the kind of things which we rejected.

QWhat is the reason for antagonism between the President and Mr. Wickremesinghe to rise to such high levels
Despite being the target of this political coup, Mr. Wickremesinghe has not criticized President Sirisena even privately. He always took his insults and all kinds of various allegations with a smile. That question should really be directed at President Sirisena. But, the real truth is that it is his burning desire to become the presidential candidate again. To do so, he tried to break our party several times, offering the prime minister posts to Mr. Premadasa and Mr. Jayasuriya. But, unlike the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), ours is a highly disciplined party which is always loyal to its leader. As a result, they did not go along with the coup. So, he decided to get together with his arch enemy. It shows how power hungry this man is.

QActually, dont you think that the policy contrasts of the two leaders along with their cultural difference added to this crisis
When he joined us at the presidential election, Ranil Wickremesinghe was a well-known politician. His whims and weaknesses were known all over. He did not come and join an unknown entity. Even the policy market-friendly policies of the UNP were well known. Knowing all these, he joined us. I remember the first speech he made at Sirikotha. He said, Even If I become the President, I would call Mr. Wickremesinghe sir.
This is the man who walked into an alliance with the UNP with all the facts in his hands. To say now that there were cultural differences was an attempt to justify the unjustifiable.

QAnyway, this is a government of two parties with contrasting policies. Isnt it
You are right. Actually, I, as the Finance Minister was very frustrated because Mr Sirisena represented an economic outlook which was long outdated. The kind of economic outlook he advocates is long outdated. It can only be found in places like Venezuela. It is a closed socialist policy that has brought ruin. He is always talking about a Deshiya economy. We have to proceed by linking up with the global economy. We must have a modern economy with the private sector having the due place. He basically was stuck in the 1970s bubble. He still wants to go back to the closed economy of the days of former Prime Minister the late Sirimawo Bandaranaike.

QDont you think that the UNP should have made certain compromises
We were making compromises all the time. When it came to the liberalization of the shipping sector, we compromised with the President and the Minister concerned, who was basically a prisoner of that shipping mafia. Likewise, we did compromise. When I brought that amendment to the alcohol law in Sri Lanka, I informed him about it. When the Buddhist priests and others protested vehemently, he asked us not to do it. He is not a leader. He proved over and over that he was a lesser being than a Grama Sevaka.

QWhat is your response to the allegation of the government being run by a Samanala Gang
I, of course, say that the butterfly is much more beautiful and dignified than a leech. Leech basically sucks off the blood of others. When sucking the blood of one person is over, it will fall out and go in search of the next person. It is very similar to what is happening now. Every decision was taken transparently by the Cabinet.

QPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his capacity of the Finance Minister, announced certain relief measures. What is your view on it as the former Finance Minister
It is a disaster. Our revenue is just enough to pay off our debt. To give these frivolous hand-outs is putting the economy in great peril.
If they go on the same path, we will face a Venezuelan or Argentinean type of crisis. In the Stock Market, what has gone out in a single day is what we lost in a year. Foreign investors are moving out like hell.

QIf you become the Finance Minister again, will you undo these measures
I will not undo my own policies. Most of these measures must be presented in Parliament.

QYou are the former Foreign Affairs Minister. There is criticism that the President was kept in the dark about the UNHRC process. What is
your response
The UNHRC resolution 30/1 was explained word by word to President Sirisena. Then, I was in New York with President Sirisena. My Foreign Ministry officials were witnesses to it. It was a great victory for Sri Lanka.
We asked the UNHRC not to present their resolution until we presented our own resolution. If not for that, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have been subjected to an international travel ban. We got it off the agenda. We made our own resolution which was co-sponsored by the United States. That is based on our own transitional justice process. We brought the three-pillared role. We saved Mahinda Rajapaksa from the guillotine.

JVP will not associate with UNP: Anura
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today said it would not associate with the UNP to form a Government or for any other purpose although it brought the No Confidence Motion against the new administration of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who expressed this sentiment during a media briefing held at the Parliamentary complex last afternoon said their intention was to form a Government of its own.
The Ranil Wickremesinghe administration was acting against the peoples mandate on a large scale and a No Confidence Motion was brought against it earlier this year. We voted in favour. We stand for truth. There may be others who claim they stand for truth but that is not relevant for us and no one could associate us with them, he said.
Mr Dissanayake added that the House did not decide that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be the Prime Minister but only passed a No Confidence Motion against the administration of Mr Rajapaksa who was appointed Prime Minister on October 26 this year.
Mr Dissanayake said what President should do now was to respect the mandate without resorting to various other tactics.
He should realise that the conspiracy of October 26 is defeated. He should decide the next course of action based on the current composition of Parliament and the mandate given by the people in 2015. The New government should be one which is based on the composition of the House, he said.
There is no Cabinet and a Prime Minister now. The President should appoint a new Prime Minister and a Cabinet. The President has enough experience in such matters. There is also a notion that if the administration formed on October 26 has no majority in the House, the administration which governed the country should be reinstated. However the Attorney General has to advise the President, he added.
He said the JVP would support a motion to dissolve the House if such a motion were to be brought in line with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
There was room for a debate on the NCM against the Rajapaksa administration. However, a group of MPs always launched a conspiracy to disrupt the House the same way which they have done on earlier occasions.
We would have come up with the interesting things if there was a debate. We were prepared for a debate. Speaker had to call for a vote as the MPs did not allow the debate to take place. There are several options when it comes to a vote and there were exercised yesterday.
No one asked for a division. Speaker asked whether anyone was against the motion. No one asked for a division. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa left the chambers at that time. He must have thought of his dignity. The President used him as a tool to contest for the Presidency once again.
Mahinda Rajapaksa had to walk out. We dont approve the response of some of the MPs. In the end, no one was against the motion. If there is a suspicion about it one can get rid of it by looking at the document, which has been signed by 122 MPs. This has been handed over to Speaker.(Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Limitation of Governance Mechanism

Limitation of Governance Mechanism
	
The Government felt that they were not accountable to internal and external actors and were highly conscious of their limited capacity to further the interest of their societies against these internal political pressures

Over the last few years, a high internal profile has been given to the development and implementation of an internally coordinatedanti-corruption strategy in Sri Lanka.
This experience allows anti-corruption strategy, and good governance agenda informing it, to be assessed and for some lessons to be drawn regarding the internal management of anti-corruption capacity building programme; designed to strengthen state institutions to ensure that anti-corruption justice to be transitional and for reconciliation to be meaningful.

Anti-Corruption activity is given much publicity during the last three years
	Narrow political interests are seen to be main concern
	The political process is increasingly played out through the language of corruption and anti-corruption

But, the major limitation of the internal regulation in the governance sphere; is that institutionalizing the unreliability of the State and dependance on poor internal mechanisms of regulation and conflict management.
This problem arises in favour of the SLFP and UNP in the country, which has led to internal regulation and reform of the governance sphere being shaped by external more than the needs of the people in the country.
The Government felt that they were not accountable to internal and external actors and were highly conscious of their limited capacity to further the interest of their societies against these internal political pressures (being an unfortunate power struggle than the countrys future).
The Governance and civil society programme developed by the Government and bureaucracy appear to give a little room for the consensus building and socially legitimating role of the political sphere.
There seems to be a view that questions of governance and social regulation can be resolved through the top-down regulation of the present administrators and the couple with the public awareness campaigning with the support of the internal and external experts.
We need to concern priorities and domestic requirements in the process of reforming, which can result in isolating corrupted ruling elites and potentially destabilizing from the political sphere.
An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, and is done under the colour of law or involves trading in influence
The political process is increasingly played out through the language of corruption and anti-corruption.
Allegations of corrupt practices have been used to provide a blank cheque to legitimize political interference by present political administrators and taken up as the language of political and personal faction-fighting among SLFP, UNP and JVP parties themselves As well as attempting to use internal and external power against their political opponents.
It has been turned into the administrative and bureaucratic questions of administrative etiquette and good practice or of good governance, alleged to stand independently of or over and above political interest.
The focus on the politicization of the corruption and the anti-corruption or the corruption of political administration in the country (present administrative system has been corrupted by political interference).
This process is clearly illustrated in the wake of the success of the political changes during January 2015, but nothing has changed despite during election corruption was high on the agenda.
Narrow political interests are seen to be main concerns, as they are based on self-interest rather than on the good society as a whole; Political corruption is that the use of powers by Government officials for illegitimate political and private gain.
An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, and is done under the colour of law or involves trading in influence.
Forms of corruption vary, but inclusion of bribery and corruption may facilitate the misuse of Government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police sadicism, is also considered political corruption. The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction.
The artificial nature of policies, implementing through administrators involved in policy processes has little awareness of the social and economic limitations.
For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, Government officials have broad or ill-defined powers; make it difficult to empower and anti-corruption capacity builders.
We need to understand international policy concerns and has marked a clear reposition in international thinking, international actors have taken leadership, todays approaches would be insisting on the regulatory role as emphasizing the importance of external guidance and international capacity (Present Government has taken consultancy from the US based anti-corruption organization and advice for restoring Central Bank of Sri Lanka) at the local level, whether we like it or not.
Though the Western-influence through the promotion of institutional changes introduced at the state level and pay less attention to how societal pressures and demand (best example is the general public attitude of the anti-corruption institution in Sri Lanka) are against on the legitimate institutional mechanisms.
This is based on the assumption that the political culture, powerful forces and challenges of corruption and nepotism and militarization, commercialization and politicization process in the country.
It has been turned into the administrative and bureaucratic questions of administrative etiquette and good practice or of good governance, alleged to stand independently of or over and above political interest
Our need is to continue that learning about history and also analyzing present context; we are already far behind as Asia continues to develop (due to poor management and corrupted administrative system in the country). As well as, we are experiencing in the influence of an Asia with increasing geopolitical power struggle (we get trapped with the geopolitical motivated lone and artificial development) but we should be intelligent enough to recognize where we should be able to get enormous benefits to the countrys economic development, peacebuilding and reconciliation programme, if we are prepared to adjust previous attitudes and policy mistakes in the country; current foreign policy must be focused on an anti-corruption approach and prioritization of good governance on international standard level current requirements of the need, international recognition, sovereignty and internal security (we must work together with the academic researchers and high-level professionals in the country to achieve this)
Once, Sri Lanka was an admirable exponent in the past, designed to maximize the benefits of amicable cooperation for all. We should endeavour to regain something at least of that earlier perceptive and strength.
There is no doubt that the Government has the greater responsibility to ensure that the requisite legal frameworks, policy implementation mechanisms, mobility are in place; corruption free country and to develop peacebuilding and to establish meaningful reconciliation and sustainable peace programme for the ethnic harmony, and also institute a culture of accountability.

Ranil falls prey to his own trap: Anura
	
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was caught in his own trap of allowing the Rajapaksa faction to flourish.
He told the Intellectuals for Democracy forum held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute that the national government was the result of the power struggle of President Maithripala Sirisena and the then Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
The sole motive of the two leaders was to secure their hold on power and this helped the Rajapaksa faction to flourish," Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said Mr. Wickremesinghe thought his political victory would be sustained by fostering divisions within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and this provided an opportunity for the Rajapaksa faction to strengthen itself.
Mr. Wickremesinghe allowed the Rajapaksa faction to thrive so as to achieve his political objectives and became a prey of the political agenda he launched," Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said President Sirisenas political agenda was to secure his faction in the government with the intention of becoming the President again in 2020 and ended up becoming a prisoner of his own agenda. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Slip showed despite the quick cover-up!
	
This story comes from a source that overheard a discussion of a group of Green Party backbenchers camping at Temple Trees determined to carry on the battle to re-take the lost power.
These politicos were Diyawanna members hailing from areas like Sabaragamuwa and Wayamba and Colombo.
One Diyawanna member was heard telling others:
How much have we told our Lokka to take head-on our rivals in this game He is playing hide-and-seek without taking the initiative! We have become helpless as a result!
Then another member had put in his own worth:
Just see, Machang! When our Lokka is silent, it is either people from other parties or newcomers to our party who do a littlesabre-rattlingg! If our Lokka does not care about what is happening, why should we stick out our necks
Yet another member who had been keeping quiet all this while had opened up:
Machang, apith yamuda (May we also go!) This question had had instantly sent up the eye brows of other members.

Finding that his suggestion had produced an effect just the opposite of what he expected, the member tried to cover up what he really meant.
Machang, what I meant, let us go home to refresh ourselves with a good bath and a brief rest!
However, the others looked at their colleague with suspicion as they believed what this colleague from Sabaragamuwa really suggested was that they quit the party to do a crossover, says the informed source.

The Bitter truth about the CEB affairs
	

Rs. 29 was paid to the ACE Power Embilipitiya Power Station for each unit of power
	In 2016 ACE Power Embilipitiya was awarded with the contract circumventing the tender procedure
	The amount payable to the private power station was in the region of Rs 850 million

At a time when electricity has become an essential need, people rarely inquire into the waste of power due to actions of the Electricity Mafia when settling their monthly bills. This colossal wastage of millions in public money is a result of fraudulent power transactions made by those at the helm of institutions, which supply power. This is a fact which many are unaware of. This weeks truthful investigation is a profile of this phenomenon. 
As and when issues arise regarding the amount of electricity generated by power stations of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), electricity is purchased from private power stations. This is in order to maintain the countrys energy supply without interruption. These purchases of power from the private sector have to be done not arbitrarily, but according to the provisions of the Act governing the supply of power while adhering to tender procedures. There are certain institutions which are directly involved when purchasing power, the primary institution being the Ceylon Electricity Board. Second, the Ministry of Power and Energy and the third is the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL). Every purchase must first receive Cabinet approval, following which the approval of the PUCSL must be sought. 
Following this procedure, the CEB entered into an agreement with a private power station named ACE Power Embilipitiya on March 9, 2003 to purchase power for a ten-year period. According to this agreement the price for one unit of power was calculated adding the total cost of the investment the relevant company has made. This was done with the aim of this power station being acquired by the Government at the expiration of the agreement. This was because the life expectancy of this power station had been estimated as 20 years. 
Accordingly Rs. 29 was paid to the ACE Power Embilipitiya Power Station for each unit of power purchased by the CEB. At the end of ten years and with the lapse of the agreement the total investment value of the company too had been settled with the company. This was nearly Rs 3 billion. With the lapse of the agreement purchasing power from this company ceased on April 6, 2015. The next episode in this story regarding the ACE Embilipitiya power station began from 2016. 
The Minister of Power and Energy presenting a Cabinet Paper on March 18, 2016, requested the purchase of private power stations regarding which the agreements had lapsed. ACE Power Embilipitiya Company was one among them. The Minister in the Cabinet paper mentioned that the Government had taken a policy decision not to extend agreements entered unto by CEB with private power stations. There had also been allegations that under these agreements the CEB had to pay a high price for obtaining power. After this Cabinet Paper was submitted, a special sub committee appointed by the Cabinet through a meeting decided on having further discussions with the owners of private power stations including ACE Power Embilipitiya with the view of purchasing these power stations. This committee was chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Employment. The other members were the secretary of the Ministry of Power, the General Manager of the CEB and a Director General. 
The relevant committee, in addition to their discussion on the purchase of the three companies, also discussed the possibility of purchasing power from the ACE Power Embilipitiya Company once again. This was followed by the submission of a Cabinet Paper dated March 29, 2016, requesting permission for the purchase of power during an emergency. Even though there was no urgency to purchase power for a period of one year, permission had been sought to obtain power from ACE Power Embilipitiya for one year while the request to enter into an agreement with the said company received approval of the Cabinet. Under this agreement it was decided to reduce 5% from capital repayments, as the company had paid back more than the total capital expenditure during the period 2004 to 2015. The price of a unit of supply had been decided upon based on capital expenditure, cost of generation and other related factors. 

Tender procedure not followed 
Accordingly the General Manager of CEB forwarded a letter dated April 1, 2016 to the PUCSL requesting the purchase of power from Ace Power Embilipitiya for a period of one year. This letter received a response by the PUCSL on April 7. Through this letter the PUCSL ruled that it could not justify the decision of the CEB to purchase power from the said company. It is stipulated in clause number 43 of the CEB Act that regarding the purchase of power the established tender procedure has to be followed.
However the tender procedure was not followed in the instance of this purchase. Although ACE Power Embilipitiya had again applied for a licence for the generation of electricity by the end of 2015, the PUCSL informed the company that they will not be issued with a licence. PUCSL giving reasons for this refusal stated that to issue a license to power stations with over 25 Megawatts output, the general treasury should make a declaration that a certain amount of ownership shares of the company has to be possessed by the Government. 
According to the Sri Lanka Electricity Board Act number 20 of 2009 and Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Act number 31 of 2013, the suitability for making a request for a power generation over 25 Megawatts lies with the CEB, a Local Council body or a state corporation, incorporated under company ordinance number 7 of 2007, and holding a number of shares as determined by the Minister of Finance and decided upon by the secretary to the treasury, a company in which the state owns more than 50 % of shares or an affiliated company. The response noted that ACE Power Embilipitiya was a completely private owned power station. 
While the generation of power continued without the license issued by the PUCSL, on December 29, 2016, another Cabinet Paper surfaced requesting the purchase of power from ACE Power Embilipitiya and two other companies for a period of one year. This request too was made outside the tender procedure. 

The Minister of Power and Energy presenting a Cabinet Paper on March 18, 2016, requested the purchase of private power stations regarding which the agreements had lapsed. ACE Power Embilipitiya Company was one among them

The Minister of Finance making his observations regarding this Cabinet paper pointed out that the dry weather present would only remain until the end of April and therefore extending the agreement for a one year period would be an additional cost to the CEB. He observed that considerations should be made over the possibility of purchasing power only during the first six months. Making his observations further on January 9, 2017 the Minister emphasised that since the Cabinet had already decided to purchase three private power stations, terminating discussions and cancelling the three agreements would reduce the expenses of the CEB. He noted that steps should therefore be taken to expedite the purchasing of these three power stations. 
However in 2016 ACE Power Embilipitiya was awarded with the contract circumventing the tender procedure to supply power for a period of one year and in 2017 the same company was awarded with the contract to supply power for another one years period sans the competitive tender procedure. 
It is well worth mentioning that in accordance with the Sri Lanka Electricity Board Act, electricity could be purchased outside the established tender procedure, only under exceptional situations like when a sovereign state makes an award for the Government of Sri Lanka, or during an emergency situation decided by the Cabinet. An emergency situation is defined as a national disaster situation or when the main generating transmission breaks down and power generation ceases. In such a situation, following a Cabinet decision, power could be purchased with the approval of the PUCSL. It is noted that in the years 2016 and 2017, a situation warranting the above conditions or an extended break down in any of the stations had not been observed by the PUCSL. 


Contradiction 
Deputy General Manager (DGM - Power Purchasing) of the CEB Sujeewa Abeywickrama informed his superior, the additional General Manager of Transmission division, in writing on February 5, 2018 with a copy to the General Manager CEB, that extending agreements with ACE Power Embilipitiya contradicts earlier cabinet decisions and clause number 43 of the Electricity Board Act. 
While this process was continuing, another Cabinet Paper dated March 15, 2018 was presented to extend the agreements with ACE Power Embilipitiya and the other private power stations for a further three years, deviating from the established procedure of competitive tenders for procurement of power. Accordingly due to the contract with ACE Power Embilipitiya to purchase power expiring on April 6, 2015, the authorities continued to obtain power deviating from the established competitive tender procedures, for a five year period between 2016 and 2021 treating it as emergency power purchase. The PUCSL meanwhile continued to reject the issuance of a power generating license stating that this action is inconsistent with clause number 43 of the Act. 
Even in the absence of a license to generate power and also the formal approval of the PUCSL, an agreement was entered unto with ACE Power Embilipitiya Company once again on April 5, 2018. In the agreement the CEB agreed to repay once again the funds already invested by the company under the original agreement. DGM Sujeewa Abeywickrama made note of this and informed in writing to all his superiors that these charges had to be amended. 
Following the extension of this agreement for the purchase of power from ACE Power Embilipitiya, the invoice for the payment for April had been received. The amount payable to the private power station was in the region of Rs 850 million for a period of 22 days in April. DGM Abeywickrama, refusing to make this clearance, stated in writing that this payment was illegal. 
The events that followed took everyone by surprise. Even before the Attorney Generals views on the legality of the agreement were obtained DGM Abeywickrama was interdicted. Meanwhile officials appointed another officer in place and took steps to obtain approval for this payment. 
The Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) which met on August 7 this year, took this matter into deliberation. The committee questioned how the purchase of electricity from ACE Power Embilipitiya continued even after the expiry of the ten-year agreement, sans any acquisition by CEB or the required tender procedures. At the meeting of the COPE Committee, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy in his presentation stated that a valuation had been obtained from the Government Valuation Department on the said power station which was Rs 2370 Million while the owner of the power station had produced a valuation amounting to Rs 2635 Million. According to the secretary the difference amounted to nearly Rs 300 million. The statement went on to detail how the owner had disagreed on the valuation of the Government valuer. Considering the need for electricity in the Southern Province and until steps were taken to purchase the power station, approval had been obtained to purchase power for a six month period, the secretary had stated. However for the years 2016 and 2017 the agreements were extended on two occasions and the CEB directed that it was better to extend the purchasing agreement rather than go into the purchase of the power station. Therefore the agreements had been further extended for three years from April 2018, the secretary had stated in the explanation. 

The relevant committee, in addition to their discussion on the purchase of the three companies, also discussed the possibility of purchasing power from the ACE Power Embilipitiya Company once again

Further investigations on this matter revealed that a recommendation report on whether the power station should be acquired or if the agreement should be extended for three years, had been prepared. According to this report the amount payable on the present nett value of the investment value (Capacity Charge) is Rs 11.92 million while the capacity value payable for five years according to present rates the nett value is Rs 18.24 million. 





Recommendations in the report 
Three recommendations were made in this report. The first recommendation was if power was purchased from this company for a period less than three years, it would be profitable to extend this agreement. Secondly, If the purchasing went beyond three years it would be profitable to purchase the power station and the final recommendation was if the agreement was for five years, it would be better to acquire the power station at the end of this period without any value. When purchasing electricity from the power station, one unit had been purchased at Rs 1.29 as the capacity value, while Rs. 76 million had been paid monthly. Calculating these figures for a period of three years, the accrued amount was Rs 2736 million, the COPE committee had observed. According to the agreement made, the CEB is to pay an additional Rs. 101 million to the said company, as the amount exceeding the capacity value of Rs 2635 million. This is minus the cost of a unit of electricity. 
One of the crucial aspects of this case unfolds here. This article related to the purchase of electricity from ACE Power Embilipitiya which was extended for another three years in April last year. Purchasing of power from this company sans all tender procedures began in 2016. With the subsequent extensions allowed, the entire period of five years ends in 2021.The amount agreed upon by the owner of the power station for the sale of the station was Rs 2,635 million. At a monthly rate of Rs. 76 million the amount that would be paid to the company without the unit price and as capacity value would be Rs 4,560 million at the end of the five years. This would amount to making a payment of Rs 1,925 million over the price quoted by the owner. If the Company was taken over by the CEB in accordance with the cabinet decision in 2016, this 1925 million and several other millions could have been saved by the CEB. 

Further investigations on this matter revealed that a recommendation report on whether the power station should be acquired or if the agreement should be extended for three years, had been prepared

It is also observed that from the year 2004 to end of 2015 and from 2016 to 2021 until the expiration of the agreement, the total amount of investment costs already paid and the balance amount payable would come to close upon Rs 7,560 million. This means that the CEB would pay Rs 4,930 million as the capacity value. According to the COPE committees observation ACE Power Embilipitiya had earned a sum of Rs 1.1 Billion in 2016 from the sale of electricity. This means that the said company had made a profit of Rs 1,100 million, an amount the CEB could have saved. 
Despite the Cabinet approval granted two years ago to purchase this company, up to the time of publication no steps have been taken to purchase the power plant. Public funds continued to feed this company violating the CEB Act as pointed out by the PUCSL. The truth about whether underhand dealings resulted in this colossal waste of public funds could only be revealed if the Criminal Investigation Department or any other independent institute is entrusted with a complete investigation.

The  Buddha and the Sahibs
	
The story of how Lankan chronicles helped British orientalists discover Indias lost emperor Ashoka
Charles Allen has written two books The Buddha and the Sahibs and AshokaThe Search for Indias Lost Emperor. The second book, written about a decade after the first one, is largely an expansion of the first.
Both are the stories of the Orientalists who discovered Indias lost history, the lost Emperor Ashoka, and the Buddha Dhamma that thrived in India during Ashokas time. Their methods of discovery were crude, sometimes outright criminal by todays standards. Allen weaves his tale in a way to take the readers along with the discoverers while (mostly) permitting the readers to judge for themselves.
Among the most interesting are William Oriental Jones, who established the Asiatic Society of Bengal; James Prinsep, who deciphered Ashoka texts; George Turnour, who translated Mahawansa from Pali to English; Alexander Cunningham, who discovered many of the Buddhist pilgrimage sites; Dr. Waddell, who discovered Kapilavastu and Lumbini; and John Marshall, who finally introduced proper methods of archeological excavation.
Here, he observed that the language was not Sanskrit, but a vernacular modification of it, which had been fortunately preserved in Pali scriptures of Ceylon and Ava
Prinsep worked to decipher the lettering on the pillar known as the Feroz Shahs Lat or Delhi No 1 for four years. His breakthrough came when he examined two dozen brief inscriptions of the same lettering at the Great Stupa at Sanchi. Prinsep guessed that these short inscriptions could only be records of donations. He was struck by the fact that almost all short transcripts ended with the same word with two characters; a snake-like squiggle and an inverted T followed by a single dot.
Here, he observed that the language was not Sanskrit, but a vernacular modification of it, which had been fortunately preserved in Pali scriptures of Ceylon and Ava, a nineteenth century Burmese kingdom. Prinseps assistant with Pali was a Sinhalese named Ratna Paula (quite likely a corruption of the name Rathanapala). Both in Sanskrit and in Pali, the verb to give was dana and the noun giftor donation was dana<U+1E41> sharing the same Indo-European root as the Latin donare (to give) and donus (gift). This led to the recognition of the word dana<U+1E41>, teaching Prinsep the two letters, d and n of Brahmi 1. The snake-like squiggle represented the sound da, and the inverted T with the single dot the sound na<U+1E41>.
Also, Prinsep noticed that a single letter (like an inverted y) appeared frequently before or near the terminal word. Prinsep determined this letter to mean of, the equivalent of Pali ssa,based on his earlier investigations of the coins from Saurashtra. If his hunch was correct, then the general structure of each sentence was something like So-and-so of the gift. Prinseps translation of one such Sanchi inscription is Isa-palitasa-cha Samanasa-cha dana<U+1E41> (The gift of Isa-Palita and of Samana.)
The opening sentence of Delhi No 1 had been observed to repeat itself again and again at the start of many sections or paragraphs of text in the pillar inscriptions and on the rock edicts. This, Prinsep could now read as Devanampiya piyadasi raja heva<U+1E41> aha. After conferring with Ratna Paula, Prinsep concluded that this opening phrase was best represented in English as Thus spake King Piyadasi, Beloved of the Gods. Prinsep published his findings in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in April, 1837.
Who was Piyadasi
But who was the author of these extraordinary edicts Who was Piyadasi Prinsep couldnt find a Piyadasi in all Hindu genealogical tables that he consulted. Only one possible candidate presented himself, one who had emerged from George Turnours translations of the Pali Chronicles of Ceylon: King Devanampiatissa succeeded his father on the throne of Ceylon in the year of Buddha 236.
In a letter sent to Prinsep on June 6th of 1837, Turnour excitedly revealed the identity of Piyadasi. I have made a most important discovery. You will find in the introduction to my Epitome that a valuable collection of Pali works was brought back to Ceylon from Siam, by George Nodaris, mudaliar in 1812. While casually turning the leaves of the manuscript I had hit upon an entirely new passage relating to the identity of Piyadasi  who, the grandson of Chandragupta, and own son of Bindusara, was at the time Viceroy of Ujjayani.
King Devanmpriya Piyadasi of the Feroz Shar Lat inscription (Delhi 1) was not King Devanampiathissa of Sri Lanka, as Prinsep had assumed. He was his Indian contemporary Ashoka Maurya.
After Prinseps death his work was continued. Alexander Cunningham relied on the accounts of the Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Xuanzang to discover the Buddhist pilgrim sites. Faxians Records of Buddhist Kingdoms was translated in 1836, and Xuanzangs History of the Life of Xuanzang and His Travels in India was translated in 1853. Faxian, who travelled to India in 400 CE, identified Ashoka as Wuyou Wang (The King Not Feeling Sorrow). Faxian visited Sankisa, and Lumbini, and from Lumbini travelled south to cross the Ganges at the point he describes as the confluence of the five rivers, just upstream of the capital of the country of Maghada: Pataliputra. Faxian describes Wuyous palace and his towering city walls and gates as being inlaid withsculpture-work.
You will find in the introduction to my Epitome that a valuable collection of Pali works was brought back to Ceylon from Siam, by George Nodaris, mudaliar in 1812. While casually turning the leaves of the manuscript I had hit upon an entirely new passage relating to the identityof Piyadasi
However, Cunningham assumed that Pataliputra must have been swept away by the changing course of the Ganges. Dr. Waddell thought otherwise. Taking together both Faxian and Xuanzang accounts, Waddell prepared a chart of Ashokas palaces and other chief monuments, and his chart led him over a railway line that marked the southern limits of old Patna, to a series of mounds known as Panch Pahari or the Five Brothers. He wrote afterwards, I was surprised to find most of the leading landmarks of Ashokas palaces, monasteries, and other monuments when reexamined so very obvious that I was able in the short space of one day to identify many of them beyond all doubt. Around the modern village Kumrahar,
Buddhas alms bowl
As mentioned before, not all sahibs treated their objects respectfully. James Campbell, the Commissioner of Customs, Salt, Opium and Akbari in Bombay Presidency in the 1890s, excavated several sites in Gujarat. Among his early triumphs was finding a new Ashokan rock edict, which he had allowed to be taken to bits, mislaid, and lost. A relic subsequently identified by the accompanying inscription as a segment of Buddhas alms bowl was thrown away. He then moved on to tear apart the Girnar Mound, a large stupa a few miles south of the famous Girnar rock inscription.
In spite of some irresponsibility, all of these men contributed to the rediscovery of Indias past. The books that tell their stories are excellent, and in this reviewers judgment both should belong in any Sri Lankans private library.

UNP to occupy government benches in Parliament: Sujeewa
	
UNP claimed that it will occupy the benches meant for the government when Parliament meets tomorrow.
UNP MP Sujeewa Senasinghe revealed this at a media briefing held this evening.
We will occupy the benches meant for the government parliamentarians when the House meets as we have emerged as the legitimate government as a majority has rejected the administration led by the newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said.
We hope the Speaker and the staff in the House will provide seats for us on government benches, he added.
He also defended the Speakers decision to take up a voice vote. There are provisions for the Speaker to call for a voice vote when members cause a disturbance without a debate or a vote taking place, he said.
It was revealed that discussions are underway to decide on the next course of action and to ensure normalcy in the country. (Yohan Perera)

West should not meddle with internal matters: Prelate
	
The Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathna Thera said on Tuesday that Western countries should not infringe on Sri Lankas internal matters.
The prelate expressed these views when Buddha Sasana Affairs Minister Udaya Gammanpila called on the Thera.
The Ven. Thera said following the change of the Government, it was now possible to save many resources that were about to be surrendered to the foreign countries.
Western forces had become displeased over the sudden political change happened in Sri Lanka without their knowledge and we have to confront strong foreign forces such as the USA, India and Europe and therefore we should not engage clashes over minor matters within the country, Minister Udaya Gammanpila said.
He said the process of appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister was done very secretly and it was not known even to his family.
These foreign forces do not recognize our Government and engage in doing all that they can do to obstruct the Government and our aim is to strengthen our power through an election. The President has decided to hold an election to show peoples sovereignty under the democracy.
Minister further said that UNP was able to get only 29.65 per cent of votes which shows 70 per cent of people opposing them and they were attempting to divide the country into nine through a federal constitution which was to be presented in parliament on 07 November. However, this attempt was thwarted with the prorogation of the parliament.
The Anunayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Thera said in the recent past there was instability in a country over some matters and movement of parliamentarians to and fro and it is a matter for regret to see them changing the parties.
Changes for the monetary gain is inappropriate unless it is on policy matters, he said.
This change has averted the transferring of nations assets to foreigners. We all should unite to achieve the full benefit of the change without leaving the opportunity for the rivals, he said.
The Minister also visited the Dalada Maligawa and received the blessings. The Kandy Buddhist Affairs Commissioner Parakrama Jayawardena were also present on the occasion.
The Minister also visited the Malwatte Chapter Maha Nayake Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

Will request for a full-judge bench: Govt.
	
The government yesterday maintained that the Supreme Courts interim order does not mean that the dissolution of parliament has been cancelled and said that it would request for a full-judge bench to hear the case.
Addressing a hurriedly called news briefing last night at the Prime Ministers Office, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said respondents have a right to request for a full-judge bench comprising nine to 11 Judges to hear a case.
People should note that the Supreme Court has not yet made a final decision on the gazette issued by the President dissolving parliament. The final ruling will be made on December 7. There is no finality in the matter as of yet, he said.
He said they were waiting for the court ruling and also fighting hard to go for an election. We will abide by the Supreme Courts decision, he said.
Minister Siripala said there were misconception that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya can appoint a new Prime Minister by reconvening parliament. Under the Constitution, only the President can appoint a Premier or other ministers, he said.
Even if the Speaker appoints a purported Prime Minister, the appointment is not valid. If the Opposition parties aspire to remove Mahinda Rajapaksa from the Prime Minister post, they will have to bring in a no-confidence motion (NCM) against him. The NCM has to be included in the order book for five days, taken up for a debate followed by a vote. This is the only way available to remove a Premier, he said.
Minister Susil Premajayantha said no one has challenged in the Supreme Court the gazette issued by the President appointing Mr. Rajapaksa as the Premier and therefore, there is no impact on the Premiership by the interim order.
Meanwhile, Minister Dinesh Gunawardana said only the gazette which was issued dissolving parliament has been suspended and that it had no effect on the election which is scheduled to be held in January. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Wilpattu deer interrupted his night dreams!
	
The recent political developments have sent the khaki chief into a flurry of excitement, they say.
His peculiar conduct these days has become a matter for concern for some, while it has become a source of amusement for some others. Ever since the sudden regime-change, the chief had been giving calls to the former defence bigwig one after another resorting to some excuse or other.
The former defence bigwig had been fast asleep when his cell phone shrilled at predawn the other day. Given the prevailing volatile situation in the country, he hastened to answer the call to find it was from the khaki chief. Sir, Ive got an important piece of news to convey to you. Hence this call! Ah! Something important. Out with it! the former bigwig had replied.
Yes! Sir, A surprise! I thought sir should be the first to know it! Sir, Sir, this morning in Wilpattu today the khaki chief was stammering.
Yes! Yes! What happened, the former defence bigwig asked. He was now losing his patience. Sir, Sir, a man had slaughtered a deer in Wilpattu. My men have nabbed both the man and the carcass! We have to put a stop to poaching like this
I say, have you gone mad in the wee hours of this morning Your deer Wilpattu! You broke my night rest for nothing! He had angrily rung off after rebuking the khaki chief.
