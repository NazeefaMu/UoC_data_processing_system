Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said a Court ruling was expected on January 30 when the petition filed by two students with regard to the registration of the Malabe private medical college SAITM by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is taken up for hearing.

He said several private sector institutions have already expressed their willingness to open medical colleges which would help students to pass out as doctors and save Rs.7,000 million annually which would have to be spent if they study abroad.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)
