Effects peculiar to Saturn’s malefic periods


	



 

Sade Sati or Shani Erashtaka – Part 2

 

By Sandagomi
Saturn takes about 2 ½ years to traverse one sign or Rashi of the 12-sign - Zodiac or one day to travel past one degree in the Zodiacal circle. This means that every person who lives over 30 years would invariably come under a Shani Erashtaka. 

 

A harsh impact on Cancer natives


We explained in our previous article that the most evil period attributed to Saturn is the Jamma Shani Erashtaka, and the full impact of the malefic period would visit on the Cancer natives. 

 

Evil effects during childhood


    A person coming under Jamma Shani Erashtaka during his/her childhood would suffer from all diseases that children would normally fall victim to.  A native would suffer from a fracture, a ligature tear or a severe sprain or an injury in the left leg with the advent of Saturn to the 12th House or the sign previous to the one where the Moon was placed at birth. (We have already explained in the previous article that Saturn’s advent to this sign marks the beginning of his 7 ½ year – Erashtaka period and Saturn’s 2 ½ year-transit in the sign where the Moon is posited at birth is the mid-phase of the three-phase malefic period.)  


If it is an injury that the native suffers, it would remain unhealed for several months even if it is a minor one. 


When a child comes under Shani Erashtaka during the school-going age, he/she would fall victim to a disease or an injury which would affect his/her mobility or he/she would run away from home leading to a disruption of his/her schooling. The child would become mentally unsound and would look on everyone as his/her enemies.  Once he/she leaves home, he/she would become a vagabond. He/she would visit friends and relatives at odd hours and would become a nuisance to them.  He/she would wander about half-starved and garbed in a dirty rags.  Even if he/she is brought back home, he/she would not resume schooling. 

 

Effects of Erashtaka at young age


When a person at a young age comes under the Erashtaka, if employed he (‘she’ is also meant wherever the pronoun ‘he’ is used) would mess up his job. He would be so clumsy in his work; his superiors would decide to terminate his services. Friends and relatives would shun him.   


He would act as one who has lost his mindfulness. He would suffer from a serious injury or a fracture on the left leg.  He would go from place to place in search of a job, but he would not get one.  Once the Erashtaka period is over, the native would secure a job and would settle down to a quiet normal life.  He might become even rich and make a great success of his life. 

 

How it affects occupation and life after marriage


When a person comes under the Erashtaka after marriage, his wife would fall sick and may not live long, unless there is a powerful planetary combination in her horoscope assuring her of longevity. A native would lose his job and he would be shunned by parents and relatives. 


Even his children would suffer in various ways.  


They would, for example, become subject to constant illness and their schooling would get disrupted. People who earlier respected him, would look the other way when they see him now.  If he is a farmer, insects, rodents and various pests would ruin his crops.  


Flies and birds would destroy his fruits and vegetables.  If the native happens to be a trader, only customers buying on credit would visit his store or shop.  If the native is a physician only terminally ill patients would consult him. If the native is a Minister in the State, he would lose his portfolio.
