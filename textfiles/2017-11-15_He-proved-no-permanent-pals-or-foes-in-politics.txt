JO stalwart Panchaudha of ‘Fast-unto-death’ fame had a surprise the other day when he got a telephone call from the purohita who was at the centre of the recent oil fiasco.

 


Panchaudha’s surprise transformed into exultation when the purohita said that he called him to thank him!


“I wanted to thank you because you are the only opposition member who explained to the country the real complexion of the oil crisis we had to face!”


The purohita proceeded to confide in Panchaudha. He told him as to who unsuccessfully pressured him to call back the oil tanker carrying the sub-standard oil shipment which he turned back. 


Panchaudha is expected to divulge shortly the parties who pressured the purohita to have the substandard oil unloaded for distribution in our country, they say.


Meanwhile, Panchaudha’s party sources say that at least two Betel leaf purohitas are involved in the alleged political pressure scandal.
