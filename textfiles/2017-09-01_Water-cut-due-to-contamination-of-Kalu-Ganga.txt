The water supply to several areas within the Moratuwa Urban Council limits, Panadura and Horana has been interrupted because of the likelihood of the water in the Kalu Ganga being contaminated with fuel, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said.

A spokesman said a petrol bowser had toppled into paddy field at Ingiriya this morning leading to fears that as a result the river water may be contaminated.

The water supply to Boralesgamuwa, Bandaragama, Piliyandala, Kesbewa, Raigama, Moronthoduwa, Welmilla, Millaniya, Kiriberiya, Keselwatte, Kumbukka and Kahathuduwa was also interrupted.
