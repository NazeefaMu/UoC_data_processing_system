Allow TN fishermen for Katchatheevu festival: PMK
	
Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S.Ramadoss on Saturday demanded that fishermen from Tamil Nadu should be allowed to take part in the festival in St. Anthonys church in Katchatheevu in Sri Lanka on December 7.
In a statement, he said though the church was built by people belonging to Lanka, Katchatheevu was under the control of Tamil Nadu fishermen for a long time.
The agreement between the two countries on Katchatheevu clearly mentions that Ramanathapuram fishermen should be allowed to attend the St. Anthony church festival, he pointed out.
It had not been specified that they could attend only the festivals in March and not in other months, Ramadoss argued. The reasons cited by the centre for not allowing Tamil Nadu fishermen was not acceptable, he said and added it does not matter if the festival is big or small.
The islet had been transferred to Lanka without the consent of Tamil Nadu, he said and added that the state government had supported the Ramanathapuram fishermens demand for participation in the festival.(DC)

MR wont split SLFP, says Grero
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa didnt like to split, leave or harm for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and he didnt even show a sign of doing such thing, State Minister for higher education Mohan Lal Grero stated in an event held in Mt. Lavinia yesterday.
He knows the ABC of the history of the party and what happened when the party was split at times. Once the party split into three parties but finally under the leadership of Chandrika Bandaranaike, we won with a huge majority votes and established a strong government. So, the party is going to establish an SLFP government when the time arises, Grero stated.
He said that just because the leader of the SLFP President Maithripala Sirisena was patient it doesnt mean he was a not a strong character.
Grero said that the President was a well experienced politician and a strong leader.

SLMC gets ultimatum
	
The Elections Commission has issued a deadline on Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) to settle its internal dispute with regard to the post of Party Secretary who would deal with matters concerning elections with the Commission.
Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya in a letter to SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem and Secretary A.C.A.M. Mansoor with a copy to the Secretary General M.T. Hassan Ali had stated that unless the party settled this dispute before December 15, the Commission would have to treat the SLMC as a party with internal conflict.
Mr. Deshapriya had pointed out the SLMC, that only the post of secretary would matter for the Commission in respect of a political party and two secretaries or positions of secretary and secretary general would not be accepted.
Reminding the SLMC's communication to the Commission, which claimed that two posts, by the name of Secretary and Secretary General had been created by an amendment to the party constitution on November 7, 2015 and Mr. A.C.A.M. Mansoor has been appointed to the post of Secretary in place of Hassan Ali, who had thus far held the post of Secretary General, the Commission states that Mr. Ali had objected to his name being removed from the list of Secretaries of recognised political parties.
The Chairman of the Commission has pointed out that the SLMC had so far failed to settle its dispute over the post of Secretary and had issued December 15 as the deadline for the party to do so, while informing the party to legally institute only one post out of the disputed two posts, and communicate it to the Commission before the deadline.
He also stated that he would take action not to display any of the names of the two disputed posts in the list of recognised political party secretaries until the SLMC resolved the matter on the date.
