Avant Garde used as a mudguard to cover up burning issues - Gammanpila

The Government is using the Avant Garde issue as a mudguard in order to cover up all the burning issues and it should tell the country which law had been violated by Avant Garde, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said.
Addressing media in Colombo yesterday he said that all local law experts have already stated that no law had been violated by Avant Garde but only Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake say that it had violated laws. He was addressing the press briefing of the common opposition.
General Secretary of Socialist Freedom Front Raja Collure said that the rule of law has ceased to exist in the country and the Attorney General as the Government's lawyer has been subjected to ridicule. The rule of law cannot be ignored or overlooked for political expediency . The same Minister is responsible for both Law and Justice. Tilak Marapana is one of the prominent and respected former Attorney Generals and he resigned because he could not work according to his conscience. He protected the rule of law.
The Chief Organizer of the Common Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said that Avant Garde is used by the Government in order to make people forget about all the other burning issues. If there is anything wrong with Avant Garde, the Government should expose it.
DLF Leader and MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that the Government was in a political mess and it is connected to many issues such as Avant Garde,the Central Bank bond issue, the corrupt coal tender etc. All Ministers are under the control of the Prime Minister and all responsibilities goes to him. It was revealed that recently one minister openly criticized him and received a very good positive response from the other UNP Ministers and MPs.
