Kanthan not at court today


	

Former top ranked LTTE Leader Emil Kanthan’s Counsel informed the Colombo Special High Court that his client could not appear before court today as the Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court had issued an arrest warrant on him.

The suspect’s red notice and warrants were recalled by the Colombo Special High Court after lawyers who appeared for him assured their client would produce himself before the court within two weeks.

Lakshman Perera appearing for Kanthan, the second suspect accused of attempting to murder former Minister Douglas Devananda, said his client’s stance on appearing in court had not changed.

State counsel who appeared for the Attorney General’s department requested the court give time to report AG’s opinion on this regard.

The case was postponed seeking AG’s opinion for March 2. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
