Comey slams White House ‘lies’ in blockbuster testimony


	



 

Ousted FBI chief James Comey accused the White House of lies and defamation Thursday, in explosive testimony that painted Donald Trump as dishonest and operating far outside presidential norms.  


During almost three hours of blockbuster sworn testimony to a Senate panel, Comey described himself as “stunned” by Trump’s “very disturbing” and “very concerning” behaviour during several private meetings.  


Expanding on the bombshell statement released on the eve of his appearance, Comey said the president asked him for “loyalty” during a White House dinner and to lay off former national security advisor Mike Flynn --who is under criminal investigation-- imploring Comey to “let this go.” 


 “It’s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” he told senators. “I was fired in some way to change, or the endeavour was to change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted. That is a very big deal.” Detailing private talks with a sitting president, which under normal circumstances would never see the light of day, Comey said he took painstaking notes of the extraordinary encounters for fear Trump might “lie” about the meetings.  


Comey indicated that it was now up to a high-powered special prosecutor to determine whether the president’s behaviour constituted an obstruction of justice, a potentially impeachable offence.  


Trump avoided directly responding to the explosive accusations, defiantly telling supporters at a religious event in the capital: “We are going to fight and win.” But the White House hit back angrily at Comey.
