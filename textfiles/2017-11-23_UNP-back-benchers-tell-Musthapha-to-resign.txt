UNP back-benchers tell Musthapha to resign


	

UNP back bench parliamentarians today challenged Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha to resign from his portfolio before the gazette on delimitation was proved incorrect.

UNP MP Kavinda Jayawardhane told a news conference held at the parliament complex that the minister should resign and sit at the back row as an ordinary MP.

He said the UNP was ready to join any force to win the elections as claimed by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

Mr. Jayawardhane said it was the SLFP and the joint opposition who wanted to postpone the elections.

He said the SLFP leaders and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa, Dilan Perera and Nimal Siripala De Silva were doing a deal to join the SLFP, UPFA and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and that it was they who were delaying the election till the deal was done.

"That is their dream. We cannot wait till they join the opposition. The President has powers to hold the elections. UNP was not in control of the local bodies for the past 20 years. We are waiting to show our powers. It is unreasonable to taint our hopes," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
