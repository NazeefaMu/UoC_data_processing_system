Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said in no uncertain terms that the decision taken by the ministry to ban the use of Laila and Suruku nets would be implemented from February 21.

At a discussion with two fishing communities at the ministry, the minister said today anyone using the banned Laila and Suruku nets for fishing after February 21 would be arrested and the equipment and the boats confiscated.

“The fishing communities in the country should comply with the conditions in the line with the circular on fishing. The ministry decision will not change. We have instructed the Navy, the Coast Guard and the Police to arrest those carrying out illegal fishing and to take necessary action against them,” he said.

The two fishing communities had reportedly engaged in a heated argument on the contents of the circular.

The local fishermen said most of their problems had arisen because of the poaching by Indian fishermen. In response the minister said Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters would be arrested and their boats, the catch and fishing equipment would be confiscated. He said this matter was discussed with the Indian Foreign Affairs Minister during her recent visit to Sri Lanka.

Currently some 20 Indian fishermen are in Sri Lankan custody.

Last year the Navy and the Coast Guard had taken into custody explosives such as 159kg of water gel, 26Kg of TNT, 5Kg of Gelignite, 5.74Kg of C4, 33 meters of safety fuse, 358 detonators, 157 illegal fishing nets, 121 boats, 120 boat engines, 3092Kg of sea cucumber, 13048Kg of conch shell, 5000Kg of endangered fish species and 380 fishermen who had engaged in illegal fishing.

The minister warned the two fishing communities not to take the law into their hands and inform the Navy or the coast guard if any illegal fishing was taking place. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
