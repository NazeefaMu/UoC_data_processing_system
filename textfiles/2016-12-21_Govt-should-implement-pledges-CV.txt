“The government should implement without delay the pledges made regarding the Tamil people while entering into pacts,” said C. V. Wigneswaran, the Chief Minister of the Northern Province

He made this statement at a media briefing which followed a meeting of the Tamil National Council held on Monday at the Jaffna Library.

He said that, in 2009, the then President of Sri Lanka had made a promise to Ban Ki-moon that the government would undertake to ensure the welfare of the Tamil people in future. "It is good to examine whether the present government has honoured these pledges," he said.

"Another pact had been signed in Geneva and it is relevant to examine whether what was contained in that pact for the betterment of the Tamil people has been implemented. A third describes how our country should change by 2030 and what should be done for the people. It is prudent for the government to show what changes they would make and what they intend doing for the people," he said.

He said most of these promises could be fulfilled. "What has to be done in accordance with all these pacts has not been done, and that had led to various problems. If what needed to be done had been done, we could forge ahead in peace and harmony," he said. (Romesh Madushanka)
