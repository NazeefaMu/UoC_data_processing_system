Norway is the best country to live in the world

NORWAY: It is not easy to stay on top for 12 long years, especially when it comes to being the best nation in the world to live in.
However, Norway has lived up to its reputation and has been adjudged the best country in the world to live in - for the 12th consecutive year.
The list of 188 countries has been released as part of the annual UN Human Development Report. It takes into account the Human Development Index, which is a measure of basic human developments.
On the opposite end of the scale, Niger, Central African Republic and Eritrea are three of the worse places to live.
The rankings were based on the Human Development Index announced by the United Nation’s Development Programme this week. The USA came in at number eight while the UK was further down at joint 14th position with Sweden.
Surprises came further down the list when Hong Kong ranked 12 but China ranked just 90, joint with Fiji and Mongolia. Vanuatu, a place that once came top on a ‘happy planet index’ came in at just 134 with Syria.
Qataris were on average the wealthiest, with a GNI per capita of $123,124 (£82,022) - but this was capped at $75,000 (£49,963) for the calculation of the HDI.
Central African Republicans were the poorest, with a GNI per capita of just $581 (£387).
This value was based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), or the amount of goods you could buy with your dollar.
The people of Burkina Faso were the least educated, with a mean schooling of just 1.4 years, while Germany had a mean schooling of 13.1 years.
If you want to live a long life, it’s best to head to Hong Kong where life expectancy is 84 years. In contrast, those living in Swaziland only had a life expectancy of 49 years.
Seven countries and territories were not ranked, including North Korea, Marshall Islands and Monaco.
The HDI also doesn’t take into account of things like human rights, pollution or the hours of work.
