Water project to combat kidney disease

The North Central Provincial Council will set up a safe pipe borne water supply scheme in an attempt to combat the proliferation of kidney disease among residents. Chief Minister Peshala Bandara Jayaratne said the project will be implemented next year.
The project will be centered round water bodies to cover villages. Filtration plants will also be in place to purify water. Meanwhile, steps have been taken to provide water filters to schools in the province.
Proper sanitation facilities will be ensured in school buildings planned in the province.
