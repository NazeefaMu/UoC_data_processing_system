	The National Police Commission (NPC) said today it had informed Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon to take disciplinary action against the low-ranking police personnel who were found to have been involved in the attack on HNDA students.
	NPC Secretary N. Ariyadasa Cooray said the report of the three-member committee, appointed by the NPC to inquire into the October 29 attack, was taken up for discussion today prior to the IGP being directed to take disciplinary action on those involved.
	He said only the Police Chief had the authority to take the low-ranking police personnel to task.
	“According to the report several police personnel below the rank of Chief Inspector had been involved in the attack on the protesting HNDA students at Ward Place. However, we are yet to decide on the involvement of any high-raking police officers if at all,” he said.  
	A three-member committee, comprising senior officers of the administrative service, was appointed by the NPC on November 2 to investigate the attack.
	The committee had handed over its 57-page report to the NPC on November 19.  The NCP earlier recorded statements from senior DIG Pujith Jayasundara, DIG Gamini Mathurata and SSP Champika Siriwardana on this matter. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
