Judicature (Amendment) Bill passed


	

The Judicature (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament a short while ago without a vote at the third reading.

The government earlier said the Judicature (Amendment) Bill would provide provisions to set up a special trial-at-bar.

The legislation is expected to make the judiciary efficient as the new trial-at-bar will sit daily and hear cases on corruption. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
