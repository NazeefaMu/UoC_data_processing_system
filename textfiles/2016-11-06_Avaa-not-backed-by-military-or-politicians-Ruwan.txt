State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene yesterday dismissed statements that the ‘Aava’ group operating the Northern Province had political and military backing of the government.

He said the government would not let anyone or any organization in the country to take the law into their hands, especially after the end of the three decade long war.

“The group called Aava is a small number of people who are trying to distress the public”, he said.

Addressing an event in Biyagama, the State Minister said he disappointed that some individuals were trying to gain political mileage by connecting the ‘Aava’ group to the military.

 “The security forces have identified the members involved with the Aava group. They will be arrested soon and punished in accordance with the law,” mnister said.

The country that was freed by the military would be protected in years to come, Wijewardene said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
