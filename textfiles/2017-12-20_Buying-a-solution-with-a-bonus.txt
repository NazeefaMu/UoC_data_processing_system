Buying a solution with a bonus


	



 

A Diyawanna member from the gem-rich area the other day called on a yahapalanaya purohita hailing from the same area to strike a deal to get over a big problem he was facing.

 


The Diyawanna member wanted to wrap up the deal to suit his own terms, but the purohita who gauged the desperate situation the member was placed in took a firm stand on the bargain and finally the member agreed to the terms that the purohita stipulated. 


The end-result is that the member has agreed to make a somersault to yahapalanaya, they say.
The JO big guns on hearing about this are said to be making counter moves to prevent the imminent event.


Meanwhile, there are indications that the deal is likely to fall through due to a different reason: the member is insisting on team member status at state level and there is no positive response to it from the highest echelons so far, they say.
