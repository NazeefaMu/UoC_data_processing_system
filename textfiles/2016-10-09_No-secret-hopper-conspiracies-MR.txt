Former president and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said that he was not used to conspiring or making secret plans after having hoppers for dinner.

“All my games and plans are out in the open. There are no secrets,” he told the joint opposition rally held in Ratnapura on Saturday.

He said the joint opposition would form a joint government by uniting all parties and fronts which are against the national government.(Ajithlal Shantha Udaya)
