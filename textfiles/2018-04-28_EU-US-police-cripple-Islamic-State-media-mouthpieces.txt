THE HAGUE AFP April 27, 2018-European and US police forces have struck at the heart of Islamic State’s propaganda machine, seizing servers and “punching a hole” in its ability to spread its radical jihadist message online.   


The transatlantic take-down was spread over eight countries and was co-ordinated by the EU’s police agency in “a major operation over a two-year period”, the head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told AFP on Friday.   


Wednesday and Thursday’s operation was the latest in a campaign targeting in particular the Amaq news agency used by IS to broadcast claims of attacks and spread its message of jihad.   


 “With this takedown action, targeting major IS-branded media outlets like Amaq, but also al-Bayan radio, Halumu and Nasher news, IS’s capability to broadcast and publicise terrorist material has been compromised,” Europol said in a statement.   


The “simultaneous multinational takedown” was co-ordinated by Europol from its headquarters in The Hague, and led by the Belgian federal prosecutor.
