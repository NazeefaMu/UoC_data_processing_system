Video: Build flats for Muslims in Wilpattu: BBS
	
	The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) today urged the government to build flats for the Muslims who live in the vicinity of Wilpattu so that our jungles would be spared from deforestation.
It also suggested that the best way to stem the rising population in Sri Lanka was to limit each family to two children.
The BBS accused Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen of promoting racism by settling people of a particular religion in the vicinity of Wilpattu.
The Minister joined the government to get his Industry and Commerce Ministry post back and continue his racist views. He appears to have some powerful backing. If not, he should have been arrested for the things he has done so far, BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilanthe Withanage said.
If their population keeps rising, the answer is not to deforest our historical lands. We cant allow it, he said.
BBS National Organiser Witharandeniya Nanda Thera claimed that a Muslim colony was being established in Wilpattu with the backing of Minister Bathiudeen. He claimed that Buddha statues and dagobas of archaeological value were being destroyed within the sanctuary.
The Thera said Sinhala businessmen are facing difficulties in running their businesses because of pressure from Muslim businessmen who have monopolised the industry.
He said BBS has decided to establish a Public Commission on Sinhalese Business through which action will be taken to resolve the problems faced by Sinhala businessmen and women.
Meanwhile, the Thera said the BBS will soon undergo a name change and will be known as the Bodu Bala Sena Political Front with the hope of entering politics.(Piyumi Fonseka)WATCH

CA Sri Lanka, SEC reward over 80 corporate directors
	
		 		 
		 
			
A total of 23 high profile corporate directors were bestowed with the Accredited Director status, while 58 directors were awarded with certificate of participation by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 07th May 2015 for successfully completing the Corporate Directors Programme.
The awards ceremony was held under the patronage of Tilak Karunaratne, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
As the trustees of the shareholders, directors play a major role in the business and therefore being equipped with the financial reporting requirements and the governance aspects have become vital for directors to perform their duties and responsibilities diligently. With this objective in mind, CA Sri Lanka and SEC came together last year to introduce a groundbreaking programme for directors to help uplift their knowledge and skills to equip them with the required knowledge in todays constantly changing context.
The programme was conducted over ten sessions and featured a combination of lectures, panel discussions and work group sessions featuring well known experts including representatives from the corporate community, regulatory agencies, corporate lawyers, financial analysts, auditors and assurance providers.
President of CA Sri Lanka, Arjuna Herath while congratulating the directors who were awarded with the Accredited Director status and the certificates, emphasized that a directors role is both critical and wide in their capacity as trustees of shareholders.
In todays complex and constantly changing world, challenges are part and parcel of a directors daily life. Therefore as an institute which is championing good governance and is continuously endeavoring to offer the countrys professional community with the thought leadership and most pertinent of programmes for their advancement, the Corporate Directors Programme is yet another important initiative aimed at enhancing the countrys corporate leadership, he said.
He added that the importance of the programme was obvious by the overwhelming response it received, which led to a quick comeback for a second time in 2014, although the original schedule was to organize only a single programme for a year.
Meanwhile the third intake of the Corporate Directors Programme will commence today.

	Some UPFA MPs today charged that the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) was politically motivated and that was why Central Bank (CB) Governor Arjuna Mahendran had still not been summoned to the FCID over the controversial sale of CB Bonds.
	MP Bandula Gunawardane said the FCID was picking and choosing its victims and that the Cabinet Sub-Committee headed by the Prime Minister was behind these moves.
	The FCID is summoning those who are alleged to have committed crimes years ago but seems adamant not to take action against Mr. Mahendran over the controversial bond issue. This is the biggest act of corruption to have taken place in recent times, but the FCID has still not summoned him, Mr. Gunawardane told a news conference.
	Meanwhile, MP G.L. Peiris said they were not opposed to the investigation into allegations fraud and corruption but pointed out that they were against favoritism when it came to taking action against certain individuals.
	Commenting further on the CB scandal, Mr. Peiris said six UPFA MPs including former cabinet ministers would brief the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about Mr. Mahendran and his involvement in the sale of CB bonds. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

This is a difficult situation but they must uphold the law. It is better to go forward with clean people than have strength with corrupt politicians he said addressing a meeting of the party in Piliyandala.
	Fonseka said that they pledged to the people a clean slate and an era devoid of corruption.
	We pledged the people that the law will rule the land. That no one will be above the law. The President has to ensure that this promise is kept. If there are corrupt people who ruled the country, they should face the consequences. No one can be above the law he said.
