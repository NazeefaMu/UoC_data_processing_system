ASSAULTS OF TOURISTS DEALT WITH FAST UNLIKE IN THE PAST


	



Suspects of alleged assault on Dutch tourists in Mirissa are taken to court

 

It was most welcome that the incident of a Dutch tourist assaulted by 16 people on the beach in Mirissa was dealt with fast with all culprits arrested. When an incident of rape and murder happened during the past regime, nothing was done till it was brought up in Britain and then dealt with. The perpetrator of this most horrendous crime, was a supporter of the then ruler and protected till there was pressure from Britain. Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Tourism Minister John Amaratunga, The Chairman of the Weligama UC, Rehan Jayawickreme and the Tourist Board headed by Kavan Ratnayake have to be thanked for getting this done and for the increased presence of Tourist Police in the area.  
People who are quick to pick nits and criticize must be aware of the vast difference between the two governments, on dealing with incidents of this nature which are a disgrace to our reputation as a paradise for tourists and therefore a hindrance to tourism. When the price of medicines was reduced, there were hardly any accolades by the public, but when the prices went up because of the exchange rate,there was a huge hue and cry.

The government publicity machine must also be blamed for not giving enough publicity to the good things done. I was glad that at last two of our UNP Ministers did contradict false propaganda, expose the fabrications and defend the UNP and the Leader. They are Navin Dissanayake and Harsha de Silva. Navin was quick to come back on a fabrication written recently, that the politburo was appointed by the UNP leader and was done to create a rift between Sajith Premadasa and him. 
The politburo was elected by secret ballot by the committee appointed to go into ways and means of restructuring the party. There were some on the latter committee who are certainly not Ranil Wickermesinghe loyalists. Harsha also made a statement which was loud and clear, that this was the first time that office bearers were appointed by vote at the working committee and not by the Leader. I wish other Ministers and MP’s too would follow the example of these two, some are quick to blow their own trumpets instead of defending the party and the Leader. I was shocked like many other UNP supporters to read of one Minister making a statement that he voted against the No Confidence Motion to hang on to his perks and privileges. One wonders if this was the reason he came into politics! Others have also made adverse comments which sound like sour grapes because they were not voted in through the secret ballot to be on the politburo. They are spoiling the laurels that came the way of the UNP after the No Confidence Motion in which they thankfully stood together as a team for the vote, showing that they were indeed the grand old party, not only in name but through word and deed. Still another who accepted office,was apparently shown on TV shouting his dissatisfaction. Why did he accept the post he was given? By making statements to the press,they are only helping the JO and nobody else. Do they want a return to white vans, rampant corruption, violence and a dictatorship by one family running the country by instilling fear and subservience?  

 


It is another joke that those who lost at the last elections and are only there by the grace and favour of the President are also hurling abuse at the UNP and its leader. Still another who was with Mahinda Rajapaksa, castigated President Maithripala Sirisena in no uncertain terms at the Presidential elections and who jumped fences soon after, is also one of the most vociferous critics of the PM. His own political history is none other than a party jumper which he has done more than once. The PM is being criticized both within and outside the party for Ravi Karunanayake being assistant Leader once again. This too was put to the vote, the working committee was asked if they wished to propose any other names, none were proposed and only two opposed his name, therefore he was elected.   
 But it is important that the UNP leader must instill more discipline and insist that Ministers and MPs belonging to the UNP, must refrain from airing their views on internal party matters to the media. This should be done within the precincts of the corridors of power in the party. He must insist that they go on the attack against the previous regime, talk about the misdeeds and talk about what the government has done,defend the party and Leader when attacked as Navin and Harsha have done, showing their political maturity. Ranil has been the linchpin of the UNP through the worst times with his quiet resourceful strength, but he must assert his authority in a tougher way both within the party and as Prime Minister, to see that those guilty of corruption, murder and other misdeeds in the previous regime are punished soon. This is what most people are grumbling about, that little has been done to punish these culprits. Unless this is done we will be on the road to nowhere and back to the vandalizing of democracy and the end of justice and freedom.

The UNP in the past never had deputy and assistant Leaders. This was done by Ranil  who continues to do so although some in these roles stabbed him in the back! The UNP is fortunate in its second line as most of these are educated professionals, and it is  Ranil who is responsible for this as mentioned by Navin in a recent interview. Those who lost their electorates at the recent local government elections have no right to talk about a change in Leadership. I am glad that senior UNPers like John Amaratunga, D.M. Swaminathan and Gamini Jayewickreme Perera spoke out in support of the Leader, quoted the UNP constitution and reminded members that they would have been thrown out by former leaders, like the late Presidents J.R. Jayawardane and R. Premadasa if they had spoken out to the media against party decisions or the Leadership. The UNP can be an unbeatable force with unity, more discipline and is undoubtedly the only party capable of leading the country into a prosperous and peaceful future.  
 I am reminded of the words of the late W. S. Senior in ‘ The call of Lanka ‘in my prayers and hope for our beloved country. ‘But most shall he sing of Lanka in the brave new days to come.When the races all have blended and the voice of strife is dumb. When we leap to a single bugle, march to a single drum’   

 


No accolade by public when prices of medicinal drugs were reduced

All UNPers stood united to defeat the No Confidence motion against PM

People wonder as to why the corrupt politicos of former regime are still not punished
