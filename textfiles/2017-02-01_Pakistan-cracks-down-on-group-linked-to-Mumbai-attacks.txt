Pakistan has placed the chief suspect behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks under house arrest as it cracks down on the group linked to the carnage.

  
Firebrand cleric Hafiz Saeed, who heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) group and has a $10 million US bounty on his head, is to be placed under “preventative detention”, according to the Interior Ministry order.  JuD is listed as a terror outfit by the United Nations, considered by the US and India to be a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the group blamed for the attack on Mumbai.   


Police took Saeed away from a mosque in Lahore late Monday and escorted him to his residence where they appear to be holding him under house arrest, an AFP journalist reported.
