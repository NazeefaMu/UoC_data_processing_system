Those who are now in the forefront of bringing a New Constitution are those who maintained that terrorism can never be defeated and peace would never dawn in our country. The LTTE and the Diaspora are involved in bringing a New Constitution, said former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa addressing an intellectual forum of the Eliya organization held in Kandy at the OK-J conference hall.

He said that the local and international groups which intimidated the former government are the ones who initiated in bringing a New Constitution. The attempt to bring in a New Constitution is purely for the need of these separatists and not the need of the common masses.

Speaking further he said that Eliya organization was started to say no to the New Constitution. “Ours is not a racist organization, but one where all patriots and intellectuals who love the country have joined together. There are no extremists and racists in our organization”.

“Terrorism existed during different governments, and there was a group who spread the opinion world over expressing that terrorism can never be defeated and peace cannot be established. These are the groups who are in the forefront of bringing a New Constitution. A Sinhalese living in this country had never objected to anyone believing in any faith, the right of living in this country. There is only 38% of Tamil nationals living in the North, the rest are living in other parts of the country among the Sinhala people”

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa also maintained that it is essential to explain in detail the contents included in the New Constitution. The TNA made several demands. They wanted us to demilitarize the areas in order to help them in conducting elections in a free manner. We did that. The requirements of ordinary Tamil people were more important that those of the separatists. Even during the war many Tamil students from the North continued their studies at the Ruhuna University without any interruption.(J A L Jayasinghe)
