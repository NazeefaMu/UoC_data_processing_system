Sixth death anniversary of legendary Henry Jayasena fell on November 9
He who lived through nature to eternity

Henry Jayasena, the legendary dramatist, renowned actor, lyricist, translator and author was a firm believer of Shakespeare's memorable phrase "All that live must die passing through nature to eternity". He had learnt this in school as, "To every man upon the earth, death cometh soon or late". During the time he commenced his long career, he initially stood tall on the modest unsophisticated Lumbini Theatre in the early 1960's.
He had confessed many times as a much adored artiste that his heart lies in theatre. Henry Jayasena could be easily classified as one, alongside amongst the elite of eminent literary figures in the annals of theatre in Sri Lanka, like Professor Ediriweera Sarathchandra, Sugathapala De Silva, Dayananda Gunawardena, Premasiri Khemadasa and Gunasena Galapaththy etc.
His abundant contributions to the theatre and cinema spanned for almost 4 decades. He called it a day from his stretched acting career in the year 1999 while he was under treatment for the acquired dreaded decease 'colon cancer'. The entire treatment route took around one and a half years. On his personal familiarity and misery he had written distinctively a book titled "Balha Gilano - the story of a cancer patient" merely to alert the masses. Since he had lived for a further period of 10 years leading a normal life. His death was sudden and was shocking to many as he had recovered fully from the dreaded 'colon cancer' was a very unfortunate to have died following a medical misadventure when he was hale and hearty. He was in such a characteristic health state when he possessed the muscle during which time he rejuvenated his famous drama, "Hunuwataye Kathawa" an adoption of Bertolt Brecht's 'The Caucasian Chalk Circle'. He had deployed a blend of experience, talent with novice actors along with a few who were involved earlier in the likes of Nimal Jayasinghe and Chula Kariyawasam.
Henry Jayasena had authored many books in Sinhala and English in addition to have written a series of articles to the national newspaper Daily News under the Artscope column .The English transformation of the book Lazarus revitalized the legacy of Henry Jayasena.The book "Lazarus" was written by Henry Jayasena about 15 years ago. Disappointingly the English version of the book was published after his death. However he had got to study the first sketch of manuscript when he lived.
The role of Judge 'Azdak' is to date ideally portrayed by Tele drama actor Nalin Pradeep Uduwela while that of 'Grusha' by Ruwini Manamperi, a novice.
The original Hunuwataye Kathawa, without a doubt, was his masterpiece. It represented him while at his peak. Bertolt Brecht's Caucasian Chalk Circle had been wildly popular in both Russia and England. In keeping with his style, however, Jayasena refused to slip Brecht's famous "alienation effect", which tried to strip a play of its emotional power, into his adaptation of it. The reason was simple: "I had seen enough of dry, spiritless, and embittered productions of Brecht not to commit the same mistake here". Deliberately and to great acclaim, he included song and dance sequences in Hunuwataye Kathawa, to provoke unprocessed sensation in the audience he sought to accomplish.
He remained as a potential dramatist who was well acquainted and nourished in English, was a bona fide fanatic when it came to the theatre. He followed play after play with gigantic consequence. His reviews on them were speck on, for the obvious impetus that he himself had acted in some of them and hence knew the intact apparatus of a "high-quality" play.
There is a section quoted in his autobiography, The Play is the Thing, where he emphasises to us his first familiarity with dramatization of a play. This occurred whilst he was a teacher at a school in Dehipe. The play, Janaki (based on the Ramayana), was his first endeavour on stage. He had mentioned how difficult it was to get the costumes, actors, and guests for the event. The play was staged, however, and turned out to be triumphant.
He also had a immeasurable repository of understanding when it came to the stage. He was at once securely rooted in his land and with the rest of the world. With a UNESCO fellowship in his arm, he left to Russia and later to England, and from both countries learnt and engrossed a vast deal. He also realised, astutely perhaps, that imitating what he had studied there was not the technique to revitalize his country's theatre, which by then was in pursue of a technique away from Sarathchandra's style of plays.
"There is a kind of sadness that settles over me at the end of every play. I mean, when all that lovely work is over and there is little to look forward to in the evenings."
It is the same kind of sadness we all revel in, whenever hard work is done with and the effort placed into it has been appreciated by everyone. It's a burden for anyone, and for Henry Jayasena it would be a burden he would get used to as time passed by and as he rose higher and higher.
Perhaps Henry Jayasena educated us with a lesson here. He knew the theatre, inside-out. He realised that for all the trends the rest of the world had popularised, he still would have to shape and acclimatize his stories to suit his own people. He understood that we had our individual stories to enrich our theatre with. He also understood that it was not imitation but adaptation which would lengthen our stage. This didn't mean a local playwright should be detached from the issues of his time was proved by his next play, Apata Puthe Magath Nathe. That's the flanking thing to a political announcement Jayasena came up with. It was based on a factual occurrence, was banned, and was later staged to a wider acclaim.
Henry Jayasena was born on in a village called Bendiyamulla in Gampaha in year 1931. He His father Albert Rodrigo Jayasena who was once the Private Secretary to Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike was a well versed person.
His father in the evenings had got all six children in the family to memorize celebrated phrases of Shakespeare although he did not understand the contents of them then. He had quipped that he was brought up in such an environment, where he fostered with no panic of language.
