The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had taken steps to avoid the splitting up of the party and to make the party victorious in the forthcoming elections, Minister of Fisheries Mahinda Amaraweera said today.


“The SLFP has decided to reorganise the party through villages with a new spirit. The youth front of the SLFP has taken steps to hold youth conferences throughout the country,” he said.


“In addition to that the central organisations and women’s organisations have taken steps to recruit new members,” he said.


“Many think that the SLFP would fall apart and get divided. But I would like to say Parliament representatives of SLFP have personally mentioned that they were against division. So, we are not ready for any kind of split and we are willing to compete for the next election as a one party,” the Minister said.


He said that the long standing fishermen issue of India and Sri Lanka would immediately come to an end as the Ministry had already taken steps to hold discussions with the Indian Foreign Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.


“We have decided that we would not let the Indian fishermen to trespass into our territory. And we have taken steps to arrest those who cross the Sri Lankan border,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
