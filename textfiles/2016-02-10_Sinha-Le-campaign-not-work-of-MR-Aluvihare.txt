Leader of the Opposition of the Matale Municipal Council, Daljin Aluvihare, said rumours that the sticker “ Sinha-Le” pasted on trishaws and many other vehicles was an act instigated by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, would tarnish the image of the former president.

He told the monthly meeting of the municipal council yesterday that a group of politicians who were out to arouse communal feelings, were responsible for such short-sighted acts but the fault was attributed to the former President.

“I am an honest politician who respects former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is the fittest to rule the country. I respect him just as I respect my father. I am not scared of Maithri or Ranil. Former President Rajapaksa, during his visit to Matale, paid a courtesy call on my mother. Those around him paved the way for his downfall and continue to do so. Trishaw drivers paste the “ Sinha- Le” sticker on trishaws under the impression that it was a movement of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He lost the votes of many Sinhalese and Muslims at the presidential election due to such short-sighted acts, for which he was not responsible,”he said.

He further said he would inform the police in this regard and request that a formal investigation be launched into the matter. (M.W. Somaratne)
