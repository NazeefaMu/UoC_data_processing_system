A story that has gone viral in political circles says that there are two purohitas well past their youth having a gala time gallivanting around with some young fashion models and cinema actresses.

 


One of these Romeos is said to be a tall guy from the central hills, whose numerous link-ups are now public knowledge. The other purohita’s escapades though a secret to the public so far has become an exhilarating subject for the staffers at a party head office in Pitakotte area. This Romeo has just returned home from his latest jaunt in Singapore with a young lovely model, they say.
