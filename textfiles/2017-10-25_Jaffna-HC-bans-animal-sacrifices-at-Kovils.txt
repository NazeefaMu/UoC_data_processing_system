Jaffna High Court Judge M. Ilancheliyan yesterday issued an order banning animal sacrifices at Hindu Kovils in Jaffna District.

The order was made following a petition filed by the All Ceylon Saiva Maha Council against the use of animals as sacrifice to the deities.

The Judge ordered senior police officers in the Province to arrest those who violate the order in the future and to take action against them. (Romesh Madushanka)
