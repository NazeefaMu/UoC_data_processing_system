Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development Sagala Ratnayake said that the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station was a a hell-hole where the smell from the toilets had become unbearable even to passers-by.

He said that he had got the smell of urine while he was exercising in the morning and he had gone to the police station and inspected it together with the Inspector General of Police. According to him, this situation had arisen because new toilets had been put in without seeking a solution to the water problem that existed there for almost 10 years.(Diana Udayangani)
