Family gets quit notice from the yahapalanaya they supported


	


The family of the onetime vociferous politico, who was slain in an election-related street shoot-out several years ago, had been living in a government-allotted apartment at the Summit Flats in Colombo 7.
Following the death of this politico, the previous government not only allowed the family to continue living in this apartment, but also provided them with armed security. However, the slain politico’s daughter,  who consistently complained that the mill of justice with regard to her father’s death was not grinding fast enough, crossed over to the Green party on the eve of the last general poll and later won a seat in Diyawanna.
Nevertheless, by a strange quirk of fate, the family of the slain politico received a letter from the authorities the other day giving them notice to quit the apartment they are living in as they were no longer entitled to it. There was also a follow-up visit soon afterwards by a government political authority holding high office in yahapalanaya for an on-the-spot-inspection as well.
Following the inspection, the family has got the final notice to hand back the apartment to the authorities immediately and also to pay the rental for the year 2015.
The family members of the slain politico have now begun saying how considerate the high ups of the previous regime were, they say.
