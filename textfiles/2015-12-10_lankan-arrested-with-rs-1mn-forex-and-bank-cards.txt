	A 32-year-old Sri Lankan man was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), while attempting to smuggle out foreign currency worth more than one million Rupees and 109 ATM cards yesterday evening.
	Customs Spokesman Leslie Gamini said the suspect was arrested by the BIA Customs officials at the Departure Lounge, while attempting to smuggle out them to Dubai.
	The suspect is a resident of Kalmunai.
	“He had currency bills to the value of 25,770 Dirhams (Rs. 1,019,203) along with 109 ATM cards with their PIN numbers in his possession, belonging to several persons,” he said.
	“According to the Banking Act ATM cards are non-transferable. The suspect must have got those cards with the promise of crediting the money to their accounts later,” he said.
	The foreign currency and the cards were forfeited and the suspect was imposed a penalty of Rs. 1,000,000.

	“During the previous 39 foreign currency raid cases the suspects attempted to smuggle out foreign currency notes. But the trend is now taking the money out in the form of credit or debit cards,” Mr. Gamini said.
