Visiting Iranian Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian today said that post-sanctions Iran is ready to do business with the world and wants closer cooperation with Sri Lanka.

“We bring warm greetings from the people of Iran. Post-sanctions Iran is transparent and ready to do business with the world. In our new era, we want closer cooperation with Sri Lanka. During the coming days, we are looking to meet with several government Ministers as well,” Minister Chitchian said at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake.

The Iranian delegation which consists of members from the government and the Iranian private sector as well as Iran’s biggest Chamber arrived in Sri Lanka this afternoon.  

Issuing a statement, the Industry and Commerce Ministry said the both countries were set to commence the 11th Joint Commission for Economic Co-operation (JCEC) sessions on Wednesday.

Among the Iranian firms in the delegation are MAPNA (railroads and locomotive supplier), FARAB (heavy infrastructure including reservoirs), SUNIR (electrification and mega scale engineering projects) as well as Iran’s biggest Chamber, Iranian Industry, Mines and Trade Chamber.

Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, who officially welcomed the delegation, said the government was ready to re-commence trade with post-sanctions Iran.

“This is a new beginning. I visited Iran twice during the time of sanctions. Despite sanctions, Iranians supported Sri Lanka during the war and we are thankful to the people of Iran,” he said.
