MYTH: Shaving the head of a newborn can prevent baldness 

BUSTED: “This is not true. There is no scientific basis for this. But there are many customs and traditions where they shave the baby’s head.  Many newborns have hair which grows while they are in their mother’s womb. It is natural for this baby hair to fall anyway. Eventually babies will grow new hair. That is the normal hair cycle. When you shave or cut the hair, the root of the hair is intact. The same hair will re-grow, but once it completes its normal hair cycle it will fall and new hairs will surface.”
