Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran today said that the Tamil people’s issues could not be solved by chasing him away. 

Replying to a statement made by Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara recently, he made this remark  at a function held in Vavuniya to declare open the new two-storey building of the Vavuniya South Sinhala Pradeshiya Sabha.

“Minister Jayasekara recently said that I should be banished from the Northern Province.  But the issues faced by Tamils would not be solved by banishing me. Not only me, even my successor will say the same thing I said as we always speak the truth,”he said. (Romesh Madusanka)
