United Citizens' Front (UCF) Leader Tissa Attanayake said today the Tamil National Alliance’s (TNA) manifesto is a threat to the country's sovereignty because it calls for the pardoning of the LTTE.
He said the TNA’s manifesto released on Saturday is a challenge to the war victory because it wants a re-merger of the North and East under federal structure and right to self determination for Sri Lankan Tamils.
Mr. Attanayake claimed that TNA’s demand to implement the resolutions adopted at the UNHRC from 2012 to 2014 was behind its moves to collaborate with the UNFGG at the general elections.
He questioned the rationale behind the TNA’s demand for pardoning the LTTE and the call for the speeding up of the ongoing inquiries allegations of human rights violations during the armed conflict.
“The TNA wants to political solution to the national question that goes beyond the 13th Amendment. It has vowed to support the UNP at the elections,” he claimed.
Mr. Attanayake said Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka should give their views on the TNA’s manifesto because they speak of sovereignty of the country.
The TNA, which comprises the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO), Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) and the People’s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), is contesting the general election in the districts of Jaffna, Vanni, Batticaloa, Digamadulla (also known as Ampara) and Trincomalee in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
