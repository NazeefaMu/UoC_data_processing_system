This politico who owns an apartment house in the city had been summoned by Police to record his statement regarding an investment he had made in a foreign country.

 


On three occasions he had avoided appearing before Police giving different reasons and he had dodged the fourth time too saying that he was too busy laying the foundation stone for his new house.


The politico had been going after various political authorities protesting his innocence ever since he received notice from the Police to make himself available for recording his statement, they say.
