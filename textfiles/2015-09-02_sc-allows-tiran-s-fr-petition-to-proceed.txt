The Supreme Court today granted leave to proceed with the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former parliamentarian Tiran Alles in connection with an alleged fraud at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) and observed that there was no reason to arrest him immediately.
Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Judges Eva Wanasundare and Upali Aberatne made the observations and fixed the hearing for October 19.
Mr. Alles filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court in May seeking an order preventing Police from arresting him in connection with the alleged fraud RADA. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
