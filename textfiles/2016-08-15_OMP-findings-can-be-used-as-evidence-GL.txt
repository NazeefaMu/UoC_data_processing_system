OMP findings can be used as evidence: GL


	

Though the government had assured that the findings of the Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) would not give rise to civil or criminal liability, the joint opposition said today the findings could be used as evidence when the judicial mechanism is set up to hear accountability issues.

Former MP G.L. Peiris said the hidden purpose of the OMP was to collect evidence to be submitted in the proposed accountability court and pointed out that the OMP would perform as an all-powerful entity once established.

He said the setting up of the OMP was not the final step but the first in a line of events which would follow. “The Truth Seeking Commission and the Special Accountability Court are the next steps of the OMP, also a result of the international pressure. It is not a product of domestically generated move,” Mr. Peiris said.

He said there were a number of statements which were detrimental to the country in the OMP Bill and said the President could still get rid of these clauses if he was prepared to do so.

“All entities at National and Provincial levels are bound to fulfil requirements of the OMP. If anyone failed or refused to provide the necessary documents or details to its officials, the OMP could go to the Appeal Court against them on charges of contempt of court. No matter what they have done, no action could be taken against OMP officials because they are immune to the law of the country. These are very serious matters and that is why we are against the OMP Bill,” Mr. Peiris said.

He criticized the prominence given to the missing persons in the North and East through the Bill and said investigations into all missing persons should be conducted in a fair manner despite their origin.

"The permission given to the OMP to accept funds and resources from any foreign country or an NGO, to come into any agreement with any factions, appoint any officials be it Sri Lankan or foreign to the OMP and vesting them with unlimited authority were also detrimental to the country," Mr. Peiris said. “The amendments which were made to accept foreign funds though the Department of External Resources of the Treasury and to inform the IGP within 48 hours after a person was questioned are of no use.”

He said the OMP has the authority not to disclose the details of a person who was reported as missing but found abroad afterwards. “Why all this secrecy? We aren’t against finding the fate of the missing but it should be carried out in a manner which is not detrimental to the country. The President asked what the shortcomings of the Bill were and now we have enumerated them. We request him to pay his attention to these issues to save the country,” Mr. Peiris said.
