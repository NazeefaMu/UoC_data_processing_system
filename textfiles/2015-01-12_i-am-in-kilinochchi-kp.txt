Speaking to the Tamil Mirror from Kilinochchi he said that he was with the children at the Sencholai children’s home in Kilinochchi and he would continue to be with the children.
However, some media outlets yesterday reported that he had fled the country.
Parliamentarian Rajitha Senaratne told media on Saturday that KP, who is wanted by India for the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, had reportedly fled the country through Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake.
India's Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) had sought to question KP over the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister.
KP is alleged to have procured massive consignments of weapons worth billions of dollars for the LTTE that waged a deadly war for over 30 years in the country.
