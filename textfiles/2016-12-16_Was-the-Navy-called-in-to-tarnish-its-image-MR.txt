Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, yesterday, asked whether the Sri Lanka Navy was asked to intervene in the recent protest at the Hambantota Harbour in order to tarnish the reputation of the Navy.

Referring to the Navy Commander's alleged assault on a journalist who was there to cover the event, Mr. Rajapaksa said the Navy Commander was a skilful officer during the wartime and added that it was the first time that the armed forces had been ordered to intervene to control a protest in recent history according to his knowledge.

Addressing the media at a workshop held in Colombo, the former president also said, “There is no democracy in the country even though the government speaks highly of democracy. The Sri Lanka Navy was used for the first time to sabotage this protest of workers at the Hambantota Harbour. Such incidents are usually handled by the Police.”

He said he wondered who had instructed the Sri Lanka Navy to intervene to halt the protest.

He said the duties connected to the armed forces could not be altered without the knowledge of the President. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
