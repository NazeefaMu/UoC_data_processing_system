VATICAN CITY AFP Jan14, 
2017 - Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas warned Saturday that moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem would deal a huge blow to hopes for Middle East peace, as he opened a Palestinian embassy at the Vatican, Abbas added that anything which legitimised the “illegal Israeli annexation” of Jerusalem would “bury the hopes for a two-state solution, and fuel extremism in our region”.   


Speaking briefly to reporters, Abbas reiterated his opposition to the possible transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as President-elect Donald Trump had indicated he might do.   
 “We cannot say anything yet because it has not happened... I hope it will not happen,” Abbas said.
