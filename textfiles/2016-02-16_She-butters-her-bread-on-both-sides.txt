This fair one functioning as a coordinating secretary at a Ministry handling both development and international affairs, is currently on secondment from a statutory body dealing with matters connected to investments.  The Ministry staff say that his lady is a beneficiary of a windfall of a rare kind.
The lucky lady well past 60, but trying to look younger than her years with heavy make-up and fashionable clothes has become entitled to her EPF/ETF awards as well as a monthly pension. She continues to draw a monthly pay of Rs.80,000 from the statutory body while enjoying the facility of a vehicle and free fuel provided by the Ministry.
