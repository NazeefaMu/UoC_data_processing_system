This Night-Vision Trap Cam on the river-front at KumbukRiver Eco Extraordinaire clicked a real gem.  While the human world is in deep slumber, this matriarch shepherds her off-spring into the water where they will quench their thirst, play awhile before disappearing into the wild.

Kumbuk River, Sri Lanka’s most internationally-acclaimed eco resort is nestled on the banks of a lively river in Buttala, on the northern edge of the Yala National Park.
