‘Behind every success stands a strong woman; behind every strong woman stands Araliya.’ 
A woman too at times resembles ‘Araliya’ a flower that’s simple, humble yet resilient and beautiful. Looking back at the success we have achieved in life, there has always been that woman (Ara-liya) who sacrificed much more, as a mother, daughter, wife, sister.


Women, an integral part of the world, play a greater role in the development and have a great potential to lift a nation.


Women have now become active participants in all walks of life.  They are more than just a unit of the family organization but are becoming a significant unit of the society while influencing the course of social change in the world.


It is for her that NDB dedicates Araliya, a women’s savings account which will not merely be an account to save, but support her in terms of developing her skills, health and knowledge whilst giving strength, security and confidence to realize aspirations in her journey of life.
