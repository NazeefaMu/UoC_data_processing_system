Navy go out as favourites against Army

The resurgent Navy SC should have the edge over Army SC in their Dialog 'A' division league rugby matches which will be worked off at Navy Sports complex in Welisara at 4 pm today.
Navy who began the season with an impressive victory over Air Force SC by 38-8 will have their work cut out with the fighting Army side that is sans any superstars have all their 15 players playing together as a team.
Navy's forte is their superior forwards led by former National captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa and have players of the calibre of this year captain Danushka 'Gertha' Perera, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, try machine Sathya Ranatunga, ex-Isipathana and Sri Lanka under 20 skipper Omalka Gunaratna and that fierce tackler and flanker Supun Peiris who learnt the art of rugby from the Navy. The good news for the Navy is the return of second row forward Sagith Saranga for this all important game.
Their back division is strong with the halves combination of Suranga Pushpakumara and veteran Dev Anand hitting it off smoothly in the last game against Air Force. Former Peterite Lee Keegal and his co-centre Kosala Tissera have played a key role in their success with their powerful runs ably supported by National winger Dinusha 'Para' Chathuranga backed up by his omnipresent speedy winger Saliya Hadapangoda and attacking full back Thilina Weerasinghe.
Navy head coach Nilfer Ibrahim said, "We were happy about our last performance in the opening match of the season. Due to 13 experienced players leaving us we were playing with virtually a new look side, I honestly never thought we would win, but the boys played really well and brought us the important win even though the ground conditions was not that good.
"Our forwards played a cracking game and secured us the ball position for our young three quarters to do the rest. Please keep in mind, we had almost 11 schoolboys playing for us; but in the end they gave a fantastic performance."
Army led by national player Ashoka Jayalal, fielding a young side with no superstars went down fighting against the CR and FC last Saturday 35-15 after a remarkable performance. Army will strive to give a much better performance against the Navy outfit by going all out to register their first win of the season.
The centres combination of brothers Imanka Ariyapala and Dinusha Ariyapala play with perfect understanding while Mihiran Perera has played a key role in their success with his daring runs down the flank. Full back Gayan Salinda has also come off with flying colours with his bulls-eye place kicking.
The Army has been bolstered by the presence of their halves combination of Rizvi Mohamad and Ashan Bandara and they will be tested to the hilt by the experience Navy three quarters.
Assistant coach cum team manager Captain Nisal Meepage said, "We identified last week our mistakes which cost us the game against CR and worked out and rectified them. Our cover defence of the three quarters was very poor and we have to improve on that as well. We are a really confident unit going for a definite victory." - WAI
