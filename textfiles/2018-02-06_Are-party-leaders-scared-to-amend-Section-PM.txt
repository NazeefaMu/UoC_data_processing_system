Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who kicked off the adjournment debate on the PCoI and PRECIFAC reports in Parliament today, questioned whether political party leaders were prepared to amend the Section 80 of the Constitution.

The PRECIFAC in its report has recommended that Section 80 of the Constitution be amended to provide for the stripping of a person's civic rights if found guilty of serious crimes.

"Are the party leaders prepared to amend Section 80 of the Constitution or are they scared to do it," he asked.

The PM told Parliament that legislation pertaining to the re-organization of the Central Bank would be introduced as recommended by the PCoI.

"We will also present legislation to create a budget office for Parliament soon," he said and added that those responsible for the bond scam had already been arrested and would be legally dealt with. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
