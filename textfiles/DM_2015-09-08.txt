In the week following the general poll, the former strongman took a holiday from politics and was relaxing at his residence in the South.
Before the poll, the former strongman found himself eternally surrounded by scores of fawning Betel leaf politicos from all parts of the country. However, after the poll none of these loyalists except a diehard one had called on him at his Tangalle residence. The exception, of course, was Udaya leading a heritage party, they say.
Meanwhile, a certain Blue party veteran now in retirement on hearing about the plight of the former strongman had quipped: Politicians should remember that they too are subject to the universal law of impermanence!

	She was under the spotlight when a video went viral on social media where she slapped a man named Selva in the Wariyapola Bus stand. Thilini further said she was mentally harassed due to the reaction of the police.
	It was not me who slapped him first. It was the time keeper and then my friend. I slapped him after they did. He made indecent sexual gestures and also said some indecent words. He even followed us to the bus we got in. However, it was he who complained first. I was told by the police to come there on August 28, last year to give a statement in this regard. But when I was on my way to the Police Station there were media reports that I was taken into custody. Also by the time I reached there were many people from various media organizations. The police acted in a highly biased manner. The trauma I went through at the police station that day was similar to what I went through at the bus stand the other day, she told a press conference held yesterday.
	Attorney Priyantha Gamage from Rights Now said the accused was sentenced under Section 345 of the Penal Code.
	He was ordered to pay Rs.25,000 each for Thilini Amalka and her friend and was given a prison sentence of six months. (Chathushika Wijeyesinghe)Pix by Nisal Baduge

IFC to help Sanasa Bank uplift small businesses and cooperatives in rural sector
	
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, will provide advisory services to Sanasa Development Bank as it expands to include more micro and small businesses, cooperatives, and retail clients. Importantly, the bank will now reach more rural small businesses across the country, boosting financial inclusion.
IFC has been a long term advisory partner with Sanasa Development Bank since 2010, and also invested in its equity in 2012. Over the course of the next two years, IFCs assistance will strengthen the banks overall operational capabilities and risk management framework.
Sanasa Development Banks growth strategy involves long-term sustainable growth in three important sectors  SME, retail, and cooperative  to make financing more accessible to a larger number of people, said Nimal C Hapuarachchi, Chief Executive Officer of Sanasa Development Bank PLC.
A transition of this depth requires strong and timely partnerships. IFCs long-term partnership with SANASA Development Bank will significantly impact the banks value-creation process, said Samadanie Kiriwandeniya, Chairperson of Sanasa.
Micro, small, and medium enterprises play a critical role in Sri Lankas economic development. However, access to finance remains a key constraint to the development of small businesses.
Supporting Sri Lankas largest private microfinance institutions transformation into an SME and retail bank will help reach much needed financial services to micro, small and medium enterprises in rural parts of the country. As a long term partner to Sanasa, IFC will help the bank expand formal financial services to under-served cooperatives and rural micro and small businesses, said Mengistu Alemayehu, IFCs Regional Director for South Asia.
Sri Lanka is a priority country for IFC. IFCs committed portfolio in Sri Lanka is now $419 million and covers projects across a range of sectors, including infrastructure, tourism, renewable energy, finance, and healthcare. IFC also provides advisory services to promote sustainable growth among small and medium enterprises by facilitating access to finance, and by offering capacity-building and training opportunities.

Interblocks and West International launch new electronic payment processing system
	
By Chandeepa WettasingheInterblocks Ltd and Sweden-based West International recently launched an innovative electronic payment processing system aiming at increasing credit and debit card purchases by over tenfold in Sri Lanka through the availability of infrastructure.
The prediction that were making on the market here is that it can easily become tenfold. The 30,000 terminals out there today can increase to 300,000, West International CEO Sten Karlsson said.
However, the success will depend on if Sri Lankan consumers are willing to convert to more card payments directly instead of drawing money out of banks or ATMs to pay by cash.
Interblocks Ltd CEO Dinesh Rodrigo said that as merchants support Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Diners Club cards depending on their preferences, there is an overlap of systems with just 20,000 merchants in Sri Lanka supporting card payments.
Ususally, Visa and Mastercard have one terminal, AmEx has a separate one, Diners Club has another and theres one more in case one of them doesnt work, Karlsson added.
West International card terminals have an integrated payment portal for all card systems and support contactless payments in addition to features present in other payment terminals.
Rodrigo said that the sales model is innovative as well, with Interblocks providing the terminals to merchants for free with a flat fee subscription, as opposed to the current practice of banks selling the terminals to the merchants and charging a percentage value of each transaction.
Right now, merchants have to either buy their terminals, or the banks will give it to them for free in return for a minimum number of transaction volumes. The way we do it, we will reach down to the next levels of merchants, Rodrigo added.
Karlsson said that West International will sell terminals in units to Interblocks and that Interblocks will start operations with 1,000 terminals.
Founded in 1998, West International is one of the up and coming giants in the industry.
There are 2 other manufacturers who are by far the largest. Were the contenders and the disruptors because they dont innovate. Were big in Europe and South Africa. This is our first entry into Asia, Karlsson said.
Sri Lanka-based Interblocks which is a leading provider of electronic payment processing solutions has operations in Sweden which led to the partnership. It will act as the local partner and payment gateway.

NHRC issues notice to TN govt. over SL refugee's death
	
	New Delhi: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in India has issued a notice to Tamil Nadu government over the alleged custodial death of a Sri Lankan refugee in Chennai.
	The Commission has taken suo motu cognizance of a media report alleging the death of a Sri Lankan refugee, Mohan (45) in the custody of Pallikaranai Police, Chennai on September 4.
	"As per the media report, Mohan died while he was in the police custody due to severe torture by the forces.
	Further, he was also kept in the custody over a period of three days against all canons of justice and law which would amount to illegal detention as well.
	"That apart, on verification of the Registry of the Commission, it was ascertained that no intimation of the death was received by the Commission from the state government so far," Justice D Murugesan, NHRC member observed.
	According to the NHRC guidelines, intimation regarding death in custody has to be reported to the Commission within 24 hours.
	Meanwhile, notices have been issued to the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police, Government of Tamil Nadu calling for reports within four weeks.
	NHRC stated that the Central Crime Branch, Chennai had received the information that Mohan had connections with people indulged in preparing forged passports.
	Mohan was therefore taken into custody and enquired upon for about three days. While he was being questioned on the night of September 4, he collapsed and was admitted in a nearby private hospital where he was declared dead.
	The family members of the refugee, however, have alleged that his death was due to the brutal treatment by the police.
	A number of refugees from Sri Lanka came to India during the 1983-2009 war between Sri Lankan government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. (ibnlive)

Penitent in private for being abusive in public!
	
The new Big Boss recently chaired a meeting of the Betel leaf alliance leaders. Among the participants at this meeting was the loquacious patriot of the farceunto-death fame.
When the meeting was in progress, the patriot asked the new Big Boss whether he was planning to dissolve the Betel leaf alliance and the latter replied there was no such move. Again the patriot craned his neck towards the new Big Boss and spoke to him softly: Sir, Some people may have told you that I abused you at election meetings. Please dont believe their stories The new Big Boss only smiled.
However, when the media went to town with the story that the patriot had apologized to the new Big Boss, the latter quickly dismissed the story as false and baseless.

They were caught napping!
	
The new Big Boss was accorded a warm welcome when he arrived for inaugurating the 8thDiyawanna council and delivering the policy statement of the national unity government.
As he walked down the aisle he saw the former strongman, now an ordinary Diyawanna member seated in the front row and warmly greeted him.
Everyone present on this solemn occasion, attentively listened to the new Big Boss address except two Diyawanna members who were seen napping, perhaps lulled by a feeling of wellbeing that comes over one after enjoying a sumptuous meal. One of the two found dozing was a Green Ministerial one of the yahapalanaya administration and the other a Blue one who held a high office in the opposition, both hailing from the hills. The two shuteyes were a conspicuous sight for those watching the proceedings over the TV, but were hardly noticed by those present at the ceremony. And the duo suffered no immediate embarrassment either as they were wide awake when the curtain came down on the event!

A local politico presiding over the public affairs of a town on the city outskirts is on the way for the chop, they say.
He was among the few politicos who hurled vitriolic abuse at the new big Boss in the run up to the August 17 general poll despite the latter being his party leader. A follower of the former strongman, this politico also is said to have incited his political supporters to violence. He had made inflammatory remarks such as: Come our poll victory, let us  that is the way we should treat the fellow. Give them the works with whatever you can lay your hands on This worthy is about to be served with a long charge sheet and his getting the due deserts is just a matter of course, they say.

Uva council up for grabs!
	
The usual chess game in the provincial councils has begun in the wake of the changes in their power equation following the general poll.
For instance, moves and counter-moves by interested parties to capture the power of the Uva council and to gain their own political goals are said to be raising the political temperature in the province.
The balance of power in the Uva council tipped in favour of the Betel leaf party when several Green party councillors won Diyawanna seats. Meanwhile, a move was made by Betel leaf members of the council to promote their colleague Charming Chamara (CC) as the new Provincial Chief. CC already elected to Diyawanna at the recent poll welcomed the move for he wished to be the provincial chief rather than an ordinary Diyawanna member!
The news about the move to make CC the provincial chief was sweet music to a certain former turncoat Ministerial one from Uva who lost the Diyawanna seat but headed the defeated ones on the district list. And he is to succeed CC as a Diyawanna member in the event of the former giving up his seat to become the provincial chief. So the former Ministerial one had thrown in his full political weight behind CCs bid to become the provincial chief.
Meanwhile, the Green party stalwarts, determined not to be outdone, are said to have clinched a secret deal with the King Rooster of the Cockerel party to retain the power equation in the council with the support of the cockerels in the council now backing the Betel leaf.
If the King Rooster decides to prop up the Green party administration of the council in Uva, it will shatter the dreams of both CC and the former Ministerial one. However, given the King Roosters unpredictable nature, political observers are wary of making a prediction either way

Wayamba duo to herald pole-vaulters season
	
The season for political pole-vaults is round the corner again, they say. Political circles are now abuzz with the story that two-once Green Ministerial ones of the former Betel leaf regime hailing from Wayamba are set to return to the Mahagedara.
	
One of the would be-pole-vaulters once moved closely with the princes of the former royal family and he is now facing a series of court cases and also served a temporary stint in a state-run lodge in connection with one of the cases. His businesses which flourished when he was in power have now gone on the rocks.
The other politico said to be planning to turn Green again was an outstanding manape scorer from both sides of the great divide. The man is so ambitious that he is not prepared to settle for anything short of a key portfolio or a leadership position, they say.
But a snag is in their way. The leaders of the two main parties have reached an agreement not to welcome pole-vaulters from the other side.

Their dialogue at this encounter runs thus: New Transport Chief: The main reason why I accepted this portfolio is to set right the wrongs done to our party supporters during your time.
Ex- Transport Chief: What are the wrongs done to your supporters during my time New Transport Chief: Well, various wrongs have been done to them! If I cannot do justice to my supporters, I will quit this job! Ex- Transport Chief: (Laughs loud) we didnt do any injustice to your people. We didnt appoint wrong people to high positions! Bus cleaners were promoted as Regional Managers during your time. We only set right such wrongs! New Transport Chief: You wait and see!

How the Flame leader boldly went it alone at the last general poll and crashed headlong is now history. Several Blue stalwarts who appreciated the support the Flame leader extended to the Compassionate One at the do-or-die battle earlier wanted to send the war hero to Diyawanna through the National List.
The Compassionate One too readily welcomed the idea, but then the list had already been sent to the Polls Chief.
Undeterred, the Compassionate One asked his long standing pal Jaye already on the National List to step down to make way for the war hero and the latter readily agreed to give up his seat.
However, Jaye in the meantime had entertained second thoughts and hedged giving his letter of consent. And thus the Diyawanna door was closed on the Flame leader for the second time.
