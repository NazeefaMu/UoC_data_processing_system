Israel has joined forces with Egypt’s military to smash ISIS militants in Nothern Sinai.  


Unmarked Israeli drones, helicopters and jets have carried out a covert air campaign to rid Egypt of Islamic terrorists, for more than two years.  


Around 100 airstrikes have been executed in the country, with often more than one a week.But Israeli assistance in the region has helped Cairo regain a footing in the battle against extremism, reports the New York Times.  


The partnership marks a new dawn for the two countries, who were once enemies in three wars.  
However, the nations have shared foe with ISIS, Iran and extremist Islam.  


According to the US military official’s Israel’s military presence has played a key role in helping the Egyptian military fight ISIS.However, there are concerns that Israel’s role in keeping terrorists at bay in Egypt is having a negative effect on the region.  


But while Israeli officials are happy to help colleagues in Cairo contain ISIS, the missions have been kept under wraps.
