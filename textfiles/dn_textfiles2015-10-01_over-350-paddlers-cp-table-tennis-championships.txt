Over 350 paddlers for CP table tennis championships

Over 350 paddlers under the various age groups and the two open events have entered the Second Central Table Tennis Championship organised by the Kandy District Table Tennis Association which will be worked off at the Jagath Rajapakse International Table Tennis Stadium, Doluwa this Saturday and Sunday (October 3 and 4 with play commencing at 8 am each day.
This is the second Central Province table tennis championship organised by this District Association and the earlier one was worked off last month said the Honorary Secretary of the KDTTA Ms Dilmini Direcksz.
The events which are expected to be worked off are boys and girls under 8, under 10, under 12, under 15, under 18 and the open event for men and women.
A much looked forward event will be the Ladies Open event in which the defending champion is 14 year old Samadhi Hettiarachchi from Mahamaya Girls College, Kandy when she took the last championship by storm by winning this event beating the top contender and former Senior National Ladies Runner up Ridmi Karadanarachchi by the comfortable marging of 3-0 giving her more experienced opponent no chance whatsoever.
This little girl upset Ridmi Karadanarachchi with excellent placement of the ball and also short smashes making her opponent scurry for safety than going for the win.
Others in contention for the title for Ridmi Karadanarachchi, Praveena Silva, Thanushi Rodrigo, Ochini Dissanayake, Sandamini Kularatne, Janani Pushpakumara, Radhushi Jathunarachchi and Navoda Kevindi.
For the open mens title the reigning national Junior and Senior Singles Champion who is also the defending champion should go out as the top favourite. At the last championship be beat Tilina Wijesiri both from Vidyartha College 3-0.
The others in running for the title are Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College, Dinesh Kavishka, Prasad de Silva, D Karadanarachchi, Krishan Wickremaratne, Chinthaka Ekanayake.
The other top event should be girls under 18 event where te defending champion is Praveena Silva of Girls High School Kandy who scored an easy 3-1 win over Thanushi Rodrigo of Mahamaya Girls College in the finals last month.
The boys under 18 event saw Udaya Ranasinghe scoring a close 3/2 win over Dinesh Kavishka with the national champion being stretched to the last set which he won 12/10. A little more effort by Dinesh Kavishka would have been curtains for the national champion.
Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College, Kandy is the boys under 15 champion with Shakila Karunaratne of Vidyartha College as runner up winning 3/0.
The others in running are Pium Ekanayake, Anupa Athauda, Harshana Karandawela, Devendra Wijebandara, Chandupa Alahakoon and D Karadanarachchi.
The defending girls champion is the under 15 event is Thanushi Rodrigo of Mahamaya Girls College who beat the open event winner Samadhi Hettiarachchi surprising in a comfortable 3-0 in the finals. Perhaps this defeat saw the best of Samadhi Hettiarachchi come out in the main event.
