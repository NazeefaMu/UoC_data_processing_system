The world is moving faster than we ever thought it  would a few decades back. Similar to everything else, methods of  enhancing beauty, therapeutic procedures and medications are rapidly  advancing, probably due to the higher customer demands and competition  in the market.   


Beauty-conscious people who can afford it nowadays use  vampire face-lifts, facial creams made from placentas and many other  cosmetic products made from platinum to gold to clay to human urine, not  gross at all!   


Do you know about the latest product introduced to the  market already full of beauty enhancers? It is none other  than bee venom!   

What is all this buzz about bee venom?
Honey is a substance extracted from bees which has been  used by our ancestors for hundreds of years due to its proven benefits  and antimicrobial and antibacterial effects. This valuable gift from  nature, also a powerful moisturizer, can be used to clean, hydrate and  heal damaged skin.

Healthcare professionals as well as Ayurveda experts  tend to suggest products containing honey or direct application of honey  with turmeric powder for the treatment of acne.   


So, moving on to bee venom, the latest advancement in the  cosmetic field. This has some additional features along with what is  already possessed by honey. While some of it is easy to apply, most of  it can be a sluggish and murkier in contrast to its soft and sweet  counterpart.   

 

Moving back to the golden days
During ancient times, this substance was extracted through a  very different procedure and according to American Apitherapy Society,  bee-venom therapy has been widely practised in the field of medicine in  ancient Egypt, Greece, India and China. Furthermore, latest research  results have proven an increased incidence in the recovery of patients  with rheumatoid arthritis, enlarged prostates and some cancers,  following this bee venom therapy.   


Bee venom, when included in the chemical composition of a  certain cream, lotion, mask or lip serum, will more or less irritate  your skin as a sting or an insect bite will. Yes it is quite similar,  resulting in a local inflammatory reaction, with a plumping and burning  sensation which will have an effect on diminishing signs of aging-  leading to an outcome similar to an anti-aging chemical.   


As you get older, the skin will gradually age, losing its  naturally occurring ‘collagen’, giving rise to various cosmetic issues  like sagging skin, fine lines and wrinkles.   


Bee venom, the skin magic, consists of a ‘potent  combination of enzymes, peptides and amino acids’ says Ayona De Mel,  Consultant Dermatologist, South Wales, MD. It is further enhanced by  being combined with popular brands, giving rise to an effect similar to  that of ‘natural botox’ which gets absorbed into the skin without any  invasive procedures or the involvement of needles.

According to Natalie  Zinder, a product experimenter who works for Venofye, one of the most  popular brands which is known to be capitalizing on the powers of bee  venom, the components of this substance are able to fool the skin by  giving a false alarm on intoxication by stings, which make the body  react by increasing blood circulation, perfusion of the skin and  production of collagen- strengthening the body, eventually causing the  skin to become rejuvenated-fresh, younger and more alive! It is also  known to act effectively in reducing negative menopausal effects such as  wrinkling, puffiness, dryness and skin-tag formation, while acting on  relaxing body muscles to a greater extent.   Case studies
In a trial done by a set of scientists in Perth involving  14 women between the ages of 50 and 59, the participants claimed that  honey bee venom had improved the texture of their skin, decreased lines,  wrinkles and dryness, making them look almost 10-15 years younger.   


In contrast, some scientists hold that bee venom should not  be used on skin, since it could lead to life threatening allergic  conditions, not just resulting in swelling or itching but even leading  to Anaphylactic shock. Allergies too can occur, even after being exposed  to cow’s milk and vaccinations. If you are exposed to the venom of a  potentially serious or toxic bee, this can lead to a very serious  situation. So it is all about taking a risk for beauty or else choosing  to safeguard one’s health.   


A few years back, Kate Middleton and Gwyneth Paltrow made  news, when they revealed their secrets of beauty and anti-aging thanks  to this miracle substance of nature. Since then, many products  containing bee venom have flooded the market, with numerous additive  effects.   

Is it cost-effective?
Bee venom is not a cheap agent for sure, even though it is  becoming as popular as eau de cologne. Its costs can range from several  hundreds of dollars to hundred thousands, depending on the brand. If you  are more up to date on the latest information available, it will  definitely help you find a cost-effective product with a considerable  range of beneficial effects.   


There are some brands containing bee venom which are  extremely expensive, as there are procedures involved in extracting  venom in a cruelty-free manner and an eco-friendly process definitely  requires multiple, high-quality resources and advanced technology.   


In supporting that fact, The Wall Street Journal 2012  mentions that 1g of venom from New Zealand- a country rich in products containing bee venom-with an equivalent of 10,000  bee stings, will approximately cost about $304.  

Are there any alternatives? 
However, if you are looking for something with effects similar to plumping and revitalization of skin, the best alternative  would be salicylic or glycolic acids which have a  minimum or no-health risk with a comparatively cheaper price tag. Also,  the mild burning sensations they cause will only result in a  small swelling, yet are known to give a safe plumping effect.   

Does it harm bees-will they die?
Extracting venom from bees is neither harmful nor stressful  to bees. The whole procedure is done in an eco-friendly manner, where a  glass sheet is placed in the beehive with a mild electrical current  generated through it. As soon as the bees sit on the glass, this current will make them stick their stingers and pump out a small amount of venom. Furthermore, when this venom is released, bees will  secrete a pheromone which will attract other bees to the glass sheet who will act in the same manner. Once a considerable amount of venom is  collected, it will be purified in special machines and the bees will  be released back to their natural habitat.   


Considering these points, why not give a chance to  these popular beauty products made from bee’s venom, a rapidly growing skincare trend which is already causing a bit of  buzz globally?
