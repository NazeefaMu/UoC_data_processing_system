Brandix boost for J.P.Morgan Squash Tourney

 
The Brandix Group's partnership with the J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions in New York this month saw Sri Lanka's leading apparel exporter on the global sporting stage for a third successive year as Official Apparel Solutions Partner and a Bronze Sponsor.
The world's largest spectator squash event, the 2016 J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions celebrated its 19th year of presenting the world's best squash players in competition on the four-walled glass court in Vanderbilt Hall in New York's Grand Central Terminal.
Defending champion and World No. 1 Mohamed Elshorbagy from Egypt beat three-time world champion Nick Matthew (England) in the Men's final, while seventh seed Nour El Sherbini from Egypt captured her first Tournament of Champions trophy by defeating 10th seed Amanda Sobhy (USA) in the Women's final.
The 2016 J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions featured 46 of the top 50 world-ranking players in the sport among the 112 athletes from 25 countries who competed in front of sell-out crowds throughout the week-long championship. As part of its sponsorship of this Professional Squash Association (PSA)World Series event, Brandix presented custom-designed and 'branded players' shirts to the players in the Men's and Women's draw.
The Tournament of Champions traces its famous international squash lineage back to 1930 when it was first staged as the "U.S. Professional." In the late 70s it became the World Professional Squash Championships and then the Tournament of Champions in 1993.
