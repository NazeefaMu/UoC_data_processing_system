Attempts were made before the parliamentary debate to change the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report in a way that it would not convey the real essence of the report, National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera claimed today.

He told a news conference that according to confidential sources an attempt had been made to alter the bond report in a manner that would prove the innocence of the culprits including former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake, former CBSL governor Arjuna Mahendran and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“It is apparent that the government is deliberately delaying and preventing the bond report from being debated in parliament. Some day the government will have to reveal the truth to the people,” the MP said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
