MMBL-Pathfinder Group has launched ‘Pathfinder - Money’, a Central Bank approved money changing service to cater to the fast growing tourism industry in Sri Lanka.


The pilot project for this venture was opened recently in the proximity of the MMBL-Pathfinder Headquarters at Riverpoint on Negombo Road in Peliyagoda. Following on the pilot stage, the ‘Pathfinder - Money’ network will be expanded in phases to important tourism centres in the country.
Another MMBL-Pathfinder Group company, MMBL - Money Transfer (a joint venture with Aitken Spence PLC.) is already the largest agent for Western Union Money Transfer in Sri Lanka. MMBL - Money transfer accounts for over US$150 million in annual inward remittances to Sri Lanka and has nearly 3000 agents throughout the island.


MMBL-Pathfinder Group President Neiliya Perera inaugurated the new project and Group CEO K. Balasundaram, Pathfinder Foundation Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke, Pathfinder Agro Director Dharmin Perera and Administration Director Nandana Devage attended the event.
