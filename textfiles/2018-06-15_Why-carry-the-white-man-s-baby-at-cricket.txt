Why carry the white man’s baby at cricket?


	


		
			ICC’s rules to restrict the movements of players outside the field might see fans distancing themselves from their cricket heroes
			
		 

I walked in to witness the first day’s play of the Test Match at Trinidad’s Queens Park Oval, after flying 23 hours, from Colombo. I was directed to the Gerry Gomes Press Box merging with the colors of the Caribbean sky.

A voice unknown boomed with an assuring “Hi Gomin, here are your papers” threw a tag at my direction while I searched for the passport to prove my credentials. The big man, who was a towering 6 feet and 8 inches tall, bellowed, “We know all about you, Man, don’t bother anymore”. The West Indian cricket administration looks tough and talks rough, but anyone of its officials is as gracious as the lady dressed in purdah. These officials, leading the journalists to the Press Box, are the kindest and friendliest of all!   



A few days ago, since my passport was stuck in the British High Commission in Chennai, the West Indian Cricket Authorities had only a photograph sent by the Dailymirror Editor to help me get accreditation. Therefore they had flashed my Googled image around the grounds for identification purposes and to make entry easy. Most officials at the Oval knew me as a lawyer than a freshly incarnated cricket correspondent- a title of small value in Sri Lanka. However this is a label that takes a person a longer distance in the Windies. Ironically in the Windward Isle of Saint Lucia working on the Google/Yahoo introductions had bloated me high. It also helped me earn an honourary visa at the the point of arrival, unannounced.   

 

Meeting Gurusinghe 
 

I made arrangements with Asanka Gurusinghe (Manager) - we had never met in person before- speaking terms on telephone via Mohan De Silva’s kind intervention. We later caught up on events over a meal in Trinidad – talking not necessary on cricket.   

 


In the Press Box I was informed by the West Indies Press that they had complied with the regulations to the full, whether lawful or otherwise on matters of human rights


 

When I went to extend the invitation during play to the players enclosure a foreign ‘white’ guy, holding out to be from the ICC corruption outfit told me politely to step back. I duly complied with the request and notified him the purpose of my mission. Asanka came out and informed from a distance, to the hearing of the ‘white gentleman’, that he cannot speak to the Press. Here was I wearing the press tag and identified as a representative of the Dailymirror  and not as one of the black sharks. Fair enough, went back to the Press Box thinking of safeguards employed by the ICC to save young cricketers from the betting community.   

The next day I saw from the Press box a Lion flag fluttering in a brewer’s stand. I decided take a walk there and found a twosome from Sri Lanka based in Toronto/Los Angeles. They sought my assistance to take a photograph with the team in the background during the break. I undertook to seek Chandimal’s permission and made the request in public gaze in front of the Joey Carew stand filled with past players to the brim. Chandimal agreed to the request after my appearance was made in the full view of hundreds of spectators in the Brian Lara Stadium and not in the slimy, sly and surreptitious mode of a bookmaker. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) knows me as their lawyer during the time of Ian Pieris and Ana Punchihewa before the 1996 World Cup.   

Nevertheless the ‘white mans burden’ followed me to the car park on that day. He nastily warned - not being polite this time- that if I did not stay confined to the Press box he would throw me out of the grounds after removing my badge. I told him that I am a lawyer and that infuriated him more. He probably thought that a cheeky bookmaker had sent a lawyer to stifle the ICC!   

In the Press Box I was informed by the West Indies Press that they had complied with the regulations to the full, whether lawful or otherwise on matters of human rights. I decided to lie low since there was no support forthcoming my way.   

 

Negative response by players 
 

The West Indian Cricket Authority in view of the titles of my articles gave me a complimentary ticket to the stand to which the entry of darker acolytes was prohibited. On arriving at that stand I learned from the handful of Sri Lankan visitors that they had expressed dismay after our players had ignored their arrival. This was the players’ response to the arrival of these visitors who had travelled a great distance at high expense to cheer them. Mendis had allowed the visitors to take photographs of him, while posing alongside with them. These are acts which make cricket fans fans proud of their Sri Lankan cricketers. This team was different from the ones in the past and tried hard to disassociate themselves with the Sri Lankan expatriates. Is this the result of the work unwittingly done by the white nations under the cover of the ICC because these same cricketers are a friendly bunch at home?   
A Sri Lankan lady living in the USA, who had witnessed my encounter with the ICC representatives, expressed sympathy at my misfortune of falling foul with the ICC in trying to promote goodwill towards our team!

Tamils abroad should not wait without supporting the mother country


 

At the time the members of the press were given an opportunity to meet the two captains, Chandimal walked away pretending not to hear me call out to him. Maybe did not hear me, but he did walk away alone prematurely. The local press did not pursue him as they had congregated around the winning skipper Jason Holder.   

I informed Gurusinghe that I wanted to speak to him as I knew he would be more expressive with a wider vocabulary at his command compared to a player. I sent him a message via an official spokesperson, our lady dean of the Press Corp. She was informed that the team meeting may take a while more and was told that there was no use waiting for it. So I left for the car park where I encountered the white man whom I previously bumped into. He heard my name being called and found out that Gurusinghe was being bold enough to respond to a call from this cub reporter from his own country. I posed Gurusinghe the questions I prepared, but warned him of possible perils and told him to exercise caution. However he responded to each prudently with wisdom. Helping is the least I can do to overcome problems, but not if the ICC keeps out proved patriotic countrymen due to brass stupidity!

He stated that players stick with the ICC guidelines. He said that some things were beyond the team management and they are helpless too. At least we have able men functioning as manager and coach and as the selector on tour.   

Are the competent authorities or the relevant minister taking necessary action to ease the suffering imposed by the ICC? Some of the ICC decisions have changed the character of our cricketers. Before long they may displease their supporters and clubs and might vanish into thin air.  

Are the Sinhala supporters correct in their assessment that Diaspora Tamils do not support Sri Lankan cricket teams abroad except for a few individual Tamils? This is an issue for the local cricket authorities to consider because cricket is a great leveler and helps in bonding communities. Cordiality abroad can evaporate easily as the Sinhalese abroad can become bitter with time if they see support from Tamils not forthcoming. Tamils abroad should not wait without supporting the mother country when its representatives take to sport.   

There is a difference in the outlook between black and white cricketers. This is due to the actions of the ICC. It seems that the West Indians, due to proximity to the USA, are still holding a colonial mentality and loving the British.   

I will keep the public posted of the proceedings from Saint Lucia by watching the games with interest in the coming weeks. I am no man’s slave here in the Caribbean.
