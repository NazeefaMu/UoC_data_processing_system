Running with the hare and hunting with hounds


	

There is a Diyawanna member who is often referred to by his colleagues these days as the ‘double-gamer’.




The politico has got this nick-name on being found that he had been playing the role of an informant for both the government and the JO in the council.


The members in small groups having gossip sessions in the lobby would switch their discussion to a different innocuous subject the moment they see the ‘double-gamer’ approaching them, they say. 


According to our source, whenever this member, now a virtual outcaste, aske, “Any important news, Malli?”, the others’ stock reply would be: “There’s nothing special, Aiya!”
