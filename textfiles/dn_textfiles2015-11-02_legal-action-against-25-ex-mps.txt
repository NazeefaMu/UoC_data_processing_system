Legal action against 25 ex-MPs

The Public Administration and Management Ministry has decided to take legal action against former MPs who have not vacated their official residences. Ministry Secretary J. Dadallage told the Daily News yesterday that about 25 former MPs are yet to hand over the official residences given to them. He noted that the ministry had sent notices asking them to vacate the official residences occupied by them as soon as possible.
“We have informed them that legal action will be taken if they continue to overstay in these residences.
Among them are former ministers and deputy ministers as well. Some have asked to grant them further time till December to hand over these residences.
We will send letters of demand thereafter. These are luxury residences located in the heart of Colombo City such as Lauries Road, Colombo 4 and Keppetipola Mawatha, Colombo,” Dadallage said.
He said the ministry has faced difficulties to provide accommodation to the new MPs as there are a limited number of official residences. Dadallage said many new MPs outside Colombo have applied for these residences.
“When processing the applications, we give priority to MPs in the outstation areas. However, each and every MP is entitled to the privilege of an official residence,” he said.
It is reported that none of the new comers to Parliament have been given official residences yet. While some of the houses are still occupied by the defeated candidates, some houses have to be repaired and refurbished before handing them over to the new users.
