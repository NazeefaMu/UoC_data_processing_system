Consumers should use electricity sparingly as water levels had gone down considerably in power generating reservoirs, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

"Despite the rainfall in the last few days, the water levels had not gone up considerably in reservoirs. Therefore we would have to produce electricity using alternative energy sources. That is for continuous producing of electricity. Therefore people have to use electricity sparingly," the Minister stated.

The Minister said at a ceremony at the historical Muhudu Maha Viharaya in Pottuvil, where he offered a solar panel system under the "Suriyabala Sangramaya Programme."
