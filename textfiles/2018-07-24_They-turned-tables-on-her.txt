They turned tables on her!


	

A fair second-in-command of a department collecting revenue for the Government, who was unduly rude to trade union delegates at an official confab had to lock herself inside her office room for several hours, they say. 




The fair deputy who too had sat with the departmental head at the talks held to discuss a transfer issue had jumped on the union delegates saying, “Who are you to tell what we should do? Go fly a kite if you don’t like our decisions!”


The irate trade unionists had later insisted on thrashing out the issue with the fair deputy who, finding that she had gone too far, had rushed into her office room and locked herself up.  


However, after making several unsuccessful attempts to force-open the door, the unionists had remained outside for a long time shouting and demanding that she come out to answer their questions, they say.
