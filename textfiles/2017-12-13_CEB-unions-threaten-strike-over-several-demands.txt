Following a discussion with officials of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry today, the CEB Joint Trade Union Alliance said it would take action if its demands were not met by tomorrow.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Joint Trade Union Alliance General Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said the Ministry Secretary accepted its demands.

"Ministry Secretary accepted our demands and said the final decision will be taken after the matter was discussed with the minister tomorrow. Also, the annual allowances and bonuses of non-executive employees have been curtailed. However, several officials have allegedly increased their allowances. The hunger strike launched by CEB employees will continue until their demands are met. The union will not resort to an indefinite islandwide strike because it could inconvenience the ongoing GCE O/L exams. However, in the event our demands are not met, we will certainly launch the strike after the exams are over,” he said.

When contacted Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Director (Development), Sulakshana Jayawardena, he confirmed that the ministry officials met with the trade union leaders.

"A solution to their demands will be provided tomorrow, after consulting the minister," he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
