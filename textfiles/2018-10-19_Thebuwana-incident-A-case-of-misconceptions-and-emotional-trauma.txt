The Police have been in the news during the past few days with the Inspector General of Police (IGP) himself making headlines as a result of his behaviour. Amid such a backdrop, another case of a law enforcement officer behaving in an unruly manner, this time as sergeant, was reported from Thebuwana. Sergeant Sanath Gunawardana is an individual who has joined the Police with determination to stand before the principles of the department. For an individual who has served Sri Lanka Police for 29 years getting promoted to a higher rank and the upgrading of payment are possibilities. But in the case of Sergeant Gunawardana it is not so. Held in captivity by the LTTE and after being jailed as a suspect during a firing incident followed by an interdiction, Sanath Gunawardana has remained stuck in the rank of sergeant for the past 27 years. Adding to his emotional pain was the recent incident where he was accused even after doing his duty. What happened after the incident made him observe the limits of what he could endure. Could it have been a misconception after all? The Dailymirror sheds light on the incident as follows :


 


What made me angry was the fact that I felt embarrassed when I was being scolded in front of the Mathugama Police OIC and the general public. What did I do to deserve such treatment? After all I was doing my duty

The incident 
 

On September 23, Sergeant Sanath Gunawardana apprehended another vehicle that was transporting sand without a valid permit. Sergeant Gunawardana would have expected the law to be enforced against the vehicle owner and the businessman, but things happened otherwise. Although it was reported that the Officer-In-Charge had to release the vehicle upon being pressured by individuals in power, it doesn’t seem to be the case. However, the Daily Mirror learns that the OIC had tried to settle things in a rather diplomatic manner when the Sergeant decided to go berserk. Since no action was taken to file a case against the vehicle owner, Sergeant Gunawardana decided to take a weapon in his hand in response to the injustice he had faced. Armed with a T56 assault rifle, the Sergeant had initially become vociferous in front of the OIC’s office and aimed the rifle at the OIC before going towards the town. Subsequently, he was arrested and produced before the Mathugama Magistrate. Following the incident he was interdicted while the Minister of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Ranjith Madduma Bandara instructed officials to submit a report in relation to the Sergeant’s mental state. However he was released a few days ago and in response to the incident, the President handed a sum of Rs. One million to the Sergeant who was later reinstated at work.

 


Sergeant and 44 others were held in captivity for four years 
 

“I joined the police during the JVP riots and amid a backdrop where those who joined the Police and Army were threatened with death,” Sergeant Gunawardana reminisced during an interview with the Daily Mirror. “This was back in 1989 and after passing out from the Police Training Centre in Kalutara, I started work at the Bambalapitiya Police Station. From there I went to the Oddusudan Police Station during December 1989. While I was there we were attacked by the LTTE in 1990 during a training class. The terrorists released the Tamil and Muslim police officers and held myself and 26 other Sinhala officers in captivity,” he recalled.

 


But he had gone to High Courts since he has an ongoing case. We had to wait and by this time the owner got angry and in turn had complained to the Mathugama Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). When the ASP asked me what had happened I said that the permit is valid, but I needed to show it to the Sergeant

Following that incident, the Sergeant and 44 others were held in captivity for four years. “We were then taken to a camp in Mallavi where we were blindfolded and asked to wear sarongs. Once again we were taken to another camp in Thunukkai. Our heads were shaved so they could identify us in the event we escaped. When they remove our blindfolds we noticed that we were in a large hall. There were blood stains and body parts everywhere. We knew it was a torture chamber because there were blood drenched Army uniforms all over the place,” he said.


From then onwards, the Sergeant had spent most of his life in hunger and pain. Although he never expected to be released, they were freed in 1994 after they went on a hunger strike. “After I was released, I returned to the Kalutara Police Station,” he continued. “Then in 1995 a Sinhala-Muslim riot took place in Kalutara and while trying to solve the issue, four Muslims were killed. Following this myself and few others were remanded because although we were following the orders of the Officer In Charge, who worked back then, the courts took the stance that such an order wasn’t given. The case is still continuing. With that I was interdicted for one and a half years and after being reinstated I worked at Jaffna, Kankasanthurai, Delft, Kopai and Kayts Police stations before I was shifted to Payagala. Then I was at the Kalutara-North Police Station, Cinnamon Gardens and Wadduwa before I was transferred to Thebuwana in 2016. So from then till now I have been working there,” he said.

 


But because we couldn’t find him anywhere and because the owner was wasting time we released the vehicle. Since the owner had complained about Sergeant to the Mathugama ASP, Sergeant Gunawardana had to go and give a statement there

 OIC U. Arulanandam


 


“We joined the Police because we had that spirit in us,” he said when asked why he wanted to join the Police during the riots. Sergeant Gunawardana has a long history with the Police and also carries gruesome memories while he being held in captivity by terrorists.

“The LTTE treated us inhumanely,” he recalled. “For them we were political prisoners and they tortured us from the beginning. When their camps were attacked by the Army, we were beaten till blood oozed out of our bodies. But when more Army personnel were killed in an attack, they would rejoice and would share food with us as well. We were chained from head to toe and there were times when all of us were chained together. It was a dark episode in all our lives,” he said. 

 When asked about injustices he has faced, Sergeant Gunawardana referred to the incident in Kalutara. “That changed my life because I was transferred and experienced much issues. Even though we were held in captivity by the LTTE, our service was never appreciated. But when Chandrika Kumarathunga was the President we were given one lakh and I was promoted to the rank of Sergeant. Hence for the past 27 odd years I have remained in this rank and haven’t got a promotion because of the ongoing court case. According to the law of the Police when a case is ongoing, the relevant official doesn’t receive promotions or salary increments,” he said. 

Speaking about the recent incident, Sergeant Gunawardana said that the sand lorry was at the Police station for a long time and the case wasn’t heard in courts.

“What made me angry was the fact that I felt embarrassed when I was being scolded in front of the Mathugama Police OIC and the general public. What did I do to deserve such treatment? After all I was doing my duty. This compelled me to take the weapon in hand. When the vehicle was released I felt rather discouraged because even after performing my duty I didn’t get the backup to proceed with the case,” he said.

 According to Sergeant Gunawardana, illegal sand mining takes place every now and then and he has even gone the extra mile to report such incidents to the subject minister himself. He has three children and the salary he earns is insufficient as he has to spend for the court case. 

“I haven’t received the reinstatement letter as yet, but I will report to work soon,” he continued with a smile. “I’m not on bad terms with anybody. I voiced against the injustice I faced and the public responded to it. As a police officer the way I behaved was inappropriate, but I didn’t have anybody to relate the emotional pain I was experiencing. The fact that I never was appreciated during war heroes’ commemorations, Remembrance Day or any other function affected me a lot. All those officers who were released are now serving in top ranks while I remain a Sergeant. But my message to fellow officers is not to become aggressive during these situations.

There will be officers who will listen to you so reach out to them. Talk about any differences you have with someone before coming into conclusions and taking hasty decisions,” he advised.

Disciplinary action against OIC

Deputy Minister of Public Administration, Law and Order Nalin Bandara said that the reports regarding the investigation are available. “According to the reports we will take disciplinary action against the OIC. In these kind of situations we have to consider both sides to the incident. The way the Sergeant behaved was inappropriate and the way the senior officers responded to it was also wrong. We cannot come into blind conclusions without knowing the facts,” said Bandara. 

He further said that the Government hopefully will be able to put a and to such incidents from happening in the future.

 


Cannot decide on media reports
 

Former Chairman and member of the National Police Commission (NPC) of Sri Lanka Professor Siri Hettige said that the NPC gets involved in matters under different conditions. “If there’s a public complaint against a Police officer or if disciplinary action has to be taken it comes under the purview of the NPC. But if the officer concerned is at OIC level then it’s up to the Inspector General of Police to take action.” said Prof. Hettige.

When asked about this particular incident Prof.Hettige said that they cannot come to a conclusion based on what has been reported in the media. “Already an inquiry is continuing and we have to see the actual facts before arriving at a conclusion. We have to address issues as and when they arise and before arriving at conclusions we have to observe the issue at grassroots level,” he said.

It was a total misconception

One prominent individual among the accused in this case was OIC U. Arulanandam who is alleged to have released the vehicle following orders from higher officials. However he related the incident to this writer in the following manner. “On September 28, Sergeant Gunawardana was doing the night shift and he had apprehended this vehicle at 4.00 am on September 29 stating that the vehicle was transporting sand without a permit. But they had a permit. By about 8.00 am the owner came to the Police and told me that he had a permit. When I checked he had a permit which was valid from 6.00 pm on September 28 to 6.00 am on September 29. But the vehicle was apprehended at 4.30am and therefore there was one and a half hours left for it to be an invalid permit. Thereafter I asked the owner to go to the Geological Survey Department and bring a report stating that the permit was still valid.

 “By Monday, October 1, he returned with the statement from the Geological Department, but before releasing the vehicle I wanted the owner to show it to the Sergeant as well,” he continued. “But he had gone to High Courts since he has an ongoing case. We had to wait and by this time the owner got angry and in turn had complained to the Mathugama Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). When the ASP asked me what had happened I said that the permit is valid, but I needed to show it to the Sergeant, so that he wouldn’t have any misconception about me. But because we couldn’t find him anywhere and because the owner was wasting time we released the vehicle. Since the owner had complained about Sergeant to the Mathugama ASP, Sergeant Gunawardana had to go and give a statement there.

“Then the next day, the Sergeant came with his weapon, loaded it and aimed it at me, shouting in filth and asking why the vehicle was released,” Sergeant continued. “I ducked under my desk because I didn’t want to be shot at. He fired twice, but nobody reported that those shots were aimed at me. People are of the view that I released this vehicle taking bribes. But I have served in the Police for 28 years and have never been involved in such shady acts,” said OIC Arulanandam. 

OIC Arulanandam is from Batticaloa and his father was taken away by the terrorists during the height of the war. To date, OIC Arulanandam doesn’t know his whereabouts. After the incident my children didn’t go to school for a week because they were scared. I was threatened by the people because they questioned as to how I could release one vehicle when I have apprehended their vehicle, also for a similar incident some time ago. Following death threats I had to keep senior officials informed because my family is in Colombo and I work here. However, it is a total misconception that reached another level,” he added.
