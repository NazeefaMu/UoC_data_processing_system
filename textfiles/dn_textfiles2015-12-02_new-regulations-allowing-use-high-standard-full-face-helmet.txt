New regulations allowing use of high standard full face helmet

The Attorney General (AG) yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that the authorities would introduce new regulations allowing the use of higher standard full face helmets.
The Senior State Counsel who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General made this submission before Court of Appeal Justice (President) Vijith K. Malalgoda sequent to three writ petitions filed challenging the police regulation. The Senior State Counsel further submitted to Court that the gazette notification already in place would be amended allowing the use of full face helmets.
Meanwhile, Court further extended the interim order staying the operation of the police circular banning the use of face-covered helmets until February 11.
The Court had issued this interim order sequent to three writ petitions filed by a chartered accountant, a retired Army Major and an attorney-at-law who sought an order prohibiting the authorities from taking any action on banning the use of such helmets.
Petitioner Rtd. Major Nalaka Indrajith, Chanaka Dassanayake and attorney-at-law Edward Ahangama had sought an interim order to suspend the operation of the gazette notification No. 644/20 dated January 11, 1991. In these petitions, the Police Chief, the Public Order Minister, the Internal Transport Minister and the Attorney General were named as respondents.
Counsel Thishya Weragoda, Pulasthi Rupasinghe, Iresh Seneviratne and Niluka Dissanayake appeared for the petitioners.
