Saying the SLFP would have emerged the absolute winner at the upcoming local government polls countrywide if the joint opposition had joined the party, UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera admitted that the UNP would be the ultimate beneficiary of the split.

“Our objective was to confront the UNP by amassing all the political forces including the JO, on the UPFA ticket. By doing so we would have won a majority of local government bodies. But the SLFP - JO talks collapsed because of the greedy and unreasonable demands of a few in the JO with the result that the UNP is now in an advantageous position,” he said.

The minister said the SLFP always wanted to keep the party undivided and contest the LG polls as a common front with all other like-minded parties.

He said the SLFP led UPFA would contest the polls with several minority parties on the UPFA ticket and win the election.

"The JO and the SLPP are now chasing a mirage unaware of their plight. They will realize their political blunder when the results of the LG polls are declared. Not only have the members of the Wimal Weerawansa-led National Freedom Front but members of many other parties have made overtures to the SLFP," the minister said.

He said the SLFP has been caught up in treachery, betrayal and legal action from the start but has emerged unscathed and ruled the country for more than three decades.

Top SLFPers like Maithripala Sirisena, T.B. Illangaratne, C.P. De Silva, P.B.G. Kalugalle and many others deserted the SLFP but it survived. Even the son and daughter of party founder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Sirimavo Bandaranaike left the party. But ultimately they achieved success in politics after returning to the SLFP,” the minister said.  (Sandun A Jayasekera)
