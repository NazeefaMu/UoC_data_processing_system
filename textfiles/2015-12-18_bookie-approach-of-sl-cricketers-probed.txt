A bookie had made approaches to cricketers Rangana Herath and Kusal Janith fix the result of the first Test between Sri Lanka and West Indies played between October 14-17 in Galle.Having refused the offer, the two have reported the matter immediately to the anti-corruption unit of Sri Lanka Cricket and an investigation is being carried out by the authorities concerned.A Sri Lanka Cricket official confirmed the approach but said that under the strict ICC guidelines they were not in a position to divulge any information regarding the incident or the investigation being carried out.Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera however confirmed the approach and said that an investigation is being carried out.“There had been two approaches during the Galle Test and it has been brought to the notice of relevant people to investigate,” the minister said. Minister Jayasekera said in Parliament on Wednesday that the doping scandal surrounding Kusal Janith could be a conspiracy to keep him out of next year’s T20 World Cup.“There could be some connection with the doping scandal and the fixing approach. I am not sure. This is why I said there could be a conspiracy,” minister explained.Urine samples were however taken before the Sri Lanka’s home series against Pakistan.(Champika Fernando)
