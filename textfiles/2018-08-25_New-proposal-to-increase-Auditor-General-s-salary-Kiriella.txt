New proposal to increase Auditor General’s salary: Kiriella


	

A new motion will be submitted to Parliament to increase the Auditor General’s salary and allowances, House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.

He told Parliament the new proposal would be for a salary much higher that what was proposed in the earlier proposal. “We withdrew the earlier motion to give a greater salary increase to the Auditor General. The government never meant to harass him,” Mr. Kiriella said.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) on Thursday charged that the government was trying to harass Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe by withdrawing the proposal presented to Parliament to increase his salary and allowances.

JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake made this allegation when Mr. Kiriella announced the government’s decision to withdraw the proposal on Thursday morning.

“Auditor General is carrying on a campaign to stop corruption and had already disclosed certain facts. We feel that the government is subjecting Auditor General to political victimization,” Mr. Dissanayake said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
