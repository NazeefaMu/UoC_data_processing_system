The government has granted Rs 90 million to construct 75 houses for those whose houses were destroyed in the Meeriyabedda landslide, said Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
The minister said the construction of the houses could be completed by January next year. He added that the funds has been directed to the Government Agent of the area.
The minister was speaking at a press conference at the Disaster Management Ministry.
Minister Yapa said the delay in construction of the houses was due to unavoidable circumstances. He added that the land to construct the houses had to be identified.
He added that due to the risky situation, the procurement of the construction materials also was a challenge.
“The site of the housing project had to be changed due to the 100 day programme” the minister said.
“However, the money has already been allocated and if needed, more money would allocated for this purpose,”he said.
