Tax dodger carries on regardless


	



 

A company running a factory has defaulted on tax payments amounting to some Rs.190 million, but the authorities concerned had failed to act either to recover the tax monies or to take punitive action against the company.

 


The company owner is said to be closely connected to a prominent politico. 


By the way, the authorities concerned when questioned, had cited the current unstable political situation as the excuse for not taking necessary steps to suspend the production operations of the factory, they say.
