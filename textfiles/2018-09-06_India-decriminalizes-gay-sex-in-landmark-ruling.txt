The Supreme Court read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, decriminalising consensual gay sex on Thursday.

A five judge constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, had concluded hearings on this contentious issue and reserved its verdict on July 17.

Section 377 refers to ‘unnatural offences’ and says whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to pay a fine.
