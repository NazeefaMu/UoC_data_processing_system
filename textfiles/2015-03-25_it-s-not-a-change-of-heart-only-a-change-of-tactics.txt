	There is a Blue bigwig who shunned the deposed Big Boss like a plague since the latter’s unexpected fall from power. He did not even care to answer a telephone call coming from the deposed Big Boss.

This Blue man now leading the opposition, in a surprise turnaround of late has begun singing the praises of the deposed Big Boss.
Intrigued by the sudden change in the opposition bigwig, several Blue Diyawanna members who had made discreet inquiries have discovered the reason behind this turnaround; the opposition heavyweight had to face the wrath of party activists at a district party seminar held at his home turf for his hostile attitude towards the deposed Big Boss. The angry activists had bluntly told the Blue bigwig that there is no future for the party sans the leadership of the deposed Big Boss.
The opposition bigwig has decided to change his tune after learning this bitter lesson at his home turf itself!
