Kerry amazed after seeing 100-day programme-Rajitha
	
US Secretary of State John Kerry was amazed after seeing the work done by Sri Lanka during the 100-day programme, claiming that even a US President could not fulfil such a large number of promises in such a short period, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Mr. Kerry expressed these views after meeting our foreign minister a few weeks ago. When he (Kerry) requested a work report from their embassy in Sri Lanka, he had expected a single page report but was astonished to receive a three page report, the minister said.

ComBank launches unique  short-term Millionaires Account
	
A new, aspiration targeted investment plan that enables account holders to build up a minimum balance of Rs 1 million within a specific period without a high initial investment, has been launched by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon, the largest private sector bank in Sri Lanka.
The first savings product of its kind in the local banking sector, the Commercial Bank Millionaires Account guarantees the depositor a balance of Rs 1 million or multiples of Rs 1 million up to Rs 10 million in three, four, five, or six years, depending on how much he or she is willing to deposit each month.
Designed principally to cater to a segment that needs to fast track savings for specific purposes such as the purchase of assets, childrens or own education or weddings, the new product is a flexible, easy to manage investment plan with a clear goal, that generates expected returns within a targeted period of time, the Bank said.
To many salaried workers with day-to-day expenses, becoming a millionaire in three to six years may seem out of reach, said Chandana Gunasekera, Commercial Banks Deputy General Manager  Personal Banking. With the Millionaires Account, we show how it can be done, with the support of Commercial Bank, one of the countrys strongest and most stable financial institutions.
Some people save in an unplanned manner, with no target balance in mind, and deplete their savings when needs arise. Our new product encourages taking a structured approach that can be customised to suit the payment capacity of the depositor and the duration of his or her choice.
Available to any Sri Lankan over 18 years of age, the Commercial Bank Millionaires Account that generates a balance of Rs 1 million requires a monthly deposit of Rs 25,000 over three years, Rs 18,100 a month for a four year plan, Rs 13,950 per month for a five year plan and just Rs 11,225 a month for a plan maturing in six years.
Depositors who wish to raise more than Rs 1 million may increase their monthly deposit according to the number of millions they wish to raise, up to a maximum of Rs 10 million. Depositors can also nominate beneficiaries to receive the total amount invested in the event of their demise before maturity.
We are very excited about the potential for this new product, Gunasekera added. Most other investment options that offer above average rates of return require a high initial investment. With this new product, depositors can invest as they earn, and their monthly commitment will diminish in significance as their regular earnings increase over the duration of the plan.
Commercial Bank ended FY 2014 with deposits of Rs 529.4 billion, following growth of Rs 78.3 billion or 17.34 percent over 12 months at an average of Rs 6.5 billion per month. The Banks assets stood at Rs 795.6 billion as at 31st December 2014.

The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) said today it would urge the government not to harm former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa because he was a conscientious government servant who risked his life to bring peace to the country.
BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said they were not supporting any politician but said the government should not risk Mr. Rajapaksas life.
Mr.Rajapaksa was conscientious government servant who has done a great deal of work to beautify Colombo City and restore peace in the country, he said.
The Thera said Mr. Rajapaksas life was in a great risk today as the LTTE Diaspora was raising its head in Europe.
He said it was not the intention of President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to imprison Gotabaya Rajapaksa but it was Chandrika Bandaranaike who wanted to do so because of a contract she undertook from the western countries.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

	Making a review of the first 100 days of the present government, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today said there were many aspirations of the people that had not been fulfilled during this period.
	JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the government had failed to establish a peoples friendly economy.
	He said there had been a delay in penalising those who had been allegedly involved in robbing public property and nationalising those properties though some probes were continuing.
	The JVP Leader said some had been cleared of charges as they happened to be associates of key persons in the government.
	He said the Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had been cleared of all charges this way.
	Dissanayake said some groups in the Opposition were involved in a conspiracy of jeopardising the enacting of the 19th Amendment, which had several positive components to re-establish democracy.
	Meanwhile, he said the JVP had decided to take to the streets to force the government to fulfill its pledges. He said the first street protest will be held today at the Fort Railway Station. (Yohan Perera)

President urges all MPs to vote for 19A
	
	President Maithripala Sirisenatoday urged all parliamentarians to ensure freedom for the people by voting in favour of the 19th Amendment and to be contributors to this act of ensuring democracy in this country.
	Addressing the nation on electronic media last night, President Sirisena said that when the people of this country voted on January 8, they clearly carried out both a transformation and revolution with their democratic right.
	The manner in which the freedom and democracy obtained by this transformation and revolution has been used by certain elements in the past three months, their political decisions and activities, brings to my mind the occasions in world history when countries that carried out revolutions were later faced with counter-revolutions.
	We are aware that very often it is a common occurrence in countries for a counter-revolution to follow a revolution. One could see a similar situation following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990-91. When the great humanitarian leader Abraham Lincoln of the United States took action to abolish slavery and introduced legislation for this purpose, for some time after this some of the people in slavery stated that they preferred the condition of slavery. This is because they thought that going forward in life in slavery was better than enjoying the freedom given and building themselves on their own strength, as they were used to living under conditions of slavery. This is the reality of human society. It is therefore essential that we understand this, he said.
	He said the ruling given by the Supreme Courts should be followed and one should not go beyond it.
	The president said there were obstacles in the path of the 19th Amendment when it was taken up in parliament recently.
	The Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that in keeping with my advice the executive powers should be removed. My Constitutional Advisor also informed the Supreme Court that these powers should be removed. We took a political decision on this. The Supreme Court has given a decision on this.
	I have not heard of any leader in the world who desired that his powers should be abolished but I am not boasting, the president said.
	I trust that all MPs will consider that it would be an honour for them to vote in favour of the 19th Amendment. You will earn yourself an honour which will go down in the history, he said.
	He said he also intended to get the Electoral Reforms Bill enacted just as he intended to get the 19th Amendment enacted.
	He said many had criticised him calling him a weak leader as he did not use his executive powers during the hundred day programme.
	Also he said that some alleged that he had given lands to the terrorists by removing the security forces from the North. This allegation is made by the extremists, he said. He recalled that lands even in Colombo were acquired by the security forces during the war and asked whether handing them back to the original owners was an offence. He said the land surrounding the presidential palace was also acquired during the war.
	The president said a task force had been appointed to recover government property. He said state assets which had been deposited in bank accounts would be reclaimed by this task force.
	He said all possible steps would be taken to curb corruption. But he said he had never made a single telephone call to any officer in the Bribery Commission.
	The president said that the number staff members was 1575 when he became president and it had been reduced to 600. He said he had decided to contest the last presidential election despite putting his life in danger. He said he faced this danger even today.
	He added that his government followed a balanced foreign policy and ensured that the countrys security would not be jeopardised at any time.
	When we are taking action against corruption and all these threats to society, there are people who like the slaves in America who were against the abolishing of slavery and said they preferred to remain as slaves. They seem to prefer a corrupt system and therefore mislead the public when action is taken to eliminate corruption and fraud.Full statement

	Jail terms should not be taken seriously as such experience was natural for them, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in Matale.
	I myself had served three months jail term, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
	The former president stated so while participating as a special invitee at the opening ceremony of new two storied Sangawasa at the Purijjala Sri Dammasiddharama Sri Sangabodi Pirivena Temple in Matale.
	As a Buddhist I didnt discriminate against any religion and also did not engage in hatred politics but the good governance government is trying to send Rajapaksas to the jail without seeking for the Attorney Generals advices. During the 100-day period all we could hear was allegations, he said.
	Basil was remanded and my secretary, former defence secretary and high ranks officials were called before the Bribery and Corruption Commission under the good governance.
	When Basil called me and told his desire to return to Sri Lanka I told that he would be arrested. He said he was innocent and had not done any wrong.
	Donating of clothing to Buddhist devotees had become a grave crime. Observation of Sil would also become an offence in future, former president said.
	There are numerous allegations against the Commissioner of the Bribery or Corruption. She had acquired a land in the Nuckles Reserve and made a road haphazardly and taken a CCTV camera through cheating. She had claimed two salaries and non-declaration of assets. It was my serious mistake not taking prompt action against her during my tenure, he said.
	Rajapaksa also spoke of the service he had done for the Buddhist education- Pirivenas- as a Buddhist leader. He said he had made enough financial contributions to the Catholic Church than any other leader and said he had donated a block of land to the Dambulla Mosque as well.
	He said he had a good rest during last 100 day period.
	But the country had gone back 100 years. Envy, hatred and revenge were spread throughout the country, he said. (Mahesh Keerthirathne)Pix by Mahesh Keerthirathne

President Maithripala Sirisena's Special Statement
	
Full statement

	On this occasion that marks 100 days since my election as President, I think it is proper that I address you as your first servant, appointed by you. Following the results of the Presidential Election on January 8 this year, you gave me the opportunity of being sworn in as the Head of State or President of this country.
	In the 100 days since then, we have as a new government, taken many important steps with regard to the countrys economy, politics, development and international relations.
	I think that when the people of this country voted on January 8 they clearly carried out both a transformation, and revolution with their democratic right. The manner in which the freedom and democracy obtained by this transformation and revolution has been used by certain elements in the past three months, their political decisions and activities, brings to my mind the occasions in world history when in countries that carried out revolutions were later faced with counter-revolutions.
	We are aware that very often it is a common occurrence in countries for counter-revolution to follow a revolution. One could see a similar scenario following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990-91. Similarly, following the fall of Communist states in Eastern Europe, when a political transformation took place in those societies that had moved towards political extremism, there was a period of political turmoil and uncertainty until the people of these countries could enjoy their entitlement to freedom and democracy. When the great humanitarian leader Abraham Lincoln of the United States took action to abolish slavery and introduced legislations for this purpose, for some time after this some of the people in slavery stated that they preferred the condition of slavery. This is because they thought that going forward in life in slavery was better than enjoying the freedom given and building themselves on their own strength, as they were used to living under conditions of slavery. This is the reality of human society. It is therefore essential that we understand this.
	Today some asked what has been done in these 100 days. I say, there was much done in these 100 days. Some of these valuable actions are neither physical in nature nor visible to the eye.
	You will recall the international situation facing our country at the time I was sworn in as President on January 9th. The international community was divided over us. You will remember what took place at the United Nations, the Human Rights Commission and the Security Council. However, after January 9th, because of the faith you placed in me and elected this government, the international community that was divided over us, now place their trust in this government, and me just as you did, and believe that as Head of State I would protect the freedom of this country and its Democracy, Human Rights and Fundamental Rights.
	My recent visits abroad started with our friendly neighbor India and later to Britain to participate in the Commonwealth Day events. Even more than my participation in the Commonwealth Day events was the opportunity to meet with the British Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Secretary of Defense and Her Majesty the Queen, on behalf of our country. By this, it is my belief that we have the support not only of Britain, but also of the wider European Union.
	My next visit was to China. As a friendly state that gave support for national development and made much investment in this country, I had the opportunity to further strengthen the friendship that existed between our two countries. I next went to Pakistan, which is one of our very close friends. I believe that trough these visits to India, China, Pakistan and Britain we have achieve a much towards winning over the entire world. Through the close friendship displayed by British Prime Minister David Cameron, Indian Prime Minister Sri Narendra Modi, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chinese President Xi Jingping have confirmed their trust placed in us for the protection and growth of freedom and democracy.
	I remember how close the world was to us at the time of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike with the foreign policy of Non-alignment, which my government too clearly follows today. This leads to strengthening friendship with all states.
	I also recall the good wishes conveyed to me when I was elected President by the UN Secretary General, whose Special Representative came to our country recently. Similarly, a large number of foreign ministers from Western countries and a large number of other diplomatic representatives visited our country and expressed their confidence in us.
	Therefore, I wish to emphasize to those who question what we have done in the past 100 days that we have regained the international friendship and trust that had considerably declined under the previous government, and that my government and I were able to win over and strengthen this friendship for the benefit of the people of this country. We must greatly value this new trust we have won which will provide us with cooperation for national development, especially for development of national resources and effective participation in international affairs.
	You are fully aware of the conditions under which you brought me to this office. I recall that prior to January 8 if I spoke to one of our own Pradesheeya Sabha Members by telephone they would shout and ask me not to speak because the telephones were tapped. The government officers did not speak freely. Ordinary people in the country would not speak freely. Members of the armed forces, the lower ranks of the police could also not speak freely on the telephone. None of them had the freedom to speak freely by telephone.
	In the past 3 months, this freedom has been restored and strengthened. This was similar with media freedom, too. I recall how prior to January 8 those who yielded political power spoke to the heads of media institutions, news directors and news editors. That included intimidation, threats and mental pressure. Today, the media is free of all this.
	Are we to transform the freedoms we have obtained to that of the wild ass I see some of the media institutions behave today. I am surprise how they use these freedoms in a wrong manner. It must be noted that we have firmly established the democratic rights of the people and the freedom of the media.
	Let us take the Judiciary. You are aware of how the rule of law was so badly damaged. Did the people have confidence in the Judiciary The Commission on Bribery or Corruption, the Supreme Court and all these institutions were subjected to telephone calls of those who were in power. You know very well how persons associated with various crimes obtained freedom at that time; how judgments in cases were obtained. Did the Attorney General have the power at the time to act according to his office Today, with the appointment of the Chief Justice, the Commander of Army, all who serve in those sections have a clear acceptance that these appointments had been made on seniority and suitability for such positions. Therefore, we have strengthened the Rule of Law, which is essential for freedom and democracy.
	National Security has now been strengthened. I informed the Tri-Forces and the Police at the Security Council that we need a new plan of action on national security. That work is now being done better than it was done earlier. This is only a beginning. We have to go much further in this regard.
	My dear people, there is another thing I wish to bring to your notice. Some have made various criticisms about my performance during these 100 days. Some say I lack strength. Some say it is weak. Some say I am no leader. However, I wish to tell all such critics, and you, my people, that my behavior in the last 100 days was not to use the unlimited powers that are available to this office. Why, because you elected me to distribute this power. I came for that purpose. I came to remove the unlimited powers of an Executive President. There could be many analyses about this. I wish to state clearly that my election manifesto stated very clearly that my election would be to remove the unlimited powers held by Executive President. I wish to mention how flexible I have been on this matter.
	From the time the 1978 Constitution was adopted, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party had been opposed to the Executive Presidential system. Therefore, since 1994 at every Presidential Election our candidates stated in their manifestos that the unlimited powers of the Executive Presidency would be removed. Yet, no one was able to do that.
	Similarly, the SLFP has from the beginning opposed the Manape electoral system that came with the 1978 Constitution. The Leftwing and progressive political parties are opposed to both of these. As I recall in 1999 the United National Party adopted a resolution at their convention against this. The UNP has been opposed to this since1999. This dialogue prevailed among the common people that went together with their knowledge, wisdom, understanding and experience. Therefore, this must be done. This is the 19th Amendment.
	In order to build a democratic and civilized society, it is necessary to prevent the emergence of dictatorship and taking control of state power, state assets, the judiciary, parliament and all of this to ones own control that comes from the Executive Presidential system.
	This should be immediately changed. I have worked towards this in the past three months. I am not aware of any leader in the world who had obtained an office with all these powers but has been as flexible in trying to get rid of those powers that had been bestowed on such a leader.
	The Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that in keeping with my advice these powers should be removed. My Constitutional Adviser also informed the Supreme Court that these powers should be removed. We took a political decision on this. The Supreme Court has given a decision on this.
	It is now necessary for us to act in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court. We cannot go beyond this. Therefore, in the past few days there were certain obstacles with regard to presenting of this 19th Amendment to Parliament. It is my respectful appeal to the honourable representatives of the people to consider this as a historic occasion that has come to you. Voting for this will bring respect in history to you. Therefore, in order to ensure that we build the country that protects the peoples freedom, democracy, promotes civilized society and helps build a disciplined country, it is my belief that every one of you will vote to adopt the 19th Amendment. I call on you to use your valuable vote for this and be a partner in firmly establishing freedom and democracy in this country.
	In addition to the 19th Amendment, a draft bill has been presented to the Cabinet to change the electoral system. Action is being taken to present this to Parliament for adoption.
	In keeping with the promises we gave to the people, we have appointed a Presidential Task Force to inquire into corruption and fraud and work on this matter is proceeding effectively.
	In order to build a strong democratic and equitable nation it is necessary to promote unity, friendship and coexistence among those who follow different religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity and also among communities such as Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers, we need ensure reconciliation and brotherhood that will eliminate mistrust, doubt and fear among people. The developed countries of the world that are democratic and give an important place to freedom have many different races, religions, languages and are multi-religious and multi-ethnic societies. It is therefore necessary for us to understand that while protecting the historic dignity and respect of the Sinhala Buddhist people, it is also necessary to ensure the brotherhood, friendship and coexistence among all communities and move towards a just society that will ensure the rights of the people.
	Moving further towards reconciliation, we have now appointed a Presidential Task Force and a Presidential Office for Reconciliation.
	Having understood the internal problems, we face as a country we must take every action to prevent situations that led to the armed conflict that lasted three decades. For this, the friendship among all people is essential. However, it is regrettable that our political opponents are using the Internet and some media to spread false information that the armed forces are to be reduced or removed from the North. That land had been given to LTTE terrorists in Sampur. That more rights had been given to the Tamils and Muslims than to the Sinhalese. Such stories are entirely spread by extreme racists. Please do not give such false information to the world. This leads to large-scale misleading of Sri Lankans living abroad.
	I wish to clearly state that during the time of the armed conflict the armed forces took private land for their use not only in the North and East, but also in the city of Colombo. Therefore, is it wrong to give these lands back to their original owners Should we not return the large extent of private property acquired in Colombo Fort near the Presidents House, around Temple Trees without any compromise on national security or weakening of and security camps However, there is wrong publicity given about this.
	We have a clear policy on this regard. A special Presidential Task Force has been appointed to regain State assets. Similar action is taken to recover the State properties transferred to others and funds belonging to the country placed in foreign banks. Action is being taken to obtain cooperation both within the country and abroad for this purpose.
	If we consider development, our country imports food worth Rs 400 billion from abroad annually. Therefore, are we self-sufficient With the building of roads and other constructions under the development of physical resources, this question of self-sufficiency is not solved. The national economy must be strengthened.
	Our country is one with a beautiful environment. The natural resources, climate and weather are blessings to this land. With such assets, we do not need to import Rs 400 billion worth of food. We have the objective to strengthen the local agricultural economy.
	Similarly, we are taking steps to strengthen the conditions of the public servants, workers and employees in the private sector. By addressing the needs of all these sections of the society we make our commitment to Good Governance as stated in our manifesto.
	The freedom and democracy that comes with Good Governance should not be abused for personal gain. However, our responsibility towards people of the country and for the children born tomorrow must be fulfilled.
	Every action will be taken to reduce and eliminate corruption and fraud. To this moment I have not made a telephone call or spoken to any officer in the Commission on Bribery and Corruption. I have not spoken to any officer in the judiciary. That is a necessity in good governance. The State sector should be an example to the people.
	When I took office, the number of employees in Presidential Office was 1575. Now it has been reduced to 600. Reduction of a 1000. That is our example.
	I very respectfully tell my people that I am committed to fully carry out the promises given in my election policy statement. I will leave no room for corruption, fraud, theft or waste. As I stated earlier when we are taking action against corruption and all these threats to society, there are people who like the slaves in America who were against the abolishing of slavery and said they preferred to remain as slaves. They seem to prefer a corrupt system and therefore mislead the public when action is taken to eliminate corruption and fraud.
	I have kept my faith with the people. I know that the people will take the correct decision. We cannot allow the law of the jungle to supersede a good legal system. I do not hesitate to take required decisions. I will take every step possible, especially to protect and strengthen the peoples freedom and democracy and through these means eliminate corruption and fraud, and thereby protect the genuine rights of the people. It was with the possible sacrifice of my life that I contested the election. That was like a leap into the ocean with the lives of my children myself at stake. I am so even today.
	I will conclude with the call to all my people to join in brotherhood and friendship to achieve the goals for which the people gave their mandate on January 8 and, therefore go forward to establish the society we seek for today and tomorrow.

Those who oppose 19A will be swept from politics - Ranil
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who sounded aggressive in expressing his desire to get the 19th Amendment passed yesterday said that all those who were involved in conspiracies to stop it from being enacted, including the Rajapaksa, would be swept away from politics.
	If we cannot get the 19th Amendment passed in parliament we will present it to a new parliament and all those who try to jeopardise it will be swept away from politics, he said, indicating that parliament would be dissolved if this piece of legislation could not be passed on April 27. He said all those who tried to jeopardise this move and all those who had robbed public funds would also be swept away.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe made this point when he met some party activists at Temple Trees this evening.
	He said major protests would be held near parliament on April 27 to force the MPs who were against the 19th Amendment to support it.
	The Prime Minister reiterated that certain groups were defending the wrongdoers and using parliament for such activities. He said such a parliament was not needed.
	Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said those who opposed political reforms were traitors.
	Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the UNP would use its May Day rally to press for political reforms and to show the partys strength. (Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Union Assurance sets industry benchmark higher with 11.5% dividend
	
		 		 
		 
			
Union Assurance declared an 11.5 percent dividend rate on their Life Advantage Plan for 2014.
This is a significantly higher return on interest than the minimum guaranteed rate of 8 percent, a rate that is still higher than the predicted average market interest for 2014, which stood at 6.69 percent.
The years bonus payout is consistent with the Companys practice of providing policyholders with a significantly higher return than promised.
This is the second year running that Union Assurance presented its policy holders with a higher than expected dividend rate, delivering a dividend rate of 11.75 percent while the declared minimum guarantee rate was 9.5 percent.
Policyholders of Union Life Advantage policies were able to enjoy this rate of dividend, which is based on the investment earnings on the life fund attributable to the dividend-based products of the company. The share of dividends is calculated based on the amount in the investment account, and is credited to relevant policy while the dividends will accumulate on a compounding basis.
Bonuses will be paid for with profit policies, which were in-force as at December 2014 with the bonus rate increasing for those policies in-force for more than 10 years. The company has been able to pay higher dividends and bonuses due to its continued growth in 2014 by earning over Rs. 10 billion in combined gross written premiums. The UA financial performance in 2014 also recorded an after tax profit of Rs. 1.2 billion, which is a notable growth (7 percent) over its performance in 2013.
Assistant General Manager, Life Operations, Iroshini Tittagalla, commenting on the achievement stated, The companys performance in 2014 continued in the upward trajectory and it has considerably strengthened its position over that of 2014. The outlook for Union Assurance in 2015 continues to be extremely positive. The strong numbers this year demonstrates our determination to achieve, and our commitment to rewarding the trust and confidence placed upon us by our loyal customers.
Union Assurance operates on the platform of Trust, which enforces the brand values of convenience, respect, and transparency. Union Assurance believes that sustainable growth can be achieved and maintained through the use of correct strategies that ensure that the right people and the best processes are in place to provide an all-round customer experience. This customer-centric approach has resulted in steady and continuous growth over the years, with excellent end-year financials results in 2014 reinforcing the Companys reputation as a trusted service provider.

Video: BC turned into hunting mansion: NFF
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) today accused the government of misusing the Bribery Commission (BC) to witch-hunt its political opponents and to tarnish the image of the former President.
The Bribery Commission had been converted into a hunting mansion and the government had appointed a Hunting Princess as the Commissions Director General to hunt political opponents. Today, the government had stoop so low that it is accusing former president Mahinda Rajapaksa on baseless charges, NFF Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said.
He accused the government had also made schemes to damage the image of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
These are the helpless attempts of a bankrupt government, he said. 
Muzammil said the main objective of the 100-day programme was to eliminate the defeated political force completely but had failed in doing so.
He said patriots had gathered around the former President at the end of the 100-day programme against the Prime Minister. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond
