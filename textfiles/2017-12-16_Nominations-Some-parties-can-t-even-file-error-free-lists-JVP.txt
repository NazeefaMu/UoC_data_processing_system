Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) General Secretary Tilvin Silva said his party was in a victorious position even prior to the election on the basis of having all its nomination lists accepted by the returning officers unlike some of the other political parties.

He said it was an act of irresponsibility by those in power or those seeking power to have failed to prepare error-free nomination lists.

“The nomination lists submitted by the JVP so far have all been accepted. We prepared them well in advance to ensure they were error-free,” Mr. Silva said and added that they were already preparing the next batch of nomination lists.

He said local government bodies had been riddled with fraud and corruption in the past and added that they had fielded candidates untainted with fraud or corruption charges so as to render a people-friendly service if elected.

Mr. Silva said the JVP had convened a national convention to be attended by all its candidates where they would pledge to provide a honest service to the people and for this purpose the party would also introduce a code of ethics for their candidates. (Ajith Siriwardana)
