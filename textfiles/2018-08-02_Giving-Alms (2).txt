Giving Alms


	



Last week in Colombo, a generous group of local women gave alms to the 70 young priests at Wickremashila Pirivena temple by making them breakfast. Headed by Mrs Kanthi Ubayakumara, the kind hearted friends made vegetable rotis and faluda for the priests. Even though Mrs Ubayakumara doesn’t have a lot to give, she strives to help those around her and has been doing so since she was a child. 

Her motto “dun dey suwandai, kae dey gandai” (What you give has a sweet fragrance, what you eat stinks) has been passed down by her mother and in turn she has passed it down to her daughter, Sulo, who also helped with making the breakfast.
