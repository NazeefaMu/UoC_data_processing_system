Rajapaksa probably  loves what  he sees


	



 


It would be apt to say that Rajapaksa would have had little or no chance to reach the pinnacle in politics if there was no LTTE


 

Nine years after the demise of rebel leader Velupillai Prabakaran he is still in the news. This time the slain tiger leader’s name was brought under the spotlight by former State Minister for Children’s Affairs Vijeyakala Maheswaran. One thing that the people of this country must fathom is that though it was possible to wipe out the LTTE erasing the name of Prabakaran is something impossible. This is because the one time tiger leader is considered as a demi God in the North.   


Vijeyakala was publicly bashed for hero-worshipping Prabakaran. The joint opposition called for stern action against her. The UNP didn’t remain silent over the issue either. Now we hear that she has left the country and is in London.   


The South has been vociferous over the activities in the North, especially when the Tamil community wished to commemorate the rebel terrorists who died in the conflict. But if we analyse the psyche of the Southern politicians, the most accomplished parliamentarian from this province, Mahinda Rajapaksa, came to power during the height of the LTTE.   


It would be apt to say that Rajapaksa would have had little or no chance to reach the pinnacle in politics if there was no LTTE. Rajapaksa’s staunch promise once sworn in as president was to finish off the war. This task not only made him a hero, the milestones passed during the take over of towns on the map to the North were given much publicity. The SMS campaign carried out by the Government using a mobile phone service provider confirms this.

World history has shown that arrogant rulers have jumped at the opportunity to go to war, when they knew that it would help their survival. Rajapaksa rode on this popularity wave for a long time and chanted a mantra about winning the war until it became a sore to the ears of the majority of the citizens. 

 
People of this country were so sick and tired of the ‘old war story’ and the man who took much of the credit for this success that they voted for a change at the 2015 Presidential Election.   


The country moved from dictatorship to democracy under a unity Government, which the Tamil minority too supported.   


 Though the majority of Sri Lankans don’t wish for a LTTE resurgence, the talk about the LTTE helps bring Mahinda Rajapkasa and his able brother Gotabaya to the minds of the people. For these two Rajapaksas even a suggestion that the LTTE could surface is like sweet music to their ears. But publicly they’d deny wanting to see the LTTE return.   


We can’t forget the fact that it was the LTTE’s wish to see Mahinda Rajapaksa be elected as president at the 2015 Presidential Election. Prabakaran with his warrior mentality preferred to go to war with Rajapaksa than see himself be seated at a table talking peace with the other candidate at the election Ranil Wickremesinghe. Prabakaran understood war, but knew little about taking on a politician from the South. There is a saying in the Sinhalese community that one should think twice before taking on a man from the South because the Southerners are ruthless and also have warrior mentalities.   


The recent spate of killings and shootings in some parts of the island have brought back memories of the war, that concluded nine years ago. Almost every other day we get to hear of some violent incident being reported in newspapers. If this unstable environment continues for some more time it will lay the ideal platform for the Rajapaksas to return to power.   


The remaining period up to the 2020 Presidential Election is crucial for this country. Burdened by enormous foreign debts and a cold war between the President and the Prime Minister of the country, this unity Government is currently on life support.   


The 19th Amendment to the Constitution blocks Mahinda Rajapaksa from becoming Sri Lanka’s President for the third time. But to hell with the Constitution, Rajapaksa showed that he is still the most marketable person in Sri Lankan politics by spearheading the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to reign supreme at the last Local Government Polls.   

 


The talk about the LTTE brings MR and Gota to the minds of the people. For these two Rajapaksas even a suggestion that the LTTE could surface is like sweet music to their ears



Though the former president brought peace to this country he will be seen as the ‘need of the hour’ if the country plunges into an unstable war -ike situation where there are shootings and contractual killings.   


Vijeyakala did Mahinda Rajapaksa a favour by talking about slain tiger rebel Prabakaran. The immature Vijeyakala fled the country leaving the experienced Rajapaksa to ride on the wave she created. Rajapaksa possibly loves the development in the political scene which suggests to the outside world that this nation is functioning without a leader!
