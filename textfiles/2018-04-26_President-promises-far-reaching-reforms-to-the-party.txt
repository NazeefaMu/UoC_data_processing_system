President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly promised to introduce political reforms to Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) with a change of some office bearers between May 8 and 15, it is learnt.

The President made remarks to this effect at the SLFP Central Committee meeting on Tuesday evening. This was the first Central Committee meeting conducted after 16 members of the party decided to leave the national unity government.

These MPs insisted at the meeting that the remaining members should also leave the government and revitalize the party.

Besides, Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake also said the SLFP, as a party, should sever links with the government.

Those who relinquished their ministerial portfolios argued that Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake should be removed from the General Secretary post of the party.

The President said he would take initiatives for, far-reaching reforms to the party between May 8 and 15. (Kelum Bandara)
