Northern Province Chairman C.V.K Sivagnanam yesterday requested President Maithripala Sirisena to release the political prisoners and detainees through a Common Pardon.
Sivagnanam in a letter addressed to the President said these political prisoners are under detention for years and years without any trial or judicial process contravening all norms of justice and human rights. The Northern Province Chairman in his letter urged the President to release them and stop the ongoing fast unto death commenced by the Political prisoners and detainees.
Excerpts of the letter: We wish to draw your very kind attention to the fast until death commenced by political prisoners and detainees in almost all the prions in the country today.
"In this connection, a copy of the Resolution adopted by the Northern Provincial Council at its sittings held on 19.11.2014 and sent to the former President on 25.11.2014, with no action taken is reproduced below: for your kind information
"Many hundred of Tamil who were arrested on suspicion during the period of war in the North are still detained in prisons for about eight to fifteen years"
"Most of them are detained without any court action and many others whose cases are still pending for many years are suffering in prisons".
"Therefore, this Council requests His Excellency the President, Minister of Justice and the Attorney General to grant amnesty at least on humanitarian grounds and release all political prisoners who are being detained in Sri Lankan prisons even after the war coming to an end more than five years ago We would therefore implore upon your excellency, to be sympathetic towards these hapless human beings and show mercy an compassion towards them," the letter stated.
