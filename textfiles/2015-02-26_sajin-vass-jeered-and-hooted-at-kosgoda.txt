	While former monitoring MP Sajin Vaas Gunawardene was speaking at the opening of a fuel station in Kosgoda, a group of UNP supporters who arrived at the site began hooting and jeering causing him to interrupt his speech.

The UNP organiser Kamal Jayantha De Soysa and Balapitiya Pradeshiya Sabah UNP member K.U. Shantha Mendis who had arrived at the function earlier, walked out of the meeting no sooner Sajin arrived at the site.
They returned later and protested at the speech made by Sajin.
