Fairfirst Insurance is the amalgamated entity of two prominent general insurance companies of Sri Lanka namely, Union Assurance General and former Asian Alliance General Insurance. Fairfirst recently entered into a strategic partnership with Stafford Motor Co. (Pvt.) Ltd, the sole distributor for Honda. 
This tie up will expand the wing of Honda Protection, which is a value addition offered by Honda to its customers. The cover exclusively designed and underwritten by Fairfirst Insurance for Honda customers includes an unlimited third party body injury cover, third party property damage cover up to Rs.100,000 and an accidental hospitalization cover worth of Rs.200,000 per annum, which also includes an ambulance service cover. This unique insurance cover will be offered to Honda customers at no charge. 
Commenting on this partnership was Stafford Motor CO. (Pvt.) Ltd Executive Director Tarindra Kaluperuma. “The Honda Protection cover is a great add on benefit to customers. We are confident about partnering with a brand like Fairfirst whose lineage in Sri Lanka and global expertise in insurance ensures we offer a solid cover to our customers.” 
Today, Fairfirst serves individuals, businesses and institutions across this beautiful island through a versatile workforce of 1400 spread across their well-knitted network of comprehensive service centres, affinity partners and leading brokers in the market. Their holding company – Fairfax Group, headquartered in Toronto, is engaged in property and casualty insurance and reinsurance and investment management across the world. 
General Manager Sales and Marketing Niranjan Nagendra added, “We are very enthusiastic about partnering with Honda on this initiative. Despite Fairfirst being a new name, the combined strengths of former Union Assurance General and Asian Alliance General allows us to offer some great value for money products.” 
Honda recently launched the new Honda Navi motorbike for Sri Lanka’s booming younger generation. With over 40 years of experience in the Sri Lankan automobile market, some of Honda’s key models include Honda CR-V, HR-V, Honda Civic from the four-wheelers and Honda Dio, Honda CB Hornet 160R, Honda CD 110 Dream and now the Honda Navi from the two-wheelers.
