The Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) reputation was damaged soon after President Maithripala Sirisena became its Chairman, former Minister Basil Rajapaksa said yesterday.

Initiating the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) membership drive targeting the Provincial Council elections, Mr. Rajapaksa said that the SLFP’s down turn in popularity could be seen when you see the plight of the Habaraduwa and Rathgama SLFP organizers, who were kicked out.

“The last hopes of the SLPF in the Galle District were lost as a result of both organizers being replaced. They were responsible, trustworthy MPs who think about the country and its people. From the day President Sirisena was elected as the leader of the party the SLFP lost most of its prestige,” he said.

Further, he said that by appointing candidates from the National List to fill the vacancies left by the two reputed organizers, the party has ensured the collapse of the SLFP. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
