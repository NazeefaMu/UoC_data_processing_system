Commenting on the decision by the United States to quit from the UNHRC, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M. A. Sumanthiran said his party would work with other countries that co-sponsored the resolution on Sri Lanka to ensure that its provisions were implemented.

He said there were four key countries that co-sponsored this resolution – the United States, Britain, Montenegro and Macedonia.

He said, in the absence of the US in the UNHRC, the other three countries would follow it up.

Also, he said the resolution on Sri Lanka was adopted unanimously on two occasions.

“Sri Lanka also co-sponsored it twice. Therefore, there should be no dispute on that. Sri Lanka has committed twice to the international community,” he said.

“To that extent, it will be obliged,” he said.

Asked whether it would be challenging without the US, he said the role of that country was crucial when votes were taken on resolutions on Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013. However, he said that there was a consensus resolution at the moment. (Kelum Bandara)
