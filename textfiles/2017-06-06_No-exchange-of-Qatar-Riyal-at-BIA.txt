All the state and private banks at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) airport, Katunayake would not exchange any Qatar Riyal (currency) until further notice, BIA Duty Manager said.

He further said most of the local banks exchange Qatar Riyal with Singapore banks and they also refused to exchange Qatar Riyal currencies.

The decision fallows seven countries in the Middle East severing diplomatic ties with Qatar.

Meanwhile the BIA duty manager said that no flights had been restricted yet between Doha and BIA.

He said two direct flights from Doha by Qatar Airways will arrive at BIA at 9.50a.m and 3.20p.m today and another flight will arrive tomorrow morning at 2.10. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
