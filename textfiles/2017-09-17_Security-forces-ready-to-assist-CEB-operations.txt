Military personnel were on standby to provide assistance to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to carry out operations, Military Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne said today.

He said the military would do so only in case the CEB made such a request.

Maj. Gen. Seneviratne said a special team comprising security forces personnel have been on standby since the launch of the CEB strike.

The members of the CEB Workers Union are on a countrywide strike from September 13 over several demands and had warned they would not attend to breakdowns, except at hospitals. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
