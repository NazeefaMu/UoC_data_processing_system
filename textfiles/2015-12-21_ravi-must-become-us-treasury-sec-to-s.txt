Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila today requested US President Barack Obama to appoint Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake as the US Treasury Secretary so as to help stabilize the Sri Lankan rupee in a reverse procedure.
He told a news briefing that though the government was fighting to stabilize the Sri Lankan rupee which had fallen sharply in value against the US dollar, the solution was not far away but within the government itself.
“Since January, the SLR has depreciated in line with the new government policy for floating the currency. I have a solution which I strongly believe will be enough for Minister Ravi Karunanayake to solve the problem in a reverse order. If he can become the US Treasury Secretary he could bring down the value of the US dollar to the level of the SLR,” Mr. Gammanpila said.
He requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss this matter with US President Obama. (Piyumi Fonseka)
