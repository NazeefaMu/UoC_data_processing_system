A forged letter shrouded in mystery
	

Amid the continuing furore over the bond fiasco comes a story about a forged letter said to have been sent to a certain company by the bank of banks.

The letter purportedly written by the head of the bank of banks had sought details of certain transactions carried out by a female official of the bank with that company.
Smelling a rat, the company high-ups had made inquiries and it had transpired that someone had forged the signature of the head of the bank.
By the way, the female official linked to the forged letter is said to have been deeply involved in the much publicized bond issue.
An inquiry into the forged letter is about to be launched, they say.
Meanwhile, various theories about the motive behind sending the forged letter are being adduced in banking and political circles. Some say that this affair will end up as a typical case of someone falling from the frying pan to the fire.

Blood is thicker than water
	

Blue stalwarts in yahapalanaya have now begun making fresh moves to unite the virtually splintered party.

Having considered the results of the recently held countrywide polls to co-operatives as a realistic indicator of general opinion of the partys rank and file, the Blue seniors had held a series of powwows at the official residence of the Betel leafs secretarial one to work out a peace strategy. However, the objection raised by several front-liners like the dark talkative one from Moneragala and the fair flamboyant one from Badulla to taking the former strongman on board had become the main stumbling block to the progress of the peace talks.
Later following a decision taken to woo the sober eldest sibling with a view to offering him the mediator role, they had sent an emissary to meet him. The emissary, a top team member, presenting the proposition to the former chair of the council had conveyed the message that should he (the latter) agree to play mediator to unite the two factions, he would be offered a very high position in the Blue party hierarchy.
The former Diyawanna chair who quietly listened to the proposal had replied with a disarming smile: First consult Malli. Whatever he says goes for us too! Talks ended on this indecisive note.

Bond scam: JVP will campaign on six demands
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which highlighted that the government cannot run away from its responsibility of taking action against those who are charged with the bond scam today said it would campaign on several demands regarding the issue.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a media briefing that his party will campaign on six demands with regard to the bond scam.
He said the demands includes holding investigations on the basis of the report put out by the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE), to penalise those responsible for the scam and reimburse the amount which had been defaulted. The party also said former Governor of Central Bank Arjuna Mahendran should be removed off from all posts he currently holds in the government. The JVP further called for action to prevent Perpetual Treasuries from transferring its assents offshore, remove the company from the list of primary dealers, recover all other officers of the Central Bank who are involved in the scam on a temporary basis. The sixth demand was investigations on all bond issues carried out by the Central Bank in the recent past including the investment on Greek Bonds.
We will not handover the document to either the President or the Prime Minister but would present it to the people and will agitate for action together with them, Mr Silva said.
Asked as to why the party failed to include other demands such as calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mr Silva said that would not be of much use as a politician resigning from a post accepting the responsibility for any wrong deed is not a norm in Sri Lanka. Has any political leader resigned from a post he or she is holding accepting the responsibility for wrong doing he questioned.
When questioned about the statement made by Mr. Mahendran before the COPE in August 2015 involving Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, the JVP General Secretary said former Central Bank Governor involved Prime Ministers name in a bid to escape.
Further he charged that the Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have already got into a deal to sweep the bond scam and other shady deals of the Central Bank under the carpet. However, he said his party will fight together with the people to prevent such an eventuality.
Both allies of the government, namely the United National Party (UNP), and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) stating both are giving lip service to the issue while the joint opposition is using it to cover up the corruption charges which they are facing, Mr Silva added. (Yohan Perera)

The first instalment amounting to 10 per cent will be paid within a month after signing the agreement, the second installment amounting to 30 per cent within three months and the rest within six months.
President Maitripala Sirisena has also endorsed the proposal. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe Ranil Wickremesinghe briefed the Cabinet on the proposed plan worked out by the Cabinet sub-committee on Economic Management. (Kelum Bandara)

He had learnt that silence is gold!
	

A group of Diyawanna members and Deputies from the Green party were engaged in an animated discussion in the council lobby the other day. The subject under discussion was the latest COPE report.

Our people will soon forget this affair as usual, a party member from the Colombo district remarked lightly.
However, a young member from the Gampaha district was not prepared to shrug off the affair as a passing cloud. He said: The end-result of this Bond affair is that we have to think twice before calling others rogues in future.
The attention of the Green members at this stage turned to a Deputy who happens to be a member of the COPE. They expected this Deputy to defend their role in regard to the Bond affair. But the Deputy was grinning without making any response. Intrigued by his silence, two or three young members told the Deputy: Aiya, why dont you say something You were in it and you ought to know what really transpired.
Pressed by all present to speak up, the Deputy said: I expressed my candid opinion about this affair at the very outset. And then I was moved out of the Ministry where I was happily working and was parked where I am today. If I take the liberty to express my genuine opinion about it again, I might be shifted out of the present Ministry as well. Thats why I keep my mouth shut. The Deputy walked away soon after giving this answer to his inquisitive colleagues.

I would have invited them in: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday that he would have allowed the disabled soldiers who were staging a protest on Monday to come into his office had he been in Sri Lanka.
He made this observation at a ceremony to mark the first death anniversary of the social activist and monk, the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) last evening.
I would have allowed the protesters to come to the Presidential Secretariat and do what they wanted to do if I was in Sri Lanka. I would have sent them a message to this effect if I was informed of the situation, he said.
The president said the protesters had been backed by some political force to act in the way they had.
These soldiers would not have known who was controlling them, he said, adding that they had only been attacked with water.
The disabled solders first stated their case eight years ago; but it was referred to us only four months ago. I studied the matter and submitted a paper to Cabinet to meet their demands, which was a difficult task, and the stage was set to grant them what they wanted. Some of the protesters conferred with my officers at the Presidential Secretariat and the matter was settled. The commotion started after these soldiers apprised the protesters who were outside, of the position. However the media and some of those who worked towards bringing us to power had interpreted it in a wrong way and said the government had attacked the war heroes, he said.
Furthermore, he said there was a political force behind the protest by farmers in Dambulla. He said that one protester had even asked the police why they were not attacked.
The President promised that the government would work towards meeting the demands made by the Movement for a Just Society and bring about political reforms. This government has brought in some reforms in the form of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. This was a difficult task as the government did not have sufficient numbers in Parliament to see the amendment through. We did our utmost under difficult conditions and with the judiciary saying that some reforms should be approved by the people through a referendum," he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said all parties had almost reached a consensus on several aspects of the new Constitution, including power sharing, abolition of the executive presidency, a mixed electoral system, the status of Buddhism, minority communities, religions and language. All parties have reached agreement on these aspects. We have now to discuss how to bring about stability in the absence of the executive presidency, and whether we should go in for the Westminister system or look for an alternative, he said. He said it had to be decided whether to go for a dual chamber system. It would be possible to finalise something about the Constitution by the time President Sirisena reaches the second year of his current term, he said. (Yohan Perera)

JO lodges complaint against Ravi
	
The joint opposition yesterday lodged a complaint against Finance Minster Ravi Karunanayake at the Bribery Commission over three cases of financial misappropriation during the Yahapalana government.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said they have gathered documents regarding twelve different cases amounting to Rs. 10 billion against Minister Karunanayake and added that they were lodging only three complaints as of now.
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has assigned a group from joint opposition MPs to investigate on the financial misappropriations which took place during the Yahapalana regime, MP Aluthgamage said.
He said they would release step by step the rest of the Yahapalana ministers who were engaged in financial misappropriations under the Top Ten  Yahapalana Mega Thieves investigations made by them.
Meanwhile, addressing the media briefing, joint opposition MP Ramesh Pathirana said Minister Karunanayake had caused the State a loss of Rs. 10 billion by releasing 800 Prado vehicles and 700 Benz vehicles from the Sri Lanka Customs.
Minister Karunanayake has released these vehicles just paying Rs. 1.6 million per one vehicle which was needed to pay Rs. 8 million per one, he added.
He said Minister Karunanayake had also engaged in a large scale financial misappropriation in connection to two private companies, Global Park Company where his daughter was currently acting as the director and a Singaporean Company.

Malinga refuses SLC Contract
	
Injured pacer Lasith Malinga had refused the Annual Cricket Contract offered to him by his employer - Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) for the 2016/2017 period.

Malinga, the worlds most feared limited over player with a sling arm action is recovering from a stress reaction in the knee.

Malinga suffered the injury during Sri Lanka's home series against the West Indies last November and has played only one competitive game since, missing the World Twenty20 in India as well.

They (SLC) offered me a contract. But, since I have not played any cricket over a year, I said NO, Malinga said in an interview with Daily Mirror.

 But I am honoured to get a contract even when I am out of cricket for sometime. If I accept it, its unfair by others. Instead I told them to give me an opportunity to play.

In August, Malinga hit the nets as he declared himself fit to play in the limited over series against Australia.
However, he was not selected for the series as the SLC doctors deemed him unfit to play.

Malinga now believes he could make a return to international cricket during the two-match T20 series against South Africa in January next year.

I think I have recovered around 60 percent now. With over two months left for the series, I think I will be in good physical conditions to play in the T20 series. I dont want to put too much pressure by playing in the 50-over matches at this stage. So, I will start with the T20s now and hopefully I will be ready for the Champions Trophy in England. I would love to be part of that tournament and give my best to the country, he added.

Malinga was also critical of the selectors who included him for the World T20 Team despite the injury.

 I dont understand their thinking. When I said I am injured, they insisted I play and when I said I am fit, they didnt select me. Any way I have played over 13 years for my country and I am immensely satisfied with what I have achieved during that period, he added.

Malinga who is the first bowler since D. S. de Silva to lead the national side said that he expects more bowlers to be given the role of national captaincy.

Bowlers are as good as anyone to lead the side. I proved it and now Rangana proved it. I hope we will have more bowling skippers in the future, he concluded. (Sanath Desmond)

Much more to do in SL to end sexual violence: UK Minister
	
Visiting British Minister for the UN and Commonwealth Baroness Anelay yesterday said there is still much more to do in Sri Lanka in order to end sexual violence and as well as to secure long term peace and stability.
Speaking in Colombo, the British Prime Ministers Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Anelay said if the issue is not confronted, it could erode hope in the future and undermine trust between communities.
She emphasised that UK would give its fullest support to Sri Lanka in strengthening human rights, democracy and reconciliation as they would expect that Sri Lanka would deliver the commitments set out in the UNHRC resolution.
Stating that even in Sri Lanka, sexual violence is a difficult subject to discuss, however she praised the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict endorsed by the government.
She highlighted the need of womens views which were represented in Governments plans for truth and reconciliation.
Meanwhile, she said de-mining is vital to enable families to remake their lives following the conflict. I was pleased that I had the opportunity to visit Tellipalai to see what a difference this is making.
She also said that the purpose of UK in campaigning to end Sexual Violence in Conflict was not only to prevent people to prevent sexual violence but also to support survivors afterwards.
She shared her experience in Jaffna where she had visited the community policing programme which trains police officers working on womens and childrens issues. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Rupee drops to Rs.150 against dollar: Bandula
	
The value of the rupee against the US dollar has dropped to Rs.150 raising concerns among the people of possible price hikes on imports including food items and raw materials, the joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane said yesterday.
He said the rupee had drastically depreciated under the current Government and would lead to an economic crisis if remedial action was not taken.
In 2012, it was Rs.127. It dropped to Rs.129 in 2013 and Rs.131 in 2014. Today, it is Rs.150. This is big drop. The prices of essential items are bound to rise as a result of the depreciation, the MP said.
He said sugar, dhal, milk powder, and lentils were among the widely consumed food items being imported to the country.
The MP who heads the economic research unit of the JO said it would affect the manufacturing sector as well.
Last year, the rupee component of the countrys total external burrowing plummeted by 285 billion. It is even higher than the total revenue of the government by way of the Valued Added Tax (VAT) last year. The government received only Rs.22 billion last year from VAT, he said.
The MP said in a desperate move the government released dollars from its reserves to stabilize the exchange rate but it would result in further economic issues.
Last year, the government sold more than US$3.2 billion in the open market. From October this year up to now, US$164 million has been sold. This will lead to a crisis in the balance of payment, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Republican's candidate Donald Trump leads the US presidential election after securing 264 electoral against 215 electoral won by Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Trumps Republic party has already taken control of the US House of representatives with 227 seats. In the US senate, the Republicans are leading with 49 votes against 47 votes of Democrats.
According to BBC, Trump has won Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Carolina, while Clinton took Virginia and Nevada. New Hampshire, Michigan and Wisconsin, considered as Clinton stronghold, are deadlocked, too.
Trump's Ohio win was a big boost to him, as no Republican has ever taken the White House without winning the Midwestern bellwether. Iowa last voted for a Republican in 2004.
Clinton supporters were seen crying and staring stony-faced at the big screens showing election results.
Foreign media further said two top Democrats in Wisconsin had told they have scoured precincts across the state "and see nothing to turn this around."
At this hour, we know very little about what Clinton herself is doing. She is with her husband and daughter, one aide said, and only a handful of aides in another room. She's been watching the returns and top aides have briefed her on the uphill climb across the Rust Belt. She's also been preparing her speech -- and one aide says there seems little reason she wouldn't give it tonight, but nothing will happen until the path is "completely closed, they said.
"There will be plenty of time for finger pointing, but none tonight," a senior Democrat close to the campaign said.
Meanwhile, the New York Times said the reaction to the prospect of a Trump presidency rippled across the globe, with financial markets abroad falling as American television networks raised the prospect that Clinton might lose.
Asian markets were trading sharply lower, down around two percentage points. Meanwhile, the US dollar and Mexican peso had plummeted.

Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton by 40 Electoral College votes, according to media reports, with the Republicans retaining control of the US House of Representatives.
There are 538 Electoral College votes allotted to the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It takes 270 votes to win.
Twenty-seven states have been called so far. Mrs Clinton has won 11 states to Mr Trump's 16.
Both candidates scored early victories in states where they were expected to win.
Those victories were long predicted and not especially significant in the national race, which is likely to turn on a half-dozen toss-up states that will be crucial in the state-by-state fight for 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.

After more than a year of hard fought battles, overturning every liberal media and analyst's prediction, Donald Trump proved to be the winner with 59,182,321 votes, amounting to 47.5% of the total votes cast. His opponent, who was tipped to be the first female President of the United States, polled 59,353, 098 votes or 47.7% of the votes cast.
He spoke to real people, the people who were never spoken to before and who didnt have a chance with this elitist system, Ronald Walker 33, a Trump supporter living in the Upper East Side in New York, told Daily Mirror.
At the time of writing, Donald Trump had won 279 Electoral College votes, which is over and above the required 270, while his rival -- the former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton -- had won just 218.
Clinton, was slightly ahead in the overall popular vote count, but the Electoral College system had all but sealed Trumps victory, early Wednesday morning.
The Trump movement saw masses of lower middle class or poor people rallying around the call to topple the existing status quo. Donald Trump, the President elect, in his rhetoric highlighted how the corrupt, system of a powerful few had alienated the average American, a message which continuously resonated with the populace. The popular message of the movement, was that the system in place had not delivered, and that the time was ripe for an overthrow.
The manner in which the Electoral College system of the United States (which comprises 538 votes) works, gave a clear indication of the upset victory early on. 435 of the Electoral College votes are cast by the states and their population, 100 votes are allocated to senators and 3 to the District of Columbia.
The popular vote which is the vote cast by the citizen in each state is counted, and the winner of each state is accordingly assigned the number of Electoral College votes he/she receives. Following the declaration of the popular vote. Accordingly the winner of a state such as Texas or California by popular vote would be apportioned the Electoral College votes allocated for the state. California has 55 apportioned and Texas the second largest has 38.
Both candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were a 30-minute walking distance away from each other, having cast their votes in New York- the home state of both.
Clinton supporters were gathered at the Jatvis Center between 34th and 40th Street on 11th Avenue, from 3pm until John Pedosta the campaign Chairman spoke to her supporters at around 1.30 am. He told the supporters, who were by then aware of the imminent defeat, Go home, she will have more to say tomorrow.
50 minutes to an hour later, all television news stations, who played a pivotal part in the forecast and reporting of the election, said that Hillary Clinton had made a phone call to Donald Trump and conceded defeat. The same was confirmed by the President elect during his victory speech.
The 70 year old businessman, the oldest to win a first term in the history of the United States, acknowledged the phone call when he spoke to jubilant fans at the Hilton at around 2.50 am.
Reading from the teleprompters before him the new President elect commended his opponent for a very hard fought campaign.
We owe a very major debt of gratitude to her (Clinton) for her service to our country, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people," he said.
In what could be termed a gracious and conciliatory speech, given the bitter campaign that many assume had divided the country, Trump attempted to make amends.
Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people, he said.
Clinton, who was scheduled to speak on Wednesday, at 10.30 am Eastern Standard Time, was yet to make her concession speech, at the time of writing.
Voting began early Tuesday morning with much enthusiasm across the country. Clinton and Trump both voted in New York, after which they both retired to their respective hotels in Manhattan.
Despite the surge in Hispanic voters and record turnouts in some states, states which Clinton supporters, pollsters, academics and political pundits repeatedly believed were safe states, the night was long and drawn out for her campaign.
The first result, at around 7.10 pm, was a victory for Trump. From then on, the movement, largely ignored by the progressives and the liberals, gained momentum, with Ohio, Florida and North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all falling to Trump. The Clinton supporters had hope, up until around 11.00 pm, when North Carolina and Ohio were called, after which, many of them who were anti-Trump voters rather than pro Clinton voters, admitted, its over.
Voters who had previously heralded the First Black President of the country, Barack Obama, had rejected Hillary Clinton and significantly voted for Donald Trump whose rhetoric had posited the exact opposite. Glaringly, Trunbull, in Ohio went to the Republican by a 6 point margin, despite giving Obama a 22 point victory in 2012.
Daily Mirror, yesterday, predicted that the polls and opinions may be proved wrong, given the nature of the campaign and the widespread cohesion of the movement, which many in liberal and academic circles failed to acknowledge until late last night.
All networks displayed shock and awe when the results started to flow in, with Wolf Blitzer on CNN among all anchors on the major Networks admitting that they had read the election wrong.
This was not expected, and we had even gone into the appointments of the President elect. This map was not supposed to look this way, the NBC news election coverage anchor said.
However, despite the constant fear-mongering, Trump's victory speech may have resulted in sighs of relief across the globe.
In his speech that lasted close upon 12 minutes, Trump said, All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict..
New York, considered the most progressive state in the country, was in no mood for partying. Since the election results started coming in, the atmosphere was sober and sullen. Despite it being the home of the two candidates, there were no street parties nor traffic around the city. The subways remained empty, symbolizing, if nothing else, that America had realised that its estimation of the dejection and disappointment of the populace at the status quo, was in fact all wrong.

Will become friends with countries willing to get along: Trump
	
Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the United States, in his victory speech assured that the US would get along with all other nations which are willing to get along with the US.
We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach, he told the supporters thronged at the Trump Headquarters in New York.
The full statement delivered by Donald Trump
Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business, complicated. Thank you very much.
I've just received a call from secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. Its about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.
I mean she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.
I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.
It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.
It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.
Working together we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.
That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.
The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors.
Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen. We have a great economic plan.We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.
I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone.
All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.
First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I are truly great parents.

[Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the united States, Donald Trump! Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.]
Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.
The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell ya. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.
And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes under appreciated unfortunately, we we appreciate them. So it's been what they call an historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you you will say that  you will say that that was something that you were  really were very proud to do and I can  thank you very much.
And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.
It's an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period and I love this country. Thank you.

Yahapalanaya What nonsense; still a Banana republic
	

The Ocean University here had recently received a good number of scholarships for its students to pursue their studies in recognized universities in the world.

The political authority in charge of the subject had distributed these scholarships in a manner typical of a corrupt politician in a Banana republic like ours.
The political authority had offered one scholarship to his own son and a few to some white collar bigwigs at secretarial level. After distributing the scholarships in this arbitrary manner, he had told the official handling the subject: Include my name too in the list. Because I wish to participate in the study tour which is a component of the scholarship.
This scholarship distribution affair had leaked out to the media following a hard-hitting letter sent to the political authority by his team member at state level questioning the propriety of selecting political henchmen for scholarships which are really meant for deserving students.
