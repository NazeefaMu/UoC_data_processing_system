The injured were part of a group consuming liquor inside a van parked outside the Magistrate’s Court.
Police said the group had become boisterous soon after and obstructed police officers from carrying out their duty.

When the group was ordered to vacate the premises, the driver of the van had tried to run over a police officer.

The officer in turn had opened fire at the vehicle, injuring a 26 year old youth in the van while the other individual was injured in a scuffle with the police.

The injured were admitted to the Trincomalee Hospital and the driver of the van was arrested by the Trincomalee Harbour Police.

Police said the group was from Kalawanchikudy. Further investigations are being conducted by the Trincomalee Harbour Police. (Amadoru Amarajeewa)
