Constitutional Assembly unlawful: Wijeyadasa


	

UNP MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who was removed from his Cabinet post a few months ago, broke his silence and said the Constitutional Assembly was totally unlawful.

In a lengthy statement, he said the present Constitution had not set out a procedure for the establishment of a Constitutional Assembly, and therefore it was virtually rendered null and void.

He said people, in voting for MPs, expected them to be knowledgeable in law making. The MP said former president late J.R. Jayewardene did not consult foreign experts paying them handsomely on constitution making.

He said it was tragic if such experts were paid colossal amounts of money and the MPs should be ashamed of it.
