“I accepted a Deputyship because I am now placed in a situation which I cannot help. However, Sir, I am prepared to throw in my lot with you at any time.”
A deputy purohita of yahapalanaya had given the above assurance to a former political leader over the phone.
Onetime powerful political leader revealed this while chit-chatting with a group of guests at the wedding of a son of a prominent gem merchant held at a high-end hotel in the city. 
“I took people like you into my confidence and I am in this mess today as the result,” had been his curt rejoinder to the deputy, he had told the fellow guests.
Referring to another politico hailing from same the area who had been a well-known rival of the deputy who phoned him up, the former political leader had said: “I don’t know whether he is still with me. But I think those in the gem business should stand by him.”
