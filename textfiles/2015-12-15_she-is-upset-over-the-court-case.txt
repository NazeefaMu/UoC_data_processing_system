“She is upset over the court case…”


	


The former strongman hosted all Diyawanna members, who did not vote for the 2016 Budget at its second reading, to a grand dinner in the city.
There were a few absentees at the dinner. Some of them happened to be away from the island. Most of these absentees had expressed regrets about their inability to attend.
Meanwhile, a fair member from the South who had made herself scarce at the vote taking, had failed to turn up for the dinner too. She had not expressed her regrets to the host either.
Her absence was a topic for discussion among some members at the dinner. “There is a reason for her absence,” a member had said. “She is upset over the court case. Some opposition heavyweights had promised to sort out the problem for her, but so far nothing concrete has been done in this regard.” Later some attendees had asked the former strongman not to take the fair member’s absence at the dinner seriously given her present frame of mind.
