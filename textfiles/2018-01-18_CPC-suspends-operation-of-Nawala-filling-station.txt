Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) sealed all the fuel dispensing pumps of the Nawala filling station last night for illegally loading of Kerosene to bowsers with the use of fuel station pump for commercial purposes, Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development said.

While issuing a statement they said it is illegal to load Kerosene to bowsers using fuel dispensing pump. This illegal operation was detected by the CPC Special Raids Division on Wednesday.

Filling stations were only permitted to fill up fuel to vehicles but not to refill bowsers or any other vehicle for commercial purposes.

Accordingly, the Nawala filling stations’ business activities have been suspended until investigations are over.

Meanwhile, CPC Chairman Dammika Ranatunga said that measures have been taken to prosecute the racketeers. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
