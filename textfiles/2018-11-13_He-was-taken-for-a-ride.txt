He was taken for a ride!


	

A politico from Wayamba has become a laughing stock after falling victim to a prank played on him by a colleague of his. This had happened when the political horse-trading was gathering its momentum.

 


On receiving urgent summons over the phone purportedly from a mansion of a very high authority in the city, the politico rushed there at the appointed time brimming with hope.


However, to his dismay, he found the high authority had gone out and on further inquiry that no such call had originated from that place.


Realizing that someone had made a joke at his expense, the politico had returned home sadder, but wiser.


Now he has stopped answering telephone calls, they say.
