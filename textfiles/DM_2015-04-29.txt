A dinner hosted in honour of new signatories
	
	The news that the Bribery and Corruption authorities served notice on the former strongman to appear before the Commission triggered an uproar among the opposition Diyawanna members.
Highly concerned over growing protests and the raging controversy over this unexpected move by the Bribery and Corruption Commission authorities, the New Big Boss met the Blue members at the Diyawanna House in a bid to defuse the tensions running high.
At this meeting with the Blue Diyawanna members, the New Big Boss revealed that he was not in the know of the move to serve summons on the former Big Boss.
Certain Blue seniors who accepted portfolios under the Maithri rule, construed the remark made by the New Big Boss as being sympathetic to the former Boss and decided to sign the petition expressing solidarity with the latter which was being circulated among the opposition members.
The prime movers of the petition considered the Blue seniors holding office in the new government signing the petition as a matter for celebration. Later a Deputy one from the South hosted the new signatories to the petition from the government ranks to a sumptuous dinner at his residence located close to the Diyawanna House.
Now we have done our duty by the former Boss, One of the new signatories exulted at the dinner and his colleagues readily agreed, our sources said.

A snap election No takers!
	
	
	A meeting of the government group of the Diyawanna House was held last Sunday with the New Big Boss in the chair.
Discussions at this meeting mainly centered on the proposed 19th Amendment and the impending dissolution of the Diyawanna council.
The meeting turned stormy when certain Blue Ministerial ones charged that the Greens were bent on basking in others glory.
When divergent views over the dissolution of the Diyawanna council were being expressed by the members, the New Big Boss intervened to assert his own stand on the issue. He said: I am not prepared to dissolve it to please any particular section. As it is quite obvious now that we cannot move ahead as a government, there is no alternative, but to dissolve it. I request those in favour of an immediate dissolution to raise their hands. 
But no hand in favour of an immediate dissolution was raised.
This means that none of you is keen on going in for a snap general election, said the New Big Boss. OK. Now let us have our lunch, he added.

AIA delivers strong 1Q 2015 results
	
AIA Group Limited announced an excellent start to 2015 with 20 percent growth in value of new business (VONB) for the first quarter ended February 28, 2015. 
AIA Group Chief Executive and President Mark Tucker said, AIA has once again maintained the strong growth momentum established in previous years by delivering 20 percent increase in value of new business in the first quarter (24 percent on constant exchange rates).
2015 is our fifth year since IPO and our strong start to the year reflects the ongoing quality of our operating performance and the consistent execution of our growth strategy, which has enabled us to deliver a record first quarter VONB of US $ 425 million.
Asias positive economic outlook and significant growth opportunities in the life insurance market remain highly attractive for AIA against a backdrop of continuing global macro uncertainty. We are exceptionally well-placed to capitalise on the long-term structural growth trends and the low levels of both social welfare and private insurance cover across the markets of the Asia-Pacific region.
We remain committed to our strategy of driving sustainable and high-quality growth by continuously improving the productivity and effectiveness of our extensive agency and partnership distribution networks, launching innovative products that meet customers protection and long-term savings needs and by leveraging our brand strength across the region.
We are confident that our scale, distribution reach and financial strength will enable us to continue to provide attractive and competitive returns for our customers and to generate sustainable increases in value for our shareholders.
VONB increased by 20 percent based on actual exchange rates compared with the first quarter of 2014 to US $ 425 million. Underlying VONB growth was 24 percent on constant exchange rates. 
Highlights for the quarter included excellent VONB growth in Hong Kong and China through the consistent execution of its Premier Agency strategy. Agency productivity improved further alongside a strong increase in the number of active agents supported by its focus on quality recruitment.
In Thailand and Malaysia, VONB growth was largely driven by further margin expansion continuing the positive trend from the previous year. In Singapore, growth was more muted following the completion of the HealthShield upgrade in the first quarter of 2014 that boosted sales of protection products in the prior year, as previously highlighted.
Korea reported lower VONB compared with the first quarter of 2014 as market conditions remain challenging. Other markets delivered excellent VONB growth, in particular Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, with strong performances in both agency and partnership distribution channels.
VONB margin increased by 3.0 pps to 46.8 percent from 43.8 percent in the first quarter of 2014 with the increase mainly from a positive shift in geographical mix. Economic assumptions remain unchanged for the quarter from those shown in its annual report 2014.
ANP grew by 15 percent on constant exchange rates compared with the first quarter of 2014 to US $ 895 million (12 percent on actual exchange rates). TWPI increased by 11 percent on constant exchange rates (8 percent on actual exchange rates). 
The long-term economic outlook for Asia ex-Japan remains positive, with a gradual and ongoing rebalancing in favour of domestic consumption in Asias emerging markets. Central banks have considerable latitude to adjust monetary policy and recent rate cuts in China are supportive of gradual rebalancing and stable growth.
While Asia is not isolated from near-term economic factors outside the region such as shifts in the monetary policies in the U.S. and Europe, threats to geopolitical stability and a more demanding regulatory environment, the Asian markets in which the company operates are well-positioned to withstand these challenges.
The life insurance industry continues to benefit from the significant long-term economic and structural demographic drivers of growth across Asia ex-Japan. The company remains confident that AIAs leading businesses across these markets place it in an advantaged position to capture the ongoing growth opportunities that the Asian life insurance market offers.

Fmr PM Manmohan Singh's travels cost Rs 6,76,74,33,477
	
	Rs 6,76,74,33,477 (Rs 676.7 crore) was the cost what the nation incurred during the 73 foreign trips that Dr Manmohan Singh made as Prime Minister.
	The figure which was provided by the Indian Prime Minister's Officer following an RTI query filed by Ramesh Chand Joshi, president of the Rashtra Rakshak Janmanch.
	The reply from the PMO which reveals the details of the foreign visits made by Dr Singh during his tenure as Prime Minister also reveals that during his second term, 15 out of the 36 trips were made when Parliament was in session.
	The RTI query which was filed got a response from the PMO. It was stated that in total an amount of Rs 6,76,74,33,477 was incurred when Dr Singh travelled abroad. He undertook a total of 73 foreign trips between 22 May 2004 and 17 May 2014.
	During his second term that is under UPA-II, 15 out of the 36 trips abroad were made when the Parliament was in session. It may be recalled that the opposition at that time had mocked Dr Singh by referring to him as a non-resident Prime Minister.
	It also can be noted that the BJP had pointed out that none of the earlier PM's had broken the tradition and travelled abroad when Parliament was in session. While 65 of the trips have been billed, there are 8 more trips which are under process.
	The billed foreign trips had amounted to an approximate of Rs 670 crore, the response from the PMO states. The details of the trips are given in the fact sheet.
	Dr Singh made as many as six trips to the United States of America during his ten year tenure. The US remained the most important destination for Dr Singh and one may recollect that the Indo-US nuclear deal was also struck during his tenure.
	Interestingly the visits to the neighbouring nations has been extremely less when compared to the other nations. Many could argue that the visits to Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and Sri Lanka could have been higher considering the amount of engagement that there is with India on a daily basis along the borders.
	The highest expenditure that was incurred was Rs.26.94 crore during the 7 day visit to Mexico and Brazil in 2012. The second highest was a bill of Rs 22.7 crore incurred during the visit to USA and Brazil in 2010.
	There is data also available on the foreign trips made by former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He made 35 foreign trips between 1999 and 2004 and it cost the exchequer Rs 185 crore.(One India)

India requests SL Navy not to fire on Indian fishermen
	
Indian Government on today said it has requested Sri Lankan Navy to act with restraint and not to fire on Indian fishermen if they stray into the waters of the island nation.
Replying to a question, Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh said there have been six cases of alleged attack on Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters and India have taken up the issue with Sri Lanka."Keeping in mind the humanitarian and livelihood dimensions of the issue, Government has impressed on the Sri Lankan Navy to act with restraint, not to fire on our fishermen and treat our fishermen in a humane manner," he said.
He said a total of 964 Indian fishermen had been apprehended by the Sri Lankan authorities since January last year, of which 927 were released. "Government was steadfastly working, in close cooperation, with the relevant stakeholders for the expeditious release of thirty seven Indian fishermen from Sri Lankan custody," Singh said. Singh said a total of 303 fishermen, believed to be Indian nationals, are languishing in Pakistani jails.
"Of these, 126 fishermen have been confirmed as Indian and nationality confirmation of the remaining 177 fishermen is under process. Since January 2014, the number of Indian fishermen released by Pakistan is 357," he said.

Lankan origin Australian executed in Indonesia
	
	Myuran Sukumaran, the British-born Australian national, originally from Sri-Lanka, one of the ringleaders of the infamous Bali Nine, was executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan Island in Java, Indonesia, on yesterday.
	He was executed at approximately 6.25pm (UK time) with seven others of the drug ring. Mary Jane Veloso from the Philippines was spared at the last minute.
	The Bali Nine were a group of nine Australians, who made headlines in 2005 for planning to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin valued at US$3.1 million (2 million) from Indonesia to Australia.
	Sukumaran and three others were arrested at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta, where police found 334g of heroin hidden in a suitcase in his room.
	According the testimonies given in court by convicted drug mules, Sukumaran and his fellow school friend, Andrew Chan, were the leaders of the drug smuggling operation.
	He had been on the death row since February 2006, after Depasar District Court sentenced him to execution by firing squad for his role in a drug-smuggling plot.
	Sukumarans close family met him for the last time before his execution.
	His brother, Chintu, said: We spent the last few hours with my brother. We didnt have much time. There were so many things to talk about.
	He added: We did talk about the death penalty and he knows this is just a waste. Its not going to solve anything with drugs.
	Tomorrow, next week, next month, its still not going to stop anything with drugs. If these nine people die today, its still not going to stop anything.
	His mother, Raji, bid a tearful goodbye to her son: I just had to say goodbye to my son and I wont see him again.
	She was joined by Sukumarans sister, Brintha, in their plea to the Indonesian President Joko Widodo to call off the executions.
	Brintha said: Please do not do this to my brother. Please dont take my brother from me.
	Just hours before the execution, the Australian and French governments also voiced their support for the familys appeal to President Widodo.
	Their joint statement with the European Union read: We fully respect the sovereignty of Indonesia. But we are against the death penalty in our country and abroad.
	In his hometown of Sydney, a crowd of 300 gathered for a candlelit vigil. Blues Point Reserve in North Sydney became the site of a monument of 15,000 flowers, donated by Amnesty International supporters and spelt out Keep Hope Alive.
	Diana Sayed, a human rights lawyer and crisis campaigner for Amnesty, said: Im sure theyre going to be seeing this, their families are going to see this and itll help whatever they are going through right now.
	Bali Nine Ringleader Myuran Sukumaran executedPrior to his incarceration, Sukumaran was known as a ruthless enforcer of the heroin-trafficking gang, with expertise in martial arts.
	But since serving his sentence in Balis Kerobokan Prison, he had undergone major transformation.
	Sukumaran taught classes to fellow prisoners in a variety of subjects, including English, graphic design, philosophy and computing.
	Sukumaran also campaigned to open a computing and art room in the prison, though he was not successful in setting up an accountancy and law course.
	His good behaviour led to his appointment as the head of a group of 20 prisoners. He managed and mentored his group, in addition to overseeing modest penalties for those who did not complete their duties.
	Bali Nine Ringleader Myuran Sukumaran executedSukumaran gained widespread notoriety for setting up a clothing brand called Kingpin Clothing and creating paintings in prison, many of which he sold.
	Curtin University of Perth awarded him with an Associate Degree in Fine Arts in February 2015.
	After being transferred to Nusakambangan Island to await his execution, he painted many self-portraits, described as more dark and disturbing in nature.
	Sukumarans cousin, Niranjela Karunatilake, who is based in London, organised an exhibition of his paintings at Amnesty Internationals headquarters in Shoreditch.
	Karunatilake said: The death penalty is never the answer and I dont believe it deters crime, but in Myus case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short.
	The death of Sukumaran and seven other prisoners will undoubtedly reignite discussions about the fairness of the death penalty.
	Even in Western societies such as the UK and Australia, there is support among the general public for it to be reinstated.
	However, if rehabilitation is supposed to be the purpose of prison, is the death sentence the best course of action(desiblitz)

My intl achievements ignored: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today that during his tenure as Health Minister, he received two awards -- one from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the other from the University of Harvard  but they were not acknowledged by the previous regime.
About a month ago, the Excise Department of Excise sent me a report stating that 326 outlets selling tobacco and alcohol without confirming to the necessary guidelines. I submitted a motion recommending that these outlets be closed. In the wake of my recommendation, the Treasury informed me of the difficulty to meet budgetary targets if these outlets were closed down. As far as I can remember, the Treasury earns more than Rs.60 billion as revenue from the sale tobacco and another Rs.55 billion from the sale of alcohol. So this is the current situation, the President said.
He made these observations at the inauguration of the National Summit on Tobacco titled, Towards a Tobacco-Free Sri Lanka. It was organised by NATA and WHO with the assistance of the Health Ministry and ADIC. Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala De Silva were also present at the ceremony.
The President said that though he had done his best to maximize the control of tobacco and alcohol use during the past five years, he had received little or no support from the leaders of the previous regime.
We need to make schoolchildren and the people aware of the dangers of tobacco and alcohol use so that they could be rescued from the clutches of these vices, he said. (Kamanthi Wickramasinghe)

Peacock mansion no longer on offer
	
	Now the entire country knows that this ASP is not a Policeman, but a businessman who offered his posh mansion to the former strongman as a gift.
Much water flowed under the bridge since ASP made this offer in public and now in a U turn, the businessman has decided not to donate his mansion. By the way, the former strongman never said in public that he was going to accept this gift. A latest report says that the ASP changed his mind about gifting his mansion on astrological advice.
The businessman preparatory to donating the mansion had on astrological advice got the swimming pool filled with sand and the positions of some doors and windows altered to dispel `Vastu-dosha or the blemishes indicated by the ancient science of Vastu-vidya.

Recalling unhappy days
	
	A group of Blue members including the Secretarial One and Gentle John the other day held a postmortem on the previous regime.
They were all highly critical about the way affairs were run at that time. As the intimacy grew, they began swapping their confidences.
I am ashamed to say this, said the Secretarial One. I was just a nonentity in my Ministry. The siblings and the offspring were running the show. I only had to sign the papers presented to me. I had no power even to appoint a peon of my choice.
I too had been receiving the same type of shabby treatment, Gentle John recalled. I was pulled up once for not standing up to greet the brat when he turned up at a public rally in Ratnapura.
But many people  villagers in particular talk highly about the former Boss. So we have to tread carefully, a Blue senior pointed out.

Take on the one at the top!
	
	The opposition group that staged a night out in the Diyawanna House held a series of discussions by way of follow-up action.
Most vociferous at these talks was Rattaran from the district immediately South of Colombo. Now that we are armed with 113 signatures and matters have come to a head, we should lose no time in dealing a decisive blow, Rattaran exhorted his colleagues.
I think the time is ripe for presenting a motion of No-Confidence, said a former Ministerial One from Kandy area now facing corruption charges.
We should not stop at moving a No-Confidence motion. We must proceed to impeach the one occupying the Main Chair as well, said a former Ministerial One from the Colombo district. 
What is going to become of our No-Confidence against the current Finance One the one who handled Education under the previous dispensation queried.
Rattaran spoke up again: Let us drop that motion. Time has come for us to hit at those at the top, The others agreed.
They later contacted over the mobile a former Ministerial One who once held professorial status in law and asked him to use his legal knowledge to document an air-tight impeachment motion against the occupant of the Main Chair. Happy that he has been taken notice of after a long time, the professor is reportedly busy at home these days beating the impeachment into shape.
However, developments playing out since then indicate that the good efforts of the professor are likely to go down the drain, they say.

They all act on advice of star-gazers!
	
	
	As crisis after crisis hits the minority national unity government in power, the leaders of the main political parties have begun turning to astrologers for advice.
Astrologers have reportedly told the Green party leaders that the results of a general election held before July 17 would be in their favour.
The former strongmans caucus wants a general election before September. They are also guided by the advice of the astrologers.
The former strongman had told in the wake of his defeat that he no longer believed in Astrology. But according our information, he has got down a group of astrologers even from India for consultation in the critical days ahead. Meanwhile, Blue party high ups are playing all the tricks in their bag in a dogged determination to get the general elections postponed for another 7 to 8 months. They too are acting on the advice of their astrologers, they say.

They fear their whipping boy will come clean!
	
	The return of the once powerful sibling who helmed the economic affairs has reportedly sent the former Ministerial Ones into a flutter.
According to reports, the former strongmans cabal was more upset over this event than others. Having learnt that moves were underway to accord a heros welcome to the sibling, they decided to use a ploy to prevent the Blue crowds from Gampaha attending the KIA. And they hurriedly organized a Blue party confab and a grand luncheon for Blue activists in Gampaha to coincide with the much publicized arrival of the sibling. Even the former strongman was invited to this event in Gampaha.
They succeeded in taking the shine off the welcome to the sibling organized by his supporters. There were only two Diyawanna members at the KIA to receive the virtual second-in-command of the previous regime. And the crowd was not as large as expected.
The cabal played the spoilsport with a view to sending an important signal to the once powerful sibling, they say. These guys had found a convenient whipping boy in the sibling. They want to blame the sibling for all the sins of the previous regime. They fear that their plans will go haywire, if he succeeds in getting his name cleared by any chance, a Blue veteran said.

Time to begin work on 20A: JHU
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said today the JHUs mission to get the 19th Amendment approved in parliament was achieved and it would soon start the next mission to introduce the electoral reforms by way of the 20th Amendment.
He told a news conference that despite many allegations levelled against the JHU it did not give up its unwavering commitment resulted in the 19A being approved with the support of all parties in parliament.
When I spoke on the 19A, everybody pointed fingers at me. Some said I was trying to be President. All we wanted to do the best for the country, the minister said.
He said the time had come to implement the 19th Amendment which was passed by a two-thirds majority.
We tried to do this with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. We submitted our proposals to amend the Constitution. But, he rejected our proposals and called for snap elections. That was why we quit the the then Government, the minister said.
The JHU thanked President Maithripala Sirisena whom they said was the only president who kept his promise to remove the arbitrary powers vested in the executive presidency though many former presidents mentioned it in their election manifestoes but were not strong enough to fulfil their promises.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the country was on a better footing and requested all the political parties to join together with the President to support him.
He said the arguments for and against the amendment in Parliament must stop now and the parliamentarians must pay attention to other burning problems in the country. (Piyumi Fonseka)
