HINDUSTAN TIMES, 12th JULY, 2017- Four Boko Haram suicide bombers killed 19 people in a series of attacks that targeted a civilian self-defence force and the people who gathered to mourn their deaths, police in northeastern Nigeria said Wednesday.


Borno state police commissioner Damian Chukwu said 23 others were wounded in Tuesday night’s attacks in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram’s eight-year insurgency. The police commissioner said 12 of the dead were members of a civilian self-defence force and the other seven people were killed when they gathered to mourn them.
