A debate on the current political situation would be held from 4 pm to 7 pm in Parliament today, following a request made by Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane.

In the morning, the Parliament session was suspended for 10 minutes when Speaker Jayasuriya responded to MP Gunawardane’s request saying that there was no proposal in the Parliament agenda to hold a debate.

However, during the adjournment, the Party leaders met and decided to hold a debate this evening. (Yohan Perera & Ajith Siriwardane)
