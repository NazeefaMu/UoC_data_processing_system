Cabinet paper would be brought in soon to ban tuition classes during school hours, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.

He told Parliament that tuition classes would be banned from 7.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. on weekdays.

Minister Kariyawasam said schools had been provided with sufficient teachers and Principals and added that more teachers would be recruited this year to fill vacancies left.

"We thought tuition classes emerged due to the lack of teachers. But it is not so. They have become a fashion today," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
