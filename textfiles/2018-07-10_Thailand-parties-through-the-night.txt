Thailand parties through the night!


	



Thailand has erupted in celebration following the news that all 12 youth football players and their coach trapped in a flooded cave for more than two weeks have been rescued - in an astonishing against-the-odds mission that captivated the world.

Authorities had been mulling ideas such as drilling holes into the mountain or waiting months until monsoon rains ended and they could walk out, with the rescue chief at one point dubbing the efforts to save them 'Mission Impossible'.  

In the end, a team of specialist divers, lead by British experts and Thai Navy SEALs, entered the cave and 'effectively pulled' the boys through several miles of waterfilled tunnels one by one - despite many of them not even knowing how to swim.

The final four school boys and their coach, who had been trapped in darkness in Tham Luang Cave complex for 18 days, were today carried out on stretchers as the three-day operation came to an end.

Residents in Chiang Rai, the city closest to the caves, took to the streets to celebrate, with drivers honking car horns and pedestrians dancing outside the hospital where the Wild Boar FC players are now recovering. (Daily Mail)
