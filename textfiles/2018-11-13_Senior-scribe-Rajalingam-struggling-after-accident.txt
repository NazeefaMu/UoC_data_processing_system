Senior scribe Rajalingam struggling after accident


	

Around mid-day on September 9 (2018), whilst returning from the library, cautious and lawful though he was, a motorcycle, approaching at high speed, drove straight into Rasiah Rajalingam knocking him down on the road, and gasp....all this happened on the zebra crossing at the Hendala Junction. Rajalingam, recalling the incident while talking to the Daily Mirror said that he was barely conscious minutes after being knocked down.   


With decades of invaluable service at Virakesari, M.D Gunesena, Lakehouse and Wijeya Newspapers under his belt, Rajalingam had eased into a freelance lifestyle which had been just sufficient to support his family. As both a father, husband and grandfather he was still an essential source of finance to his family, making the consequences of the accident a blow to both himself and his dependants.   

Rajalingam found the roles reversed as he sat down to recount the scarring experience with this writer.

Following the unfortunate accident, Rajalingam, now enduring restricted movement and a broken arm, finds himself at a great disadvantage. He ruefully described his complete dependency on his wife, who despite her own frailties, dedicates herself to feeding, bathing and dressing him.   


Forced into this static period of recovery, he flips through a faded scrapbook thick with nostalgia and pride. Clippings of news articles he had written over the years fills up its pages. Not only are they all diverse in their coverage, but also displays his tri-lingual contributions to the field.   


Residing in his humble abode in the inner reaches of Hunupitiya, Wattala, Rajalingam addressed the road accident as an undeserved serving of repercussions to himself and his family despite being a law abiding pedestrian. In his partially immobilised state, he finds his source of income cut off, but new expenses flooding in. Frequent trips to the hospital and the courthouse have become a weighted burden to the simple family of Rajalingam.

While he feels strongly about wrongs being righted, his immediate concerns lie in carrying his family forward. Refusing to let physical disability hold him back and responding to a passion for journalism, he is making his left arm his tool of independence. However, with months of slow recovery ahead he is open to kindness and empathy of any form.   


He may be reached on 0778900871, for friends, philanthropists to be of any assistance during this difficult time.
