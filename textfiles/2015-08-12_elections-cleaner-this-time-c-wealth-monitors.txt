	There had been fewer violations of electoral laws so far and the poll seems to be cleaner than the Presidential Election, the Commonwealth Election Observers said today.
	The Chairman of the Observer Group, Former President of Malta Dr. George Abela told a media briefing that that observers were here in January during the Presidential Election and that they could see that the general elections seem to be cleaner than the Presidential Election.
	“Our objective judgment is that Sri Lanka is well placed to hold a democratic election that enjoys confidence of the people but one has to wait till the electoral process is over to make a final judgment,” he said.
	Dr. Abela said the 19th Amendment had strengthened the Commissioner of Elections but Sri Lanka should decide whether to stop here or whether more powers were to be given to the Polls Chief and to introduce more regulations. (Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
