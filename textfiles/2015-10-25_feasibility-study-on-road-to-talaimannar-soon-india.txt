The Indian government will soon carry out a feasibility study on establishing a road link between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Talaimannar in Sri Lanka, said Union Minister of State for Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon. Radhakrishnan said.
“India is keen on implementing the project. It needs the consent of both countries. The project needs to be discussed at various levels,” he told reporters here on Saturday.
Stating that the Centre had begun consultations to carry out a feasibility study on various aspects, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the sea bridge was aimed at ensuring seamless traffic between the two nations.
To a question, he said the Centre had studied different alignments to implement the Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project (SSCP). It would be implemented by adopting a new alignment without affecting the sentiments of the people and the ecology of Gulf of Mannar. The government would expedite the project once the Supreme Court disposed a case pending before it.
The BJP shared the sentiments of fishermen and the Centre had already initiated diplomatic talks with Sri Lanka to secure the release of the fishermen who were arrested recently.(The Hindu)
