Dilmah Conservation will initiate a series of workshops for the One Earth Nature Club members under the theme Youth in Responsible Conservation, to promote science-based, practical, neutral and conscious conservation practices amongst the next generation.


The workshops will facilitate the transfer of expertise and knowledge from experts to the youth with common environmental goals through a dynamic and 
collaborative dialogue.

The first in this series of workshops will be held on Sunday, September 30, 2018, from 9.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. at the Diyasaru wetland park.


Senior Lecturer in Ecology and Conservation Biology, Country Representative for the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation (ATBC) and Director of the Tropical Ecosystem Research Network (TERN), Dr Enoka Kudavidanage will lead the first workshop, engaging in an interactive discussion with the members of the One Earth Nature Club.

 

The workshops will facilitate the transfer of expertise and knowledge from experts to the youth with common environmental goals through a dynamic and collaborative dialogue

The workshop rises from a need to address the importance of responsible scientific endeavours to maintain the momentum in the conservation sector.
Dilmah Conservation hopes to arm the next generation of conservationists with the technical knowledge, experience and professional skills to face any hurdle that they may come across in their career.


In addition, the workshop will instil the power of neutrality among the youth and will motivate them to make decisions objectively.
This workshop will be open to members of Dilmah Conservation’s One Earth Nature Club.
