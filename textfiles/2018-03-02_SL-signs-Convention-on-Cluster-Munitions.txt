Sri Lanka deposited the Instrument of Accession to the Cluster Munitions Convention also known as the Oslo Convention on Thursday, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.

In a statement, it said the Convention is a humanitarian imperative-driven legal instrument which prohibits all use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions.

In a depository notification, the UN said the Convention will enter into force for Sri Lanka on September 1, 2018 in accordance with its article 17 (2).

“For any state that deposits its instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession after the date of the deposit of the thirtieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, this Convention shall enter into force on the first day of the sixth month after the date on which that state has deposited its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession,” the article 17 (2) of the Convention said.
