The Bodu Bala sena (BBS) Organisation today said that it would meet the Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya tomorrow to request on forming a new political party backed by the BBS.
BBS Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dilantha Vithanage said they had had several phone conversations with Mr. Deshapriya in this regard and would meet him today to make an official request on forming a political party.    
“BBS will back the new political party, but will continue to remain as an apolitical organisation. Buddhist monks will guide and provide instructions to the political party. However, the candidates will be laymen,” Vithanage said adding they had yet to decide on a name and a symbol for the party.
