The Attorney General’s Department has filed the proposed ‘final solution’ of the Government with regard to SAITM by a motion in the Supreme Court on Monday (13), contrary to the accusation of the GMOA, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said.

Responding to the accusations of the GMOA that the government had failed to convey its final decision on SAITM to the Courts, he said the Government had kept its word.

In a Facebook post, Dr. Harsha De Silva, who is also the Head of the Presidential Committee on SAITM said he was informed by AG Department that ASG Rajaratnam filed the proposed ‘final solution’ of the Government by motion in the Supreme Court yesterday.

“It is unfortunate that the GMOA has accused the Government of not informing Court of the same, as per a report filed in the Daily Mirror online website. My Committee and I are determined to have this matter resolved by December 31, 2017 as instructed by the President and the Prime Minister,” he said.
