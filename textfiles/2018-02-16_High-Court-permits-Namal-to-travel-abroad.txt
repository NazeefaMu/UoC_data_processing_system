High Court permits Namal to travel abroad


	

The High Court today permitted Namal Rajapaksa to travel abroad from February 20 to May 30.

He was previously not allowed to do so because of the magisterial inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of funds in the 'Krish' deal.

Permission was granted on the basis of a request he had made to attend the Commonwealth parliamentary conference and two youth conferences in Nepal and Russia.

The Fort Magistrate’s Court also permitted him to do so last Monday. (Yoshitha Perera)
