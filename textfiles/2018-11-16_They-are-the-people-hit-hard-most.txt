The Diyawanna politicos, who forfeited their right to a monthly pension due to the mid-term dissolution of the council are a very unhappy set these days, they say.

 


This group sympathizing with one another about their ill-luck is said to be sharing the opinion that they are the people most adversely affected by the dissolution.


However, a well-heeled politico from an area of an ancient kingdom fame had remarked:


“Machang, this monthly pension of Rs. 18,000 is a mere pittance for me… This money is hardly sufficient to keep me going even for one day when I am in Colombo!”
