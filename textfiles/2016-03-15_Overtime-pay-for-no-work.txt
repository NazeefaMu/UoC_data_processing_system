Overtime pay for no work


	

A fair and lovely unmarried clerk working in a state corporation coming under the purview of a ministry connected with marine resources has come in for an unexpected bonanza thanks to the affection of a high up close to the purohita. 

 


She has drawn overtime pay for purportedly working 116 extra-hours last August, 169 ½ in September and 174 in November. 


However, the employees maintain that she had performed no duty outside her working hours to earn any extra-pay.


Meanwhile, 14 female employees of the corporation have been seconded to the ministry violating the relevant Public Administration ministry circular instructions, they say.
