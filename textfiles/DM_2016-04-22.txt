BBS complaints to new IGP
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), backed by some other organisations, today handed over a letter to the newly appointed Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara to take legal action against Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for allegedly making statements igniting separatism.
Speaking to the media at the Police Headquarters after handing over the letter, Ven. Magalkande Sudaththa Thera of this collective of organisations, condemned a statement made by Mr. Vigneswaran asking for the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces which was against the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
The Thera, who is also the Convener of the Sinhala Ravaya, said the Opposition Leader Sampanthan should represent all the provinces of the country and he should not be limited to a certain province.
The present Opposition Leader only plays his role on the Northern and Eastern Provinces. He also tried to justify the LTTEs actions, the Thera charged.
Ven. Magalkande Sudaththa Thera said the BBS hoped that justice be meted out from the IGP and the Yahapalana government into this issue.
We have made sixteen complaints to the Police Headquarters before and no investigation has taken place. We hope IGP Jayasundara will take legal actions by probing this complaint as he is a talented and senior officer of the Police Department, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane and Chaturanga Pradeep)

Move to re-employ retired professionals: Defence Secy
	
The Defence Ministry has decided to re-employ technically and professionally experienced retired officers of the armed forces to address the severe shortage of officials in those categories in the government and semi-government sector, a senior official said yesterday.
Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi told the Daily Mirror that the programme was being implemented on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Cabinet approval had been granted recently for the programme.
A considerable number of officers in armed forces, who possess technical and professional qualifications and experience, retire from the service annually due to the completion of 22 years of service and with the completion of maximum period an officer can serve in a certain post. We have observed that many of these officers who engage in Engineering, Surveying, Medical service, Nursing, Supplementary and Interim Medical Services, Technology and Sports retire at the age of 42-45 years but are eligible to perform their duties with their good physical and mental conditions. As a solution to the lack of technically and professionally skilled persons in the government field the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch this project on the advice of President Sirisena, Mr. Hettiarachchi said.
He said a database of such retired officers would be maintained by the Ministry enabling to obtain their service as and when necessary to public institutions on contractual basis.
President Sirisena in his endeavor to increase productivity in the public and semi-government sector also expects to establish a database of bilingual and trilingual resource persons and to make those details open for all government and non-government institutions and for the public to obtain their service where necessary.

No noteworthy rise in water levels in reservoirs: MASL
	
There was no notable change in the water levels in the major reservoirs even though heavy showers were experienced in the catchment areas in the past couple of days, the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, MASL Water Management Secretariat Director Thilaka Samaratunga said the water had still not started filling into the reservoirs despite the heavy showers. Although no significant improvement was witnessed in the water levels of the reservoirs, this would have a bearing on the production of power as there are adequate water resources available, she said.
She said the only issue was in the Kotmale Reservoir as the water levels there were low in comparison to the other reservoirs. The water levels of the Kotmale Reservoir had only shown a one or two per cent rise even with the showers experienced in the area recently, she added. (Kalathama Jayawardhane)

Pop legend Prince dies at 57
	
American singer Prince, who defined the sound of the '80s with songs such as "Kiss" and "Purple Rain" and defied the music industry in a fight for creative freedom, has died on Thursday.
The 57-year-old singer was found unresponsive in an elevator at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, Minnesota, Carver County Sheriff Jim Olson said.
According to the CNN, paramedics had tried to perform CPR but were unable to revive him, the sheriff said. He was pronounced dead at 10:07 a.m., less than 30 minutes after sheriff's deputies responded to a medical call at the scene.
Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death, Olson said. An autopsy is scheduled to take place Friday.
Prince's publicist confirmed his death but didn't provide details about the possible cause or who was with the musician.
"It is with profound sadness that I am confirming that the legendary, iconic performer, Prince Rogers Nelson, has died at his Paisley Park residence this morning," publicist Yvette Noel-Schure said.
A man called 911 at 9:43 a.m. from Prince's estate, first reporting an unconscious person and then reporting a death, according to a transcript of the call released by authorities.
"The person is dead here. ... And the people are just distraught," the man said as he struggled to find an address to give the dispatcher.
The person who died, deputies soon discovered, was Prince. Authorities haven't identified who made the call to 911 or details about the circumstances surrounding the call.

Union Assurance declares 9.5% dividend on Life Advantage Plan
	
Union Assurance declared a 9.5 percent dividend rate on their Life Advantage Plan for 2015.
This is a significantly higher rate than the minimum guaranteed rate of 8 percent for 2015, a rate that is still higher than the average market interest for 2015, which stood at 5.99 percent. The years bonus payout is consistent with the Companys practice of providing policyholders with a significantly higher return than promised. This is the third year running that Union Assurance presented its policy holders with a higher than expected dividend rate.
Policyholders of Union Life Advantage policies were able to enjoy this rate of dividend, which is based on the investment earnings on the life fund attributable to the dividend-based products of the company. The investment account maintained for each individual dividend based policyholder is credited with the dividend on monthly compounding basis.
The Companys With Profit policyholders who were in force as at 31st December 2015 will receive an annual bonus for 2015, which will be added to their policy. The company has been able to pay higher benefits to its valued policyholders due to its continued growth in 2015 by earning over Rs. 6.9Bn in gross written premiums.
General Manager, Life Operations, Iroshini Tittagalla, commenting on the achievement said, The Companys performance in 2015 continued in the upward trajectory and it has considerably strengthened its position over that of 2014. The outlook for Union Assurance in 2016 continues to be extremely positive.
