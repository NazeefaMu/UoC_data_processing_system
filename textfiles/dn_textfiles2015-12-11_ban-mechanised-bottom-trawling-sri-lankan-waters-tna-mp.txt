Ban mechanised bottom trawling in Sri Lankan waters: TNA MP

A Bill prohibiting mechanised bottom trawling was filed in Parliament last week by TNA MP M. A Sumanthiran.
He said: "We have taken several remedial measures, one of which was a discussion with the President. One such measure is to bring in a legislative measure towards which a Bill has been presented to Parliament. If this act is implemented deep sea trawling will be banned and will be considered an offence. The offender will be sentenced to a two year prison term and will have to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000."
The Bill calls for the amendment of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, No 2 of 1996. The Bill was first presented by Sumanthiran on April 21, 2015. Following this, however Parliament was dissolved.
The Bill proposes to prohibit trawling operations in Sri Lankan waters. The Bill seeks to amend legislation which allows for licenses to be granted for trawling operations; prohibit the use, possession, import, transport, purchase and sale of trawl nets for trawling operations in Sri Lankan waters; and specify action to be taken in the event of persons engaging in trawling operations in contravention of these provisions.
"Bottom trawling is an extremely destructive form of fishing and can result in long term damage to marine resources," he said.
"Over the past few years we have witnessed the extent to which Indian trawlers have continued to enter Sri Lankan waters, and exploit our resources. Foreign fishermen fishing in our water has caused great distress to our fishermen specially those living in the north," Sumanthiran said.
