Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed the UNP backbench parliamentarians to withdraw the No-Confidence motions submitted to the Speaker against six ministers and the deputy speaker, Department of Information Director General Sudharshana Gunawardana said today.

Quoting the Premier, Mr. Gunawardana said that any decision regarding a No-Confidence motion must be taken at a UNP parliamentary group meeting.

“The Prime Minister has stated that the No-confidence motions handed over by the backbench UNP MPs was not a decision of the UNP but the views of a few MPs. Further decisions on the matter will be taken at a UNP group meeting, soon. He has asserted that the issues arisen with SLFP would be resolved through negotiations,” Mr. Gunawardana added.
