Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had informed the UNP Parliamentary group meeting that he had received the report and that some of the recommendations would be implemented immediately while the implementation of other recommendations will take time.

However the five page report had recommended that the party should be reorganized and almost all positions should be changed. However sources said the committee had not recommended anyone to any position.

The committee was headed by State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene while Ministers Harin Fernando, Sagala Ratnayake, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam were members of it while UNP MP Bandaula Lal Bandarigoda acted as the secretary of the committee.  (Yohan Perera)
