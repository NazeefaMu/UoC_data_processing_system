Kondaya's brother Saman Jayalath today pleaded guilty to the charge of killing of 5-year-old Seya Sadewmi of Kotadeniyawa after the indictment was read to him by Deputy Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena in the Negombo High Court.
The accused also pleaded guilty to the charges of abduction and rape when the case was taken up for hearing by Negombo High Court Judge N.V. Karunathilaka.
However, Judge Karunatilleke observed that despite accused pleading guilty to the charges, the law presumes that the accused is innocent until the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt and fixed trial for January 25. The Judge said the trial would be conducted on a daily basis.
The accused told the Judge that he wished the case to be heard by the High Court Judge instead of in the presence of a jury.
The court fixed the case for January 13 for the issuance of summons to the prosecution witnesses.
Senior Deputy Solicitor Genenral Ayesha Jinasena with Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara and Shehan De Silva prosecuted.
Assigned Counsel Chatura Amaratunge appeared for the accused.
On September 11, Seya Sadewmi was abducted from the custody of her parents, raped and killed.  (Pushpa Kumara Mallawaarachchi and W. Hubert Fernando)
