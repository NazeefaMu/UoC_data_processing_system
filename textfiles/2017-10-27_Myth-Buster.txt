MYTH: You shouldn’t stand near a fire when wearing contact lenses because they can melt into your eyes.  

BUSTED: “This isn’t true. Nothing happens actually. If you get near a fire, it is not the contact lenses, but your eyes that will get burnt. The lenses can’t melt. You can’t possibly go so close to the fire that it would melt because before that your skin and cornea would be burnt. Your eye can’t bear that kind of heat. So nothing will happen if you wear contact lenses near a heat source or a fire,” explained Dr. M. Wijetunge, a retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital.
