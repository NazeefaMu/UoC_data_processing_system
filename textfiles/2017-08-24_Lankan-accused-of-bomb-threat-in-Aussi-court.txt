A Sri Lankan man accused of threatening to detonate a bomb on a Melbourne -Kuala Lumpur flight has again faced court.

Manodh Marks, 25, allegedly tried to enter the cockpit of Malaysia Airlines Flight 128 out of Melbourne on May 31, threatening to cause a mid-air explosion.

He has been charged with threatening to destroy, damage or endanger the safety of an aircraft or to kill or injure those on board. As a result of his alleged action, the flight was aborted.

Marks, who has not applied for bail, faced the Melbourne Magistrates' Court via video link on Thursday for a committal mention.

The court has previously been told that Marks, who suffers from a Psychiatric illness, holds fears for his safety in custody.

His defence lawyer previously cited Marks' age and appearance as reasons for his vulnerability.
Marks had been living at Dandenong on a student visa.

He was remanded in custody to reappear on October 31. (au.news)
