	Mr. Kariyawasam said he will not be affected at all as a UNP candidate for the Kurunegala District, even Mahind Rajapaksa contests from the same district. “Former President will be welcomed to contest from Kurunegala District,” he said while charging that he is facing an issue contesting from the Hambantota District.
	The MP said the former President cannot contest from Hambantota as his son, former MP Namal Rajapaksa would be defeated if he wins. “ If the father wins, the son will lose, and therefore, the father will not contest from Hambantota,” he added.
