DPA, 14th MARCH, 2018-Angela Merkel has been sworn in as German chancellor before the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, in Berlin.


Ending with the phrase “So help me God,” Merkel took her oath of office in front of parliamentary speaker and former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Wednesday.


Merkel had earlier been elected to her fourth term as chancellor by the Bundestag. Merkel garnered 364 of the 688 votes delivered in the secret ballot on Wednesday and was therefore elected as expected in the first round of voting. At least 355 votes were required in the 709-seat chamber. There were 315 votes against her re-election and nine abstentions.


For the first time, Merkel’s husband Joachim Sauer was present for the vote, as was her mother, Herlind Kasner.


German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier had earlier proposed Merkel - who heads the largest party in the chamber, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - as chancellor to the lawmakers in accordance with the constitution.
