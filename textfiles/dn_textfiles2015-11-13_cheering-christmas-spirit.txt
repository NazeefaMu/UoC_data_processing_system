Cheering in the Christmas spirit

Christmas celebrations witnessed an enthusiastic start with the age-old cake mixing ceremony at Citrus Hikkaduwa, ushering in good tidings and happiness.
Driven by General Manager Cyril Perera and the energetic F&B and Kitchen teams, the ceremony began by mixing colourful cherries, dates, plums and dry fruits together in the heady concoction of vinos and malts, as guests who were gathered in large numbers participated in the ceremony.
The morning was soaked in happiness as the crowd joked and mixed the ingredients in merriment.
Preparing for Christmas, the dried fruit mixture will be placed in a secure place in the main kitchen of the hotel, to soak in all the liquid and mature beautifully in time for December and will then be used to make delectable cakes, cookies and puddings.

Citrus Hikkaduwa is a multi-star luxury resort, offering all the warmth and hospitality of an authentic southern Sri Lankan welcome. There are 51 newly-refurbished Standard Rooms, 40 brand new Deluxe Rooms and 2 Suites. The rooms are comfortable and well stocked with thoughtful amenities, while some feature a private balcony and the view of the magnificent Indian Ocean. Providing all with the perfect accommodation for their beach vacation to relax and unwind, there is no better place to experience this enchanting city than at Citrus Hikkaduwa.
Filled with friendship and cheer, this cake mixing ceremony not only infused fruits and vinos, but also reaped in early Christmas cheer.
