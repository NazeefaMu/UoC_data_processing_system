Ignorance or a bona fide mistake?


	



A gaffe made by a political high-up with official ties with the Sasana in the message he issued to mark last Poson has raised laughs in Buddhist circles. 

 


In his Poson Day message, this high-up has said that King Devanampiyatissa had preached the Cullahathipadopama Sutta to a 40,000-strong gathering of devotees. A number of opposition politicians later urged that the politico be removed from the Buddha Sasana Ministry as he was not fit to hold any responsible position in this Ministry.
