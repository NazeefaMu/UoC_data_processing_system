The petition filed by two former SLFP members demanding the reinstatement of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as SLFP Chairman was dismissed by the Colombo District Court today.

The petition was filed by SLFP’s former All-Island Central Committee members Aruna Priyashantha and Asanka Srinath.

District Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka said the plaintiff had no legal right to file the petition.
The petitioners also demanded that their membership of the SLFP All-Island CC be restored.

They named SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, former General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Elections Commissioner as respondents. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
