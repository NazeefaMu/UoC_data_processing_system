Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa didn’t like to split, leave or harm for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and he didn’t even show a sign of doing such thing, State Minister for higher education Mohan Lal Grero stated in an event held in Mt. Lavinia yesterday.

“He knows the ABC of the history of the party and what happened when the party was split at times. Once the party split into three parties but finally under the leadership of Chandrika Bandaranaike, we won with a huge majority votes and established a strong government. So, the party is going to establish an SLFP government when the time arises,” Grero stated.

He said that just because the leader of the SLFP President Maithripala Sirisena was patient it doesn’t mean he was a not a strong character.

Grero said that the President was a well experienced politician and a strong leader.
