A special team consisting of the senior management from Qatar Airways Head Office, led by Chief Cargo Officer Guillaume Halleux made their inaugural visit to mark this occasion and present the awards.

Guillaume stated, “We are deeply honored to recognize EFL’s growth and support over the last few years. EFL has worked diligently to enhance its reputation as one of the world’s leading freight forwarders and this partnership has strengthened our position as a global player.  

“EFL’s success is a direct result of such vibrant international partnerships. We therefore express our sincere gratitude to Qatar Airways Cargo for these awards and remain committed to further enhancing this relationship as we move boldly forward,” stated Hanif Yusoof, Founder & President – EFL. 
EFL has witnessed a significant expansion in freight forwarding volume, combined with increasingly customized solutions specifically designed to meet the supply chain demands.

“Our relationship with Qatar Airways Cargo serves as an ideal example of how logistic providers and airlines can work together to tailor solutions that provide maximum benefit to global brands. Having reached the end of another outstanding year of business where we have closely collaborated together, we now look forward to increasing our engagement with carriers and customers and developing more customised solutions that are timely and effective,” Yusoof added.
