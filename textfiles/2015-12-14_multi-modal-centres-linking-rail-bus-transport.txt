	A new concept of multi-modal centres integrating rail and bus transport system is to be introduced by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development shortly, progress report of the Ministry which was tabled in Parliament last week said.
	Accordingly, the first multi-modal centre will be constructed in Makumbura. This is the first multi-modal transport Centre having modern facilities to the commuter and for the public and privet transport mode.
	This centre will link the Kelani valley railway line with bus transport. This will be a prime centre for the highway traffic to direct in to the other highway connections as well as the other local road and rail network. Also, this will help reduce the number of vehicles going up and down to the capital city. The project will combine road traffic, railway traffic and will provide parking space for people to arrive in a location from home and continue their journeys to wherever they like, using public transport. The cost for this project would be Rs 849.4 million.
	The report also said all major commercial and public offices will be shifted out of Colombo to ease the traffic congestion.
	Another plan is to establish a health squire in the Colombo National Hospital area, expanding the Southern Highway from Colombo with an elevated highway, (Yohan Perera)
