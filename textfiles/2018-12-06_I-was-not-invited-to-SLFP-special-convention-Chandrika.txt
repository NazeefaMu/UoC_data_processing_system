Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga has claimed that she had not been invited for the special convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which was held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium last Tuesday, December 4.

In a letter to SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa, the former President had said that the Gampaha District Secretaries were informed and posters had been distributed among them.

“All SLFP members have been invited except me and SLFP Kelaniya Organiser Thilak Waragoda. All of them were invited to be present on November 30 at 4.00 p.m.,” she said in the letter.

"I learn that MP Alagiyawanna had advised the organisers not to invite me and Kelaniya Organiser to the annual convention," she said.

“Rathanasena Ketawalage, who was my adviser in my political activities, had received a poster last Friday (November 30) when he went to the SLFP Head Quarters for some other work. But no one had informed me about an SLFP annual convention until now,” her letter said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
