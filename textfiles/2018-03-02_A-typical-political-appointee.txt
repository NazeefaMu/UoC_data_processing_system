A typical political appointee!


	



 

The female head of a revenue collecting department who recently harangued a subject clerk for failing to add a Rs. 750 allowance to her monthly salary, had been remiss in her duty to provide uniform material and shoes to a certain category of employees in her department for two consecutive years, they say.   

 


By the way, this white collar bigwig had got her appointment to the high office thanks to her connection to a very high political authority.


The uniformed staff of the department are entitled to two sets of uniform, one pair of shoes and three pairs of shoelace once a year, they say.
