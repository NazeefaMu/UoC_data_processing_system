Fitch rates DFCC Bank’s debentures up to Rs.7bn ‘A+(lka)( EXP)’


	

Fitch Ratings has assigned DFCC Bank PLC’s (DFCC; AA-(lka)/Negative) proposed subordinated debentures of up to Rs.7 billion an expected national long-term rating of ‘A+(lka)(EXP)’.


The proposed debentures, which will have tenures of five and seven years and carry fixed coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. DFCC expects to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier II capital base and manage maturity mismatches. The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. The proposed subordinated debentures are rated one notch below DFCC’s national long-term rating to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured debt.


DFCC’s rating captures its developing commercial banking franchise and still-high capitalisation. Its weaker asset-quality compared with better-rated peers weighs on its rating. 
The negative outlook on DFCC’s national long-term rating reflects weakening capital buffers that stem from weaker asset-quality metrics, increased loan growth and below-average internal capital generation.
