Yahapalanaya government came to power with the slogan to arrest those involved in corruption, thuggery and murder and there was a public outcry when no one seemed to be arrested or charged for a considerable period. Now that a series of arrests were done in the name of Yahapalanaya what does the citizen have to say?
