Dress change to suit new status


	



 

How a sarong-wearing lorry driver of a department coming under the purview of a certain Ministry had transformed into a tie-coat wearing executive of the same department overnight has become a hot topic in gossip sessions in public service circles these days, they say.

 


This one-time lorry driver had the good fortune to get this sudden upswing in his status soon after his brother-in-law was appointed the purohita in charge of the Ministry.


The new purohita, a large-hearted man, had considered that that his wife’s brother had served long enough as a lorry driver and had him raised to the position of Marketing Promotion officer in the same department. So, that worthy had to change his dress from sarong to coat and tie to suit his new status.
