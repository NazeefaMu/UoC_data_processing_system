Thrill-seeking holidaymakers can now risk a face-to-face encounter with a 16-foot saltwater crocodile separated only by a thin plastic barrier.

The tourist attraction, which is based in Darwin on the Great Barrier Reef, is ominously called the Cage of Death. Tourists pay £103 to be lowered into an aquatic enclosure for a 30-minute encounter with the beast. (Daily Mail)
