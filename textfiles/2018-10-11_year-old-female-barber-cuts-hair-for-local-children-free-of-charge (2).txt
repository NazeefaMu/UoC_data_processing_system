At only 7 years old, Neijae Graham-Henries became the only girl in the class at the Junior Barber Academy in North Philadelphia to pass the junior barber training course, and the class’s youngest student yet!  Originally tagging along with her older brother, Neijae’s mother soon realized that her son wasn’t interested, but her young daughter was.  After graduating from the course, and now 8 years old, Neijae is now giving free haircuts to children in her neighborhood as an act of goodwill and community service. CBS spoke to proud mother Jamie Graham as she explained – “she wasn’t intimidated because she was the youngest student or the youngest female. It was really exciting for me to see her go after something she really wanted to do.  I’m hoping she can take that same attitude and same focus and energy throughout her life.”
