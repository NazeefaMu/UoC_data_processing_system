Move to appoint new PM from SLFP or SLPP: Nalin Bandara


	

UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha charged today that there was a move to appoint a new Prime Minister from Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), who does not command a majority in the House.

He told a news conference that there was no reason for President to refrain from appointing Mr. Wickremesinghe, who commands majority in the House, as the Prime Minister.

He said security detail given to MP Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister should be removed as he cannot function as the premier as per the interim order given by the Appeal Court yesterday.

He said IGP Pujith Jayasunda should act the same way he acted and removed security detail of UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe when he was removed from the Prime Minister’s post.

“Mr. Rajapaksa is no longer entitled to the security that is given to a Prime Minister now as he does not hold the post anymore,” Mr. Jayamaha said. (Yohan Perera)
