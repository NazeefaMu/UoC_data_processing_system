Don’t ever go to Saudi, Kuwait: Troubled housemaid pleads with SL women


	

The Sri Lankan housemaid who was repatriated to Sri Lanka after she was subjected to mistreatment for over 15 years by her employer in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today pleaded with all the Sri Lankan women not to go to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for employment as housemaids.

Murin Jasintha, a 46-year-old mother of three made this request at a media conference organized by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Ministry (SLBFE).

Murin Jasintha, a 46-year-old mother of three and a resident of Muvunuwatawana, Chilaw was brought back to the country by the SLBFE a few days ago after she escaped from her employer where she was held without being paid for more than fifteen years, amidst physical harassment.

According to SLBFE reports, Murin went to Riyadh in 1999 at the age of 29, on an SLBFE registered working agreement.

However, after two months, the employer had refused to pay her monthly wages and not allowed her to get in touch with her family members. After the SLBFE officials intervened into the matter, the employer had agreed to pay her dues of Rs. 2.7 million in arrears for fifteen years.

“I was not paid, but I had to work for them continuously. When I gave letters to be sent to my children and husband, all of them were thrown out by my employer. One day when I was cleaning the house, I found some letters written by me to my children in a corner of the house. I felt very sad and helpless, but I stayed on ,” she said.

She also said that many changes had taken place in her family in Sri Lanka during the 15 years.
During the past 15 years when she was held in Riyadh, all of her three children have got married and they too are having children.

Further, she said her husband has started a new family with another woman.

“My husband is now living with another woman happily. I was not with them for 15 years. Anyway, I can be happy seeing them leading a happy life,” Murin said.

During the time she was accommodated at the Welfare Centre at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Murin said another Sri Lankan housemaid whose leg was broken after being harassed by her employer, was also brought there.

“I have only one request to all the Sri Lankan women. Please don’t ever think of going to Saudi and Kuwait for housemaid jobs. The mother of my employer troubled me a lot. I tolerated everything for the sake of my children,” Murin said.

“While doing cooking and washing at the employer’s house, I was compelled to lift two cans of water of 10 litres each for more than 25 times per day. I had to go up and down the stairs of a 15 storied building. I tolerated every hardship I had to face. Once I had to undergo a surgery after diagnosing an illness in my belly as a result of lifting such heavy weights, continuously. I got 49 stitches on my belly. My dedication was bigger than those problems,” she said.

She thanked Minister Thalatha Athukorala for making all the arrangements to bring her back safely to Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh for the assistance.

A cheque worth Rs. 2.7 million for her monthly wages in arrears which was refused to be paid by her employer was offered by the Minister to Murin.

Another woman named S.I.Asiamma, 47 was also brought back to the country by the SLBFE.

Asiamma who is not having a good memory relating to the details of her work place and the employer, has also faced many hardships during her period of work. The SLBFE offered Rs.150, 000 from the SLBFE fund for migrant workers. (Piyumi Fonseka)

We can't challenge Saudi laws:Thalatha 

Responding a question raised by a journalist whether legal action could have been taken against a Saudi Arabian employer who has allegedly involved in an abduction of a Sri Lankan housemaid to intimidate her not to ask for a monthly wage, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorala yesterday said the ministry cannot challenge such ‘systems of strict laws’ of Saudi Arabia.

“It is a great achievement that we could save her and bring her home. Legal action should not be taken, since we cannot fight with the strict laws of Saudi Arabia which is one of those big countries,” she said.
