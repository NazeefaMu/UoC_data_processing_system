Night of Sight Sing-A-Long

This Christmas join for a Sing-a-Long with Annesley Malawana to help light up little children's lives in collaboration with the Rotary & Rotaract Clubs of Panadura.
"Night of Sight" Sing-a-Long will be held on December 19 at BMICH Banquet Hall from 7pm. This event will be for a worthy cause carried out by the Rotary and Rotaract Clubs of Panadura through their "From My Heart 2 Yours" initiative which is dedicated for the underprivileged children identified with Cataract whose parents cannot afford the surgery cost involved in re-storing their child's eye sight.
As an effort to restore the children's vision, the community service organization plans to undertake the costs for a minimum of 200 surgeries starting from January 2016.
The audience is guaranteed of a fun filled evening on this day with the evergreen Annesley and his band Super Chimes taking the centre stage singing the hits of 60's & 70's both English and Sinhala favourites.
The youngsters will not be forgotten as there will be an upbeat dance session to wind up the event.
Tickets can be purchased at www.tickets.lk and for inquiries and reservations call Thiwanka on 0773992206 or Yohan on 0772672459. You can also make a generous donation for the cost of surgery by contacting any of the above mentioned members.
