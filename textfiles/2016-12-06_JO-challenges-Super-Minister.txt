JO challenges Super Minister


	

The Joint Opposition is to challenge the Constitutionality of the Development (Special Provisions) Bill which, if enacted, would provide for the creation of what it calls a ‘Super Ministry’ with far-reaching powers.

Addressing a press conference on behalf of the Joint Opposition former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris said the government had sought to take over powers of even the President and various other State institutions to be vested with the proposed ‘Super Minister’.

He said this would result in Government bodies being downsized.

“We will challenge the bill in court,” he said.

The Constitutionality of a Bill can be challenged in the Supreme Court within seven days upon its presentation in Parliament. (Kelum Bandara)
