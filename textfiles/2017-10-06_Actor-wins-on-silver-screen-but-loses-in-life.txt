Life and love are entwined. No one would raise objections if someone says that life is incomplete without love. When one is obsessed with love the slightest misunderstanding among lovers could lead to serious consequences.  



 The untimely death of Tele drama actor Dasun Nishan was the result of his illicit love affair  with another female artiste. Nishan’s wife has confirmed Dasun having had an illicit affair.  


Born in Senkadagala Pura as the first child of Lalitha Swarnakumari  Herath, Dasun had his primary education at Sumangala Vidyalaya Kandy. Circumstances made this family shift to Mirigama. In the absence of his father, Dasun was specially cared for by his mother. Having passed the Ordinary Level Examination while at Mirigama, Dudley Senanayake College, he entered Gampaha Bandaranaike Vidyalaya to complete his education. He obtained a BIT degree from the Colombo University.

Giving up potential opportunities to serve the country as a software engineer, he opted to take to modeling. Later he stepped into the field of movie making and became an actor. To aid his chosen profession he shifted residence to Gorakapitiya, Piliyandala. He shared accommodation with some fellow actors. His mother and brother in the meantime resided in Kanthota, Nittambuwa.   


Dasun met his first love during his school days. By the time his love affair had reached 11 years his fiancee had become a teacher at an international school. By this time he was a popular actor. It was then that they decided to enter matrimony, as expected by their close associates.  Their marriage took place two years ago. However Dasun delayed taking his wife to his abode and start living under one roof as husband and wife. It was apparent that Dasun was aiming to climb the rungs of the acting ladder reach greatness.     


However, he surprised his close associates, his family and other artistes by ending his life. He chose suicide to end his life. A hurriedly written letter, left at the site he committed suicide, was the only proof that he committed suicide.  Informed sources revealed that he had preferred to stay away from attending rehearsals and acting in a Tele drama series that is being telecast now. The reason Dasun gave for his unavailability was that he was sick. His body was found hanging on the ceiling fan of his room.

Police investigations proved that Dasun had committed suicide. The inquirer into sudden deaths Ajith Wijesinghe, and the JMO of the Kalubowila teaching hospital DR PRasadani Senarath declared that the death was due to suicide. 

 
His mother Swarnakumari giving evidence at the postmortem revealed that her deceased son was married to a young woman from Giriulla. She said that a few months ago he had started a love affair with another young female artiste, an actress. She said that she had admonished her son several times about this illicit affair. Her son had visited her at her residence, but she had not noticed any unusual behaviour in her son and their was no indication that he was suffering from mental stress.   


Dasun’s wife said that they had known each other for the past 13 years. They had married and there was nothing unusual. However from January this year Dasun had developed a love affair with an actress and his wife had come to know of it later. When questioned he had admitted to the fact, but had sworn to his wife that he would not give up on her. This actress had even spoken to Dasun’s wife. Dasun’s wife suspects that due to some misunderstanding between him and the actress Dasun would have been dejected and had taken his own life.   


The little note left behind by Dasun and the live recording on his mobile of the scenes of his suicide proved beyond doubt that it was a suicide.   


Dasun, who played different characters in Tele dramas, had won the hearts of many viewers both young and old. His roles in Pahesara and Rathu Pichcha and his performances in “Dedunu Akashaya’ had left lasting impressions on television viewers.   
Many have criticized his decision to end his life. Many consider it as an idiotic thing to do. Many blame his death on this illicit love affair. Many questions remain unanswered following his death.
