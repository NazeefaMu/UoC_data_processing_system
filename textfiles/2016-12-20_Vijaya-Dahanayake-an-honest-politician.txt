Vijaya Dahanayake, eldest son of the revered teacher K. Dahanayake, was our classmate at Richmond College, who bid goodbye to us after being ill for a time.  
Vijaya was one of the most determined students at the College, with several handicaps in that he was born with a defect in his eyesight. But he was one of those students at Richmond who excelled in debating and applied himself to  his studies with commitment. He was an important member of the College debating team. I recall his late father, a much respected teacher and a brilliant product of Richmond College as Principal of Denham Academy where he nurtured and trained his three sons, namely Vijaya, Saranaguptha and Parakrama in their English and General Knowledge. In fact sometimes when we visited Vijaya we were also encouraged to participate in these sessions. Vijaya’s father, K. Dahanayake was very keen to impart his knowledge and experience to his three sons. 
I recall when it came to exams or writing notes in class, Vijaya used a magnifying glass to enable him to write notes and answer question papers. To me and our classmates, Vijaya was a man who was rich in qualities though not rich in monetary terms. A person who valued compassion, love and humanity. He always displayed a sense of honesty and integrity despite these qualities and spoke out expressing his views tempered with cordiality, tact and compassion. To my knowledge, he never said anything to hurt anyone. He was a very sincere friend who extended a helping hand to anyone. 
I also recall his closeness to his cousin Ranjith de Silva, better known as R.L. de Silva, who was a batch mate of mine in the Police, and always gave him brotherly advice about his heram scaram ways. Vijaya was helpful to me in a situations where I was used by a colleague of mine to get me transferred from Allawa police station without any rhyme or reason.
 He in fact intervened on my behalf and spoke to his uncle Late Mr. W. Dahnayake, one time Prime Minister who was the Minister of Home Affairs in 1969 and helped me to get the transfer cancelled. Vijaya learnt his ABC in politics from his uncle, Late W. Dahanayake when he was his Private Secretary.
 He had a good grounding and was successful, winning the Municipal Elections ultimately becoming the Mayor of Galle. It was around this time that he married Nalani whom I came to know when he used to come to the airport to proceed to BELGUIM Schipole on a KLM flight when I was the Security Manager. His wife has been a great asset to him.  
Vijaya is an excellent example of a politician who lived honourably and had a vision. His vision in politics was to improve the city of Galle. 
It is well known by all that his visits to Europe whilst he was Mayor of Galle produced results in terms of development in the Galle Fort and Galle City. Perhaps he is the last of the Mohicans who lived a simple and humble life with a high degree of honesty which was clearly displayed through the way he lived all these years, in his parental home along with his brothers who supported him. A politician who lived sans jeeps, luxury vehicles and bodyguards.  
Vijaya to me was a person who had clean hands, a pure heart and did not lift his soul for what is false.  
He also believed that life should resemble channels and not reservoirs, for reservoirs store water and channels distribute it. That was Vijaya. He was a channel of blessings to others.  We all love you Vijaya. We will never forget you  
May you Rest in Peace.  
Your classmates at Richmond.
