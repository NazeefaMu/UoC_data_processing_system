The staff of Sampath Bank both present and past  have contributed immensely to take the bank to where it is today. 
Inaugurated in early 1987 in the midst of the ruthless ethnic conflict soon to be followed by the equally ruthless insurrection the pioneering lot of employees risked life and limb to enable the fledgling bank to get on its feet . Very often working late into the  night on a regular basis without any extra benefit.­
For all those who worked at Sampath Bank at whatever stage of its evolution the Bank has always remained near and dear their hearts and is always remembered with great affection. The excellent grounding received and the positive encouragement to achieve highest professional standards will be remembered with gratitude. The ‘family’ feeling and the caring   culture with the ‘respect for the individual’ as the most important key value will endure among the Sampath fraternity till the very end.
To  facilitate the interaction and promote fellowship  among ex-Sampath Bankers from varied industries , professions and age groups  an initiative is being taken to form an association where members could benefit from their collective experiences, with the common bonding of affinity to Sampath Bank. 
The first event to launch the Ex-Sampath Bankers Club is to be held on July 25th titled ‘X Sampath Nite 2015’and many ex-Sampath Bankers are expected to attend including several from overseas.
