Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying's expressed these views at the Regular Press Conference when asked whether Hambantota port would be used as a military base in the future.

Ms. Hua said the port is a cooperation project conducted by China and Sri Lanka on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

“It will contribute to local socio-economic development. Our two sides have the strong will to ensure the smooth progress of this project. I think that there is no need for certain people to make speculations from the military or other strategic perspectives,” she said.

Meanwhile, responding to reports that there are accusations against the financing projects in the framework of China's Belt and Road Initiative, she said the initiative was open and transparent.

“As to the different views held by some people, I think that the conclusion may be different when people view the same thing with a different mindset and from a different perspective. We hope that relevant countries can follow the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to advance it and deliver benefits to their people,” she said.
