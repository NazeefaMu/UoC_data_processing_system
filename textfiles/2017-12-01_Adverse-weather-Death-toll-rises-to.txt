The death toll from the prevailing adverse weather conditions had increased to 11 persons, while another five still reported missing, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) reported.

DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili said three bodies belonging to fishermen, who were reported missing since Wednesday (29) had been found a short while ago in Galle. 

Despite the gale force winds which later developed into cyclone ‘OCKHI’ moved away from the country to some 750 km West of Colombo while torrential rains lashed most parts of the country today with the water levels of several rivers including Nilwala Ganga, Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga breaching their banks.

The Meteorology Department said with the depression moving away from the country the rains too would lessen during the next few days. Disaster Management Centre said 77,481 people from 23,884 families were affected by the weather conditions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
