Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has sought a report from the authorities concerned on the violence in Parliament including brawls, name calling, spraying of chili powder and damaging properties, a statement from his office said today.

He told a party leaders meeting that he regretted the incidents that took place in the House and pointed out that it was the duty of all MPs to avoid the repetition of such ugly scenes in the future.

The Speaker said he had received intelligence reports that disruptive activities would be carried out yesterday and therefore preemptive measures were taken.

Commenting on the allegation that unwanted people were present in the public gallery during commotion in the House last Friday, he said he looked into it and found that there was no organized presence of such individuals.

The Speaker said any MP could bring up to five of his supporters to the gallery.
