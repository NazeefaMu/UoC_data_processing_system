Arunthathy Thiruchittampalam She lived a full life


	

The certainty of death has removed from our midst, Amma.  


I called her Amma, for I was married to her daughter, Sarojini and that was how Saro called 
her mother.   


Amma belonged to a Colombo-based Jaffna family, the Paramanayagams. Her father was a doctor and she lost her mother when she was very young. So she and her father had to take care of her two siblings, a sister and a brother.   

 


Amma was educated at one of Colombo’s leading Convents, St. Bridget’s, where she was with the likes of Aunty Leila Chitty and Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike


 


Amma was educated at one of Colombo’s leading Convents, St. Bridget’s, where she was with the likes of Aunty Leila Chitty and Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world’s first female Head of State.  At school, she excelled in her studies. Although a Hindu, she won the prize for Christianity. She was gifted with a copy of The Complete Works of Shakespeare. That copy was given to my wife to be used at school and at university. My wife did English Literature and so did my daughter. That copy is still with us. She also learned Buddhism and Sinhala from a Buddhist monk.   


After her education she married an irrigation engineer and then lived in various parts of the island. The couple was blessed with three daughters and one son. Although I am a Christian and a priest of the Church of Ceylon, she accepted me into the family. She visited us at all our stations and also in Calcutta where I completed my theological studies.  


Amma designed and built her own house in Colombo. She passed away in that house. She lived a full and complete life. Amma was a member of the Sri Lanka Housewives’ Association, read the papers daily and was up to date with the latest news, played scrabble and crocheted. Amma celebrated her 100th birthday last June, surrounded by her extended family from all around 
the world.  


Amma, thank you for being my mother. I am most grateful. We shall always remember you 
with love.
