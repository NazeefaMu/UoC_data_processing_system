Diyawanna member in revealing dress reprimanded!


	



A fair Diyawanna member with ties to a field of art, who attended the sittings in a sleeveless bodice and a saree draped in an unbecoming manner, had been reprimanded by the House authorities, they say.

 


This comely fashion-conscious member had been severely warned that she should attend the sittings of the assembly properly dressed in future. However, the member had faulted the authorities for not having apprised her of the dress code and left the House in a huff.
