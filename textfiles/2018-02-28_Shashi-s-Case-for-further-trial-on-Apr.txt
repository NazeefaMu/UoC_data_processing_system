When the trial of two cases filed against Shashi Weerawansa for holding diplomatic and general passports illegally, were taken up before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday, the eleventh witness of the case, former Commissioner of the Department for Registration of Persons Jagath Wijeweera informed Court that he gave special instructions to approve Shashi Weerawansa’s application based on trust, regardless of necessary documents being not furnished.

He told the Court that former Minister Wimal Weerawansa had personally contacted him and said that Shashi Weerawansa had lost all her documents when they shifted to their new residence in Colombo 07 and she has to obtain a new ID immediately.

Mr. Wijeweera also said that he had issued a special written statement to the approval section of the Department, noting that Shashi Weerawansa had lost all her relevant documents and she would submit them later.

Accordingly, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara fixed the two cases for further trial on April 23.

Shashi Weerawansa was arrested in February, 2015 over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passport illegally. She had allegedly submitted birth certificates with forged names and dates of birth to obtain those passports. She is currently out on bail.
