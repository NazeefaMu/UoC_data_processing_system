A man's body believed to be that of the missing businessman, Mohamed Sakeem Sulaiman, was found on the Hemmathagama Road in Rukulagama in Mawanella yesterday evening, police sources said.

The victim whose face had been disfigured with serious injuries, believed to have been made by a blunt instrument, was in the process of being identified. Several police teams including a special team from Colombo had reached the scene last evening.
