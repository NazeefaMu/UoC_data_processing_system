Chief Minister Nazeer not allowed in military camps
	
Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahamed would not be allowed to enter military camps and the three forces would not participate in functions attended by the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) said.
Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the decision was taken after considering a request by the security forces to do so.
He said the security forces have been perturbed following the recent incident where Chief Minister Ahamed rebuked a naval officer during an event held at the Sampur Maha Vidyalaya.

CM's tirade: MR urges probe
	
Responding to the behaviour of Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahamed who slandered a Navy officer at an event, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa urged a full investigation into the matter, and said insults directed at the security forces by political authorities should stop.
Issuing a statement, he said , A video clip of the Eastern Province Chief Minister verbally abusing a naval officer at a public meeting in Sampur has appeared in the media and been posted widely on social networks. The fact that this ugly incident took place in the presence of the American ambassador has added to its seriousness. The Eastern Province Chief Minister who raised an issue of protocol over his place on the stage can be heard shouting at the naval officer repeatedly using phrases like get out from here idiot and shut up.
On a previous occasion when TNA politicians forcibly entered an army camp in the north, the government went out of its way to portray this as a minor incident and to sweep it under the carpet. This is now the second such incident. The incidents that took place in the north and in Sampur should not have taken place anywhere in the country. Politicians in any part of the country should not seek to enter army camps without obtaining prior permission or giving due notice. Likewise no politician in any part of the country should ever speak to a uniformed member of the armed forces at a public meeting the way the EP Chief Minister spoke to that naval officer.
Deliberate insults directed in this manner by the political authorities at the armed forces that rid the country of the scourge of terrorism, should stop. We suspect that this latest incident is a part of the project that began in January last year to demoralise our war heroes. I call upon the government not to sweep this latest incident under the carpet the way they dodged taking action over the incident in the north. It is the duty of the government to formally investigate the conduct of the EP Chief Minister and to take steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur anywhere in the country in future.,

Ex-Senior DIG, Ex-Crimes OIC re-remanded till June 09
	
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Perera were ordered to be further remanded till June 9 over the Magisterial Inquiry relating to the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen by the Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today.
The former SDIG and the former Crimes OIC were remanded on charges of causing disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, touching it to screen the offender and conspiring under the clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code.
Acceding to the request of the prosecution that the Mobitel Company was not supporting probe sufficiently by providing mobile phone details appropriately, the Magistrate ordered the Mobitel Company to provide certain mobile phone details relating to the inquiry immediately to expedite investigations.
Submitting a report of the preliminary inquiry conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council against Former JMO Ananda Samarasekara and two others on the allegation of missing body parts of the corpse of Thajudeen, the counsel appearing on behalf of the SLMC told the court that the council had charged the former JMO and others in a Professional Behavior Committee for further inquiry.
The Magistrate also directed the SLMC to report over the progress of the inquiry consistently to the court.
Senior State Counsel, Dilan Ratnayake told the Court that the prosecution was conducting a sensitive investigation dedicatedly into the complex nature of the murder of Thajudeen, therefore, the CID needs appropriate time to work on the investigations.
Submitting a further report in Court, the CID informed the court that the former SDIG had interfered in closing the extracts of the case deceitfully, since he had not taken any appropriate actions as an experienced police officer to investigate on the deceased, Thajudeens wallet which was found after the accident from 3 kilo meters away from the place of the accident.
Appearing for the first suspect, former Crimes OIC, Sumith Perera, the Counsel Ajith Pathirana told the court that his client was prepared to provide a statement to the Magistrate over the inquiry under the Power to record statements and confessions of section 127 in the Criminal Procedure Code.
However the Magistrate told the suspect that he may have to satisfy the Magistrate if he was to make a statement independently on the next date.
Appearing for the second suspect, counsel Anil Silva PC moved that the offences stated in the B report under the section of 190 and 198 of the Penal Code were bailable if the magistrate was satisfied to grant bail considering the other facts.
And he also citing few precedents, and said that it was not fair to consider on the prosecutions arguements in rejecting bail application as it cannot be seen that the suspect would interfere with witnesses in the inquiry or effect public peace.
The Magistrate rejecting the bail applications of the suspects held that the Court could apparently see the possibility of the witnesses being affected by the suspects if they were released on bail, as they were once powerful police officers with the capability of affecting the inquiry.
The Magistrate also held that under the section of 32 in the Penal Code, Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention, provides more broader provision to a magistrate to consider on remanding a suspect and he also considered the allegation under section 113 of the penal code, conspiracy.
The Magistrate also rejected the request of the defense counsel that to allow the second suspect, former SDIG to be examined by his private specialist Doctor at the prison and directed the defense to request the Prison authority first regarding any outside medical treatments and then tender the recommendation letter from Prison Medical Officer in court.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

property damage.

Harvinder Singh, GM (Marketing & Operations) of LIC Lanka informed that if the death has occurred due to the recent adverse weather condition, it will be treated as non-early claim, irrespective of the duration of the policy.

LIC has issued an internal circular to all its offices to effect these relaxations in the company.
The company has initiated these measures so that genuine claimants of LIC (Lanka) Ltd. are immediately paid the claims, which is the basic purpose of Life Insurance. Claimants can contact the nearest branch office of LIC (Lanka) Ltd.

The life insurance gross written premiums (GWPs) crossed the billion rupee mark during the period and ended the quarter with Rs.1.42 billion GWP, an increase of 64 percent from a year ago.
This is more than double the industry growth of 23 percent year-on-year (yoy) for the quarter, the company said in a statement.
The general insurance GWPs rose by 17 percent yoy to Rs. 526.3 million, well supported by motor insurance. Motor GWPs grew by as much as 80 percent yoy to Rs. 405.8 million.
In line with the insurance regulations, the company spun off its general insurance business in to a fully-owned subsidiary starting from January 2015.
The companys innovative Click2Claim product appears to be gaining fast momentum in the motor segment due to its fast claim settlement process in
the market.

Meanwhile, the group paid premiums worth Rs.415.5 million, up 11 percent from a year ago.

industry players. The other operating and administrative expenses of the group rose by 79 percent yoy to Rs.529.3 million.
In a sector report compiled by Capital Alliance Research in 2014, Asian Alliance was identified as s star performer in the industry along with HNB Assurance PLC to outperform the industry in terms of GWPs and profits during the five years to 2018.

Sri Lanka is now among the countries that incorporate the best practices of the insurance trade, for protecting citizens from the ill-effects of natural calamities.
The National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) has under Sri Lankan government sponsorship insured all uninsured Sri Lankan citizens and uninsured properties by obtaining a catastrophic reinsurance cover of up to Rs. 10 billion from major reinsurance companies in London and other parts of the world, through Crescent Global and its subsidiary Strategic Insurance Brokers (SIB).
All of the companies in the reinsurance cover agreement for 2016 are with A, AA and A+ ratings, and world renowned reinsurance companies. This national minded outcome was made possible through the Insurance services and brokering efforts of Crescent Global Southeast Asia and its subsidiary Strategic Insurance brokers, which facilitated this catastrophic reinsurance cover agreement for NITF, for the year 2016/17.
NITF would now as a result of the catastrophic reinsurance cover for 2016, have the capability to settle claims up to 2.5 million for any uninsured property that is affected by a natural calamity. Fishermen would be compensated up to Rs. 1 million for loss of life due to natural disaster while fishing at sea, and all citizens are covered for Rs.100,000 in the event of death due to natural perils, said Manjula de Silva, Chairman, National Insurance Trust Fund.
We responded to a request that came from the Minister of Finance to arrange this cover. It will greatly enhance the ability of the Treasury to absorb the impact of a significant natural disaster. The speed with which claims for compensation can be settled will also be vastly improved as we will be coordinating directly with the Ministry of Disaster Management. We greatly appreciate the role played by Crescent Global who succeeded in obtaining reinsurance cover from an excellent panel of reinsurers whose reputations underpin the effectiveness and the quality of the programme, de Silva added.

Unity vital in serving victims: MR
	
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said in Parliament yesterday that all persons should act in unison rather than hurling allegations against each other to serve the victims of natural catastrophes.
While participating in the debate on natural disaster in the House, Mr. Rajapaksa said the country witnessed serious calamities such as floods in 1958, the cyclone in 1978 and the tsunami in 2004. He said officials and the members of the security forces with experience in responding to such disasters still served in the country.
"It is the duty of all people to cast aside party differences and work for the good of the affected people," he said.
On another note, Mr. Rajapaksa said the damage could have been averted to a certain extent if a proper warning was given. Public servants should be encouraged to work at this moment because they remain reluctant to implement some measures in fear of action against them, he added.
He further lamented that schoolchildren had lost their textbooks and uniforms, and it was a serious matter to be attended to. Commenting on infrastructure development, he said he took steps to build the stretch of the outer circular road on elevated pillars, but not on a landmass filled.
"Today, the elevated road has been fared by the floods. If changes are done to the original plan of constructing the rest of the road, I request the subject minister to consider elevated pillars. We did it after consulting not only engineers but also environmentalists," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
