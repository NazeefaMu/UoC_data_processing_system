Avant Garde and its guardian angels


	


A group of yahapalanaya purohitas determined to put the Avant Garde high ups in the dock recently rendezvoused to discuss the whys and wherefores for some of their colleagues to protect these high ups.
During this powwow, one purohita asked his colleagues: “Why on earth are they trying so hard to white-wash the high ups of this company?”
“Don’t you know that the son of that one … is running this show from behind the scene!” the reply came from a yahapalanaya purohita who trotted out the name of a colleague and his son.
“Ah! That son! He is a very young chap…He was doing a job in a key Ministry,” the purohita who raised the question recalled.
“He is the man!” the other confirmed. “He claims that he has the blessings of the dear and near ones of those in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya!”
“It means that a full expose of this affair could leave egg on the face of those in the highest echelons as well! Then it is our duty to warn our bosses on time,” another purohita said.
All others agreed to this suggestion.
