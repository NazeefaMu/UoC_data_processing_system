Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra and eight others were today indicted in the Colombo High Court by the Attorney General over the alleged abduction of a youth in the Dematagoda area.

The Attorney General had filed the indictments on 29 counts against the suspects.

Earlier, the suspects had been produced in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court at a non summary trial and they are now out on bail.

The victim, Amila Priyanga, was alleged to have been abducted by the suspects.

The entire incident was captured on CCTV cameras, and the footage was later used by the police to arrest the suspects. (Shehan Chamilka Silva)
