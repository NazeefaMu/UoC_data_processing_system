Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa today denied allegations of any connection with the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) or the recent attacks aimed at Muslim owned shops.

In a facebook post, Rajapakse strongly condemned the false rumours linking his name with the BBS and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in connection with the atrocious burning of Muslim owned shops in the recent past.

“I strongly deny such allegations and decry the attempt to tarnish my reputation once again. We need to have the wisdom to understand the political agenda behind such conspiracies and rise as one nation against such despicable acts aimed at inciting racial disharmony,” he said.
