DFCC Bank further extended its footprint in Kandy with the opening of two fully-fledged branches in the Kandy City Centre (KCC) and Peradeniya, recently. 


The branches were ceremoniously declared open by CEO Arjun Fernando, DCEO Lakshman Silva together with the members of the community and senior representatives and staff from the bank. Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake also graced the KCC opening ceremony.


DFCC is fast expanding its branch network across the island with the objective of advancing financial inclusion. In addition to traditional brick and mortar structures, the bank is also focusing on developing electronic mediums that provide customers with the ease and convenience of experiencing banking on-the-go.


The new branches will offer end-to-end financial solutions for all business and retail customers in Kandy. Moreover, with its expertise in SME financing, the bank expects to play a key role in nurturing and helping businesses in the region to grow. These services are well complemented by the online banking facility, a 24/7 call centre and access to over 3,500 ATMs through DFCC’s own and partner ATM networks, which facilitates unlimited withdrawals at zero cost. 


DFCC’s Kandy City Centre branch is located at  No: 05, L1-K4, Kandy City Centre, Dalada Veediya, Kandy and the Peradeniya branch is located at 901/A, Peradeniya Road, Kandy.
