While reiterating that there was no rift within the SLFP, Party Spokesman Dilan Perera said it was the UNP, which should be worried about party fractions in future.   
Commenting on a statement made by SLFP Deputy Minister Thilanga Sumathipala to the effect that all remaining SLFP ministers were mulling to resign, which had been rejected by other SLFP ministers, Mr. Perera said the deputy minister had simply sought approval of the party Central Committee (CC) to resign.
“The Deputy Ministers had sought SLFP CC approval to resign from ministerial portfolios as they were given on the approval of the CC. We don’t have any rift based on this statement as some elements claimed.
“However, there are reports that UNPers are campaigning to promote Sajith Premadasa as the Opposition Leader and if this happens, UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will have to face hurdles,” he told a news conference at party headquarters.
Meanwhile, he said UNP Badulla District candidate Harin Fernando had failed to addresses the charges thrown at the UNP and had instead asked the UPFA to take poison.
Mr. Perera invited UNP leaders to take poison alleging they were involved in frauds and in return Mr. Fernando asked the UPFA members to consume poison when the party was defeated on August 18.
