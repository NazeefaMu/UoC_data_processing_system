Joint Opposition hands over Memorandum rejecting joint resolution to UN Mission in Colombo

 
The resolution tabled before the UNHRC jointly sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka undermined the country’s sovereignty and independence and as such the Joint Opposition in
Parliament completely opposed it. Although the Joint Opposition did not oppose any investigation into war time atrocities it should be done through a local mechanism only.
A memorandum to this effect notifying the total rejection of the UNHCR resolution by the Joint Opposition was handed over to the UN Mission in Colombo to be forwarded to the visiting UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Prince Zeid Ra’ad al Hussien by Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena and Prof. Tissa Vitharana yesterday, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
He said the Joint Opposition took steps to handover this memorandum because they had not received any favourable response form the UN Mission to the request they made for an appointment to meet Zeid to have a discussion with them.
