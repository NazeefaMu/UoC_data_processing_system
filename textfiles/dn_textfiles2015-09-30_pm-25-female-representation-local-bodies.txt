PM for 25% female representation in Local Bodies

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe yesterday said that 25 percent of the seats in Local Government bodies should be reserved for women.
"Still we are discussing the procedure and hoping to bring the amendment prior to the next Local Government polls and implement it at that election which is scheduled to be held in March next year." the Premier said.
He was addressing the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the Department of Elections held yesterday at the BMICH.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe noted that female representation in Sri Lankan politics was very low.
"Even though 51 per cent of the country's population comprise women . I don't think even a dozen female representatives are in Parliament," he said.
The PM also said that earlier there was a proposal to allocate a certain number of nominations to females as a solution for this matter. But, it cannot be considered as a de facto solution to the problem.
He also noted that the government plans to bring all the proposals in this regard to the Parliament in November this year.
He observed that political parties have various ideas with regard to the changes that were needed to be brought to the country's electoral system."
We are hoping to arrive at a solution for the prevailing issues in the country's electoral system by the end of this year. "Several problems in the electoral system were discussed and addressed to a certain extent through the 19th amendment to the constitution and that however some issues still exist," he said.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the necessity for introducing electronic voting machines to the country as most of the countries currently use this technology. ",we have to carry out trials and come to an agreement prior to the introduction of these machines. We should also make the public aware of this".
