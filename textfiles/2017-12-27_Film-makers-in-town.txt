Two young British film producers were in Sri Lanka recently, putting the finishing touches on a film venture with Sri Lankan film director Louis Van Der Straaten.
Kiran Rai is the executive producer for Parachute, an action film directed by Van Der Straaten, who also scripted the story. Ralph Perera is the main producer.


Sri Lankan-born Ralph Perera migrated to the UK early. Kiran Rai was born in the UK but has his roots in Mumbai, India. He visits India often and now Sri Lanka, too, has become a favourite destination.
Ralph Perera is an investor by profession and says he sees film as a good area for investment.
He has produced documentaries and television films in the UK.
Kiran Rai is a reporter for the London Evening Post, covering sports events such as football and Formula I, and is an aspiring actor.
He says he was delighted when director Van Der Straaten offered him the lead role in his next film venture.
Parachute is a Sinhala language film and will be distributed internationally after being dubbed in English. The producers say it is based on a true story.
