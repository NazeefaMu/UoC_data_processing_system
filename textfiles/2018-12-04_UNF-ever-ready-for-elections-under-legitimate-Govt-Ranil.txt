UNF ever ready for elections under legitimate Govt.: Ranil


	

 UNF Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said today they were agreeable to a legal election if a legitimate government was appointed in line with the Constitution.

“UNF has no reason to oppose an election if other parties agree to hold a snap poll. Therefore parties can decide on a date of an election. This can be done by a motion which is approved by a two-thirds majority. We have conveyed this to the SLPP and had told them that parties should meet and decide on what needs to be done,” he said.

Mr. Wickrmesinghe said the government should be constitutional. What we have in Sri Lanka is a Parliament-based government. No one should act like Hitler. It is only me and the UNF which could command a majority. Therefore we ask those concerned to work in accordance with the Constitution. (Yohan Perera)
