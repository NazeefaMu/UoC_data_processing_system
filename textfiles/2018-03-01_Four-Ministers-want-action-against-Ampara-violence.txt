Ministers Rauff Hakeem, Mano Ganesan, Daya Gamage and Rishad Bathiudeen had urged the Government to ensure that action is taken against those responsible for communal violence in Ampara two days ago, it is learnt.

At Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, these four Ministers spoke against the violence that broke out in Ampara.

The incident was triggered by a rumour that a certain eatery was serving food mixed with birth control pills.

The Ministers said if that were the case; it should be investigated rather than violence.

They are reported to have said that the Police would know the area people responsible for the incidents. (Kelum Bandara)
