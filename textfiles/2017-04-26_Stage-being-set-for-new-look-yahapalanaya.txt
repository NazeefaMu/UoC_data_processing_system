A prominent purohita who is said to have played a vital role behind the scenes to bring the yahapalanaya into power had a three-hour one-on-one discussion with Number One quite recently.

 


This talkative purohita who is, by the way, an official mouthpiece of the government had urged Number One to make certain ‘long overdue’ changes as part of an overall plan to set the regime on a sound footing. 


The purohita had during the lengthy discussion also mentioned several names as those they should lose no time in winning over to the government. 


Soon after this discussion, Number One had sent word to a gung ho monk residing in Narahenpita saying that he wished to meet him for a friendly chat.


A loyal supporter of the former strongman, the monk after readily accepting the invitation had had a powwow with Number One. The outcome of this meeting remains a secret, but observers say that it is quite obvious that the stage is being set for a politically significant event in the near future.
