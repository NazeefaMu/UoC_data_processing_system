Probe involving Minister pigeon-holed?


	

It was on the agenda of a very important Diyawanna committee to summon the mandarins of a key Ministry for questioning last August, but the committee has so far failed to issue the summons, they say.

 


The committee has decided to summon the Ministry mandarins to question them about a report it had received containing a long list of grave allegations of corruption against the Minister concerned.

Meanwhile, it has come to light that the errant Minister had brought pressure to bear on the chair of the committee not to proceed with their probe into the allegations.
