A Blue party state purohita often seen hobnobbing with Number One rang up a gabby Pohottuwa colleague the other day.

 

The state purohita hails from Gampaha area and the Pohottuwa one from the hill capital.


They immediately got down to talking about the treasury bond report. The state purohita told the gabby one from the hill capital. “Machang, you must appreciate that we bowled a full toss for you to hit a six.”


“Yes! yes! “Pohottuwa one readily agreed, but waited for the other to go ahead with what he proposed to say. 


“Machang, what on earth are doing? Instead of going for a smashing hit, you are targeting the bowler! Now that you have got a fine chance to come out with all guns firing at our common enemy! Don’t spare any one of them… I ‘ll tell you more things when I meet you at Diyawanna!” With that promise he rang off, they say.
