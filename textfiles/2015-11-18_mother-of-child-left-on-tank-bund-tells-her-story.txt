The mother of the three year old boy who had been abandoned near a bathing spot on the bund of the Mahakanadarawa tank in Mihintale surrendered to the Mihintale Police on Wednesday.
She confessed that her husband had left her a long time ago and that she was working on a poultry farm in Kuliyapitiya.
“I keep the child at a friend’s house in Mahakanadarawa as I cannot take him with me. I go to the place where he is staying and look into his needs every weekend. I did not leave him on the bund,” she told the police.
The woman who handed over the child to the police has also been questioned to verify the statement given by the mother.
The woman had told the police what the child’s mother said was true. “A neighbour told me that I would fall into trouble by keeping a northerner’s child. I was frightened on hearing that and handed over the child to the police saying that I found him on the bund of the Mahakanadarawa tank concealing the fact that he had been with me for a long time. I told the child to tell the police that his mother came on a bike with an uncle and left him there,” the woman said.
The woman who took care of the child had given a statement to the police saying that the child must have said so following her instructions.
The child and the two women were to be produced in the magistrate’s Court.
The villagers who had seen the child crying and alone had informed the Mihintale police who had taken him under their care.(Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)
