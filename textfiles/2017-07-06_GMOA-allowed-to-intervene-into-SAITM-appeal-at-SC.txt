The Supreme Court allowed the GMOA to intervene during the Supreme Court inquiry into the appeal filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council today.

The application was supported on Wednesday before Supreme Court Judges Buwaneika Aluvihare, Sisira De Abrew and Anil Gunaratne by President's Counsel Gamini Marapone appearing with Navin Marapana and Ravindranath Dabare on behalf of the the Government Medical Officers Association

The GMOA had earlier sought the Supreme Court’s permission to intervene into the Appeal filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) contending the judgment of Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal ruled following a trial that the petitioner in that case a SAITM University student who had graduated in MBBS was entitled to register as an MBBS qualified medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.

The GMOA and several medical students challenging the Appeal Court order sought the SC’s permission to intervene into the appeal.

The SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgment dated January 31, 2017 by Court of Appeal and an interim order to stay the functioning the judgment made by the Court of Appeal in the writ application.

The Court of Appeal after inquiring a writ petition filed by a student of SAITM on January 31 ruled that she SAITM was empowered to grant MBBS degrees. (Farook Thajudeen)
