Turn heads with your festive style

Play with palazzos or go for the Boho look. There’s lots you can experiment with when it comes to your style.
You can make heads turn this festive season by donning a maxi skirt with ganji or sporting a denim look, says an expert. Carlton D’Souza, Myntra LookGood Advisor, has shared some innovative styling tips:
Try the Boho look: Pair your tube top with a mirror-work jacket. To glam it up, wear it with dhoti pants.
Go with denim: You can draw even more attention to your style by wearing a kamarband on your waist. The fusion of Indo-western is sure to make you stand apart from the crowd. A tight high bun and bright red lipstick would add to the look.
Play with palazzos: Remember those palazzo pants that have come to your rescue so many times? Time to sway in them yet again with another look. Use your colourful bandhani dupatta as a tube top. Wear chunky costume jewellery and look your stylish best.
Sport maxi skirt and ganji: You can even flaunt your skirts with a funky ganji or racerback top.
Opt for sarongs: Wear it as a tube dress and jazz it up with high heels and anklets for an ethnic finish. Try shararas with short kurta: Wear it with your short kurta and a colourful bandhani.
