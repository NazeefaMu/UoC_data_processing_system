UNP back benchers today urged the party leadership to suspend State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran from her portfolio and suspend her from the party.

UNP MPs Thushara Indunil Amarasena, Chaminda Wijesiri and Hesha Withanage told the media they had already requested the party leadership to take action against Ms Maheswaran. “We are ashamed to be in Parliament with Ms. Maheswaran and therefore we urge the party leader to take action against her,” MP Amarasena said, adding that she had acted against the State by making this statement.

MP Wijesiri said the unruly behaviour of joint opposition MPs in the House yesterday even after Speaker assured them he would take action against Ms Maheswaran was unacceptable.

“The unruly behaviour by JO MPs can have dangerous consequences, as it could arouse extremism in the minds of people in the North. The JO has made an attempt to cover up the allegations made against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa by the New York Times. The JO which has become helpless after the NYT story is trying to highlight the Maheswaran incident to cover their sins,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
