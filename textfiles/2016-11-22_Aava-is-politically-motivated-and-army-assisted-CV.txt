Aava is politically motivated and army-assisted: CV


	

Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran said today the gangsters who call themselves the ‘Aava’ group operating in the North is ‘politically-motivated and army-assisted’.

He told a news conference in Colombo that the group did not originate from among the Tamil community per se.

Mr. Wigneswaran said he was speaking to the media on behalf of his Tamil People's Council formed with the backing of the Jaffna-based civil society to advocate the rights of Tamils.

He said the police had been directed to get to the bottom of this problem. (Kelum Bandara)
