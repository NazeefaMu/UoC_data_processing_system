We hope that our regular readers may remember that we explained the significance of the Basic Numbers from 1 to 9 in some previous articles.


When we discussed the significance of the Basic Numbers from 1 to 9 in the previous articles, we explained the qualities each Basic Number from 1 to 9 represents and their affinity to each other and the planets in Astrology they represent.

 


If the numerical value of your name corresponds to a number  which is not favourable,  you can change its numerical value to a value that is favourable to you...


 


Now we are to discuss the significance of numbers beyond 9 in relation to their numerical and vibrational value which we have 


already discussed. If the numerical value of your name corresponds to a number  which is not favourable,  you can change its numerical value to a value that is favourable to you by modifying the spelling of the name by adding or removing an innocuous letter.
