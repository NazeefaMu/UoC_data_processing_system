SLFP dissidents: CC to decide on necessary action


	

If the 16 SLFP disidents continue to sabotage the SLFP, the party’s central committee decide on the steps to be taken about them before the SLFP’s annual convention to be held in October, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.

He told reporters that he did not know how many members still remain in this group because the numbers steadily declining.

“Former minister Dayasiri Jayasekara is not with the group now. Former deputy speaker Thilanga Sumathipala closely associates with party leader and President, Maithripala Sirisena. Several others are also not supporting the group. But there are a few who have their feet in both camps and criticize the SLFP led by the President. They are also hoping to bring the SLPP and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to power. The SLFP cannot take anymore of this. Therefore, I believe the CC will take a decision on the traitors," the minister said.

He said a recent survey conducted by the SLFP revealed that certain disidents had done nothing in their respective constituencies or districts to promote, organize or strengthen the party and as such the CC would have take this into account and appoint new electoral and district organizers as the party had to face three crucial elections soon.

“For years they have failed to work as party organizers but worked for the benefit of the SLPP,” the minister said.

Responding to a journalist on what would happen if the delimitation report was not passed in Parliament, he said the Speaker could appoint a five-member parliamentary committee chaired by Prime Minister to review the delimitation report and make recommendations to Parliament in two months enabling the Elections Commission to conduct polls to 6 PCs next year under the old PR system.

“However, if Parliament approves the delimitation report on Friday, many of the obstacles would disappear,” the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
