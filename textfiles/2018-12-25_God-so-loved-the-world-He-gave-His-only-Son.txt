‘For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son
That whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.’
St. John 3:16
Choosing that ideal gift for someone you care   
Can be a daunting task no doubt, yet you dare   
For tis the season for gifting and 
much celebration   
But the greatest gift of them all is in the Incarnation   
Where the Word was made flesh for mankind’s salvation   
May you reflect on this Loving Act of God this Christmas   
And celebrate the season with true joy and true happiness   
HAVE YOURSELF A BLESSED CHRISTMAS
A GRACE-FILLED AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR…. 

 

M. Joseph A. Nihal Perera
