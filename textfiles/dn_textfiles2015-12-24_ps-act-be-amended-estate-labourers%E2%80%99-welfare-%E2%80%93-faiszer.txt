PS Act to be amended for estate labourers’ welfare – Faiszer

The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry has decided to amend the Pradeshiya Sabha Act to benefit the welfare of estate labourers. According to present legal conditions it is not possible to use Pradeshiya Sabha funds to supply public services to estate settlements, Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He said that this fact had been brought to the notice of the President by MPs P. Digambaram and Mano Ganeshan. Accordingly, Article No. 15 of Act 1987 is to be amended, Minister Musthapha said, and will be presented to Parliament once Cabinet approval is given.
