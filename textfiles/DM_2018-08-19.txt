Asian Games: Indonesia police kill dozens in criminal crackdown
	
Indonesian police have fatally shot dozens of "petty criminals" in the lead up the 2018 Asian Games, rights group Amnesty International says, BBC reported.
The group condemned the deaths, calling for an investigation into the "shoot first and ask questions later policy".
At least 77 people have reportedly been shot dead since January, Amnesty said, with 31 deaths in police raids meant to clean up host cities for the Games.
Authorities have said that people were shot after resisting the police.
The raids began in July with high-ranking officials telling their officers "don't hesitate to take firm action", the BBC's Indonesian service reported.
The two-week-long Asian Games, which starts on Saturday, will take place in the capital Jakarta and the South Sumatran city of Palembang.
Authorities are deploying 100,000 police and soldiers for the 18th annual event, which will see some 17,000 athletes compete between 18 August and 2 September in the largest multi-sporting event outside of the Olympics.
"The authorities promised to improve security for all. Instead, we have seen the police shooting and killing dozens of people with almost zero accountability for the deaths," head of Amnesty Indonesia, Usman Hamid, said.
"The hosting of an international sporting event must not come at the price of abandoning human rights."
The killings peaked in the first half of July, when 11 people were shot dead in greater Jakarta and 41 others shot in the legs.
The total number of those killed and accused of petty crimes in 2018 represents a 64% increase on the same period in 2017.
"These shocking figures reveal a clear pattern of unnecessary and excessive force by the police," Mr Hamid said in a statement.
Thousands of people have been arrested and hundreds detained in an effort to ensure the safety of visiting tourists, according National Police Chief General Tito Karnavian.
"In the last month... I have ordered my personnel to finish off all networks of pick-pockets and bag-snatchers," he told reporters in late July.
"If [criminals] fight back, don't hesitate. Finish them off," General Karnavian said.
The police operation is expected to end with the Games, but many people on the streets of Jakarta would not be opposed to the drive continuing, BBC Indonesian's Heyder Affan reports.
"I agree with the police action because it's [otherwise] very dangerous for the people," said one resident in the capital's old town.

Kofi Annan death: World leaders honour former UN chief
	
World figures have been paying tribute to former UN secretary-general and Nobel laureate Kofi Annan, who has died at the age of 80.
Current UN chief Antonio Guterres hailed him as "a guiding force for good" and Russian President Vladimir Putin described a "remarkable person".
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said Kofi Annan was a visionary leader whose work reshaped international efforts to ensure peace and stability across the world. Generations to come will benefit from his hard work.
Ex-US President Barack Obama said Annan had always pursued "a better world".
The Ghanaian national served as UN chief from 1997 to 2006 and is the only black African ever to hold the post.
Since then he has served as the UN special envoy for Syria, leading efforts to find a solution to the conflict.
The career diplomat died in hospital in the Swiss city of Bern. He had been living near Geneva for several years.
He "passed away peacefully on Saturday after a short illness", the Kofi Annan Foundation said.
He was a "deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world", the statement added.
Mr Guterres led the tributes to his predecessor. "In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination," he said in a statement.
UN high commissioner for human rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a tweet he was grief-stricken over Annan's death:
Mr Obama, the first African American to win the White House, said: "Long after he had broken barriers, Kofi never stopped his pursuit of a better world."
President Putin said the memory of Annan would "forever live in the hearts of Russians".
Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi said "the world has lost not only a great African diplomat and humanitarian but also a conscience keeper of international peace and security".
