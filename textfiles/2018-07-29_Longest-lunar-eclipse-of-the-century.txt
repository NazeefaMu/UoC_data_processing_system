Longest lunar eclipse of the century


	



Sri Lankans on Friday (27) night experienced the longest total lunar eclipse of the 21st Century which lasted six hours and 14 minutes. The eclipse started at 10.44 p.m. standard local time on the Esala Full Moon (Poya) Day, when the moon entered into the penumbra - the less dark shadow of the earth, and ended up at 4.58 a.m. early Saturday (28).

The very rare occasion was caught on our cameras from Colombo. Pix by Kushan Pathiraja
