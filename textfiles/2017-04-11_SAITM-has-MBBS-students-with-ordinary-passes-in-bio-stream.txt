There are MBBS students at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) with only three ordinary passes in the biology stream at the GCE (A/L), SAITM said today.

SAITM Registrar Husni Hussain told the Daily Mirror that these students had joined SAITM prior to the gazetting of the minimum standards by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) in August 2011.

“In 2011, the SLMC laid down the minimum standards for the private education sector as two credit passes and an ordinary pass. Till then we have enlisted students only with three ordinary passes. There are several students in three batches at SAITM with three ordinary passes for GCE (A/L),” she said.

Ms. Hussain said SAITM was enlisting students for the MBBS degree programme with minimum two credit passes and an ordinary pass since 2011 up to present and were willing to do so even in the future.

However, the SLMC has recently announced that the minimum qualification for student admission to a Government or Private medical college should be at least two credit passes and an ordinary pass in the biology stream at the GCE (A/L), according to the minimum standards prepared by them.
