	Former UPFA Parliamentarian Sajin de Vass Gunawardane today filed a motion requesting the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court to grant him permission to go abroad to seek medical treatment.
	Gunawardene, who has a court case against him for not revealing his assets, was banned from leaving the country following a court case filed by the Bribery Commission.
	After considering the request, Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya yesterday issued notice on Bribery Commission officials to appear before the Court today (20) in order to consider the Gunawardane’s request. (Nirangi Abeywickreme)
