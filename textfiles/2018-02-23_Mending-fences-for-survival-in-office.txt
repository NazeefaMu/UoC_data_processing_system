Mending fences for survival in office


	



 

This gabby one, the political head of a province, during the recent local polls, derided a new upcoming political party likening it to a flower bud destined to wither out before it could bloom. However, making a U-turn soon after the polls, he had sought an audience with the leader of the party he had disparaged, they say.

 


It is a fact obvious to all and sundry that this politico who was placed fourth on the preference list at the PC polls, depends on the pro-flower bud members of the council for his survival in his high office. 
The politico who had hitched his political wagon to the Maithri- star has now gone jittery with the imminent ouster staring in his face. 


Meanwhile, a flower-bud member in the council is said to have already announced that if the politico dare approached him, he would show him the door with a kick in his pants!
