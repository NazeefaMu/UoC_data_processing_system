The Finance Ministry sources revealed that within 10 months of this year a sum of R. 50 milliion had been obtained by the chairman of the Lotteries Board , directors and other managers as a special allowance during the process of selecting the winners.

This allowance had been paid for the top management for taking part in the telecast of the lottery draw.
From January to October in this year the Chairman of the lottery board and six directors had obtained about Rs. 8 million. One director had refused to take this allowance and he had donated a sum of Rs. 100,000 to an employee of the board who does not own a house.
It is transpired that a similar system does not exist in the development lottery office and the finance ministry is considering to introduce a new system when the lottery winners are selected.
