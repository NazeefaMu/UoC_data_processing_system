UNP parliamentarian Mujibur Rahuman said today there was suspicion whether some SLFP ministers with the connivance of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa were conspiring against the Government.

He said some of the SLFP Ministers were attempting stir up trouble between UNP and President Maithripala Sirisena by making controversial statements.

“We have reasonable doubts whether some SLFP Ministers are conspiring against the government while others are supporting Mr. Rajapaksa while being in the opposition," Mr. Rahuman said and added that the SLFP ministers were blaming the UNP and the Prime Minister when strikes were launched.

“The UNP and the SLFP joined together to form a national government not because we did not have options or the UNP is weak but we wanted to develop the country. They claimed that the UNP has an agreement with Basil Rajapaksa to divide the SLFP. We do not have any such agreement. If we wanted to divide the SLFP we could have joined some SLFPers and formed a government,” he told a news conference.

Mr. Rahaman said the Government had ensured democracy, media freedom, set up independent commissions and won over the international community but some SLFP ministers were trying to destroy the initiatives taken by this government.

He challenged the SLFP ministers who were criticizing the government to leave the government and added that the Government would not be toppled even if they did so.

“There is a good understanding between the President and the Prime Minister. Most of those who criticize the government were appointed through the national list. They can criticize the government within the Cabinet or at group meetings without acting in media shows,” Mr. Rahaman said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
