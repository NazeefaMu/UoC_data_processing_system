Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane today asked in parliament why the government had ignored the international warning about the recent tropical storm issued three days ahead of the impending disaster.

He said the government agencies had only issued an advisory to the fishing community.

"This has not only dealt a severe blow to the people and the economy but had also tarnished the country's reputation among the tourist industry and the industrial and commercial sectors," the MP said.

He said the tropical storm had resulted in 14 people killed and several houses and power lines damaged or destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people displaced or homeless.

The MP said the government had not carried out its duty properly in this crisis situation and asked why the people were left in the dark about the impending disaster.

He asked what action the government would take to face future storms.

House Leader and Minister, Lakshman Kiriella said international agencies had not warned of stormy weather between of November 28 and 30 and had predicted that the atmospheric disturbance would result in a storm which was some 400 miles away from Sri Lanka towards West.

He said Meteorology Department had issued weather warnings to naval and fishing communities at the proper time which had prevented a huge disaster.

"We would have had to face a huge disaster if the fishing community was not informed about the strong winds and rough seas," the minister said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
