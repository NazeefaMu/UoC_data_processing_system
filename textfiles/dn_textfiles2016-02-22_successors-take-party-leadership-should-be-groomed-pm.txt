Successors to take on party leadership should be groomed - PM

A political party needs to groom a line of successors to take on the leadership and I was the third tier or spare wheel to the UNP leadership when President J R Jayewardenae was the party leader, admitted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the United National Party's Ministers, Members of Parliament, Provincial Councillors, past and present members of Local Government Institutions and organizers of the Matara District at the SANASA auditorium in Nupe last Friday (19). The meeting was convened by the UNP leader to enlighten the districts' UNPers of the newly formed national government's development plans for the Southern Province.
Earlier, the Prime Minister together with Ministers and Members of Parliament representing the Galle, Matara, Hambantota and Moneragala districts, met with government officials at the District Secretariat in Matara to enlighten them on the intended development in the south. The PM also met members of the Matara Bar Association at the Nildiya Hotel.
"President J R Jayewardene who became the leader of the United National Party in 1973 and then Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in 1977, groomed a successor, a second tier and even a third tier to take on the leadership of the party. At that time it was former Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa who was to succeed him as the party leader and ministers Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake were next in line, while I was the third tier. It was like a three wheeler of which former Prime Minister Premadasa was the front wheel while Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayaka were the rear wheels and I was the spare wheel! With the unfortunate demise of the two side wheels and the front wheel, I who was the spare wheel had led the party for the past twenty years. It is important to have a successor, a second, third and even a fourth tier to lead the party and hold it together at times of crisis."
"We have entered a new era by forming a national government with the leader of the SLFP as the president and me as prime minister of the nation. The people are disgusted of the never ending political tug of war between political parties in the past and expect this national government comprising of the two main political parties to develop the nation and I wish to assure you that this government will take all steps to fulfill the aspirations of the people within the next five years as promised."
"It is after eleven years that we have come back to power and during that time which was a most trying period, we have been able to safeguard the unity of the party and not let it splinter. We have to help those who stood by us when we were in the opposition and helped us regain power. We have to help those youth that have been politically victimized. We have to provide employment for the youth and we expect to create employment opportunities for one million youth within the next five years."
"As a national government is formed by parties that hold conflicting views and hence we together with opposition party have agreed to work within a framework of principles. Although we cannot change things overnight, we will fulfill the aspirations of the people," Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged.
