Sri Lanka’s Ambassador in Beijing, Ranjith Uyangoda yesterday rejected reports that he had come to Sri Lanka for the election campaign and said he was in Kandy for his mother’s alms giving on leave approved by the External Affairs Ministry.
Earlier, reports said several Sri Lankan diplomats who had arrived here to monitor the presidential election left the country on Sunday and Ambassador Uyangoda was one among them.
“I came to Sri Lanka on January 3 to attend my mother’s second death anniversary alms giving held on January 4 and 5 in Kandy on leave approved by the EAM Secretary,” Mr. Uyangoda said and added that he did not take part in any election-related activities.
