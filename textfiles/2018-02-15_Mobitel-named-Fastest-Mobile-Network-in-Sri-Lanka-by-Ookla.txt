Ookla® has declared the National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel, its Speedtest Award Winner for having the Fastest MobileNetwork in Sri Lanka. Speedtest Awards are licensed to Internet Service Providers and mobile carriers around the world that are determined by Ookla to be the fastest in their market. Sri Lanka’s Award was determined using a proprietary methodology of Ookla’s analysis of Speedtest® results from Q3–Q4 2017

In the 2017 Speedtest Awards, the awards for top providers in speed are determined using a Speed Score that incorporates a measure of each provider’s download and upload speed to rank network speed performance. Adding upload speeds is a new addition this year with awards from past years focusing on download speed only. 

Commenting on the recognition, Nalin Perera, CEO of Mobitel said ‘Winning the Ookla awards affirms Mobitel’s commitment to deliver optimal benefits to our valued customers to enjoy being on the fastest and best network in Sri Lanka. This prestigious recognition from a well renowned international body is something that is rewarding to the organization for its commitment and dedication to ensure that customer expectations are met. Mobitel has built the infrastructure to meet these expectations and will continue to invest in enhancing all aspects of the network in the months ahead to enhance the overall user experience to world-class standards’.

Mobitel dominates rival networks in the country in terms of network speed on broadband to emerge No. 1 in the industry. Mobitel 4G LTE technology offers users the superior experience of enjoying high definition streaming videos and Multimedia Online Gaming (MMOG).  Mobitel also recently enhanced its 4G LTE network coverage by innovatively deploying its existing 900MHz spectrum. This initiative is Sri Lanka’s first such deployment, thus significantly enhancing Sri Lanka’s 4G LTE coverage and LTE MIMO technology, making Mobitel the No.1 network in Sri Lanka.

The Speedtest Award is decided using Q3–Q4 2017 Speedtest results from Ookla – a popular independent internet testing tool used by millions of consumers around the world every day. It is published on http://www.speedtest.net/awards/lk/carrier/2017 for further information.
