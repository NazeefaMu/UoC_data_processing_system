Asian medalist and International acclaimed athlete Sriyani Kulawansa has been enrolled to the Health and Physical Education (BEd) degree at the National Institute of Education (NIE) ignoring the routine enrollment procedures Daily Mirror learned.
The three year course which was suspended for some time had been re-launched last year and the lectures were started on November 24, 2017.
According to sources Ms. Kulawansa has applied for the said degree after the enrollments were closed.
When contacted, NIE Director General Dr. Jayanthi Gunasekara acknowledged that Mrs. Kulawansas application was submitted after the deadline and since she was a national athlete her application was directed NIE Council for consideration.
The council after the evaluation procedures, instructed me to change the existing regulations and enroll Ms Kulawansa for the course. I have sought the permission of both the Education Minister and the Secretary over the matter. I do not wish to elaborate further as I have followed the proper procedures, she said.
According to the NIE sources, Ms. Kulawansa had not sat for the entrance examination or the physical fitness examination prior to the commencement of course. She was enrolled at the NIE under the recommendations made by the NIE council considering her contributions to the country.
Ms. Kulawansa had attended the lectures over the weekend after she was informed by the NIE to do so on Friday.
However, the students who are following this course had protested against the move, stating that its a violation of course regulations.
We admit that she is a prominent athlete. Due to late enrollment she will not be able to complete 80 percent attendance. Though she is a medalist special concessions cannot be granted. All the students should be treated equally, a concerned student who wanted to remain anonymous said.
According to our sources, the students were told by the NIE officials to welcome Ms. Kulawansa or leave the class if they oppose the decision.
They had left the class room after the decision.
Commenting over the matter Ms. Kulawansa said that she applied for the degree following the Education Ministry informed her to do so.

Dr. De Silva pulls out from Investors Forum in London
	
State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr Harsha de Silva has pulled out from speaking at an Investors Forum to be held in at the London Stock Exchange on October 8, in a move to help cut the demand at the margin in the face of rapid rupee depreciation.
When contacted, the State Minister said he was supposed to speak at the London Stock Exchange next week in an Investors Forum.
But I pulled out and declined to go because I wanted to do whatever I can, from my end, to help manage the current situation. There are other officials going and they can fill my void, he said.
When asked about the Finance Ministrys decision to take a number of temporary measures to ease the pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee, he said this was what he also said in his recent Facebook post.
He said he simply requested those who can, to take temporary measures to ease the situation and not to prevent measures altogether.
Not only Sri Lanka, other countries have also taken such measure to deal with the situation. Even the US, when it was facing the financial meltdown some years ago, took measures on a temporary basis. The US Government stepped in and in some cases, took over some of the private companies. Today, India has taken such measures, Malaysia too, he said.
He commended Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera for the temporary steps he has taken instead of putting up taxes on the imports.
Minister Samaraweera has balanced a difficult situation. We need to liberalize the economy by removing para-tariffs and various non-tariff barriers. From the last year budget, para-tariffs of about 1,000 items were removed and many more to be removed in this budget. Instead of imposing these tariffs, what he has done is found a way to temporary reduce the demand by bringing in measures which he can put and take off as soon as possible without upsetting the liberalization process. The key point is that the liberalization process continues. Given this temporary sudden situation which has arisen due to external factors, the minister has decided to do this, he said.
Meanwhile, he said he will push for his view on letting the overnight rate rise in order to deal with the situation.
If we let the overnight rate rise at the Central Bank, there will be an across the board dampening of demand on imports. That also should come in now in order to deal with this temporarily. Our exports should be increased in order to come out of this issue. Because of falling exports and the inability to earn dollars to pay for our increasing imports, we have got into large foreign debts. Now we have to pay this US dollar debt for the next years, essentially due to the high cost payments of the international sovereign bonds issued by the previous government, he said.
Commenting on the upcoming tourist season, Dr. De Silva said we should seize the opportunity to increase the influx of US dollars.
In a very short time, the tourist season is coming up. Everybody is talking about Sri Lankan tourism. We have to expand services and we must take the opportunity to increase the expenditure of arriving tourists, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sanga urges Mathews, Hathurusingha to sort out their differences
	
The rift that presently exists between Angelo Mathews and coach Chandika Hathurusingha must be repaired as soon as possible, so that Mathews can return to the ODI side quickly, the former Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara has said.
Hathurusingha and Mathews have been at odds in the past week, with Mathews expressing surprise that Hathurusingha would play a part in removing him from the captaincy as well as drop him from the team, only 10 months after Hathurusingha had asked him to take up the limited-overs leadership.
The coach, meanwhile, has explained why he and the selectors had chosen to omit Mathews from the side, drawing attention to Mathews' supposed lack of fitness, and his poor record in running between the wickets.
Sangakkara, who has been a long time advocate of Mathews and has also repeatedly stated his admiration for Hathurusingha as a coach, says the two need to patch things up as soon as possible, for the good of the Sri Lanka side. Dinesh Chandimal, the new ODI captain, may have a role to play as well.
"I think this breakdown of communication needs to be sorted quickly," Sangakkara told ESPNcricinfo. "It needs to be sorted through direct, honest and clear conversations between captain, the management and the player concerned.
They need to make sure, also, that the public also has the right idea of why this decision has been taken, especially at an emotional time. What they have to be careful is that it's not a knee-jerk reaction to the team's performance at the Asia Cup, but it's actually a worthwhile decision for the side.
"But I really think that with Hathurusingha's strategy, Angelo will find himself back in the side very soon."Mathews has not been omitted from Sri Lanka's Test squad, so will need to work with Hathurusingha in November when Sri Lanka play England in three Tests, in any case. But for Sangakkara, Mathews is vital to Sri Lanka's ODI side as well.
Though Mathews has temporarily given up bowling in limited-overs matches, due to a slew of leg injuries, he should resume his role as an allrounder, said Sangakkara.
"Angelo's performances in the past suggest that he's a player of great value to the side. I think it's very important to get Angelo bowling again. I think it does his confidence a lot of good. It does the Sri Lankan side a lot of good.
And whoever is captain - whether it's Angelo or Dinesh Chandimal - it gives them a lot of options to use a multi-skilled cricketer in different situations. All of that is going to be absolutely vital to their chances at the World Cup."
Mathews' running between the wickets has especially come into focus, after Hathurusingha suggested the number of run-outs Mathews had been involved in was a "world record", though perhaps what he meant was that Mathews had run out too many of his batting partners.
Sangakkara, however, who frequently batted with Mathews during his own career, said he did not consider Mathews to be a poor runner between the wickets, but suggested Sri Lanka would reduce the number of run-outs they suffered if they fielded a consistent top order.
"The running is not a stat that I've really looked at - I wasn't the best runner between the wickets either," Sangakkara said. "I think that in a batting line-up where you've batted in the same positions consistently, communication improves between batsmen.
They understand each other's games, and understand how the other batsman runs, and how they react to quick singles or turning back for a second or a third.
One of the things you seen when you have bad running between the wickets is bad communication - maybe a player doesn't know what his partner is looking for in terms of gaps and singles. That's another reason I think Sri Lanka needs to very quickly settle down with a consistent batting line-up."
If Mathews does eventually make it back into the Sri Lanka ODI side, Sangakkara would prefer to see him in a different batting role. "For me, looking at the World Cup, I think Angelo needs to be batting higher up the order, at No. 4. I think he should take a lot of responsibility in defining innings, especially with two new balls in play. He has the ability to do that."ESPN Cricinfo.

US sanctions on Iran-- More economic issues to SL: PM
	
Sri Lanka might face more economic issues when the US sanctions on Iran comes to be effective in November this year as Sri Lankas tea exports to that country may become vulnerable, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe said over the weekend.
The Prime Minister said this during the opening of Wanathawilluwa Police Station in Puttalam on Saturday.
We will have to be vigilant in November this year as the US economic sanctions on Iran is going to be effective then. We will have to see what steps we should take then. It is not clear whether we will be able to export tea to USA, the Prime Minister said.
Sri Lanka is facing double trouble as a result of the global economic crisis because of its debt services. We will have to pay $ 3000 million this year and $ 4000 million in 2019. Sri Lanka went into for borrowings in 2008 instead of going for foreign investments. These were proposed by former Central Bank Governor. I warned the previous government several times. However, they said US economy will never come up. Government revenue was hardly sufficient to settle the debts" the Prime Minister said.
He said that the previous government was trying to control the rupee but was not successful and it decided to go for elections. "We inherited this debt. We managed to bring the economy to a position where we could settle the debt but we then faced natural disasters. Government was compelled to increase VAT. We were heavily criticized. This is natural. Then we got caught to the global economic crisis, he added.
He said the government has decided to curtail imports as other affected countries have done. We will curtail our imports as of now but will have to take more steps later. We cannot spend the time criticizing the previous regime. I can criticize the previous regime continuously for 24 hours if the economic crisis can be resolved by doing that. However, the economic crisis cannot be resolved by criticizing the last government. We have to take steps, he said while stating that Finance Minister and the government top brass will inform the people on what steps would be taken to resolve the crisis, he said in this regard.
State Minister Palitha Range Bandara who also spoke related how he was politically victimized when serving in the police. He recalled how he had to file action against the then Deputy Minister of Defence Anuruddha Ratwatte. This case he said is now referred to in the training course designed for police officers. Also he said the government should mete out justice to the people in Anamaduwa which was subjected to several attacks by the LTTE during the war. (Yohan Perera and Hiran Priyangkara Jayasinghe)
