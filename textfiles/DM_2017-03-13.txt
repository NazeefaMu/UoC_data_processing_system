## Title: Chiles Schindler

Chiles Schindler
	
During 18 years of brutal military rule under Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a brave man saved between 25,000-35,000 people from torture, prison and death. But Roberto Kozak, who died in September 2016 wasnt even Chilean. He was Argentinian and was belatedly awarded citizenship by Chile last year. 

Tall, strikingly handsome and immaculately dressed, Kozak has been compared to Oskar Schindler, the German businessman who saved 1,200 Jewish lives during World War II. Emilio Barbarani, an Italian diplomat in Santiago who worked with Kozak, sees a parallel between the two men. As he puts it: Roberto was a success with girls. He was well-dressed, well-paid. He did not need to take political risks. It was not his job to do this. He did it because he was courageous. 
Kozak, one of 12 siblings, was born to a poor farming family in Argentina on May 14, 1942. The family moved to Buenos Aires, where his father made his living doing odd jobs. Kozak started working in a bookshop after school when he was just nine years old. He became an avid reader and attended evening classes, eventually obtaining a degree in civil engineering from the University of Buenos Aires. After a number of technical jobs, Kozak applied for a job at the Argentinian office of the International Committee for European Migration (ICEM), created in 1951 to help WWII refugees. Now known as the International Organisation for Migration, this body has 165 member countries and comes under the umbrella of the United Nations. 


"Roberto undertook a great task but he did not do it alone. He was part of a network. He would have considered it egocentric to claim responsibility"

In 1970, Kozak was sent for diplomatic training in Germany and then to study English in England. After a stint in Geneva, he was transferred to Chile. Eleven months after his arrival in Santiago, on September 11, 1973, General Pinochet launched his coup against the elected socialist government of President Salvador Allende. 
The coup wasnt unexpected. But the military juntas brutal crackdown on all opposition shocked many in Chile and around the world. Pinochet, who believed Marxism to be the root cause of all evil, targeted anyone with left-wing views or sympathies. But dragged into this bloody net were students, journalists, priests, musicians and even foreigners suspected of helping the opposition. Between 1973-78, about 70,000 people were detained, of whom an estimated 30,000 were tortured and approximately 3,500 killed. The most notorious of Pinochets detention centres was Villa Grimaldi, a remote farmhouse near Santiago. 
Roberto Kozak
Run by the notorious Major Marcelo Moren Brito of Dina, Chiles secret police, it had around 4,500 detainees, most of whom were brutally tortured. Among them were the parents of Michelle Bachelet, who is now President of Chile. Her father, an air force general who supported Allende, died under torture. Michelle Bachelet too was tortured but later released along with her mother. 
Rodrigo del Villar, a geography student, was tortured at Villa Grimaldi. In 1976, Kozak managed to secure his release. As Villar later told an interviewer: If he had not got me out Quite simply, we would not be having this conversation now. 
Kozak took enormous risks but he did not do it alone. He had a network of helpers ranging from foreign diplomats to Catholic human rights organizations such as the Vicariate of Solidarity. A modest man, he believed in teamwork and even his son did not know until many years later precisely what his father was doing during those dark and terrible years under Pinochet. As his widow Sylvia put it: Roberto undertook a great task but he did not do it alone. He was part of a network. He would have considered it egocentric to claim responsibility. He felt his task was important but he never took centre stage. He placed great value on teamwork. 


"Rodrigo del Villar, a geography student, was tortured at Villa Grimaldi. In 1976, Kozak managed to secure his release. As Villar later told an interviewer: If he had not got me out Quite simply, we would not be having this conversation now"

But he was more conspicuous than the rest of the network because of his looks, his energy and his busy schedule. In 1986, when the worst seemed to be over, an ultra right-wing death squad of Pinochet loyalists raided Kozaks office. Calling him a communist son of a bitch, he was made to answer questions at gunpoint after his co-workers were tied and trussed up on the floor. 
Kozaks incredible luck held again. They were looking for hidden weapons because left-wing guerillas had attempted to kill Pinochet five days ago. Unable to connect Kozak to the assassination attempt or to find weapons, they left without killing anyone. As one staff member later recalled: He was green. It was a colour between yellow, white and green. But poker-faced, he went downstairs, calmly called Geneva to inform them of the raid and then went on with his work. 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet
ICEM was not a human rights set up and Kozaks superiors in Geneva were not aware of precisely what he was up to in Santiago. Kozak realized that if he was going to help Pinochets victims, he would have to take personal risks with both his life and his job. He told his fellow staffers that they should not be content with being wheels in a bureaucracy and should do whatever possible to help the coups victims. Kozaks stylish home as well as the ICEM office became clandestine places of refuge for people he had freed from military prisons.  He managed to do that with a combination of diplomacy, daring and generous amounts of whisky. Kozak held regular late night parties at home, inviting officers from the junta and secret police and befriending them. He led a double life, with released prisoners hidden in his attic while their tormentors were entertained upstairs. Discovery would have meant an unpleasant end for Kozak and his family, but he managed to get away with it. 
His second wife Sylvia recalls that he often suffered from acute stress, though he managed to look calm outwardly. Once, a death squad loyal to Pinochet raided Kozaks office after the dictator escaped an assassination attempt. 


"The man turned to Kozaks son and said: Your father saved my life"

Not all of Pinochets men were willing to put up with Kozaks humanitarian work. The secret police chief Manuel Contreras took a strong dislike to him. But even Contreras was unaware of the scale of Kozaks operation. Kozak sometimes negotiated and secured the release of scores of prisoners. 
After getting them released, Kozak had to find them safe haven abroad by persuading friendly foreign diplomats to give them visas. A released prisoner, if he or she remained in Chile, always risked being arrested again. To prevent those freed from being instantly re-arrested, Kozak personally took them from the detention centre to his home or office and hid them there till a foreign visa was obtained, a process which could take several months. Once that was done, he would escort them to the airport and all the way to the waiting airliner. 

Kozak knew that Pinochets men did not respect his diplomatic immunity and counted on the contacts he had with junta members, hoping the goodwill would hold. Getting Pinochets top men to drink, Kozak would ask them to sign expulsion orders for detainees. The ICEMs drivers worked late into the night as Kozaks waiters. As one staff member recalled: the whiskey was very importantwhile Roberto was having a party for the military officials in his house, there would be refugees and political prisoners hiding in the attic. He was always playing with fire. 
Kozak daringly went all the way to the top, meeting Pinochet himself in 1978. He told Pinochet the same thing he told his late-night military guests  Chiles international reputation was suffering because of its human rights record. But, if Pinochet agreed to release more political prisoners, Kozak would tell the press that the regime was at last working to improve its human rights record. 
Living this double life, Kozak became heavily stressed. His wife said later that her husband suffered both due to personal risk and the tortures he saw being inflicted on people almost everyday and he was not always successful in getting his protgs out of Chile. Some were arrested again and killed. 


In 1992, Chile awarded Kozak its highest honour, the Order of Bernardo OHiggins. But Kozak was always modest about his achievement. While attending the opening of Chiles human rights museum in 2010, his son Nikolai saw a man step up through the crowd to his father. Both began to cry. 
The man turned to Kozaks son and said: Your father saved my life. 
I then realized my father was not the man I thought he was, Nikolai said.

ETCA: SL seeks new date, Delhi yet to confirm
	
The Government had sought fresh dates at the end of this month for another round of discussions on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) to be signed with India, an official said yesterday.
Already, three rounds of talks have been conducted at officials level between the two sides. The last was in January in Sri Lanka.
Secretary to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade Chandani Wijewardane told the Daily Mirror the next round could be conducted in New Delhi.
We have sought dates for talks towards the end of this month. New Delhi is yet to confirm the dates. We will have it hopefully in April, she said.
Alongside, she said there would be parallel negotiations for Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with the countries such as Singapore and China. She added the Government intended to finalise trade negotiations on ETCA this year.
"Nothing has been finalised yet. Only the initial texts of the agreement are being discussed," she said.
A Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and India has been already in operation since 2000.
However, the trade balance has grown heavily in favour of India. Sri Lankan exporters complain that bottlenecks in the Indian bureaucratic system and other non-tariff barriers have stifled trade with India even under the current agreement.
The Indian side argues that most of its exports to Sri Lanka are channeled outside the FTA, and therefore the FTA could not be blamed for the widening trade gap. (Kelum Bandara)

Participating in a ceremony to distribute land deeds to the people in Uva Wellassa he said there was a lot of criticism directed towards the government.
While watching news on television in the evening under this given media freedom, people who associates with me closely, say this government will fall tomorrow but this is not something that will happen, the President said and added that it would only disappoint the people who are waiting for this government to collapse because it would never happen.
The government will complete its term it was elected for and we will resolve the issues of the people. We will face the next election and also develop the country in the meantime, he said.

The meeting that was attended by the Finance Minister where Central Bank Chief Executive Officers and primary dealers also asked to be present, three weeks after I received a phone call from Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to accept a bid for Rs. 10 billion was an abnormal occurrence, said Superintendent of the Public Debt Department of the Central Bank Ms. U.L Muthugala, giving evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate the Issuance of Central Bank Treasury Bonds.
When Mr. Mahendran informed me over the phone to accept the Rs.10 billion bid, I was compelled to follow his instructions, Ms. Muthugala said.
Replying to a question posed by the Commission Judge Prasanna Jayawardena she said during her long service at the Public Debt Department no former governor had visited her section and spoken to officials while they were doing their duty.
The acceptance of the Rs.10 billion bid also led to a turbulence in the money market, she said.
Evidence was led before the Commission comprising Supreme Court Judges K.T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Jayawardena and former Auditor General Velupille Kandasamy.

PSUNU token strike a failure: CNH Director
	
Colombo National Hospital Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe said today the token strike launched by the Public Services United Nurses Union (PSUNU) has not affected the healthcare services at the Colombo National Hospital.
The trade union action was launched today morning to urge the government to resolve the concerns of the members including salary anomalies.
Dr. Jasinghe said out of about 820 nursing staff assigned for the morning shift more than 620 reported for duty.
Although there was a slight shortage of nurses in the operating theaters, the impact was minimal, he said.
PSUNU Chairman the Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera claimed that the strike was successful with the participation of a large number of members. He rejected the statement made by the Dr. Jasinghe and said he had no knowledge about the staff.
Dr. Jasinghe is making statements without a check on the wards. He is not aware of the shortage because he doesnt visit the wards, the Thera said.
Expressing his views on the PSUNU strike, the Government Nursing Officers Association (GNOA) President Saman Rathnapriya said the strike was utterly unsuccessful.
The PSUNU has about 8,000 members. Of them 80 to 85 per cent reported to work. Base Hospitals and Teaching Hospitals in Colombo, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Kandy, Karapitiya, Batticaloa and several others were functioning more or less normally, GNOA said.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) rejected Mr. Ratnapriyas statement that it had backed the TU action.
Meanwhile, Health Ministry Deputy Director General (Admin II) Mr. Rahuman said the the TU action had not affected the daily operations, however, the ministry had forwarded the PSUNU demands to the Cabinet.
The Cabinet has referred the matter to the National Salaries and Cadres Commission. We will do our best to resolve their concerns, he said.
However, commenting on the strike Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that the token strike launched by the PSUNU was not successful and he received information that some principals of the nurses Teaching colleges have forced their students to join the protest and but failed.
He said the unions' demand to start the public health service had already been initiated. Minister Senaratne also said by now Rs. 200 million funds had been allocated to complete the shortcomings and the rest could be resolved through discussions.
Meanwhile, the minister said PSUNU leader Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera had become helpless and had launched the most unsuccessful trade union action.
The token strike is expected to end tomorrow morning. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The Malabe Medical College Parents Association (MMCPA) today handed over a letter to the Police Headquarters complaining against what they called a mud slinging poster campaign against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Speaking on the matter, the associations president Gemunu Wijeratne said some trade unions had put up these posters within the Health Ministry and around the government hospitals in order to tarnish the SAITMs image.
The SAITM is already an established institute in this country. The Court has given the ruling. We have requested the Police HeadQuarters to remove those banners and cutouts which would mislead the people, he said.
Further, he said that they had attached documents containing 94 pages including the copies of Supreme Court and Appeal Courts rulings that had recognized SAITM as a private medical college.
Mr. Wijeratne said that all authorities including the Health Minister who were silent on the matter should take the responsibility for the poster campaign as this could have stopped at the beginning, if they had been vigilant.
He also said that the Police officials assured them that they would investigate the matter and find the culprits.
He alleged that politically motivated trade unions could be behind this mud slinging campaign with a view to create a situation that could close down the SAITM. However, SAITM parents would not allow that to happen, he asserted. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SL Navy did not fire at Indian fishermen: Commander
	
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne yesterday denied allegations by Indian fishermen that the Sri Lanka Navy had opened fire on Indian fishing vessels recently.
After attending the Feast of St. Anthony's Sacred Church located on Kachchativu Island, he responded to a question raised by a journalist as to why there had been no Indian presence at the annual Feast saying Indian fishermen had boycotted the feast due to an incident where they claimed that the SL Navy had fired at an Indian fishing boat in Sri Lankan waters, which is totally false.
Mr. Wijegunaratne said that even for a warning shot is fired at a boat it has to be to receive the approval of the Navy Commander. I never authorised such a thing. We dont need to fire at them. If foreign fishermen are captured in Sri Lankan waters, the protocol is to arrest them and produce them before courts. With the technology available, any Navy officer can contact me directly. However, there is an ongoing inquiry about the incident being conducted by the Navy Deputy Chief of Staff, he said.
Mr. Wijegunaratne said that the information of the location where the boat was at when the incident took place has been requested from the Indian side but to date this information has not reached us.
We have requested the GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates of the boat when it was shot at. Thereafter we can conduct further investigations based on data in our radar system. We hope that the Indian Coast Guard would give us that information soon, he said.
The Navy Commander said that the SL Navy is presently maintaining a close relationship with the Indian Navy. He said if the shooting did take place it should have been reported to the Indian Navy and they should report it to our Navy immediately.
This years feast marked the first of its kind conducted upon the completion of the new church by the Sri Lanka Navy and Mass was conducted by Bishop of Jaffna, His Lordship Rt. Revd. Dr. Justin Bernard Gnanapragasam.
The Feast was attended by the Vicar General of the Diocese of Jaffna, Very Revd. Fr. Pathinathar Josephthas Jebaratnam, District Secretary of Jaffna, Mr. N.Vethanayahan, Commander of the Security Forces in Jaffna, Major General Mahesh Senanayake, Commander Northern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva, Jaffna Deputy Inspector General of Police Sanjeewa Dharmaratne, senior officers and a large number of fishermen. Sri Lankan Catholic devotees as well as a large number of religious dignitaries including Rev. Sisters were in attendance. (Romesh Madusanka and Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SL security forces continue to operate with impunity-Sooka
	
The executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa, and the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) Yasmin Sooka who previously served on the UN Secretary-Generals Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka alleged that Sri Lanka's security forces are still continuing to operate with impunity, even after the change in the government.
The violations and abuses are ongoing and include abductions, torture and sexual violence which the ITJP unfortunately continues to document once the victims flee the country. This level of militarisation is unacceptable eight years after the war. It also demonstrates that the security forces continue to operate with impunity, she told in an interview with -The Wire- an Indian online news publication.
Commenting on the change in the political leadership in Sri Lanka in January 2015, Sooka said the international approach towards Sri Lanka has shifted 180 degrees.
Where once there would have been intolerance and frustration with the Rajapaksas now there is patience and a willingness to give more time. In terms of the situation inside the country, clearly the atmosphere has eased and activists have more space in which to function, the Human Rights Commission has credible leadership but still lacks capacity and generally civil rights have improved in the south.
The Full interview
Would you tell us a little bit about ITJPs work
ITJP documents human rights violations and abuses as well as gathers evidence for the purposes of building a prima facie basis for criminal trials and truth recovery processes. In addition, the ITJP also carries out transitional justice work including the training of CSOs [civil society organisations]. The key elements of our documentation and evidence gathering include taking detailed witness statements from survivors of war crimes, torture, arbitrary detention, abductions and sexual violence. Our statements are supported by medico-legal reports. Typically, taking a statement may take between three and four days to complete, with statements running into many pages supported by exhibits like maps, sketches of cells and forensic reports. To date, we have taken 240 statements, which means we have one of the biggest databases of in-depth testimonies attesting to recent Sri Lankan human rights violations and abuses. The evidence gathered constitutes a basis for an independent investigation as in many instances we have identified several alleged perpetrators in the military and police. We hope one day a credible international independent investigative unit with an independent prosecutor will be set up so the people of Sri Lanka can discover the truth.
The evidence gathered also provides the basis for a submission to the truth commission in Sri Lanka if it is ever established and will expose the violations perpetrated by the security forces. Of course we have pointed out in our recent publication Putting the Wolf to Guard the Sheep that all of this also depends on witness protection for the witnesses.
Its been more than two years since Maithripala Sirisena was elected president. How much has changed in Sri Lanka since January 2015
Internationally the approach towards Sri Lanka has shifted 180 degrees. Where once there would have been intolerance and frustration with the Rajapaksas now there is patience and a willingness to give more time. In terms of the situation inside the country, clearly the atmosphere has eased and activists have more space in which to function, the Human Rights Commission has credible leadership but still lacks capacity and generally civil rights have improved in the south. However in the former conflict areas, Tamil civilians live under a militarised and securitised system in which surveillance and intimidation constitute everyday life. The violations and abuses are ongoing and include abductions, torture and sexual violence which the ITJP unfortunately continues to document once the victims flee the country. This level of militarisation is unacceptable eight years after the war. It also demonstrates that the security forces continue to operate with impunity.
In terms of fulfilling its transitional justice commitments, how would you describe the governments performance
The Sirisena government came to power amidst great hope and good will for transformation particularly from Tamil citizens who voted for this government. Shockingly we have witnessed two years of inaction. We have argued that the Sirisena government is complicit in the ongoing violations and abuses because it has done nothing to investigate the very grave allegations of system crimes set out in the [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights] OHCHR Investigation report (OISL).
The emphasis has been on procedures, rhetoric and box-ticking but what this government has failed to do is set out a clear vision of why Sri Lanka needs a transition from the past. The government has also failed to impress upon society in the south that this is necessary if Sri Lanka is to take its place proudly in the international community. The transition is necessary to transform Sri Lanka from a state mired in serious violations and abuses which quite frankly amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity in which its criminal justice institutions have been tarnished. While there is a great deal of glib talk about reconciliation; it is extremely shallow as reconciliation involves a reckoning and an acknowledgement of the truth about the past including past violations. In reality, what we have witnessed is denial from the politicians and many in civil society about the extent of mass atrocities perpetrated by the security forces. What we have is a structural and institutional problem in the country which unless addressed will result in ongoing violations and abuses as we know is happening. Reform is urgently needed for Sinhalese and Muslims as well as Tamils.
In terms of the transitional justice process, we all heralded the national consultation process which took a long time and was perceived as doing the job. When it was farmed out to NGOs we stifled our criticism. It is precisely this farming out of a function, which the government ought to have led, which has allowed the president and prime minister to disown the recommendations, leading many to ask whether the government is serious about the transition. Sadly civil society and many political parties were also duped into believing that the government was sincere in its commitments and now to their cost they are discovering differently.
Legislation establishing the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) was passed last year. However the chaos and confusion regarding the text in parliament has seen nothing happen. Six months later there is no body established. Best international practice around appointments indicate the need for a transparent vetting process for the selection of persons to run the OMP and any other transitional justice mechanism; rumours abound that the government intends to appoint mainly Sinhalese persons to head a body that will primarily deal with Tamil disappearances. Consideration should be given to appointing Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims in order to inspire confidence and trust amongst the families of the disappeared. An open nomination and vetting process would ensure that affected communities have the opportunity to nominate people they consider credible particularly those amongst them who have spent a great number of years working on issues of the disappeared. A number of Tamil activists including priests spring to mind as they have risked their lives over years to collect lists of the disappeared.
How involved should international actors be in Sri Lankas transitional justice process
Any transitional justice process, if it is to succeed, must be locally owned not by the elites and the politicians but by the victims. However decades of violations and abuses as well as disillusionment with the government and its institutions have left many, if not all Tamil victims and witnesses, deeply distrustful. Many have indicated that if they are to testify to a truth commission or court there needs to be meaningful international involvement in that body to win their trust. A credible domestic mechanism is a contradiction in terms. They have all failed; why would things be different now when whats at stake is the investigation of even greater crimes than in the past. This is compounded by the fact that no witness protection exists and whether a witness is in Sri Lanka or abroad there needs to be international involvement in any witness protection programme.
Theres been some debate surrounding the sequencing of transitional justice mechanisms. What do you think would be the most effective approach
In many countries politicians and elite always try to argue that there should be sequencing not just of the mechanisms but also many argue a peace versus justice option. The issue of sequencing is largely dependent on the context in a particular country. In the Sri Lankan context one already has the outcome of the OISL inquiry as well as the evidence gathered by groups, including the ITJP, which provides a basis for any criminal accountability mechanism to carry out its work. At the same time, this should not preclude other mechanisms like the truth commission and the OMP from doing their work. This has happened in many countries including Sierra Leone, and Colombia will soon see a plethora of transitional justice mechanisms operating side by side.
Of course, what has to be worked on is the relationship between these mechanism to optimise resources and access to information. However, given the different purposes, written into the mandate of the truth commission should be the obligation to name names and pass this onto the criminal justice mechanisms as well as to refer the cases of the missing and the disappeared to the OMP.
A lesson that we all learnt from the Sierra Leonean experiences which saw a truth commission operating side by side with the special court is that there should be guidelines on the relationship between these bodies if they are to be successful and achieve their respective mandates.
Some people have argued that accountability for wartime abuses should be de-prioritised in favour of a political solution to the longstanding ethnic conflict. Relatedly, others have asserted that economic justice should be front and center, and that the call for accountability is actually driven by international actors. Whats your take on all of this
In the Sri Lankan context a political and economic solution to the conflict is absolutely essential. However, this does not preclude that accountability and addressing entrenched impunity for serious crimes is equally important. The scale and gravity of the crimes perpetrated in 2009 against civilians demands justice. Listening to the traumatised survivors as I did on the UN Panel of Experts as well as the many courageous individuals who stayed behind in the war zone, it is obvious that these are extraordinary crimes for which there must ultimately be accountability.
In my view it represents one of the great tragedies of our time that tens of thousands of civilians were killed in a matter of weeks in a tiny area of the country without the international community intervening  this challenges the entire regime of international humanitarian law and the very notions of decency on which the responsibility of the international community is built. The world cannot let this slip. Nor can Sri Lankans. In my work in South Africa and Sierra Leone as well as many other parts of the world, political change is important as is economic transformation but bitter experience has taught me that the guarantee of non-recurrence requires measures of accountability  particularly prosecutions of those who were in command responsibility positions.
Victims also require institutional reform in order to regain trust in the institutions of the state believing that they will work for them irrespective of their religious belief, ethnicity, race and group. In many countries the politicians argue that victims need development rather than reparations and we remind them that every citizen is entitled to development, but the recognition of the wrongdoing suffered by a victim demands acknowledgement and reparations. They need to eat but not at the expense of justice. Both the national consultations as well as the various consultations which were carried out outside of the country have indicated that justice is critical and for victims this means holding the perpetrators criminally accountable. It is false to portray the demand for criminal accountability as an international demand  this is done by those who want to avoid it because they have something to hide.
The 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council runs from February 27 to March 24 and Sri Lanka is on the agenda. What would you like to see happen
A tough, honest report by the High Commissioner assessing Sri Lankas lack of good faith in implementing Resolution 30/1 with the council setting clear benchmarks and time frames for the full implementation of all commitments, including essentially the foreign and commonwealth judges, investigators and prosecutors for the court which must be hybrid not domestic. OHCHR has been very clear that a domestic process will not work  wed like to see them impress this point on the international community more forcefully.

Speaker should resign: Gammanpila
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should resign if he loves himself and wants to maintain his dignity, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today.
He said Speaker Jayasuriya, who is a respected person, is being severely criticized for suspending Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena from Parliament for a week.
The resolve of the Speaker to suspend MP Gunawardena is biased as he didnt even allow the MP to express his voice in Parliament. We, MPs, dont attend Parliament with the intention of creating ruckus. We are compelled to express our opinion when there is any incident of injustice, the MP told a news conference.
He said the duty of the Speaker is to save the Opposition MPs from being suppressed by the government and to protect the sovereignty of Parliament from the influence of the Executive.
However, the MP said Speaker Jayasuriya was helpless and that he had been appointed as Speaker in an attempt to reduce his popularity and to put him in a difficult position.
Commenting on Fridays tense situation in Parliament where government MPs left Chambers in opposition to allowing three joint opposition MPs to speak, he said the incident had been scripted.
This is a false attempt to show that the Speaker is unbiased. Why couldnt he have act in the same manner and allowed MP Gunawardena to speak in Parliament the day before Following the MPs suspension, there was severe criticism over Speakers decision. Therefore, the Speaker and the Government wanted to show that the Speaker is unbiased, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The proposed  National Physical Structure Plan 2011-2030 - Commercialisation and threats to the en
	
Sri Lanka is steadily transforming itself in to a commercial hub with the involvement of various government and multi-national companies. While such positive progress is being made, little to no attention is given in terms of preserving the environment in Sri Lanka. Sadly today, many rainforests and other natural resources are in the process of being exhausted as a result of this commercialisation. At a recently held press conference, the Centre for Environmental Studies (CENS) shed light on the proposed National Physical Structure Plan (NPSP), its objectives and the adverse impacts on the environment.

The main source of income for NPSP is the tourism industry :
Ravindra Kariyawasam
Speaking at the press conference, environmentalist and National coordinator of CENS, Ravindra Kariyawasam said the government was trying to implement this plan without giving any insight to the public. This plan was begun during the former regime and its main aim is to transform Sri Lanka into a knowledge, aviation, production and energy-based hub in South East Asia by 2030. In order to achieve this far-fetched goal, several international bodies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund have made requests to the present government as well. According to the National Physical Structure Plan, the government has planned to construct six mega-cities for example, one city connecting Gampaha and Kalutara, another in Galle, Hambantota, Batticaloa, another connecting Trincomalee, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa and the Jaffna city itself. There is an upcoming network of highways spanning from the South Coast to the North and the East and the entire country. But this will not end here. This network of highways will eventually reach India across Adams Bridge and would eventually be one phase of the South Asian network of highways. This network is constructed by utilizing the resources that are freely available in our land today. 


Speaking further, Ravindra said the main source of income for this NPSP was the tourism industry. Therefore, many areas have been identified as eco-tourism zones. With this identification process, many hotels too will be established in these areas. In addition to that, elements such as Titanium and Copper which are found in abundance along the coastal belt will also be exhausted as a result of these projects. In terms of agriculture it is quite evident that Sri Lanka has been sold into the hands of various multi-national companies. One American company has acquired acres and acres of land for cultivation purposes.
As of now, close to 50 acres of land in the Kegalle district have been cleared and several lands in Kalutara and Mathugama have been acquired to plant palm trees. There is an ongoing project to seek permission from farmers to manage water for irrigation purposes. In other words, the government is seeking permission from farmers to sell the reservoirs and the wells. On the other hand, mini-hydro power plants are mushrooming across the country and many of these plants produce non-renewable energy. 


"At this rate, by 2030, only around 10% of local rainforests will be left. The question here is whether this 10% would be able to provide water to the entire land"
Quite a number of forests will be destroyed due to this project. This would affect natural habitats and pose a threat to local flora and fauna. At this rate, by 2030, only around 10% of local rainforests will be left. The question here is whether this 10% would be able to provide water to the entire land. Moreover, this clearing of forests would impose a threat to local flora and fauna and eventually lead to their extinction, said Ravindra. In his concluding remarks, Ravindra said that before these projects commenced, there should have been an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), but this was done in quite an ad hoc way. The people involved would blindly produce a report and then move on to the extent of cross-questioning us to see if everything was in place. A proper EIA would weigh the pros and cons of conducting the project but the EIAs which were produced are useless documents. During the previous years, there were many protests staged against the Darbur Company which was set up in Kotadeniyawa to produce an Indian fruit drink. Recently we saw how the Coca Cola Company carried out discussions with the government to establish their production plant in Sri Lanka and export to India. The previously mentioned highway network is also in aid of this transaction because Coca Cola bottles cannot be transported by air. Therefore, once the highways are built connecting India, this transaction will be made easier. 

Development and conservation of nature should go hand in hand :
Fr. Ashok Stephen
In his comments, Fr. Ashok Stephen representing The Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) said that it was important that all human beings should come forward to protect the environment during the development process. Humans are the guardians of nature but today we see that these guardians are politicians. Hence, we can see the results today. The development and conservation of nature should go hand-in-hand. But development should happen in such a way so that natural resources are not exhausted. These resources should be preserved for future generations. Quite a number of projects take place without the proper assessment of their impact on nature and this I believe is quite a serious matter. Irrespective of the regime, there is a greater impact on the environment due to these ongoing projects and those involved are geared to carry them out illegally. Therefore, its high time that we spread the message around and open the eyes of the public to save our country from facing any other man-made disaster in future.

Two navy personnel to be arrested: PHU claims
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today claimed that it had received information from the CID that two navy personnel, Lt. Commander Prasad Hettiarachchi and N.G. Wickramasuriya, are to be arrested this week to please the separatists who back the government.
It said naval intelligence officer R.P.S. Ranasinghe and another naval ranker Udaya Kumara had already been arrested on baseless allegations on March 3.
Ranasinghe and Udaya Kumara were arrested in connection with the abduction and disappearance of several Tamils. If they have committed such a crime, there is nothing wrong with arresting them. But, no complaint has been lodged in this connection by anyone. These arrests are attempts at weakening the morale of the military to get their signature for bogus confessions, PHU General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference.
He said arrested military personnel are being given the assurance of a safe life abroad if they claimed it was former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda who instructed them to abduct the people.
He said naval intelligence service officer Ranasinghe, who is in custody, was among the nine Navy personnel who had been promoted based on their performance in the field.
Commander Ranasinghe caught an LTTEer who was delivering a truck full of bombs to Colombo. That arrested LTTEer had been released today and the one who caught him had been put behind bars. Ranasinghe was earlier arrested in connection with the Raviraj killing but he was later acquitted after a year spent in prison, he said.
The MP requested President Maithripala Sirisena to look into the issue. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
