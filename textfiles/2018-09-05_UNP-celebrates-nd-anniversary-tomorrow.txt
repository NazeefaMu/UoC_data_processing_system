The 72nd anniversary of the United National Party (UNP) is set be celebrated tomorrow at Sirikotha.

UNP General Secretary and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told a news briefing that arrangements have been made to hold the 72nd anniversary of the UNP at Sirikotha, the UNP headquarters at 9.30 am under the patronage of UNP leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 

All UNP Ministers and Parliamentarians and other senior UNP regional leaders across the country will participate at the event which will be celebrated in a grand scale.

“The UNP, being a party, has rendered its service to the people in numerous occasions. It is a party that always stands with the people despite whatever the circumstances may be,” the Minister said.

“UNP has had its ups and downs. However, it had persevered irrespective of successes and failures. Although we have been unable to come to power since 1994, we are confident that we would be able to form a united UNP government by means of the forthcoming presidential election,” he added.
