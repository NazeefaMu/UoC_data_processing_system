Deputy Minister of Justice and Prison Reforms, Sarathi Dushmantha said today the ministry was taking steps to transfer the Welikada Prison's female inmates to newly-constructed prisons.

He told Parliament there were shortcomings regarding basic sanitary facilities at the Welikada Prison because of congestion.

The deputy minister said this in response to a question asked by joint opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who had pointed out that the prison lacked sanitary facilities so much so that three toilets were being used by 146 inmates.

The MP said female inmates were stressed out with these concerns, which might have led them react violently in the prison recently.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
