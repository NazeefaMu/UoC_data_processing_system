Muslims may lose Mecca if they fail to hold on to Jerusalem: Erdogan


	



Muslims may lose Mecca and other holy sites if the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israeli capital isn’t reversed, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has warned   


“If we lose Jerusalem then we won’t be able to protect Medina. If we lose Medina – we will lose Mecca and Kaaba,”Erdogan said in a speech at an award ceremony in Istanbul.   


Erdogan has been one of the most vocal critics of President Trump’s controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Turkish president has slammed other nations for their “weak” response to the US move.   


On Saturday, Erdogan urged the UN Security Council to annul Trump’s decision. If the UNSC fails to act on the issue, Turkey will do everything necessary within legal frameworks to fight the US recognition, he promised.   


“If the [UN Security Council] will not, we will approach relevant authorities within a legal framework,” Erdogan said. “Turkey will not stop defending Palestine or Jerusalem just because Israel wants it to.”
