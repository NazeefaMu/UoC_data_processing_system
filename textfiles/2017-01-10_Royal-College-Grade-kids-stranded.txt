The admission to the Grade One at the Colombo Royal College for the year 2017 had been suspended after the Education Ministry launched a special inquiry into the admission process, sources said.

The inquiry has been launched after complaints from several parties including the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) about the irregularities allegedly taken place during the admission to the Grade One.

The ceremonies to mark the admission to the Grade One for 2017 are to be held in schools islandwide tomorrow (11).

Several attempts to contact the Education Minister and Ministry Secretary failed.
