United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe would not be appointed as the Prime Minster even if the confidence motion would be passed in Parliament, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.

The UNP is to move a Confidence Motion on Wednesday in Parliament pledging solidarity with its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.

Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader Udaya Gammanpila said according to the internal sources of the UNP, the MPs who would vote in favour of the motion were to file a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court in order to receive an order that Mr Wickremesinghe would be appointed as the Prime Minister.

“There is no appropriate requirement for the Supreme Court to deliver an order to appoint a new Premier because there is a Prime Minister, whose privilege to function as the Prime Minister has only been nullified through an Interim Order issued by the Appeal Court,” Gammanpila said.

“Most of people are of the opinion that the interim order has restrained Mahinda Rajapaksa from being the Prime Minister. It is not so. It has only retrained Rajapaksa from functioning as the Prime Minster,” he said.

Gammanpila reiterated that even though the motion of confidence passed in Parliament, Wickremesinghe could not be appointed as the Prime Minster. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
