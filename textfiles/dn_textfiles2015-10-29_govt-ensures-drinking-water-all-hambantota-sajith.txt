Govt ensures drinking water for all in Hambantota - Sajith

The present government will take up the responsibility of ensuring the right to have pure drinking water for all people in the Hambantota district, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said yesterday.
He said a large number of people in the Hambantota district faced difficulties without safe drinking water for the past 10 years.
"But they couldn't raise their voices against the previous regime due to dictatorial powers. The previous regime implemented large scale development projects in the area without paying their attention to these issues. This government has taken measures to solve the drinking water issue of the area," he said.
The Bandagiriya people engaged in a protest on October 12 at the Pallemalala Junction along the Hambantota-Tissamaharama Road demanding pure drinking water, he said.
The minister alleged that there was a political agenda behind the issue.
"I submitted the Cabinet paper with regard to the second phase of Bandagiriya and Gonnoruwa water supply project on October 14. Cabinet approval has been granted to provide Rs.214.93 million for the second phase of the project," Premadasa said.
He said Hambantota has also been recognised as a CKDu affected area.
Meanwhile, addressing the Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday, Cabinet Spokesman and Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said Cabinet approval has been granted to implement the second phase of the pipe laying project from Andaragasyaya underground tank to Gonnoruwa as a solution to the acute drinking water problem in the Hambantota district, following a proposal by Housing and Construction Sajith Premadasa.
Karunathilaka said around 12,000 persons of about 3,000 families in Bandagiriya, Keliyapura, Ketenwewa, Gonnoruwa, Andarawewa, Kuda Indiwewa and Hendilla areas of the Hambantota district are facing various economic, health and social issues with the acute drinking water deficiency in the area.
"As a permanent solution to this issue, the first phase of the project to provide 250 new water supplies at a cost of Rs.465 million under the Ruhunupura Water Supply Project is being implemented," he said.
He also said that the second phase of this project will benefit additional 11,272 persons with construction of a new pipeline system that facilitates the distribution of drinking water with 2,818 new water supplies from Andaragasyaya underground tank at a cost of Rs.214.93 million.
