To hook them by hook or by crook


	



 

A senior purohita has now got a contract from a political authority in the highest echelons to induce certain JO-leaning Betel leaf Diyawanna members to stay put by offering each of them a suitable carrot. 

 


The senior one who has been given this contract is a party stalwart who managed to scrape through at the last general polls thanks to ‘manape’ despite losing his constituency.


This worthy has already met several JO-leaning members and dangled carrots before them while painting a frightening picture for them if they crossed over to the other camp, they say. 


Already alerted to this carrot dangling move, the JO leaders are said to be planning a counter-move.
