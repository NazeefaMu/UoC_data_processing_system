The FCID told court that the Presidential Secretariat in 2009 had permitted to obtain 12 vehicles for the Parliamentarians elected from the NFF.

THE FCID submitted that the suspect, who was not a Parliamentarian, had obtained one vehicle of it and used it for his personal purposes until 2015 causing Rs. 8.9 million financial loss to the Government.

“Later in 2012, the suspect had been appointed as the private secretary to the then Minister of Housing and Construction and had obtained Rs. 1.6 million as a fuel allowances claiming that he used his private vehicle for Ministerial works while already using a vehicle given by the PS,” the FCID said.

The FCID also said that there was a huge financial misappropriation taken place while using the fuel allowance book pertaining to the highly protected vehicle given to the Minister Weerawansa by the PS.
