UN ‘hopes’ SL will follow accountability pledges


	

Despite contradictions in the Sri Lanka political spectrum on proposed accountability mechanisms, the United Nations said that they hoped the country would follow the procedure agreed upon with the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC).  

Spokesperson to Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Stéphane Dujarric said that he was yet to see the exact comments made by President Maithripala Sirisena on the involvement of international judges in the accountability procedure.

“I haven't seen those exact comments.  There are issues between the international community and Sri Lanka and agreements to ensure accountability.  And we hope those are followed,” Dujarric said.  

He expressed these views when questioned about President Sirisena’s remarks during the daily press briefing.

Journalists questioned if the comments could be seen as the country taking a step back from the commitments made to the international community.
