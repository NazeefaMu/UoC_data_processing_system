Out of the 58,716 students who applied for university entrance, 24,343 students have been selected for admission to state-run universities this year based on the results of their GCE A/L examination, University Grants Commission (UGC) said a short while ago.
The UGC released the cut off marks of students who sat the GCE A/L examination. They could obtain their Z-score marks by accessing the UGC’s official website www.ugc.ac.lk or by calling the Government Information Center on 1919.
UGC Chairman Mohan De Silva said that out of the 247,376 students who sat 2014 GCE A/L exam nearly 149,572 were found eligible to enter a university.
“The UGC received 58,716 applications but only 24,343 of them were selected under the normal university intake. We will later take in more students as special intakes,” Prof. De Silva said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
