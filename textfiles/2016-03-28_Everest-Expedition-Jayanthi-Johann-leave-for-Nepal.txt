Two Sri Lankans, Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala and Johann Peris who are gearing up to climb Mount Everest, left for Nepal this afternoon.

Mountaineering is not something new to the two of them, who had successfully attempted many of the world’s most challenging treks, including Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Imja Tse, Mt. Kinabalu, and the Andes.

Jayanthi and Johann said they had received enormous support from friends and others, some of whom were even unknown to them, for their giant step, which will take Sri Lanka’s flag into the International arena.

In an interview with Daily Mirror Online, Jayanthi, who is a leading women’s rights activist and gender expert, invited all the Sri Lankan women to empower themselves and come forward to take up challenges of this nature.

Johann, a renowned hair stylist and fashion designer, said they took up this challenge to not only fulfill their dream, but to also make Sri Lanka known throughout the world.

Climbing Everest, the world highest mountain is an experience full of thrills and risks.

Several climbers from various countries have attempted to reach the ‘roof of the world’ but while some succeeded, many failed. (Piyumi Fonseka)
