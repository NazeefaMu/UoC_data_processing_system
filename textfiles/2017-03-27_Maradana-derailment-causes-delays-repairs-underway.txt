The railway tracks between Colombo Fort and Maradana, which were damaged due to a derailment, are being repaired, an official said today.

Trains that crossed the segment had to face delays due to the derailment of the Colombo bound Talaimannar train last night around 9.30 p.m.

Officials said that it would take several hours more to repair the tracks to bring back the service to normal schedule. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
