Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre boasts of curing patients with many complications

As a result of negative experiences that several ayurveda chicaneries have created, people had lost faith in ayurveda (a form of alternative medicine). Situated amidst a busy street alongside Duplication Road in Colombo 03, is the Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre that offers treatment. The success associated with this centre is underscored by the fact that the medical facility is hustling with patients from all ethnicities throughout the day. The centre promises excellent service and effective treatment. In fact, the quality of the treatment administered has resulted in more patients turning up with the hope of treating various maladies. The only down-side that has resulted due to the upsurge in patients at the centre is that its limited staff and facilities can’t cope with the demand for treatment. The authorities at the centre now face the challenge of operating the facility smoothly and managing the regular patients without a hassle.   

“People now prefer natural methods of treatment”

“It’s quite astonishing to see the large number of patients who have resorted to ayurvedic treatment for various ailments. Over 4000 patients seek treatment from us at the centre monthly. Everyday we treat about a 150 patients,” said Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani, Senior Medical Officer, CMC

Dr. Tharangani, who treats patients at the ayurvedic centre, told the how the centre came into existence. “The department of indigenous medicine has implemented 16 ayurvedic centres in Colombo, which include one in Kollupitiya. The history of Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre in Kollupitiya dates to a time even before the 1960s,” she said.   

According to Dr. Tharangani human health is being infested by many bodily diseases. There has been a significant rise in non-communicable diseases. The doctor stressed that this is largely due to changes in the lifestyle patterns. Fast foods and unhealthy dietary habits, lack of exercise and mental stress are related to the problem. Dr. Tharangani stated that all these issues are addressed in ayurveda. “Ayurveda teaches people how to lead healthier lifestyles being in harmony with nature. Ayurveda can treat diseases that range from nervous diseases and metabolic diseases to skin diseases and phlegm. The majority of patients that we receive suffer from conditions such as arthritis, diabetes and cholesterol. We also treat spondylosis, cervical spondylosis, migraine and varicose veins. I also recall a patient who suffered from leucoderma, a dermatological complication that results due to changes in pigmentation. Such patients also get socially stigmatized. However through ayurvedic treatment, she was able to get cured,” said the medical officer listing the treatments offered by the ayurvedic centre.   


The CMC has always extended support to us. In time to come we hope to expand the centre and develop the facility and increase the staff so that we can accommodate a larger numbers of patients



They feared ayurvedic medicine as there were many myths associated with ayurvedic medicine. There was one myth in particular that ayurvedic concoctions damage the liver. This isn’t true  Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani

 

 


The numbers of patients who opt for ayurvedic medicine over western medicine has increased over the years. Dr. Tharangani accentuated that unlike western medicine ayurveda has no side effects because ayurveda uses natural methodologies during treatment. At present more people prefer natural methods. She stated that people have lost their fears of approaching ayurveda. “ Previously people were scared to approach ayurveda. They were hesitant to consume ayurvedic concoctions. They feared ayurvedic medicine as there were many myths associated with ayurvedic medicine. There was one myth in particular that ayurvedic concoctions damage the liver. This isn’t true. I see that the myths associated with ayurveda have perished. Ayurvedic medicine is side-effects free and consists of only herbal and natural methods. No chemicals are included. Nowadays people are becoming aware of our efforts and prefer to seek natural treatments,” she said.   



With the ascent in the numbers of patients seeking ayurvedic treatment, the centre is getting inundated daily. “During a day we treat about 150 patients. Due to this increase, we are forced to limit the number of patients. We have resolved to stick to a number system to manage these patients. We ayurvedic doctors stress on the fact that if you seek treatment from us then you have to strictly adhere to our treatment and medications to obtain benefits. Initially people are quite hesitant to take herbal concoctions, but with time they get used to it. Otherwise they may not find positive results and they would be wasting the time of other patients as well because we have quite a large number of patients daily,” said Dr. Tharangani.

Out of the 16 ayurvedic centres, the centre at Kollupitiya has received a lot of positive responses from patients. The limited space and staff seem to be the only handicap. Otherwise the centre is functioning perfectly. This medical officer mentioned that there are plans to expand the centre to offer the maximum service to patients. “The CMC has always extended support to us. In time to come we hope to expand the centre and develop the facility and increase the staff so that we can accommodate a larger numbers of patients. I am of course very happy to serve patients here and we hope to see our services maximize for the betterment of the people,”she said.   

The service and treatment provided by the staff at the centre have greatly satisfied many patients who were awaiting their turn to consult the doctors. Among the patients were individuals who had returned to the centre because they had positive experiences. There were also those who were visiting the centre for the first time, following recommendations. The feedback provided by the patients was quite positive. They requested that the facilities to receive ayurveda treatment be expanded.   “A patient can expect positive results”
