Rejecting Anticipatory Bail application: Ex- Chief JMO goes to HC


	

Former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara today filed a revision application in Colombo High Court over rejecting his anticipatory bail application filed in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court, in the expectation of preventing him being arrested over the inquiry conducted into the missing body parts of the late Wasim Thajudeen.


In the revision application, the applicant cited Attorney General and OIC of Homicide Division of Criminal Investigations Department as respondents.


Earlier, the anticipatory bail application filed by the former JMO was rejected by the Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe.


During the consideration of the anticipatory bail application, raising a preliminary objection, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake revealed in court that, according to statements recorded from witnesses, the former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara had dispatched the samples from the refrigerator a few days prior to his retirement.


The DSG informed that the CID had had begun an investigation concerning the missing body parts under the Public Property Act -- because the body parts had earlier been taken into the former JMO's custody, as case productions and, therefore, they belonged to the State.


An anticipatory bail application can be filed by an individual seeking bail in anticipation or in expectation of being named or arrested of having committed a non-bail-able offense.


He had also earlier filed a Fundamental Rights petition in Supreme Court against the imminent infringement of his Fundamental Rights in relation to the ongoing investigation into the death ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
