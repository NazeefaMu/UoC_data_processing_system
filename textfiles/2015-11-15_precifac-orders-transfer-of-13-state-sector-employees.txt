PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille De Silva said the transfers were made in order to maintain the credibility and impartiality of some of the probes that were being carried out by them into corruption at these state entities.
An additional secretary of the Justice Ministry, the Secretary of Mahiyanganaya Pradeshiya Sabha and several employees of the Ceylon Fishing Corporation and the Coconut Research Institute were among those who were ordered to be transferred.
