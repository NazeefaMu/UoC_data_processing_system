	The Supreme Court today issued notices on UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Secretary General Kabeer Hashim and other respondents through the petitioner sequent to a petition filed by former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake against his expulsion from the party.
	Accordingly, the matter was fixed to be mentioned on March 19.
	Mr. Attanayake, who crossed over to the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) during the presidential election, had cited UNP leader, Secretary General and all members of the Working Committee as respondents.
	He stated that after the defeat of the former President, he had been arrested and remanded on a charge of preparing fraudulent documents on February 2 and was bailed out on February 11.
	While he was in remand, he received a letter from the UNP stating that he had been expelled from the Party.
	Mr. Attanayake stated that party decision to expel him was unlawful and contrary to natural justice without giving him an opportunity to explain his views. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
