Hippie brings his visit to an abrupt end!


	

The head of a leading city council the other day paid a courtesy call on a top team member.

 


The host warmly welcomed the distinguished visitor and shortly afterwards he excused himself and went inside the house.


Presently, a young man in short pants wearing a dozen of multi-hued bracelet bangles and necklaces and sporting a typical hippie-style haircut appeared before the city high-up carrying a tray with a cup of tea.


The appearance of the hippie-type young man got his goat and ignoring the tea offered, he barked at him: “Who are you? What a spectacle you are! Can’t you come properly dressed to greet guests here?”


Having thus vented his anger, the city high-up immediately walked out of the house, they say.
