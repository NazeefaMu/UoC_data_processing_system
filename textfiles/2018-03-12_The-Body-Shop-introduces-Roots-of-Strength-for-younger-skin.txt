The Body Shop introduces ‘Roots of Strength’ for younger skin


	

Draw strength from the power of traditional Chinese medicine as The Body Shop in Sri Lanka introduces Roots of Strength, a formula that firms and strengthens to leave skin feeling more plump and dense-as if reshaped. The high-performing range of skincare products visibly restores youth, energy and strength to skin by drawing from the goodness of plant root extracts renowned for their restorative properties

Roots of Strength is infused with the potent power of three plant roots to restore the skin’s strength and shape. Ginger root extract from the verdant foliage of Madagascar is known for its bracing re-plumping properties; Ginseng root extract from the Jilin province of North East China is a firming agent; and Ruscus root extract from the wild oak forests of Europe stimulates and reawakens tired skin. All three ingredients are sustainably sourced from communities that hand harvest their extracts from the point of origin. Their combined strength is enriched with the addition of Community Trade soya oil from Gebana, Brazil.

The complete firming and shaping routine reduces wrinkles in number, surface area and length after just four weeks. The refreshing daily Firming and Shaping Essence Lotion is a next step after cleansing to help prepare skin for the benefits of the routine. The lotion combines the lightweight freshness of water with the comfort of a moisturizing gel and leaves skin feeling smoother, and looking more refined.



The uplifting Firming Shaping Serum glides effortlessly onto skin, firming and strengthening for a plump appearance. The silky Firming Shaping Cream is a rich, non-greasy application with a fresh spicy scent, once again helping skin feel firmer and denser, with more strength. 

As always, the products are mineral oil, paraffin and petrolatum free. Find the complete Roots of Strength range and more products at The Body Shop flagship store on Bagatale Road, and outlets at Odel Alexandra Place and the Kandy City Center.
