Janashakthi Full Option’s fleet of breakdown assistance trucks will be on standby to tow any affected vehicles to the nearest garage, free-of-charge.
In the wake of the natural disaster, Janashakthi also made efforts to provide flood and landslide assistance to its policyholders who could contact the Janashakthi 24-hour helpline on 011 2303 300 to receive assistance from dedicated relief teams.
