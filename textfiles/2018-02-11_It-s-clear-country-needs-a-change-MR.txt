Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who led the new political party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to the Local Government election victory, today said it was clear that Sri Lanka needs a change.

“Thank you to all who supported the vision of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna at the LG election. Your voices have been heard. It’s clear that our country needs a change,” he said in a tweet.

In a statement this morning, Mr. Rajapaksa said the opposition has been able to achieve this victory amidst unprecedented persecution and harassment.

“Despite the personal harassment they may have had to face over the past three years, I earnestly request all those who contested under the SLPP to celebrate this hard won victory peacefully and with restraint and in a manner that will not inconvenience the defeated side,” he said.

He said the members of the SLPP should be mindful to celebrate the election victory in a peaceful way to show their appreciation to the voting public of Sri Lanka.

“I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to the voting public of Sri Lanka who have reposed their trust in us, and made this victory possible,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
