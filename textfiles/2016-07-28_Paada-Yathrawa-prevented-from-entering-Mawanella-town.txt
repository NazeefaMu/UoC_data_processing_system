The Jana Satana Paada Yathrawa organised by the Joint Opposition was prevented from entering into Mawanella town by the police officers near the Ganethenna area this evening as the procession was ordered not to enter the city limits.

However, a meeting was held by former president MP Mahinda Rajapaksa at Ganethenna. The march is scheduled to begin tomorrow outside Mawanella city limits. (Ajith Siriwardana & Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
