The body of a Sri Lankan woman, who had worked as a housemaid in Saudi Arabia, will be repatriated within two weeks following the issuance of the postmortem report, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) said yesterday.

The woman, Priyantha Jayasekara (38), was shot dead by a Saudi national on March 10 in Buraidah and the suspect later committed suicide.

SLBFE Internal Affairs Additional General Manager W.M.V. Wansekara told Daily Mirror that the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia continually visited the crime scene to keep track on the progress of investigations.

“The authorities that concluded the postmortem were now waiting for the final report which will take another two weeks. It is only then they will decide on a date to release the body. We will assist in bringing back the body to Sri Lanka. The officials attached to the embassy had requested the authorities to expedite devising the final report,” he said.

Meanwhile, Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara who recently visited the residence of the deceased assured to secure the future of her children. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
