UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma today apologised for using a lion’s flag without the two coloured strips -- reprsenting the minorities -- at the protest held outside the Bribery Commission yesterday.
Several organisations and political parties including the Pivithuru Hela Urumya participated at yesterday’s protest outside the commission over the Commission summoning former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
“This is serious matter. We apologise and regret for having used the flag without the two strips. We say sorry to any person or group that may have been hurt by the use of this flag,” Mr. Alahapperuma said.
