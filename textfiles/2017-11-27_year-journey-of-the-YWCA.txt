The Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) is a movement working for the empowerment, leadership and rights of women, young women and girls in more than 120 countries and 20,000 communities around the world. It was founded by Mary Jane Kinnaird and Emma Robarts in 1855 in the United Kingdom. The headquarters is located in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Young Women’s Christian Association of Sri Lanka was founded in Sri Lanka in 1882 with the visit of Emily Kinnaird to Ceylon as YWCA of Ceylon.
The YWCA of Ceylon, is affiliated to the YWCA of London which is started in 1884. The first National Conference of YWCA of Sri Lanka was held in September 1951 in Colombo.
The National General Secretary of the YWCA Shamalee Perera told the Daily Mirror that as it celebrated the 135th Anniversary, it had gone through challenges and success at the National level right throughout the beginning.
“Now it has spread widely and engaged in a lot of charitable works giving priority to the rights of women. Local branches are active both in Urban and rural areas,” she said.
“Currently, there are 22 local associations around the country. Providing hostels for women is the key service of the YWCA.” Mrs. Perera said.
She said that The Rotunda which is the National House was open as the YWCA Hostel at National Office and becomes A Home Away from Home to young women who came to Colombo for study or work.
“By Love Serve One Another” is the Motto of the YWCA. As Sri Lanka was embroiled with the negative impact of war and political changes, the YWCA of Sri Lanka focused its programmes and services, especially to work towards rebuilding a sustainable livelihood for women, young women and children.
The YWCA of Sri Lanka also adheres to the Envisioning Goal adopted at the 28thWorld Council of the World YWCA. The Envisioning Goal is “By 2035, 100 million young women and girls will transform power structures to create justice, gender equality and a world without violence and war; leading a sustainable YWCA movement, inclusive of all women.”
In achieving the goals, the YWCA of Sri Lanka focuses her work on two broad areas such as “Democracy & Women” and “Economic & Social Equity”.
