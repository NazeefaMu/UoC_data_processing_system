Heated argument over sharia law in Parliament


	

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran was today verbally confronted by Muslim MPs in Parliament creating chaos the House when he asked whether stoning a person to death had been recommended by Islam's Shariya Law.
He said this when referring to the stoning to death of a Sri Lankan woman in Saudi Arabia.
Muslim MPs shouted at Mr Sumanthiran saying he has no right to talk about Shariya Law. The vociferous cross talk was led by UNP MP S.M. Marikar, Minister Rishard Bathiudeen and several others.
Mr. Sumanthiran shot back saying he has a right to refer to the teachings of any religion as long as he did not insult any religious discipline.
He recalled how Jesus Christ confronted the law of 'stoning a person to death' as stated in the New Testament.
Mr. Bathiudeen said all MPs represented in Parliament have made a collective effort to save the Sri Lankan girl from the death sentence. (Yohan Perera)
