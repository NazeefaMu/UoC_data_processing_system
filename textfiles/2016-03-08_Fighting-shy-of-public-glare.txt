Fighting shy of public glare


	

A high political authority in yahapalanaya had been receiving a series of telephone calls from a fair one from the former royal family in the recent past. 




And all these calls had been made to make one desperate appeal: That she be spared the embarrassment of having to appear before the FCID by sending an official to her residence to record her statement in connection with the latest case against her. 


It has transpired that the FICD had summoned the lady for questioning in regard to a land purchased in the name of her husband. 


The fair one had implored the yahapalanaya bigwig to help avoid the glare of media publicity that could cause her immense shame and dismay.
