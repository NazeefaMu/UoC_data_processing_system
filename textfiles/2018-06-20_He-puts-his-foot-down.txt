The Pohottuwa stalwarts are now embroiled in a big row over the question of their relationship with the Gang of 16, they say

 


Meanwhile, the failure on the part of some JO stalwarts to back the party nominee, Katana lady who ran for the Deputy Speaker’s post has added a new dimension to the internal dissention. 


This issue had triggered a heated discussion at a high-level meeting of the party held last Tuesday at which the former strongman had launched a tirade against the party seniors who had failed to pull their weight in favor of the party nominee. 


The former strongman who had issued a severe warning to those defying his instructions had emphasized that the backing of the Group of 16 was vital for winning the upcoming polls and his politics was winning people and not alienating them.


He had silenced even a family member with an angry retort when the latter tried to hold a brief for those under fire, they say.
