World leaders could follow President Sirisena: Power


	

Visiting US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power today called on President Maithripala Sirisena and said rest of the world leaders could follow the precedent set by President Sirisena to give up power.
While commending the reforms of the new government to revive the country, Ms. Power said most of the African and Asian leaders were attempting to centralise power around them.
She said it would have been better if the government could expand relationships with the institutions and officials who were in the process of establishing reconciliation in the country.
President Sirisena said the power centered on the Executive Presidency would be delegated among the independent commissions.    
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was also present. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
