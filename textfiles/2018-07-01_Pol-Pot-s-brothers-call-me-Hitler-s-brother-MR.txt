Those who call me Adolf Hitler’s elder brother are Pol Pot’s younger brothers, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa told a public meeting held at Sri Visuddarama Temple in Mawathagama, Kurunegala.

He denied the allegation made by New York Times in its report, ‘How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port’; he said it was a story planted by the present administration to attack him.

“The country’s largest bond scam has created a situation in which various allegations are being levelled against current leaders in the government.  To cover up their wrongdoings, they have contacted a paper from overseas and planted a story against us.  I have invited them to investigate my bank accounts and even volunteered to provide my account numbers. I told them that if they find any wrongdoings I will take a knife and cut my throat.  They are still searching for evidence,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.

He said the Government not only wanted to sling mud at him, but also wanted to cover up their wrongdoings.

Mr. Rajapaksa said no international organisation had given them money; these were false allegations.

With regard to the upcoming provincial council elections he said some wanted it held under the previous system while others say that they want a new system.
“Whatever method is used we will surely win,” he added.

With reference to the 2020 presidential election he said his party would select a candidate who can follow the 'Mahinda Chinthana’ manifesto. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
