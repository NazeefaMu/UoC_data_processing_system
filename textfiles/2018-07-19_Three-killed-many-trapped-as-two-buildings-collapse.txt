The Hindu,JULY 18 2018- At least three bodies were recovered and three others have been rushed to a hospital after two buildings collapsed in an Indian village on Tuesday night.   


A local said that at least 40 persons might be trapped inside the building. At least 12 families had shifted to one of the building, the local added.   


The rescue operations which began on Tuesday night continued on Wednesday morning as many people were feared trapped in the rubble.   


A six-storey under-construction building collapsed on an adjacent building around 9.30 p.m on July 17. The second building also collapsed under the impact. The police have detained the builder and property dealer for questioning.   


Drills are being used to remove metal rods to reach those trapped under the debris. A dog squad has also been pressed into service.   


“Four teams of the NDRF and a dog squad are at the spot,” said Gautam Budh Nagar District Magistrate B.N. Singh.   


“Exact casualties are yet to be ascertained as the rescue operation is on,” regional chief fire officer Arun Kumar Singh said.
