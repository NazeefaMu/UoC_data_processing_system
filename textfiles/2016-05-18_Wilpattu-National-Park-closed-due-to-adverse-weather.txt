The Wilpattu National Park was closed today because the road network inside the park was underwater and impassable, Wildlife Conservation Department Director General Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya said.

He said the park would remain closed till May 25.

Wildlife Department Media Spokesman Hasini Sarachchandra said Wilpattu National Park has several waterfalls and tends to get flooded even during a mild to moderate rainfall.

She said the bungalow reservations made by prospective visitors would be cancelled and alternate dates provided when the park is opened after May 25.

Meanwhile, Dr. Pilapitiya said the date fixed for the opening would have to be delayed in case the rains continued. (Piyumi Fonseka)
