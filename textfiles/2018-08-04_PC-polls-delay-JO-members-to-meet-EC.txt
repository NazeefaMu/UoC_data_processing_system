The representatives of political parties functioning under the joint opposition will meet the Elections Commission on Monday to discuss matters relating to the provincial council elections, an official said yesterday.

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris told Daily Mirror yesterday he and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane and some other MPs would attend the meeting.

According to the EC there is a gridlock with regard to conducting the elections because of the enactment of new legislation to change the electoral system for such elections.

However, Prof. Peiris said the EC must take action to conduct the polls and in case there were problems with the new law, it should conduct the polls under the old system.

He said the Interpretation Ordinance provided for it and pointed out that three PCs had been dissolved some ten months ago while three more councils would be dissolved in October and that his party would take legal action if the EC delayed the polls any further. (Kelum Bandara)
