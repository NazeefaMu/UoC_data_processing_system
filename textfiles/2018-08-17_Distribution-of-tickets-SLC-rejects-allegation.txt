Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said today the media reports that Sports Minister had distributed 800 tickets free of charge among his close associates were baseless and that SLC only allocated tickets to the Minister to accommodate people at the ‘Minister’s Box,’ which is reserved for the Sports Minister, during International Matches.

SLC said in a statement that certain parties had claimed that Sri Lanka Cricket had made an allocation of 800 tickets to Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapa, to be allocated to his supporters to witness the concluded Sri Lanka and South Africa Series.

“However, SLC wishes to clarify that such allegations are baseless, as Sri Lanka Cricket only allocated tickets to the Hon. Minister of Sports to accommodate people at the ‘Minister’s Box,’ which is reserved for the Minister of Sports, during International Matches,” the statement added.
