A chief purohita of a provincial council which is expected to go to polls shortly, is planning to seek re-election on the Pohottuwa ticket, they say.

 


This worthy who continues in office thanks to the Pohottuwa support, was among those who played a consistent lead role to unite the two factions of the Blue party from the very inception. He is said to be blaming a party heavyweight for sending their peace efforts down the drain. 


He has already decided to take a leaf from his Sabaragamuwa counterpart’s book, sources close to Pohottuwa say.
