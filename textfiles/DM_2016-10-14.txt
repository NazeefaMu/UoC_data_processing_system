AIA Pensions Month: Is your retirement ready
	
Most Sri Lankans dont know how much they will actually need at retirement, nor have they really thought about it. Often in real life, immediate needs overshadow long-term needs and most times, we realize our mistakes too late! Prioritising a portion of your savings specifically for retirement is essential, as is starting to save early and regularly.
The real question is of course, how big is your pensions funding gap
Be it the rise in life expectancy, not contributing enough to the existing savings plans, or not having any plans at all, there is a substantial gap between the level of income people are set to receive after retirement and that which they will actually need. That is why AIA is out to make Sri Lanka retirement ready and help them close the pensions gap by educating people of the need to start planning earlier.
We want to encourage people to start saving soon because the younger you are, the more time you have to build up a suitable fund to afford the lifestyle you desire and deserve at retirement, said Head of Marketing Suren Perera, adding that ideally a good pension plan will continue to build up without further contributions if you die prematurely, so your spouse (or beneficiary) can use it to maintain the lifestyle you would like them to have.
During the Pensions Month AIAs nationwide team of wealth planners will put all their energy into guiding Sri Lankans to a more secure and ideal retirement. Whatever your retirement need maybe, be it a monthly income to manage your bills, protection for your beloved family in case of your death or a nest egg that allows you to live your retirement dream, you need to start planning now!

Civil activists express shock and disappointment over President's statement
	
The Movement for a Just Society and the Purawasi Balaya Movement that toiled for the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena today condemned and expressed their displeasure over the recent statement of the President regarding the CID, FCID and the Bribery Commission.
Calling a media conference at 11.00 am in Colombo, the civil society movements had boycotted a meeting scheduled to be held with the President at 12 noon today at Presidential Secretariat regarding the much contentious statement which created a storm in Sri Lanka politics.
Purawasi Balaya Movement Co-Convener Saman Rathnapriya said there was no need to inform the President or the Prime Minister on the developments of ongoing investigations and prosecution in advance. If so, it would obviously tantamount to an unnecessary political inference, he said.
While questioning the difference between questioning the general public and those involved in the Defence Sector, Mr. Rathnapriya said the law should be applied equally to everyone with no double standards.
The three former commanders of the Navy and Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa were summoned to the Court since they were suspects in the Avant Garde case filed by the Bribery Commission. What is the big deal about it It is regrettable how the President is eyeing to meddle in affairs of the Independent Commissions such as Bribery Commission. Can they be called independent anymore , Rathnapriya asked. (Piyumi Fonseka)

HNBs subordinated debt assigned final A+(lka)
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Hatton National Bank PLCs (HNB; AA-(lka)/Stable) proposed Basel II-compliant subordinated debentures of up to Rs.6 billion a final national long-term rating of A+(lka).
The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned for the subordinated debt on August 25, 2016.
The proposed issuance, which will have tenures of five and seven years and carry fixed coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. HNB expects to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier II capital base.
The proposed subordinated debentures are rated one notch below HNBs national long-term rating to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured debt.
HNBs national long-term rating reflects its strong domestic franchise, satisfactory capitalisation and strong performance, which are counterbalanced by a higher risk appetite as seen in the sustained high loan growth that has put pressure on its funding and liquidity profile.
The ratings on the debentures will move in tandem with HNBs national long-term rating.

Perpetual Treasuries 14-month profit exceeds Rs.10bn: leaked CB report
	
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL), the controversial primary dealer connected to the family of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, has recorded a mammoth after-tax profit exceeding Rs.10 billion within a period of 14 months, according to a draft report by the Central Bank, which was leaked to the public domain by a whistleblower within the bank.
The Central Bank on Monday acknowledged the authenticity of the report and said a complaint in this regard was made to law enforcement authorities to probe the whistleblower. The bank also said the internal processes of the bank with regard to the report hadnt been completed at the time of its leak and the final report was yet to be submitted to the Monetary Board.
Based on the published accounts of PTL, Mirror Business last week reported that the primary dealer recorded a profit-after tax of Rs. 5.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2016, against a Rs.960 million profit in the year before.
The revelation sent shockwaves across the countrys financial sector as PTLs profit was not only extraordinarily high compared to its peers but also well above the profits of some of the mid-size commercial banks in the country.
However, according to the leaked Central Bank report, for the 14 months from April 2015 to May 2016, the PTL has reported an after-tax profit of as much as Rs.10.1 billion. To put things into context, during the same period, the cumulative profit after-tax of its peers was just Rs.544 million.
This in fact will become another stunning revelation for the countrys financial sector as PTL has posted a whopping Rs.5.0 billion after tax profit in just two monthsa performance inconceivable even for the countrys most valued business entities.
According to the leaked Central Bank report, these massive gains have been made by the company immediately after the two bond issues of March 29 and 31, 2016, in which PTL had effective participation rates of 34 percent and 31 percent respectively, with a success rate of 96 percent and 72 percent, respectively.
Sri Lankas Central Bank issued the 2030 bond on March 29, 2016 to raise Rs. 10 billion, but ended up accepting Rs.29 billion at an after-tax weighted average yield of 14.23 percent.
On March 31, 2016 the Central Bank further issued 2028 bond to raise another Rs.10 billion, but ended up accepting bids up to Rs.21.7 billion at an average yield of 13.72 percent.
However, the bond yields significantly came down two days later in the secondary market giving windfall capital gains for the buyers of these bonds at the primary market.
There is an inverse relationship between the bond yield and priceshigher the yield, lower the price and vice-versa.
As per the leaked report, PTLs return on assets (RoA) was a massive 115 percent, while the return on equity (RoE) was a staggering 225 percent as of April 30, 2016.

SDB Bank shows real meaning of World Childrens Day
	
SDB Bank, which has taken the initiative to help future generations realise their dreams through some unique value additions, thereby partnering in the nations development as well, has again stepped forward to show the world the real meaning of the World Childrens Day.
Every year, on October 1, the World Childrens Day is celebrated in Sri Lanka as well, in recognition of the younger generation that will take over the future of the world.
A child should be allowed to freely spend his or her childhood, to derive the real benefits. It is also essential that their health be protected and they receive an education that equips them to face a competitive world in the future. It is also very important that the savings habit be inculcated in them. The Lakdaru childrens savings account of the SDB Bank has been tailored to fully meet these demands.
SDB Bank has made arrangements to provide various gifts and scholarship programmes to children who have Lakdaru accounts. Among the unique features of these childrens account are: entitlement to 1 percent more interest than with ordinary savings account, entitlement to attractive gifts based on the account balance, students who excel at the Grade Five scholarship examination or GCE (O/L) and GCE (A/L) examinations being entitled with cash rewards up to Rs.50,000 and account holders who maintain a minimum balance of Rs.10,000 for a month being entitled to a medical insurance to the value of Rs.50,000 annually via a cashless card for hospitalization for any illness. Under this scheme, while a sum of Rs.5,000 per day will be paid in the event of hospitalisation in a private hospital, a sum of Rs.3,500 will be paid in the event of being hospitalised in a government hospital.
In the same way, the bank has launched a special Lakdaru promotion (subject to allocated resources) targeting the World Childrens Day and Savings Month. For every new Lakdaru account being opened during this period, SDB Bank will provide a sum equivalent to the sum deposited by the account holder subject to a limit of Rs.1,000 and a sum of up to Rs.5,000 in respect of standing orders.
For a balance of Rs.1,000 in the Lakdaru account, which can be opened with Rs.500, your child will be gifted with an attractive world map with important information on the countries of the world, which will provide a wealth of knowledge necessary until your child completes schooling. Additionally, many more gifts including tills to encourage the savings habit, caps, valuable school bags, bicycles, dictionaries, tabs and laptops will also be given.
Similarly, every child SDB Bank account holder, who is successful at the Grade Five scholarship examination, will receive gifts, while those who excel at the district and all-island levels of Grade Five scholarship examination, GCE (O/L) or GCE (A/L) will receive cash rewards.
The Dayada investment certificate is another very special award that SDB Bank has introduced for the countrys children. Through this, a child gets the opportunity to step into society at the age 18 with some economic stability. Sri Lankan culture emotionally bonds the parents and their children even after the children reaching their young adulthood. Parents tend to look after their child and support them financially as well. Due to these, pressure is built up among parents on how to take care of the children and their needs after they grow up. SDB Dayada is an ideal solution to release the parents pressure since the guaranteed return will be a benefit for the child, even if the parent is employed or not, when the child grows.
Anyone who wishes to make a worthy endowment to an infant or a child can gift investment certificates. Based on the current market conditions, a new-born infant will have the unique opportunity to receive at age 18, up to five times the investment. Even if the interest rates in the banking sector were to change, the child will nevertheless be able to receive the sum contracted at the time they were issued. It need hardly be said as to how valuable this would be for a child who is about to step into the competitive adult world. It can therefore be said that the SDB Dayada investment certificate is one of the best awards that can be made to a child.

Seize Perpetual Treasury profit: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) yesterday requested the Central Bank (CB) to seize the excessive profit of Rs. 5.1 billion earned by Perpetual Treasuries Limited as of March, 2016.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the CB Bond Sale scam, through which the Perpetual Treasuries Limited allegedly earned the massive profit, was the biggest heist under the Yahapalanaya Administration.
The incident is a black mark for Yahapalanaya. The entire country knows who the culprits of this infamous scam are. We are all waiting for action, he told a news conference.
He said the latest COPE report on the incident was due soon and that the CB too had launched an internal investigation into the scam.
The CB report, however, was leaked. The CB should make sure action is taken against those who are responsible for the scam without focusing on digging into those who leaked the report. After all Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the new head of the CB is known for integrity and transparency, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Shiv Sena in India to support Sri Lankan Siva Senai
	
Shiv Sena in Mumbai has extended its support to a new Sri Lankan Tamil outfit called Siva Senai, triggering concerns among the mainstream politicians of Sri Lanka that sectarian outfits will reopen wounds of a 20-year-old civil war that ended only in 2009.
The Siva Senai, based out of Vavuniya in the Tamil-dominated northern Lanka, is led by Maravanpulavu Sachithananthan. The party takes its name from Lord Shiva and plans to fight coercive conversion from Hinduism to Buddhism, the dominant Sinhalese religion.
Shiva Sena leader Sanjay Raut told News18 that his party extends support to the new Lankan outfit. Our party is a Hindu party. We support the cause of Hindus all over the World. We support
Siva Senai, he said.
Sinhalese leaders fear the militant nature of the new Siva Senai could break the status-quo prevailing in Northern Lanka while Tamil leaders are wary that outfits like Senai would split Tamil unity.
The three main players in the Sri Lankan politics  ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party of President Maithripala Sirisena, the United National Party (UNP) of Prime Minister Ranil Wickeremesinghe and the Opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA)  have expressed serious concerns over the birth of Senai and the support it is getting from Hindu right-wing parties and organisations in India.
The new outfit which is also Sri Lankas first Hindu right-wing organisation accuses the Lankan government of supporting a Sinhala  Buddhist Colonisation to undermine the importance of Hindus. It also accuses the Muslims and Christians of getting huge foreign funding to spread their religion.

Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina.
The UNESCO resolution, which was submitted by the Palestinians supported by Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar and Sudan, raised Israeli officials' ire.
The theater of the absurd continues with UNESCO and today the organization has made its most bizarre decision by saying the people of Israel have no connection to the Temple Mount and the Western Wall, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented.
The occupied territories have already been the scene of increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem al-Quds in August 2015.
Nearly 250 Palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. (Press TV)
