Geetha's parliamentary seat: Parliament SG will consult AG once notified


	

Parliament Secretary General Dammika Dissanayake said today his office would consult the Attorney General on the legality of MP Geetha Kumarasinghe's parliamentary seat once the Court of Appeal notified him of its ruling in this regard.

The Court of Appeal ruled on Tuesday disqualifying Ms. Kumarasinghe to remain in her capacity as MP because of her dual citizenship.

However, she informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Mr. Dissanayake through her lawyer that she would appeal to the Supreme Court against the ruling, and therefore asked the parliamentary authorities to withhold deprivation of her from her seat.

Asked about the situation, Mr. Dissanayake said he would seek the Attorney General’s opinion once the ruling by the Appeal Court was communicated to him through the formal channel.

Meanwhile, former Minister G.L. Peiris, who spoke on behalf of Ms. Kumarasinghe said the appeal papers would be lodged in the Supreme Court early next week.

‘To prevent any kind of action being taken in the meantime, we are informing all the relevant authorities. We are asking for nothing to be done until the appeal is heard and disposed of. Otherwise, the right of appeal is nugatory.

When the High Court announces a death sentence on a person, he has the right to appeal in the Court of Appeal and then in the Supreme Court. If the sentence is executed, the right to appeal will be of no use,” Prof. Peiris said. (Kelum Bandara)
