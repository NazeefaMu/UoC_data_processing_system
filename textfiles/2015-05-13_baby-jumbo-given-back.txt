A baby elephant allegedly kept by Magistrate Thilina Gamage without proper documents had been handed over to the Wild Life Conservation Department at Battaramulla this evening, Director General of the department H.D. Ratnayake said.
He said an investigation had already been launched by the CID to look into this incident and others where elephants were kept illegally.
“The original owner of the elephant is someone else and no proper paperwork had been done when transferring the ownership of the animal,” he said adding that the department would take further action on the matter in future. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
