A 49-year-old woman today complained to the Wattala police that unknown person or persons had drawn her blood when she had lost consciousness while travelling in a three-wheeler.
In her police complaint, she said that on regaining consciousness she found herself opposite St. Anthony's Church in Wattala.
The woman who lives at Weliamuna in Wattala had admitted herself to a nearby hospital before feeling well enough to lodge a complaint.
She said she had taken a three-wheeler to work on Monday morning and had lost consciousness near Ekala only to wake up several hours later opposite the church.
Police said the woman was unable to recall any details of the three-wheeler or describe its driver.
They said this was the first occasion that they had received a complaint of this nature. Police are investigating the matter. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
