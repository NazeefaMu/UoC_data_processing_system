The minister said the government would not control the social media websites but would take action within the legal framework should these websites violate the law.
"We will not allow the media to abuse the freedom given to them" he said.

The minister said mischievous elementsare attempting to create a fear psychosis saying the government was trying to dilute the status given to Buddhism in the constitution." We will safeguard Buddhism while ensuring the rights of other religions," he added. (Yohan Perera)
