Leading e-commerce company, Daraz, is bringing 11.11, the ‘World’s Biggest Sale Day’, to Sri Lanka for the first time. The one-day sale is sponsored by Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever, Anchor, Samsung, Avirate, Browns and Co and Nivea - as well as Rakuten Viber as the messaging Partner. During the first mega event since the launch of the new Daraz App, customers can expect a truly personalized and supercharged lineup of activities. Daraz 11.11 is a first of its kind event and is set to revolutionize Sri Lankan ecommerce.   

What is 11.11?
11.11 started in 2009, when Alibaba, Daraz’s parent-company, positioned it as Asia’s answer to Black Friday. Fast-forward 10 years and the headlining 11.11 sale is ready to make the journey to Sri Lanka.  

When is 11.11?
11.11 is the numeric short-form of 11th November. On 11th November 2018, Sri Lanka will greet the sale phenomenon with open arms and carts.  

What is on offer for 11.11?
Customers can look forward to a fully personalized shopping experience, in addition to massive mega deals, flash sales, hundreds of brand vouchers, mystery boxes, discounts from banks, giveaways and more. The one-day sale event on the new Daraz App will be the biggest to date for the e-commerce company.

The Daraz 11.11 sale will also feature additional discounts for HSBC, Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Seylan Bank credit card holders along with monthly instalment schemes at zero interest.

Managing Director - Daraz Sri Lanka, Bart Vandijk shared his thoughts on the upcoming flagship sale, “11.11 is poised to disrupt Sri Lanka’s e-commerce industry. Once you experience what the Daraz App has in store for you, you’ll be able to draw a line in the sand and say: that was Darazbefore 11.11; this is Darazafter 11.11. It will mark a paradigm shift. 11.11 is about more than just deals and discounts - it will bring our entire digital ecosystem into play: a combo of artificial intelligence assisted personalization, entertainment, massive deals, secure payment solutions, and an assortment of more than 200,000 products.”
