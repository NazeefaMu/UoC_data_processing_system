The latest gossip abuzz in political circles is that a young comely fair Diyawanna member has fallen head over heels in love with a young personable member from the gem-city district. The affair has gone so far, that the fair member is now set to untie the present knot to clear the coast for their impending union, they say. 

 


It has become a pastime of some Diyawanna members to steal a look-see at the couple falling over each other in the nooks and corners in the assembly premises, they say.
