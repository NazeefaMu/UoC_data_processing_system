Financial City:  JVP asks why build on reclaimed land


	

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today asked why the proposed Financial City could not be constructed inland instead of building it on land reclaimed from the sea.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that finding a block of land for this project in Colombo would not be that difficult.

“There are enough spacious lands in the Colombo City to build the Financial City without doing so on land reclaimed from the sea and causing an environmental hazard,” he said.

Mr. Dissanayake said the coastal belt extending through Wellawatte, Mount Lavinia and Moratuwa would be severely affected by sea erosion resulting from reclaiming land from the sea.

“All hotels along this coastal belt will be destroyed in time to come,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
