The area around the cellblock in the Colombo Remand Prison where Yoshitha Rajapaksa and three others are detained on charges of money laundering has been declared a restricted area.

Only the two jailers on duty are authorised to enter J block of the prison where the suspects are detained. The suspects are kept under 24 hours surveillance by the jailers.


One jailer has been assigned to be present whenever Yoshitha Rajapaksa is taken out to meet visitors. All the suspects have been ordered not to leave the area without informing the jailers on duty, according to sources.


These restrictions have been placed on them after a mobile phone was found in a cell near Yoshitha's, prisons officers said.(Jayantha Samarakoon
