Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today he was open for discussions with anyone for the sake of the country including President Maithripala Sirisena.

He said this in reponse to a question asked by Daily Mirror during this morning’s live Twitter Q and A session #AskMR.

When asked whether he was ready to talk to President Sirisena with regard to finding solutions to the current issues in the country, Mr. Rajapaksa said he was open for discussions with anyone.

When asked whether foreign countries were interfering in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka, he said there was no need for foreign interference when the government was in the process of implementing the agendas of external parties.

When asked if he believed that all members of his government were corruption-free, Mr. Rajapaksa said anyone can conduct investigations without political motives.

"I trust you have the same concerns about serious corruption allegations against this government," he tweeted.
