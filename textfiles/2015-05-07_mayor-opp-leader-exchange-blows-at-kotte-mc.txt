A campaign held to protest against corruption at the Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council turned sour when two groups led by the Mayor and the Opposition Leader exchanged blows within the council premises this afternoon.
Welikada Police had received three separate complaints since 2.00 pm from the council’s Opposition Leader Sugath Appuhamy of the UNP, a ruling party UPFA Councilor Premalal Athukorala and Mayor Janaka Ranawaka, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Opposition Leader Sugath Appuhamy who was the first to lodge a complaint said he was engaged in a demonstration outside the Council premises against the corruption within the Municipal Council, and that he came under attack by the Mayor and other ruling party Members.
According to eyewitnesses the Opposition Leader had opposed to the passing of funds to construct the new Council premises taken up at the Finance Working Committee gathered at the Council’s Monthly General Meeting held today.
Sugath Appuhamy had then walked out of the house and started protesting outside by climbing on to one of the gate posts at the front entrance. He had claimed to possess 17 files containing evidence of corruption at the Council.
The situation turned tense when Mayor Janaka Ranawaka accompanied by several UPFA Councillors and staff members rushed to the scene demanding the Opposition Leader to get off the gate post.
While climbing down the post Appuhamy had collapsed on the ground and had remained in that position as a mark of protest. He later alleged in his complaint that the Mayor had pulled him while climbing down forcing him to collapse on the ground.
