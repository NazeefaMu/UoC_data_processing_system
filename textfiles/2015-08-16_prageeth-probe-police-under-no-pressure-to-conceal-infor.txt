Police Headquarters said today that some of the details of the investigation into the disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda had been released to the public but the rest could not be revealed because the investigations were continuing.
It denied that Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon was holding back some of the information under pressure from some individuals.
Prageeth's wife Sandaya Eknaligoda had at a news conference claimed that information regarding the disappearance of her husband had not been released to the public.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the police had handed over all the files connected to the disappearance to the CID under instructions from the police chief to carry out the investigations without fear or favour.
"There has been no intimidation at all," he said. The CID was continuing the investigation successfully, he added.
“We can’t reveal all the information we have. We have already arrested two individuals and we will provide more information as and when necessary. We will update the media and the family when we have made further progress while making sure that the information would not hamper further investigations,” ASP Gunasekara said.
