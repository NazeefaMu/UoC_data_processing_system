‘Chege Pemvathiyo’ launched

Sagarika Dissanayake’s latest novel ‘Chege Pemyathiyo’ was launched recently. The book is a Kalana Ratna publication.
A Japanese Cultural Exhibition was held at the Lionel Wendt Gallery, No. 18, Guildford Crescent, Colombo 7, recently. The Exhibition has been organized by the Embassy of Japan in collaboration with the Japanese Language Teachers’ Association of Sri Lanka, and will feature Ikebana (floral arrangements), Bonsai (miniature tree planting) and Origami (paper folding) in the form of display and demonstrations. Moreover, special tea ceremony and Shakuhachi (bamboo flute) performance are also scheduled and their performers respectively will be flown from Japan for this Exhibition.
The Exhibition was designed to display Japan’s culture and lifestyle and thereby to further enhance the friendly relations between the peoples of Japan and Sri Lanka.
