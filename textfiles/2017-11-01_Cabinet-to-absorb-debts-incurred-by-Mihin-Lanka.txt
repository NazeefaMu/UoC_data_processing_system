The Cabinet yesterday decided to absorb the debts incurred by Mihin Lanka, which is expected to be liquidated soon.

It was disclosed at the Cabinet meeting that the airline launched by the previous regime owed Rs.4,860 million to the People’s Bank and Rs.1,700 million to the national carrier, SriLankan airlines.

The government is reported to be planning to sell the airline's permit to a third party for operational purposes.

Meanwhile, some ministers suggested the appointment of a Presidential Commission to probe alleged financial irregularities involving the establishment of the airline during the former regime. (Kelum Bandara)
