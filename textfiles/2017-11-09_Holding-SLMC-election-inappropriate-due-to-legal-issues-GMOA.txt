Holding SLMC election inappropriate due to legal issues: GMOA


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday said it was inappropriate to hold the election of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) having legal issues with regard to it, amidst being in a crucial condition on the SAITM issue.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told the Daily Mirror that in 2014 they had pointed out several issues in relation to the election procedure of the SLMC and they had urged for several amendments in the said procedure.

“There have been no amendments since 2014 to 2017. However, there are about four vacancies at present in the SLMC. Earlier, we have referred proposals to the related authorities suggesting the need for amendments to a legitimate election procedure,” he added.

He said the SLMC had now approved for an amended election procedure through the Health Ministry and added that even though the council has approved of it, the legal background of it was questionable.

He said it was illegitimate and a gazette notice should be issued with regard to it through the subject minister in order to get it legalized.

“However, the SLMC is getting ready for an election and nomination has been called. The election should be only held after establishing a legitimate procedure through a gazette notice,” he added.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)
