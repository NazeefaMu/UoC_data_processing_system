President Maithripala Sirisena‘s presence at the tea party after the budget and the quick exit of former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa avoiding the reception were notable features in Parliament.
MP Wimal Weerawansa who also boycotted the reception was seen making a quick remark that he did not understand a single word of the budget speech made by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. ‘ I did not understand a word but I will go through the documents and see whether I could learn something,” he told journalists who gathered around him to get his views.
Mr. Rajapaksa also made a similar comment but added that the budget was not an appealing one. “Meka Melo Rahak Nethi Ayawetak,’ he was heard saying.
However Opposition MPS Dinesh Gunawardene and Vasudeva Nananayakkara were seen at the reception.(YP & AS)
