€50mn to improve Colombo water network


	

The European Investment Bank (EIB) today said it will provide EUR 50 million to support improvement and expansion of sewage networks across the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.

 
The new loan will help the Colombo Municipal Council achieve its goal of providing full sanitation coverage to benefit people living and working in the greater Colombo area.
 
The new loan is EIB’s first ever support for water investment in Sri Lanka and the first loan for public sector investment agreed with the new post-civil war government.
 
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayke said the new support from the EIB will help unlock essential new investment to improve sanitation in Colombo.


EIB Vice President Andrew McDowell said increased access to sanitation to be achieved by this project will improve the lives of thousands of people living in Colombo and contribute to achievement of sustainable development goals in Sri Lanka.

“The EIB is pleased to be working closely with partners in Sri Lanka to ensure an environmentally sustainable future for the country’s capital and is grateful for the excellent cooperation with the Asian Development Bank in our first joint support in the country,” he said.  

The existing water supply and sewage network in Colombo was built a hundred years ago and is not adequate for the city’s needs. Once complete the upgraded water network will enable a clean water supply 24 hours a day and seven days a week, compared to the currently heavily restricted service.

The new water investment programme will include provision of a new sewage network in currently un-served areas of Kirillopone. Under the initiative a new wastewater treatment facility will also be built to reduce pollution at the Wellawata sea outfall.
