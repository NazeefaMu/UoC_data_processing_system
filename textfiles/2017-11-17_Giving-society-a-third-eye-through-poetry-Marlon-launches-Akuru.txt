Freelance journalist, Marlon Widanapathirana, who contributes to Sunday Lankadeepa, Tharunaya and GO magazine, published his maiden collection of poems titled “Akuru”. A cinematographer, a journalist and now a poet, Marlon began exploring the world of poets with “Akuru”. Following are excerpts of an interview done with Widanapathirana.



 QYou have published your maiden book on poetry. Why did you use the title “Akuru”? 


I was thinking of using “Akuru” as the title of my first poetry book. There’s a story about my handwriting. I had the ugliest handwriting in my class. On the first day of  the English class I attended in grade 9, the teacher asked me to bring a double rule book to practise writing. Therefore, I wanted to name my first collection of poems “AKURU”. 

 QWere you planning for a long time to write this book or is it just the right time? And what are your interests in poetry? 

The ones for this collection were selected from among numerous poems I wrote from time to time. There are 25 poems written on various themes, mostly focusing on matters less evident to the society. No preface nor afterword has been used in the book. 

QWho are the individuals who have made a huge influence on your poetry? 


The biggest influence on me……has been made by poets like Manjula Wediwardana and Monica Ruwanpathirana. I learned a great deal from them.
   QWhen was the book launch? 


The launching of ‘Akuru’ was a light event held at Sripali Mandapaya, in the Colombo University. It was also a special occasion because a few days later I had to attend the graduation ceremony of the special degree in Cinematography, which I followed at University of Kelaniya.

   Q‘Akuru’ isn’t merely a book on poetry and you have translated these Sinhala poems into English. How do you feel about doing so?

 
I think this is the first ever bilingual book on poetry published in the Sri Lankan university history in both Sinhala and English languages simultaneously. 

 
My younger brother Akash, who works as a journalist at Sunday Times, translated the book from Sinhala to English. 

 
The cover of the book was designed by Diman Darshana Hettiarachchi.

 QWhat are you currently working on? Will there be a second poetry book as well? 


I am getting ready to co-direct a children’s movie in which the script was also written by me.
