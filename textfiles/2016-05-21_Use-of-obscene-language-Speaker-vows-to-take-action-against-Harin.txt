Use of obscene language: Speaker vows to take action against Harin


	

Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane yesterday urged speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take action against Minister Harin Fernando whom he accused of using abusive words on MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.

"We are saddened by the language used by the minister on the MP and urge you to take action," Mr Gunawardane told the Speaker.

He pointed out that the Speaker of the Australian Parliament had suspended that country's Prime Minister for using abusive language and Mr Jayasuriya should also look to do the same.

Speaker Jayasuriya assured MP Gunawardane that he would look into the matter. (Yohan Perera)
