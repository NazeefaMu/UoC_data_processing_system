Armed robbers with baby hold up shop

ARGENTINA: Three armed robbers with a baby have held up a clothing store in Argentina, attacking the salesman before ransacking the shop.
Security cameras recorded the criminals entering the store and carrying out the robbery, while the baby sat quietly on the floor.
Marcelo Taraborrelli, owner of the store 25 kilometres south of Buenos Aires, said a couple carrying the baby entered the store, posing as customers.
After asking questions, they told the salesman that "they would come back in a little while" because "they were going to get money from the teller" but when Mr Taraborrelli opened the door to let them out, a third criminal came in.
One hit the salesman and tied him up while the other two packed up their booty while the baby was left on the floor.
"He didn't walk, we think he was nine months to a year old," Mr Taraborrelli said.
"It was their strategy - it's obvious that the woman carried the baby to make it look like everything was all right. He was unfortunately the gang's innocent accomplice," he said.
Mr Taraborrelli reckoned he lost 50,000 pesos ($7300) worth of stock.
It is not the first time robbers have taken young children to a hit. Two men and a four-year-old were reportedly charged with robbery in Dallas this year, a couple was arrested last month accused of a street robbery in Atlanta, while two men were reportedly arrested in Chicago last week accused of taking a one-year-old along to several robberies. - AFP
