The gazette released on January 9 said the drivers should behave in a civil and orderly manner, should not finish the tour before he has been discharged by the hire and should carry passengers to their destinations by the shortest possible route within the shortest time unless otherwise requested by the passengers.

“It is the duty of the driver to issue a receipt for the payment. Such receipt should include the distance travelled, vehicle registration number, amount charged and the date of receipt,” the gazette said.

Drivers were ordered to display the vehicle registration number, name and driving license number of the driver, a photograph of the driver and telephone numbers of the respective police stations where the vehicle is registered to inform in the case of emergency, behind the driver seat to be clearly visible to passengers.
