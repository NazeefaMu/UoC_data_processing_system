Aiyo! is now part of Oxford dictionary


	

The 'aiyo' word- a Sri Lankan and South Indian phrase that expresses distress, regret or grief, was included in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), last month as a part of the latest addition of words to its database.

OED has defined the popular word as, "In southern India and Sri Lanka, expressing distress, regret, or grief; 'Oh no!', 'Oh dear!'"



Apart from aiyo, 'aiyoh' and 'aiyah' have also been included in the lexicon, India Today reported. Though the two words can be identified as part of the Indian vocabulary too, OED has actually included their Chinese usage.

The latest addition saw the inclusion of various Singapore English words like mamak (Malaysian word for street stall), pancit (flat tyre) and even popular dishes from Singapore and South-east Asia like "char kway teow", "chicken rice" and "rendang".

The dictionary also paid a sort of a tribute to author Roald Dahl, by adding words he invented like "splendiferous", "human bean" and "Oompa Loompa." The children's books writer's birthday falls in September too.

The OED updates its bank of words four times in a year, and almost every year some people find its choices like "srsly", "squee", obvs" and "omg" hard to believe. Some quirky entries can be found in this month's list too, including biatch, butt-f**k, jagoff, 'Merica, scrumdiddlyumptious, moobs, yoda and YOLO.

The Oxford English Dictionary has been the foremost authority on the English language, all over the world. OED is more than 150 years old and contains at least 6,00,000 entries. It is updated four times -- March, June, September, and December -- in a year.
