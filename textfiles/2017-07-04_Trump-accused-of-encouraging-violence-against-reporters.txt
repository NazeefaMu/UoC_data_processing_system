Trump accused  of encouraging violence against reporters


	

President Donald Trump is being accused of encouraging violence against reporters after he tweeted a bizarre edited video clip of himself ‘beating up CNN.’  


The video appeared to be a modified version of a 2007 appearance by Trump at World Wrestling Entertainment’s WrestleMania 23 promotion, in which Trump ‘takes down’ WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. In Sunday’s video, McMahon’s head has been replaced with the CNN logo.  


After Trump appears to beat on the CNN effigy, a logo, ‘FNN Fraud News Network’ appears at the bottom of the screen in script similar to that of CNN.   


The 71-year-old president captioned the tweet he sent around 9.45am with ‘#FraudNewsCNN #FNN’.   
The official @POTUS handle also retweeted the video that appears to be a literal embodiment of his assault against the media. Just three days prior, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed ‘the President in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.’   


The Cable News Network’s PR Twitter account responded to the president’s tweet via Twitter by quoting Sanders.   


They also tweeted: ‘It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters.  


‘Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied when she said the President had never done so.’
