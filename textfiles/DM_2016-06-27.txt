Fitch revises Siyapatha Finances Outlook to negative; affirms at A-(lka)
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has revised the rating Outlook on Siyapatha Finance PLC (Siyapatha) to negative from stable and affirmed its National Long-Term Rating at A-(lka).
The agency has also affirmed the expected National Long-Term Rating on Siyapathas proposed senior unsecured redeemable debentures at A-(lka)(EXP) and affirmed Siyapathas outstanding subordinated debentures at BBB+(lka).
The rating action follows the revision of the Outlook on its parent, Sampath Bank PLC (Sampath), to Negative from Stable on 22 June 2016.
Fitch continues to believe that support for Siyapatha would be forthcoming from Sampath, if needed. This view is based on Sampaths 100 percent ownership of Siyapatha and involvement in the strategic direction of Siyapatha through board representation.
Siyapatha is rated two notches below its parent because of Siyapathas limited role in the groups core business. Sampaths leasing book accounted for just 7 percent of group advances at end-2015, of which Siyapatha provided 33 percent. Siyapathas contribution to group profit also remains low.
Siyapathas proposed senior debentures are rated at the same level as Siyapathas National Long-Term Rating. The issue ranks equally with the claims of the companys other senior unsecured creditors.
Siyapathas subordinated debentures are rated one notch below Siyapathas National Long-Term Rating to reflect their subordination to senior unsecured debt.

Global banks seek to reassure after Brexit vote
	
AFP: Global banks sought to reassure investors and clients Friday that they will absorb the impact of Britains vote to leave the EU, with US giant JPMorgan warning that financial sector jobs may leave Britain.
In the months ahead, we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles, said a JPMorgan staff memo obtained by AFP.
JPMorgan employs 16,000 people in Britain, while chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon previously said that up to 4,000 jobs could move out of the UK.
For the moment, we will continue to serve our clients as usual, and our operating model in the UK remains the same, the memo said.
Earlier Friday, the Chairman And Chief Executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, said the US investment bank had been focused on planning for either referendum outcome for many months.
Rival Morgan Stanley, while warning that the UKs vote to leave the European Union is a very significant decision which will have a considerable impact, it noted there will be time to implement any changes required to adjust its banking business.
Like JPMorgan, major European players like HSBC and Deutsche Bank said they may need to shift activities abroad in the event of a Brexit, in a warning shot to Londons City financial district that employs tens of thousands of people.
Following an EU exit, London could shed 100,000 jobs, according to finance lobbyists TheCityUK ahead of the vote.
That is almost one in seven of the estimated 729,600 people employed by financial and related professional services in the traditional City district and the newer Canary Wharf area that houses Britains biggest bank HSBC and rival Barclays.
Among the biggest fallers in European stock market trading Friday were banks, with shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland shedding around 20 percent of their values.
Banks and housebuilders have been hit particularly hard as markets try to factor in the Brexit effect on the UK economy, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.
HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said the banks commitment to British businesses, customers and staff in the UK remains undiminished.
We are today entering a new era for Britain and British business, he noted.
The work to establish fresh terms of trade with our European and global partners will be complex and time consuming, Flint said.New reality
Credit Suisse warned of market volatility to stay with us for some time in the face of the new reality created by the Brexit vote.
Fellow Swiss giant UBS also expects a multi-year process of adjustment to the result.
The bank sought to make a virtue of being used to preparing our business for change in line with the democratic will of the public in referendum-loving Switzerland.
The tone from Britains Barclays was more sombre, with chief executive Jes Staley pointing to uncertainty and profound changes ahead while saying the bank would do whatever it takes to support its customers and clients.
There is no doubt that the uncertainty following the result represents a challenge, Deutsche Bank chief executive John Cryan said.
But he added that the spectrum of possible scenarios for future relations between Great Britain and the EU is large and that Deutsche does not assume we will have to change our structure or our business model in Great Britain significantly in the short term.
Bank of England pledge
BBA, the lobby group for Britains banking sector, sought to reassure customers on Friday.
People will be able to take money out of cash machines, exchange currency and have full access to their banking services, BBA chief executive Anthony Browne said in a statement.
Any consequences of the referendum result will take some time to resolve and any changes to banking will take place over several years, he added.
Foreign currency dealerships witnessed a boom in trade in the days running up to Thursdays vote, with Britons lining up to sell their pounds, concerned about a devaluation if Britain voted to leave the EU.

Life expectancy of Sri Lankans increases
	
The life expectancy -for both males and females-had increased since 2012 compared to 2001, the Department of Census and Statistics said today.
The Department said it had published the life tables for Sri Lanka for 2011-2013 and these tables were used to get an idea about the life-expectancy of population in the country.
Director General of the Census and Statistics Department A.J. Satharasinghe said in a statement that life-expectancy for years 2011-2013 was 72 years for males and 78.5 for females.
The life expectancy of both males and females was 68.8 and 77.2 respectively in 2001, the statement said.
The difference between female and male life expectancy at birth in 2012 is 6.6 years which is a reduction compared to the value of 8.4 years in 2001.
Life table have been usually prepared for Census years since 1901 and before the years 2011-2013 the life tables were prepared for the years 2000-2002.
Basically the age specific death rates are used to prepare life tables, Life expectancy at birth, life expectation of a person in a specific age group, the proportion of population in a specific age group that would survive to reach the next age group and the probability of surviving of a population in one age group to another age group could be measured from a life table. These information have immense practical importance in many disciplines, such as education, health, insurance and actuarial science.
The standard principle of preparing the life tables is for males and females separately. The basic inputs for construction of life tables are age-specific mortality rates three years prior to the census year.
The data required to obtain such rates are the distribution of population by age and sex and the distribution of deaths by age and sex. Population data are obtained from the Census of Population and Housing, conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics and the data on deaths are obtained by the Civil Registration system of the Registrar Generals Department. Since the last Census was conducted in year 2012, population data from the Census 2012 and the deaths occurred in 2011, 2012 and 2013 are used to calculate the life expectancy for the years 2011-2013.

Narcotics, tobacco, alcohol to be eradicated by 2020: MS
	
The destruction of natural resources and all other components essential for the survival of living beings on earth by people themselves was the biggest challenge faced by the world today, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
At the 6th national programme at Nuwara Eliya Town Hall yesterday to create a Narcotics Free Sri Lanka, he said the production, distribution and abuse of drugs had become a menace that needs to be eradicated more by example than by precept.
"Although the Nuwara Eliya district can be identified as one of the main economic centres of the country with its plantation crops such as tea and food crops such as vegetables and fruits, some 18% of those living in the district are undernourished. A comprehensive study is needed to find out whether there was a link between the use of tobacco, alcohol and malnutrition because the district was the second highest tax payer for tobacco and alcohol after Jaffna," the President said.
He said the government was determined to free the nation from the perils of narcotics, tobacco and alcohol by 2020
The President said he would make all drug prevention programmes better organised and efficient and directed the officials to include the discussions on drug prevention into the agendas of the District and Local Development Committees.
He said one of the reasons for the high level of poverty and undernourishment among the people in the Nuwara Eliya District was drug addiction among males and females.
The national programme was organized by the Presidential Task force on Drug Prevention.
The President unveiled the plaque on educating people about drug prevention.
The report on the National Drug Prevention Programme of the Nuwara Eliya District was presented to the President by NE District Secretary K.H.A. Meegasmulla. Minister P. Digambaram, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Member of Parliament Muthu Sivalingam, President's Senior Additional Secretary Rohana Keerthi Dissanayake and Presidential Task Force for Drug Prevention Director Dr. Samantha Kithalawarachchi were among present.

SriLankan suspends flights to Frankfurt, Paris
	
SriLankan airlines today announced that it would suspend its flights to Frankfurt and Paris in October and November, 2016 respectively.
In a statement, the national carrier said the last flight between Frankfurt and Colombo (UL 553/554) will be on October 30, while the last flight (UL 563/564) from Paris to Colombo will be on November 6.
The Government of Sri Lanka has made it clear that it will no longer fund continuing losses. Airline sources said that the route network is being continuously evaluated in the context of changing market dynamics in order to maximize on sustainable routes which bring in more contribution towards the bottom line.
While the drop in fuel prices has contributed to the airlines improved performance, this benefit has been significantly eroded with the airlines revenues declining for the F/Y ending 2015/16 compared to the previous year.
Addition of capacity to the Colombo market particularly by Middle Eastern carriers, accompanied by a drop in airfares in European markets has seen the contribution of the European network drop in comparison to the other routes. This has been further exacerbated by the depreciation of the Euro against the Dollar. Airline sources further stated that there were no short term signs of recovery in yields.
SriLankan operates daily flights to both Doha and Abu Dhabi and has a strong code share relationship with Etihad and Qatar through which it will continue to provide onward connectivity to the European destinations it has been serving via Paris and Frankfurt.
London will remain the Airlines gateway to Europe, where the Airline has deployed its state-of-the-art A330-300 fleet for daily non-stop operations, providing a greater comfort and an enhanced flying experience to its passengers.
The Indian Sub-continent, the Middle East and the Far East will remain SriLankans focal markets, where the Airline will continue to explore its potential for expansion, it said.

Uncertain global situation could last two years: CB
	
The uncertain global economic situation triggered by Brexit could last for two years, and Sri Lanka could also be affected by this crisis for such a period, a report submitted by the Central Bank to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
This report said it would take at least two years for the UK to leave the EU as per section 50 of the Lisbon Agreement and, therefore, the global economic crisis that had already begun would last for two years.
The report ,according to sources in the prime minster's office, said that Sri Lanka would definitely be affected -- as 40 percent of Sri Lanka's exports to Europe go to the UK. Sri Lanka would be affected with the fall of the pound sterling, it said.
It had also said that Sri Lanka would not get the expected advantages from the GSP plus facility.
The report had further stated that several stock markets across the world had been adversely affected.
The report had made certain recommendations, but the sources in the prime minister's office did not reveal them.(Yohan Perera)
