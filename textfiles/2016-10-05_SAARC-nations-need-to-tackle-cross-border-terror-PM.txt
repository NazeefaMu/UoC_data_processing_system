Backing India's initiatives in the aftermath of Uri terror attack, Wickremesinghe said, "Your PM (PM Modi) has taken a lot of steps to defuse tension."

Wickremesinghe ruled out war as an option between India and Pakistan.
On his country's relations with China, Sri Lankan PM said "Our relationship with China is an economic one, not military."

Earlier, Nepal had also urged the SAARC nations not to let terrorists use their soil for cross-border terror.
