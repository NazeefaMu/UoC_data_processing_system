The Section C-350 of the Central Bank Treasury Bond Commission Report which contains call records of COPE members and former Finance Minister relating to the Treasury bond controversy had been publicized today by the National Archives upon a request of the Presidential Secretariat, the National Archives Department said.

The Section C-350 of the report consists of 127 pages.

Earlier, Secretary to President Austin Fernando sought Attorney General Department advice whether releasing the report would create an impact over the ongoing investigations into the scam.

The report was publicized after the Attorney General had informed the Secretary to President Austin Fernando, releasing the report will not have an impact on ongoing investigations into the scam.

Centre for Human Rights (CHR) Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said the interested parties can obtain a hard copy of the report for around Rs 12,875 and a soft copy for Rs 5,255 from the National Archives.

He urged the Secretary to the President to publish the rest of the report as immediate.

The Sections C350 to C360 of the bond commission report was handed over to the speaker of parliament by the Presidential Secretariat on June 5.

Politicians and civil society activists demanded the release of several redacted documents of the bond commission report believing them to contain details of individuals including politicians who had accepted money from either Arjun Aloysius, Perpetual Treasuries or companies connected to the Perpetual group.
