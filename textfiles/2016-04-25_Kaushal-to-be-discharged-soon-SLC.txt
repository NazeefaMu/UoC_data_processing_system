Cricketer Kaushal Silva, who was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Colombo after being hit by a ball on the head, would be discharged today or tomorrow, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) sources said today.

However, they said Kaushal won’t be able to play for at least another week.

Meanwhile, SLC Secretary Mohan de Silva said Kaushal’s condition was out of danger and a CT scan was to be done on Kaushal in another two days.

Kaushal Silva was airlifted to Colombo last evening after he was hit by a ball during a training session in Pallekele Stadium.
