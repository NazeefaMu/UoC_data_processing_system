The next round of talks on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) is to be held in New Delhi in October.

A source close to the ETCA negotiation team said the latest round of talks was conducted in Sri Lanka recently and that both sides discussed trade in services and goods.

“Some progress is likely after the next round of talks in October. Service liberalization is a difficult point coming up for discussions,” the source said and added that the negotiators have still not discussed the negative lists of goods to be covered under ETCA. (Kelum Bandara)
