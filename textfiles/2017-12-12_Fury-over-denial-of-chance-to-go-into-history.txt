A woman politico who attended the opening of an indoor sports stadium the other day had created a scene on finding that they had failed to mention her name on the commemorative plaque. 

 


It had transpired later a powerful politico who happens to be a relative of the woman politico was responsible for omitting her name from the legend on the commemorative plaque. 


Although the woman politico and her kinsman are bitter enemies, they are often seen together at public functions in the area, they say.
