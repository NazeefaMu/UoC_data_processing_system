A thief who had entered a poultry run in a Tea estate in Dumbara braving the rains to steal some fully grown fowls had to make a hasty retreat leaving his sarong behind, in the face of a severe attack by a swarm of bees which got disturbed.

The poultry run had been located in the back compound of a house, and the fowls which used to roam about from the early hours in the morning in search of food, normally return back at nightfall. A thief who had entered the poultry run breaking the door and had picked on some fully grown fowls and had put them inside a gunny bag he had brought with him. Despite the heavy rain and been happy over the catch, attempted to make a quick exit and in the rush, he had knocked against a wooden box full of bees. The impact aroused the bees which came in a swarm and attacked the intruder.

Being unable to resist the bee attack, the thief made a hasty retreat leaving the gunny bag with the fowls and in the rush, he forgot that he had exited the scene leaving his sarong behind. (Dammika Gunawardene)
