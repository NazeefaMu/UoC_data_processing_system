The Colombo Fort Magistrate today issued an open arrest warrant on former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga.  

The INTERPOL issued a ‘Red Warrant' on Mr Weeratunga last month, naming him as a fugitive wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities.

He was wanted in connection with certain discrepancies that had taken place in the acquisition of four MiG-27 fighter jets from the Ukrainian arms company 'Ukrinmash' in 2006 and financial misappropriation said to be taken place in overhauling four MiG fighter jets owned by the Air Force.
