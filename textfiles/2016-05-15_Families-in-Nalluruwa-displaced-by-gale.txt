More than 35 families living in Nalluruwa were displaced when a gale hit the area. About 30 houses were affected and five were damaged extensively in the incident. Several carpentry shops were among them. Residents said the gale blew for about two minutes amid torrential showers and lightning. One individual had been injured when a tree fell on his house. Others however, escaped unhurt.

The power supply to the area had come to a standstill when the falling trees damaged the service mains. Those affected said only the Panadura Police visited the area and investigated the incident and that no other official arrived to provide relief. They said the gale hit the area at about 11 a.m.

They requested the authorities to provide them with temporary shelter and urgent relief. (Siri Mahabellana and K.S.Fernando)
