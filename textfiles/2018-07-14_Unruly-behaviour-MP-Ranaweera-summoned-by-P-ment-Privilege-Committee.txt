Joint opposition MP Prasanna Ranaweera has been summoned to appear before the Parliament Privilege Committee on Monday over his unruly behaviour in Parliament when former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran made a statement regarding LTTE resurgence.

However, the Parliament session had to be suspended due to the tense situation that erupted when joint opposition MPs protested against the controversial statement made by the former State Minister.

Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera, who raised an issue in Parliament saying their privileges were breached due to the unruly behaviour of JO MPs, urged the Speaker to refer the matter to the Privilege Committee.

He also alleged that several parliamentarians including Prasanna Ranaweera attempted to snatch the mace. (Ajith Siriwardana)
