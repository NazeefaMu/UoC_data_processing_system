Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansooriya said today that in the absence of sufficient evidence, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka could not be named as a suspect in the Rajagiriya accident involving the minister’s vehicle.

Considering the contradictory statements made by witnesses and the police investigations, the Magistrate said there was no way the minister could be named a suspect.(Shehan Chamika Silva)
