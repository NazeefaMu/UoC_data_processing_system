Jaden and Aaron: keep the Lankan Flag flying high

Twelve- year-old Aaron and 13- year-old Jaden keep the Sri Lankan flag flying high as they enter the final round of the Asia Cup of Road Racing in Taiwan. They not only created history in Asia for being the youngest riders to represent a Country, but also have ensured that Sri Lanka goes in to the final round with hopes of a podium in the 3 round championship. Thailand currently leads the championship closely followed by Sri Lanka, India, Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia & Nepal.

The Asia Cup of Road racing is a 3 round championship hosted by the Japanese, Thai and Chinese Taipe federations, this year we have 8 Countries participating in it and the ACRR uses standard to fully race prepared one make motorcycles for its championship. The young Gunawardena brothers who put Sri Lanka on top of championship in round 1 in Japan could not keep up the momentum in Thailand owing to an accident and injury and ended up 5th .
However the accumulated points from round one places Sri Lanka in the second position points wise, and the young brothers would need another podium finish or even a 4th place in the curtain closer in Taiwan in order to secure a slot in the championship.
The curtain closer of the 2015 FIM Asia Cup of Road Race will be held on the 14th and 15th November at the Pen bay International Circuit [PIC] and organized Chinese Taipei Motor Sports Association.
