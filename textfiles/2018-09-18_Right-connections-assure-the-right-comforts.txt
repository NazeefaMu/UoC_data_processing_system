Right connections assure the right comforts!


	

This onetime white- collar one currently detained in the State lodge on charges of corruption said to have committed while serving a political authority, is having a good time in a healthcare unit despite a medical consultant giving him a clean bill of health, they say.




The white-collar one who had gained admission to the health care unit at the very outset, had been sent back to the lodge after a short while, but a female high-up of the lodge, who had returned to this place after having served a brief stint elsewhere had taken hurried steps to send him back to the unit again to enable him to continue to enjoy the comforts provided there. A Ministry high-up and his better half, a doctor herself, are behind the plan to keep this particular lodger in the best possible comfort, they say.
