The Indian police yesterday deported Sudhan Subbiah (37), a Sri Lankan national having LTTE links.

Subbiah was picked up from Lohegaon airport on September 1 while he was trying to fly to Germany on a fake Indian passport.

A police team handed over Subbiah to immigration officials at the Sahar international airport in Mumbai on Thursday night. He was put on a Colombo-bound plane around 3.10am.
Subbiah had allegedly tampered with the passport of one Marimuthu Raju, a resident of Alangottal in Tamil Nadu, and pasted his own photograph. He was detained by the Intelligence Bureau at the airport here on suspicion before he could board a Frankfurt-bound flight on September 1.

Subbiah was under the observation of the Airport police station after the foreigners registration office restricted him from leaving Pune. The Sri Lankan embassy in Mumbai confirmed that Subbiah was a resident of Tiruvelli East, near Jaffna, and issued ham a temporary passport as he had lost the original one in Tamil Nadu.

A police officier said, "After completing Class XI at Songuda Hindu College in Jaffna in 2000, Subbiah completed an automobile mechanic course at Kokwil Technical College, Jaffna. He worked at an LTTE army unit camp and received arms training before leaving it in 2005."

The officer added, "Subbiah used to ferret out landmines and undertook house painting contracts before leaving for Dubai where he worked as a supermarket salesperson till 2014. He came to Chennai in June last year on a tourist visa and lived in Valasaravakkam. He began looking for opportunities in Europe and, finally, landed a job in Germany."

Subbiah was sent back as senior police officials decided not to register a complaint against him as he would end up staying in India for an indefinite period, the official added. (Times of India)
