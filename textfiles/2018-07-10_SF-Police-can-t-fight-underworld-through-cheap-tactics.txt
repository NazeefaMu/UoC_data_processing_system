SF: Police can’t fight underworld through cheap tactics


	

Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said that the Police would not be able to eradicate the underworld by resorting to third grade and futile methods.

Speaking to the media after visiting Bakamuna and Bambulla, where elephant issues were reported, the Field Marshal said some Police officers in his electorate reportedly assault innocent people, file court cases against innocent people after planting drug packets and also demand for ransoms.

“Even yesterday, a child from my area had been taken by the Police and had put chili powder in the child’s eyes.

“His head had been covered with a polythene bag before beating him after hanging him. These types of methods cannot be used to curb the underworld,” he said.

He said the Police should act in an honest manner to control the underworld.

“Curbing the underworld is not an impossible task if done properly. However, the law shouldn't be taken to people’s hands.

“Underworld related issues are not under my purview. We will support the Law and Order Minister and Deputy Minister,” he said.
