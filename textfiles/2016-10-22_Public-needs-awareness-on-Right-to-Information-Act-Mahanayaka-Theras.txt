The Mahanayaka Theras of Malwatta and Asgiri Chapters said the Right to Information Act introduced by the government is beneficial to both the media persons and the general public of the country alike.

The prelates expressed their views when the Minister of Mass Media and Information Gayantha Karunathilaka and the Director General of Government Information Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya met them at their temples in Kandy on Friday (21).

The Mahanayaka of Malwatta Chapter Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera said people seem to be still not knowledgeable of the Act.

The minister told the Mahanayaka Theras that awareness raising workshops are being held throughout country for the general public and media person on the importance and usefulness of the Act.

People of the country could enjoy the right to information without any difficulty under the present government what they could not get during the last government. The minister also said in India this right was gained by the people after staging struggles in streets.

Under this Act, people could get any necessary information from the government institutions and officials are bound to give relevant information, the minister explained to the prelates.

Director General of Government Information Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya said now any citizen has the access to the information they want from the government institutions except for those related to national security.

After meeting the prelates, the Minister spoke to the media and said that frauds and corruptions are preventable through the implementation of the Act. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
