Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera today met Colombo’s Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith to appreciate measures taken by him to stop private classes on Sundays and Poya Days.

He also thanked the Cardinal for standing up against discreet measures taken to make men and women infertile.

While speaking with Cardinal Ranjith, Ven. Gnanasara Thera said there was an undergoing mission on Ligation and Resection of Tubes (LRT) on women and Vasectomy on men allegedly carried out by Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs).

During the Past ten years more than 900,000 people had been made infertile, the Thera said.

“During the discussion we proposed the Catholic Church to create an atmosphere to promote inter-religious harmony and hold discussions to create a platform to avert religious discord,” the Thera said.

The Archbishop had responded positively to support and implement such decisions. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
