The sample of the controversial consignment of Basmati rice was sent by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to the Industrial Technology Institute for testing, following rumors that the consignment had plastic rice in it.

Following the quality report issued, ITI Acting Director General Ananda Pannila said the eight rice samples that were sent by the CAA passed comprehensive tests conduct by the ITI.

“We tested the rice samples using the latest technology. However, we did not find any harmful molecules during the comprehensive tests. Therefore I can assure the samples we received are clean and good for human consumption,” he said.
