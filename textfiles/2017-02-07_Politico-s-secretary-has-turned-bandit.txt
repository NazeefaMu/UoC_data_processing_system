Politico’s secretary has turned bandit


	



A coordinating secretary of a politico holding secretarial status in a main political party is reportedly behaving like a typical thug.

 


His latest bully boy act was to have locked up a tea factory after beating up its owner, they say. 
The tea factory owner was deep in debt and had been in financial difficulties for some time. 


Taking advantage of the tea factory owner’s plight, on a number of occasions the secretary had threatened him to give up the ownership of the factory and not to step into the premises.


The secretary had reportedly planned to grab the tea factory so that he could hand over the job of running it to a close friend of his, they say.
