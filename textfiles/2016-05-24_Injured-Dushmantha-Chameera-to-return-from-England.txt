Fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera has sustained an injury to his lower back and will be returning to Sri Lanka for further treatment and rest, the SLC said today.

It said Chameera underwent a MRI/CT Scan this morning, which has indicated a stress fracture to his lower back and medical recommendation is treatment and rest for as much as four months.

Last week, medium-fast bowler Dhammika Prasad also returned to Sri Lanka with an injury to his shoulder and is currently undergoing treatment.

The SLC said National Selectors headed by Sanath Jayasuriya will meet within the next 24 hours to decide on a suitable replacement.
