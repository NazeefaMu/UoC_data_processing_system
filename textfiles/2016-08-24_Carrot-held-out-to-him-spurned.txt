A move made by some high-ups to silence a vociferous opposition critic holding a responsible office by offering him a carrot of a limousine has misfired, they say.

 


The opposition politico who turned down the offer had pointed out that the government had failed to provide pressing needs such as an adequate staff and computer facilities for him to efficiently discharge the responsibilities of his office.  This opposition politico is a vocal critic of the irregularities in the spending of public funds.
