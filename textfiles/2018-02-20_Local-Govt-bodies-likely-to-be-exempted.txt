Local Govt. bodies likely to be exempted


	

Parliament was informed that the 25 per cent representation of women in local government bodies would be implemented, other than in those where it was not practically possible.

The matter was raised by joint opposition MP Dallas Alahapperuma in the House today saying it was unfair to overlook the 25 per cent women representation in local bodies, because the SLPP had already ensured its implementation.

However, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said no decision was made to by-pass the rule relating to women's representation.

Joint opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella who also confirmed this said it was decided to exempt the LG bodies from the rule where it was practically impossible to implement it.

JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said it had been decided to immediately permit the formation of local bodies where the parties had obtained an absolute majority. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
