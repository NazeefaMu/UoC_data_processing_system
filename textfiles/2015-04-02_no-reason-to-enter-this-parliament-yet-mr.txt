	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said that ‘there is no reason yet’ for him to enter the present parliament, although many members have offered their seats in order to make way for his entry.
	Mr. Rajapaksa made these remarks after a meeting with lawyers at the Narahenpita Abhayaramaya on last night.
	He also said the current government was on a media blitz, by questioning his staff members among whom were senior citizens.
	“This government has nothing better to do and are questioning and intimidating my former staff members. These include those above 60 years and they walk out of these questionings in tears,” he said.
	Many officials who held top posts during the Rajapaksa regime, including former Treasury Secretary P.B Jayasundara, former Secretary to the President Lalith Weerathunga and Former Central Bank Governor Ajith Cabraal were questioned by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).
	“It’s good for media as well because it has one news in the morning and by evening there is another. They seem to be enjoying it,” the former President said.(Indika Sri Aravinda) WATCH
