Conspiracy to kill me: CV
	
A conspiracy is being hatched up to assassinate me and put the blame on the LTTE, Northern Provincial Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran said.
He said this in the felicitation message he sent to the function of launching the book on 'Constitution of Sri Lanka authored by former Senior Lecturer and independent researcher M.Thirunavukarasu.
"I denounced the building of Buddhist temples arbitrarily in the Northern Province. A hate-campaign in going on in the South against me misquoting me as saying that Buddhist temples should not be built in the North and that Sinhalese should not live here and they should be evicted from North, are utter lies," the CM said.
"The majority of people have a mind set that we should not express our grievances and we have to accept meekly whatever given to us. I hear that a plot has been designed in the South to kill me and put the blame on the LTTE" he said.

Lets Talk About Memes: This Time About Technology
	
By Tharique Azeez
Memes are the big subject on the internet. They function as like genes in our body as they get replicated and adopted by various situations. They also function as the catalyst for understanding the world around us.
Meme starts with an idea and starts to replicate from there. Just like genes it gets evolved the way survival of the fittest works. Meme gets variations from its origin and carries messages that matter.
In the process, memes get shared, blended, altered and parodied in various ways. They'll become more and more representative of the condition or situation around them.
As time goes on, memes begin to hold more authority on the ideas they carry.
Internet memes are the source and form of raising awareness in a particular subject. Memes often convey the message with funny, humour and satirical way. In recent history we have evidence that memes are used to generate change in society and politics.
We crawled the internet and collected some of the internet memes that related to technology. This is an effort to show how memes can be a powerful media to convey the message. They use analogies and things that we can relate to.
Let's begin. Brace yourself; internet wisdom overload.

LNG power plant in K'pitiya instead of the SCPP
	
India has agreed to convert the proposed 500 MW Sampur Coal Power Plant (SCPP) to Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plant with the first joint meeting on the contract will be held on October 18 in Colombo, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda said yesterday.
He said however, the Indian-funded LNG plant would be relocated at Kerawalapitiya which has been identified as the best location for its construction.
President Maithripala Sirisena requested Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convert the coal power plant to a liquid gas power plant when the President met him during his official visit to India in May last year.
The MoU for the first stage of the US$600 million coal power plant was signed on December 29, 2006, between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Indias National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).
The Power Purchase Agreement, Implementation Agreement, BOI Agreement, Land Lease Agreement and Coal Supply Agreement were signed on October 7 2013 by relevant parties including the Government the CEB and the Trincomalee Power Company Limited. The power station was expected to begin operations in 2017.
However, there was opposition to the coal-power plant from people living in the area. Prominent leaders like R Sampanthan and Rauf Hakeem have expressed reservations about the plant and in the wake of these protests the President made the request from Mr. Modi.
Dr. Batagoda said the work on the project might begin in 2018 and the power plant commissioned in 2021. He said the cost of construction will be two-thirds of the coal power plant and a unit price would also be less than of the unit price of thermal power.
He said the government expected to reach a 20-year agreement to purchase LNG based on global tenders when the Kerawalapitiya LNG power plant was commissioned.
The government policy is to have more energy security and therefore Power and Renewable Energy Ministry endeavours to ensure to have mix energy resources. We should have strong and mixed power resources such as hydro, coal, solar, wind, thermal, LNG, bio gas to ensure energy security and uninterrupted power generation round the year. We do not depend on one or two energy sources considering the cost, supply, storage and maintenance and operational factors. The least cost application must also be maintained with mixed energy sources at the same time in order to ensure clean and low cost power generation, Dr. Batagoda said. Right now we do not have an LNG power plant which is considered one of the best options in terms of cost and environment protection. Besides, we are in the dark with regard to the fluctuation in the cost of coal in the global market and tax on coal, he added. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

'Pakistani' pigeon carrying threat message for Modi in Indian custody
	
The Punjab Police have said they have "taken into custody" a pigeon that was found near the state's border with Pakistan, carrying a note with a threat message for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
According to the NDTV, the police had said officers of the Border Security Force or BSF had found the bird in Pathankot, where Pakistani terrorists had attacked an Air Force base in January this year.
A police inspector, Rakesh Kumar, told news agency AFP that the bird was found with a note in Urdu tied to it. "It said something like 'Modi, we're not the same people from 1971. Now each and every child is ready to fight against India'," Mr Kumar said.
He said the note was apparently signed by the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and "so we are investigating the matter very seriously."
Security forces are on high alert at the borders with Pakistan in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir amid heightened tension after terrorists sneaked into India two weeks ago and attacked an Army base in Kashmir's Uri, killing 19 soldiers.
Last week, the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control against terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, where several teams of terrorists were waiting to infiltrate into India.
Recently, two balloons were found in Punjab with similar threat messages addressed to PM Modi in Urdu.
Last year, the police had captured a pigeon on suspicion that it was being used for espionage by Pakistan and had x-rayed it to check for spy cameras, transmitters or hidden chips. In 2013, security forces had found a dead falcon fitted with a small camera, and in 2010 another pigeon was captured over spying fears.

SL issued statement on SAARC at behest of India: PHU
	
India is behind Sri Lanka's statement that the atmosphere was not conducive to hold the SAARC Summit in Islamabad, Pakistan, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the tilt towards India in the statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry on Friday was a grave diplomatic error committed by the country to hurt Pakistan.
Sri Lanka already knew that the Summit will not be held after India had pulled out. Therefore, there was no need to issue a statement just before the Pakistan government announced the postponing of the Summit, he told a news conference and claimed that India had pressed Bhutan and Bangladesh as well to boycott the Summit.
The MP said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera had discussed the matter with the Prime Minister and issued Fridays statement after giving into Indian pressure. It is rumoured that the President was not aware about the statement, he said.
He said India sabotaged the SAARC Summit in Sri Lanka in 1991 by boycotting it but Pakistan's Prime Minister expressed his solidarity by attending the summit as scheduled.
He said Sri Lanka played the role of peace negotiator during the Indo-Pakistan war in 1971 because Sri Lanka was the only country accepted by both India and Pakistan.
Former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the peace negotiator back then. But, today Sri Lanka has lost the opportunity to play the role of negotiator when the two countries are on the threshold of an armed conflict, the MP said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Swiss Justice Minister to raise migration issue in SL
	
Swiss Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga will tackle the issue of repatriating Tamil asylum seekers to Sri Lanka during her visit to the country, Swissinfo.ch reported on Sunday.
It said migration will feature prominently on her trip to Sri Lanka and India.
In July, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration has said it would apply more stringent criteria for granting Sri Lankan nationals  mostly ethnic Tamils - refugee status.
The decision was taken in light of a perceived improvement in the human rights record by the Sri Lankan authorities.
Switzerland has been criticised in the past for forcing failed asylum seekers to return to Sri Lanka.
Human rights groups say that some returnees were arrested and tortured for having suspected links with the Tamil separatist movement.
In March during a visit to Bern, Sri Lankas Foreign Minister promised repatriated Sri Lankans safe passage when they returned home.
Around 50,000 people from Sri Lanka live in Switzerland, mostly Tamils, who fled the islands 30-year civil war that ended in 2009.
But not all who arrived in Switzerland were allowed to stay, a situation that has alarmed NGOs.
During her visit to Colombo, Sommaruga hopes to formalise a bilateral agreement governing repatriations from Switzerland and to intensify cooperation between the two countries on the issue.
A press statement said she would be meeting with returnees from Switzerland and will visit a project for vocational training and continuing education that receives funding from Switzerland and is also open to returnees from Switzerland.

The nine provinces were a British creation: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said the nine provinces were a creation of England's King George and therefore there should be no quarrel over them.
"Who gave us these nine provinces It was not given by us or your people. It was given by England's King George and as such there is no need to fight about them but work together as Sri Lankans," he said at the concluding ceremony of the 42nd National Sports Festival held at the Alfred Duraiappa Grounds in Jaffna on Sunday afternoon.
The President said the division among provinces for sports, music, development, and administrative purposes has to be accepted and tolarated.
We must compete with each other with the feeling that we are one country and one nation. The nine provinces were demarcated in the last century for Britain's administrative convenience. Therefore, there is no need to fall out with each other when resolving our problems, he said.
He said the British Empire divided Ceylon into five provinces in 1833 and then to nine provinces in 1890.
The President said he was committed to ensure peace and reconciliation in the country while building peace and brotherhood among all communities while developing sports which is a universal language to heal bleeding hearts.
He said a sports ground was a place for everyone to meet irrespective of a person's race, religion, caste or regional differences and added that the sports played an important role in inculcating discipline and had the power to transform an undisciplined society to a disciplined one.
The President said that today there was a strong need for good moral values in our country and in the world but the lack of ethical values today the whole world is at war instead of reaching excellence in moral values and building lasting peace.
"This Government is committed to providing maximum facilities for the upliftment of Sports with the aim of building a disciplined society. We will provide assistance to develop sporting skills of the children in all parts of the country to reduce the development disparities countrywide," he said. "Facilities including high quality stadiums and modern technology will be provided in each region."
Nearly 800 athletes from the nine provinces participated at the 42nd National Games and the awards were presented to successful athletes.
