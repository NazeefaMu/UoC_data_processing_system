The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today extended the arrest warrant of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to USA, Jaliya Wickremasuriya, with regard to the magisterial inquiry conducted into the alleged misappropriation of USD 132,000 of State funds in the process of purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan embassy in Washington, USA.

Filing a further report, FCID obtained court orders from all Banks and finance institutions in the expectation of getting details relating to the money that the suspect is alleged to have misappropriated.

According to the Defense submission, it was revealed that former ambassador’s immunity had been revoked by the State while he was being treated in USA and therefore the USA State Department does not allow him to leave the country as there was another investigation going on against him in USA.

However, the prosecution raised legal question over the two sureties (his wife and sister-in-law) and a land that were attached as bonds when the suspect was released on bail as two sureties has not so far turned up in court on behalf of the suspect.

The Magistrate fixed August 27 to deliver an order with regard to the sureties of the suspect.(Shehan Chamika Silva)
