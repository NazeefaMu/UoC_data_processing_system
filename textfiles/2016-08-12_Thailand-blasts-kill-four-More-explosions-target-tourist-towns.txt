A series of coordinated blasts across Thailand has targeted tourist towns leaving four dead and many injured, with reports of more explosions.

In the popular resort town of Hua Hin four bombs exploded over the last 24 hours. Several blasts also hit the island of Phuket on Friday.

No group has said it carried out the attacks, but suspicion is likely to fall on separatist insurgents.
The timing is sensitive, as Friday is a holiday marking the queen's birthday. (BBC)
