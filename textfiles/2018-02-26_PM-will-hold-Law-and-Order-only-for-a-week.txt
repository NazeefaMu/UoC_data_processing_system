Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will hold the Minister of Law and Order only for a week, informed sources said yesterday.

Prime Minister was appointed as the Minister of Law and Order previously held by Minister Sagala Ratnayake at the Cabinet reshuffle last afternoon.

Sources said a new Law and Order Minister will be appointed at the second round of the reshuffle.

Accordingly, there is a chance that a women MP who already holds a Cabinet ministry would be appointed to the post. (Yohan Perera)
