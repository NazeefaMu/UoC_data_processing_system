Anunayake Thera is against opening of road opposite Dalada Maligawa


	

Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter Ven Dr. Niyangoda Sri Vijithasiri Thera said it was malicious for anyone to request for the opening of the road in front of Sri Dalada Maligawa on the assumption that it would ease traffic congestion.

He was addressing the media on the current issue related to this. He said air pollution and traffic congestion are problems afflicted not only in the city of Kandy but in other cities like Colombo, Kurunegala, Galle, Matara and Matale. The Venerable Thera said that the traffic problem has emerged due to the non-availability of an alternate route.

He said the proposal to build a flyover near the Mahamaya Balika Vidyalaya was a sound proposal and delay in implementing it is also a concern for the public.

"Those who claim that the closure of this road is creating this traffic congestion should realize that in the Kandy town there is a massive air pollution that is taking place due to the traffic congestions and the emission of air from these vehicles. No investigations had been carried out in a broader manner regarding this," he said. (J. A. L. Jayasinghe)
