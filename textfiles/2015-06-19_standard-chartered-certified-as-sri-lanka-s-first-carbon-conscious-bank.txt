Standard Chartered was certified by the Carbon Consulting Company as Sri Lanka’s First Carbon Conscious Bank. 
The certification is awarded to business entities that have calculated the footprint and have implemented a comprehensive Carbon Management Program.
The bank commissioned a calculation of its carbon footprint which is the amount of Green House Gases (Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, etc) emitted directly or indirectly from a business, product or service’s activities, and is measured in tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalence (CO2e), after conducting a “GHG Assessment”. 
Sanjeewani de Silva, Head of Corporate Affairs/Brand and Marketing, Standard Chartered, speaking at the certificate handover ceremony said: “The GHG assessments will need to have been conducted by an independent body following an internationally accepted standard for carbon footprinting and we are delighted to partner with the Carbon Consulting Company to obtain this certification for the bank. In 2012, Standard Chartered announced the first zero carbon credit card in the country in partnership with the Conservation Carbon Company (CCC), so this is yet another step in the right direction.”
At Standard Chartered focus is placed on efforts to reduce the direct impact of operations on the environment.Environmental issues, particularly resource scarcity, have an increasing influence on clients and business. The impact will be felt in every corner of the world, but more immediately in the regions in which the bank operates. Responding to these issues requires a consolidated effort from businesses, governments and individuals. Standard Chartered has long-term targets to reduce energy use, water use and paper consumption, and reports on all properties that are over 10,000 square feet and a selection of smaller branches and offices, which make up 75 percent of its portfolio.
