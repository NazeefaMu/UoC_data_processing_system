Drunk couple buy Sri Lankan hotel while on honeymoon


	

A couple got so drunk on honeymoon in Sri Lanka that they woke to find they had agreed to buy the hotel.

Gina Lyons, 33, and Mark Lee, 35, had checked in and struck up a friendship with some of the staff, spending their first night drinking rum on the beach with one of the bartenders, who told them that the lease on the hotel was almost up.

During their trip, the London-based couple checked into a rustic hotel on the beach and immediately hit it off with some of the staff members there.

On their first night, they took to the beach with several bottles of rum and drank with one of the hotel's bartenders, where they were told the current lease on the hotel was almost up

Twelve glasses later, the couple decided to take it on for three years at a cost of £30,000, despite living in a “tiny flat” near Croydon in south London and still paying off their wedding.

As of July 1 this year, producer Gina and Mark, a sales director, officially own the hotel they drunkenly agreed to buy and have renamed it 'Lucky Beach Tangalle'.

Gina said: "When we walked into the hotel we saw a group of old Sri Lankan men who were still drunk from the night before, so we started drinking with them.

"The hotel looked grotty and very cheap, but it was by the beach and had the 'wooden tree house' feel that we like.

"When we were on the beach drinking rum, we were told that the lease was almost up for the hotel.

"After finding out that it was £10,000 a year, myself and Mark thought that it would be a brilliant idea to buy it - because we were so drunk.

"Now, almost a year on from our drunken idea, we own the hotel and have started doing the hotel up and making it ours."

Despite having had the initial conversation about purchasing the hotel whilst they were drunk, Gina explained the couple were also tipsy during the following, more serious, chats.

She said: "The next day we went and met an old couple who we had to speak to about renewing the lease ourselves.

"We had to take two friends we had made with us so they could translate for us, as the couple didn't speak English themselves.

"Because we didn't understand most of the conversation, Mark and I were just sat drinking more rum and slowly getting drunk again.

"After some bartering, we finally agreed that we would pay £30,000 for the three year lease and pay £15,000 in the first year and the other half by March 2019.

"But on top of that we had to pay about £7,000 legal fees in obtaining licenses and then £6,000 to refurbish, so it wasn't cheap."

Despite struggling financially, the couple managed to pay the first half of the lease - however they stumbled into an unexpected debt three months after agreeing the purchase in March this year, when Gina discovered she was pregnant.

Gina said: "When we had paid £8,000 of the lease, we found out that we were expecting a baby.


"I felt like I was already a bad mother because I felt guilty that I'd wasted all of this money buying a business that might not work.

"Even our friends and family think we're idiots and shouldn't have been doing it - we owed a lot of money from the wedding and only lived in a tiny flat, and now we had a baby on the way.

"I was plagued with feeling irresponsible, but it was either sink or swim - so we decided we'd have to make it work.

"That's when we decided to throw our all into it, both for ourselves and for the baby, and in July we officially became owners of the business."

Despite initially doubting their decision, the couple opened their seven-bedroom B&B at the end of July and have since had an inflow of regular customers.

And although the business venture has paid off for them, the couple insist that their decisions to expand will be made sober. (Source: mirror.co.uk)
