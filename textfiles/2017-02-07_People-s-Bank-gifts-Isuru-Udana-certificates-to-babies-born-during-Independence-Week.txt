On the popular theme ‘Birth of Freedom’, People’s Bank has taken steps to grant Isuru Udana gift certificates to babies born during the Independence Week.
Parallel to the 69th Independence Day celebrations, People’s Bank will gift each and every baby born between February 1 and February 7, 2017 with Isuru Udana gift certificates worth Rs.500 each.
With these Isuru Udana gift certificates, the parents have the opportunity to open Isuru Udana accounts at the nearest People’s Bank branch for their newborns.
Since its inception in 2006, Birth of Freedom comes into effect this year for the 11th consecutive time.
The objective of this programme is to focus the attention of parents on their children’s future. Isuru gift certificates provide a timely opportunity for all parents to establish a strong financial basis to plan their children’s future development and success.
Birth of Freedom clearly reflects the contribution and commitment of People’s Bank as a state bank towards the personal development of all individuals. Under the patronage of People’s Bank Chief Executive Officer/General Manager N. Vasantha Kumar, the inaugural ceremony of the Birth of Freedom was held at the Maternity Hospital, Castle Street, Colombo 8, on February 4, 2017.
Aligned to this initial ceremony, People’s Bank has also made arrangements to hold similar events in other hospitals islandwide.
