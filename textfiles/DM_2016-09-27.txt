A deputy minister facing likely arrest: Ranjan
	
A deputy minister is expected to be arrested soon because the investigations into his deals have been completed, State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.
He told the media that this arrest would be historical because it would be the first instance where a deputy minister in office would be arrested on corruption charges.
This will prove that even a minister will not be able to get away with corruption under the present administration,"
the state minister said adding that the Bribery Commission had questioned nearly 15 ministers.
He claimed that even Minister Rajitha Senaratne had been questioned a few times.
I and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Vijitha Herath have requested that the rear gate of the Bribery Commission be kept closed so that these ministers cannot get away secretly. Most of these MPs get away from the rear gate in vehicles with tinted glasses," the state minister said. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: FM says VAT only on taxable goods revenue

FM says VAT only on taxable goods revenue
	
The Finance Ministry says despite the value-added tax (VAT) increase proposed through the VAT Amendment Bill, the retail and wholesale merchants, who have opposed the VAT hike, will have to pay a lesser VAT quantum.
The VAT Amendment Bill proposes to increase the VAT rate to 15 percent from the current 11 percent and the retail and wholesale merchants, whose daily turnover exceeds Rs.138,000, will be brought under the VAT payment threshold.
However, the Finance Ministry in a statement said the amendments to the bill will ensure VAT being only charged on the revenue accumulated on the sale of goods on which VAT has to be paid, eliminating the hidden payment existing in the present VAT system.
For instance, a merchant, whose daily turnover is Rs.200,000 and revenue from the sale of goods liable for VAT is Rs.50,000, he has to pay only Rs.7500 as VAT (15 percent) under the proposed amendments to the VAT bill.
Whereas under the existing system, though the VAT payable is 11 percent, the same merchant who has the turnover of Rs.200, 000 will have to pay more, according to the Finance Ministry. 
While paying Rs.5,500 being the 11 percent VAT for the revenue of Rs.50,000, he also has to pay an additional 11 percent for the revenue of Rs.200,000, minus the maximum exemption of 25 percent granted on the total revenue.
Accordingly, a merchant whose daily revenue is Rs.200,000 under the existing VAT Act, has to pay altogether Rs.16,500 as VAT, whereas the same merchant under the proposed amendment has to pay altogether Rs.7,500 despite the VAT rate being higher at 15 percent.
According to the Finance Ministry, under the present VAT regulations, despite only a limited number of VAT payable goods are included in the turnover, traders were compelled to pay VAT for the total turnover during a specific period.
The VAT should be paid for certain commodities such as cosmetics, biscuit, soap and processed food items. All other essential commodities have been exempted from VAT.
Several health services provided by the private hospital sector have also been exempted from VAT. Among such services are OPD services, laboratory services and dialysis services.
The VAT is borne by the final or the ultimate consumer and not by the trader. It is an indirect tax and the government will receive at the end, through all the intermediary suppliers and whole sale and retailers, an amount equal to the amount paid by the final consumer.
VAT was introduced to the tax system in Sri Lanka in 2002. At the beginning, VAT was charged under three levels, at the rates of 0 percent, 10 percent and 20 percent. In 2005, it was increased to 5 percent, 15 percent and 18 percent. Later, in 2006, VAT was increased to a single rate of 20 percent. However, it was reduced to 15 percent in 2007 and it was further reduced to 12 percent in 2009. VAT was the tax on domestic consumption of goods and services since its inception but, for the first time, it was extended to the retail and wholesale sectors by the then government in 2013.
Accordingly, supermarkets and other trade outlets engaged in retail and wholesale with a daily turnover above Rs.2.8 million were brought under the tax net and a 12 percent VAT was imposed on such business institutions.
However, this threshold was reduced to Rs.1.4 million in 2014. A limited number of VAT payable goods were included in the turnover but the traders were compelled to pay VAT for the total turnover during that period.

Foreign visits by PC members: Follow prescribed guidelines: MS
	
In the wake of 29 Central Provincial Councillors travelling to Russia yesterday using public funds, the Presidential Secretariat directed the nine Provincial Councils to adhere to the guidelines issued by President Maithripala Sirisena when undertaking foreign trips by public officials and PC members.
The President has instructed PC members and public officials to refrain from undertaking trips abroad with more than five at a time.
But in this instance there were 29 participants who travelled abroad on the pretext of a training and study tour.
It is not desirable for peoples representatives and public officials holding senior positions to travel abroad in large groups at one time. A careful study should be made in advance of the need for such trips abroad wehn formulating project proposals to be submitted to foreign agencies in future, the President said.
In a note to Cabinet he had stressed the need for all public officers to focus attention on the need and desirability for training or observation tours abroad whenever project proposals are formulated.
"Permission should not be granted for trips abroad where invitations have been received from outside unless the total cost of the trip or a substantial portion thereof is being met by the outside agencies," the President said and added that in case it was necessary for more than the stipulated number of officials should travel abroad, then attention should be focused on arranging such visits on a staggered basis.

Govt. must make responsible statement on C.V.s allegations: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the Government must make a responsible statement with regard to the false and baseless statements made by Northern Province Chief Minister on resettlement of Sinhalese in the North and constructing of places of worship without having backbenches to do so.
JHU national organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the government must make a statement with facts and figures as the international community may be misled by these baseless allegations.
The government must reveal how many Sinhala families had been resettled in the North and how many Buddhist statues have been built and places of worship of other religions like Muslim and Christians. If not the international community may think that Sinhalese are invading the North, he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said about 20,000 Sinhala people had been living in the North according to the census conducted in 1971 and added that less than 5000 Sinhalese had been registered for resettlement there.
Only 110 families were resettled in Nawakkuli and most of them have already left there due to intimidation while only 33 Sinhala families went to Nari Kaadu for resettlement. Sinhalese and Muslims were chased away from the North during the war, he said.
He said baseless statements of Mr. Wigneswaran were a hindrance to the reconciliation effort by the government.
The Central Bank Governor, Chief Justice and Opposition Leader are all Tamils but Sinhala people had not protested against them being appointed to such posts. But Mr. Wigneswaran is trying to hinder this political reconciliation, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. suffering from tax mania: Gemunu
	
The government is suffering from a tax mania and trying to collect even from private buses, the Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
While lodging a complaint at the Human Rights Commission (HRC) today Mr. Wijeratne said the government is trying to collect tax money even from private buses as we are providing the same service as the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB).
Today we lodged a complaint against the Finance Minister and the Secretary and to the Inland Revenue Department Commissioner before taking the step to a bus strike, Mr. Wijerathne said.
We have made several discussions with the Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka earlier and the discussion ended with a hope that didnt come true as yet, he said.
It is unfair to collect tax money from innocent private bus owners. We cannot pay a huge tax from day to day service. There are 20,000 private buses in the service. About 5000 buses are operating from the SLTB, he said.
However, the government is giving Rs.1 billion per month for the SLTB. Both the Private and the SLTB services are doing the same service to the country. Because of that there should be the same treatment given to both the private bus service as to the SLTB service. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The head of a certain government institution has become both a nuisance and a laughing stock to his subordinates, they say.
Subordinates complain that lecturing to them for several hours at a stretch at so-called official conferences frequently convened by him to brag about his own achievements has become more of a nuisance than a source of amusement, they say.
This institutional head makes it a point to have a few hand-picked cronies from among the high-ups seated by his side at these conferences to nod and grin approval at his utterances, they say. Whenever the institutional officials receive summons from the boss to attend these lengthy conferences they would utter in disgust: Ah, Ah, another lunatic conference!

JO vows to take VAT to SC again
	
The Joint Opposition today said that it would go to Supreme Court for the second time against the Governments attempts to introduce the revised VAT, since the Gazette notification on the revision had been printed way before the Cabinet Approval was granted.
MP Bandula Gunawardane, addressing a news conference said the Gazette notice had been printed on September 9 though the Cabinet of Ministers didnt approve the VAT Bill till September 13.
This shows how arrogant and ignorant the Finance Ministry is. The VAT blunder created by the Government deepens with the Gazette notice including a clause not to return the illegally collected VAT money which was collected from May 2, he said.
The Supreme Court ruled out that the VAT increase from 11 percent to 15 percent was illegal since it was not approved by Parliament. 
In this context, Cabinet Spokesman said there wont be any retrospective laws, when the reformed tax revision was introduced. However, the new Gazette is attempting to legalise illegally collected amount. Therefore, we will go to the Courts for the second time, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

JVP condemns 'extremist' remarks made by Wigneswaran
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran has started making radical, extremist statements because of his political bankruptcy, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) charged today.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a media briefing that Mr Wigneswaran has become politically bankrupt as the Northern people have rejected him. The people of the North have rejected him as he has done nothing for them for the past few years. Therefore he is out to gain political mileage by making radical statements against the government, " Silva said.
He said the chief minister's call to keep the Sinhalese away from the North is unacceptable as every citizen has the right to settle in any part of the country no matter what ethnic group he or she belongs to. What would happen if the Tamils living in the South are chased out he questioned.
Also he said citizens living in any part of the country have the right to construct places of worship in the areas they where they live. He made this remark in response to the chief minister's demand that Buddhist places of worship should be removed from the north.
The JVP General Secretary warned that the Northern Chief Minister, by his racist remarks was only providing fuel for radical extremists in the South to explore. Just imagine what would happen to the country if radical extremists in both North and in the South become active" he added.

Central Province Governor Neluka Ekanayaka said today a miscommunication between her and Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayaka had resulted in 29 PC members travelling to Russia last morning in violation of presidential guidelines.
She said the Chief Minister informed her that the President had verbally approved the foreign trip.
The Governor said she had instructed Councils Chief Secretary to conduct a thorough inquiry into the foreign trip by a group of PC members using unused council funds allocated last year.
I will submit a full report on the incident to President Maithripala Sirisena because he has given us clear instructions on how foreign tours should be undertaken, the Governor said.
She said 56 PC members and 14 officials were to undertake the trip to Russia and that it was the Chief Minister who had informed her in writing that President Sirisena had consented to the tour.
I had no reason to double check whether President had approved the foreign trip because it was the Chief Minister who informed me. I realized that the President was unaware of the tour until he returned home from the US last night, the Governor said today.
However, President Sirisena had allowed the 29 PC members and officials to go ahead because by the time his instructions were received to cancel the tour, the members and the officials were at the BIA with their air tickets. The remaining 41 PC members and officials would not be permitted to travel abroad.
The Governor admitted that this was not the proper time to undertake foreign trips of this magnitude using Council funds because the Central Province was faced with huge financial constraints.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

The second phase of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's Kisan Yatra commenced on an unpleasant note with a shoe being hurled at him during his roadshow in Sitapur, which he termed as an act of the BJP and RSS.
"I want to tell people from the BJP and RSS that even if you hurl shoes at me, I am not going to move back out of fear. Your anger is proof of your weakness," said Rahul Gandhi, at a public address in Sitapur on Monday.
Addressing the shoe-thrower, Rahul stated, "You had hurled the shoe, the shoe went from this place to that place, and it did not even get registered in my mind. The story ends here. Keep your anger with yourself, I will keep the brotherhood ('bhaaichaaraa') with me."
Circle officer (City), Sitapur, Ram Sanehi Yadav told TOI, "The miscreant has been identified as Hariom Mishra, who claimed to be journalist of a local news channel. The incident took place around 2pm. Mishra threw a shoe towards Rahul Gandhi at Transport Crossing, but it could not hit the Congress leader." Police said the youth was detained immediately and taken to the city police station.
