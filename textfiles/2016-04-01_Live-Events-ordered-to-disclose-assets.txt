In the case filed by Attorney Nishan Premthiratne claiming damages for serious breach of contract at the recently concluded Enrique Concert the Colombo District Court ordered Live Events Pvt Ltd to declare its assets and the total earnings made from the ticket sales in the “Enrique Iglesias - Sex and Love" concert held in December last year.

Mr. Premathiratne and his wife have filed two separate cases seeking damages charging that the company had failed to fulfil the undertaking it had made.

He said though the Directors of the Company had made a public statement admitting the breach of contract with an undertaking to compensate the ticket holders; they had done nothing of the kind.

Mr. Premathiratne was represented by Kuvera de Zoysa PC, Attorneys Amrit Rajapakse, Kushan Illangathilake , Niranjan de Silva, Nadun Wijesiriwardena, Yasith Hirimburegama and Janith Fernando  instructed by Sanjay Fonseka.
