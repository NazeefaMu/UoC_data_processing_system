	She said the commission is currently investigating the Avant Garde mystery but declined to comment any further on this matter saying the people would know the details when the probe report is published.
	Ms. Wickramasinghe appealed to the people and State officials to provide all available details when making a complaint and instead of vague information on pieces of paper it would to submit a proper document with the facts.
	"In the wake of some 10,000 complaints, of which 4, 000 were received since January this year it had become a grave task to inquire into these complaints because of the inadequate details.
	At a news briefing held today in view of an Awareness Walk on December 9 to mark International Anti-Corruption Day, Ms. Wickramasinghe urged State officials to supply information of any misdoings of their superiors and politicians without too much delay.
	Commenting on the recent arrest of three Customs officials, she said the assistance of the Customs Department was essential in arresting the other two Customs officials involved in this case. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Darshana Sanjeewa)
