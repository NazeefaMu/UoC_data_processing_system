	Thirty nine members out of the 56 in the ruling alliance administration in the Western council had attended the Kandy rally held by the motley group in the opposition clamouring for installing the deposed Big Boss as the next Prime Minister.
	 

The new Big Boss who had run out of patience with the local government and provincial council members continuing to defy the directive of the high command decided to put a end to this ‘unhealthy trend’ once and for all. He called Thilake holding a Ministerial portfolio in the Western council and told him that those defying the party directive in future would face dire consequences and this was his final warning. This warning for once has struck fear into the loyalists of the deposed Big Boss, they say.
