President Maithripala Sirisena has reportedly told the Central Committee of his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that the party had to endure a dismal performance at the local polls only due to its political alignment with the United National Party (UNP).

He said everybody should give it a thought.

The President who addressed the party said all the major parties had been hit by factionalism.
"Nobody can single out a party unaffected by internal squabbles," he said.

He said the SLFP had been affected by division right from its heydays during the time of the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike.(Kelum Bandara)
