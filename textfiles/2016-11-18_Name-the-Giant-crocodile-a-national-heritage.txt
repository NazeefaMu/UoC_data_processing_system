The giant crocodile measuring about 18 feet in length which was recently caught in the Nilwala River should be conserved after being declared a ‘national heritage’, Dr. Anslem de Silva, the Regional Chairman, Crocodile Specialist Group, South Asia and Iran, of the International Union for Conservation of Nature/Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) said today.

He said this at a conference held under the theme, ‘Let’s protect Bio Diversity in Sri Lanka’ organized by the Rufford Foundation, UK and Bio Conservation Society (BCS), Sri Lanka at the Oak Ray Regency Hotel in Kandy.

Dr. de Silva said the monster crocodile is believed to be the largest and the longest found among some 500 crocodiles known to live in Sri Lanka.

“Longer crocodiles were earlier found in the Nilwala River but died due to various reasons. As this crocodile is the longest we have ever found, it should be conserved,” he said.

He also expressed his gratitude to the Wild Life Department officers who released the animal safely after it was found itself trapped in a canal off the Nilwala River.

He went on to say that in Philippines, a 20 feet long alligator was deified by the people. (Chamil Rupasinghe)
