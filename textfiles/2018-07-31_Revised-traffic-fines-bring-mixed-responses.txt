Speaking to the Daily mirror  , the Director of Traffic Administration and Road Safety SP Indika Hapugoda said the number of traffic offences, that deserves fines, had been increased. He said that new offences had been included.   


He said the present number of traffic offences had been increased with spot fines. 

 
The minimum fine prior to the reversion of traffic fines was Rs.100 while the maximum was Rs.2500.   


According to revision of traffic fines, the minimum fine amounts to Rs.500 and the maximum is Rs. 3000.   

Not contrary to the law

“This isn’t a decision that was taken all of a sudden. We had several discussions with relevant authorities and came to a conclusion that the fines had to be increased in order to minimise the occurrences of severe accidents,” SP Hapugoda said.   


“We have observed that drivers don’t pay much attention to traffic signs and regulations and consequently, have to undergo severe consequences, even death,”SP Hapugoda added.   


He said that they hadn’t amended the new fines in contrary to the Motor Traffic Act or any law.   


About 100,000 Police fine books had already been sent for printing. “10,000 books have been delivered to 489 Police Stations in 42 Police Divisions,” he added.   
Traffic fines for additional offences had been amended to Rs.1,000 as a minimum fine and a maximum of Rs.3,000. “The fine for breaking speed limits has been increased to Rs.3,000 from Rs.1,000. The fine for high speed will have to be paid within 14 days. And after 14 days the offender will have to pay double,” SP Hapugoda said.   


He said fines going up to Rs.25,000 for seven traffic offences, such as drunk driving, would be added as spot fines after receiving Cabinet approval.

An attempt to boost Govt. revenue 

 

Meanwhile, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne told the  that by increasing traffic fines regarding 33 offences, the Government was attempting to increase its revenue rather ensuring discipline and safety.   


“By increasing traffic fines for 33 offences, the Government cannot reduce road accidents, but would be able to increase Government revenue,” Wijeratne said.   
“Before implementing new fines and regulations, the road infrastructure facilities such as road capacity and proper bus halts should be developed.   


“The Government should pay attention to renovating roads and traffic signs which are in a dilapidated condition. Perhaps, drivers aren’t aware of some of the traffic offences until they are caught by cops for breaking those rules,” he added   


Therefore, he said that there is lot to be done on the part of Government before thinking of increasing its revenue.   


However, he said that the association wouldn’t increase bus fares in response to the increase in traffic fines.

Move to minimize road accidents hailed 


Speaking to , National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said the decision taken by the Government was a good one as far as traffic accidents in Sri Lanka are concerned.   


“It’s only by increasing traffic fines that people become more cautious of their behaviour on the roads. Otherwise, they don’t care much about traffic rules,” Dr. Kodagoda said.   


“Some countries have been able to reduce the number of road accidents by increasing traffic fines. If Sri Lanka is to reduce road accidents, the traffic fines should be increased,” Dr. Kodagoda added. 

 

Moreover, he said the council would introduce a system within two months so that offenders can pay traffic fines via cards.   

 



Spot fines illegal as traffic boards are illegal

Police traffic expert retired DIG T. Perinpanayagam told the  that the majority of those regulations were in contravention of the Provisions of the enabling Laws.   
“Some speed limit sign boards installed at different locations on main roads are contrary to the Government gazette Nos.763/36 and 1940/21,” Perinpanayagam charged.   


“Some installed No-parking sign boards, No-parking and standing sign boards aren’t keeping with the motor traffic regulations regarding traffic signs, road makings and signals published in the Government gazette No.1940/21 dated 12.11.2015,” Perinpanayagam added.   


“Panel arrows indicating the starting point, the ending point and the centre panel indicating both ends, are absent and not exhibited in these prevailing parking sign boards,” he said.   



 


It’s only by increasing traffic fines that people become more cautious of their behaviour on the roads. Otherwise, they don’t care much about traffic rules

-Dr. Sisira Kodagoda NCRFChairman


 

 

He asked as to how the Ministry of Transport had increased the spot fines for traffic offences when the majority of traffic signal boards were contrary to the law.   
“The enforcement of the Law in such an errant manner is a negation of the fundamental rights to the equal protection of the Law guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and directive delivered in SC (FR) application No. 297/2007 dated 03. 12.2007,” Perinpanayagam added.   


In conclusion, it should be noted that something might have gone wrong in this regard because this newspaper has heard both positive and negative comments regarding the increase in traffic fines. Hence, the authorities must heed to the feedback about what has gone wrong when implementing these laws.
