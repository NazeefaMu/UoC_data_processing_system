Toilet served to answer a different call


	

A story about a provincial politico who was forced to remain inside a toilet for a long time in unforeseen circumstances is reportedly raising titters in political circles these days. 




A virulent opponent of yahapalanaya, this provincial politico had on the sly called at the official residence of a senior purohita and was engaged in a lengthy discussion with him when a journalist with a photographer in tow suddenly arrived there.


The provincial politico who got panicky on seeing the duo from the Press, had exclaimed: “Oh! My God! I am finished if they catch me talking to you!” Looking about for a place to hide, he had seen a door open a few yards away at the corner of the building, rushed there and closed it behind him.  


Once closing the door only, the man had realized that he had mistaken a servant’s toilet for a room. 
It had taken more than one hour for the newsman to conclude his interview with the senior purohita and the provincial politico had emerged from the toilet only after the departure of the two visitors from the Press.
