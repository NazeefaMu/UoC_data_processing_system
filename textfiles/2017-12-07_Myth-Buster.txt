MYTH: If you sprain your ankle you should walk it off for it to heal faster.  


BUSTED: “This is not recommended. If you sprain your ankle what we do recommend is doing RICE. This is, you have to Rest the injured area, keep Ice on it, Compress it with a bandage and keep the injured area Elevated.

If you go to walk on it then you can make the injury worse and it would take longer to heal” explained Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama.
