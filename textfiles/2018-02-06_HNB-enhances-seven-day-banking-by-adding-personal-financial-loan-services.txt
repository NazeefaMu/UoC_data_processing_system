HNB enhances seven-day banking by adding personal financial loan services


	



 

Bringing greater convenience to their weekend banking customers, Sri Lanka’s largest private sector commercial bank, HNB PLC, added personal financial services to their already existing seven-day banking customer centres.


Customers across 12 townships in Sri Lanka can now avail themselves of loans even during weekends, in addition to the usual banking services from these fully-fledged centres.


Such centres will manage all ‘over-the-counter’ banking needs plus provide advisory assistance to customers on HNB’s unique financial products including personal and housing loans, leasing and credit cards, at an easier, relaxed, weekend pace.


HNB envisages that the Saturday and Sunday offering will be a boon to their customers, most of whom have very tight work schedules during the week. Such customers who have no time to visit the bank could now pop-by to the closest seven-day centre during a weekend to discuss all their banking needs from loans to leasing.


HNB Retail Banking Deputy General Manager Sanjay Wijemanne speaking on the rationale behind the additional services said: “HNB has taken a pragmatic decision to transform our existing seven-day banking centres to include value added services, such as personal financial services. Now, customers can meet a dedicated staffer during the weekend for advice and assistance, collect applications, hand-over documents and more, without being rushed.”


The centres now located in Wellawatte, Rajagiriya, Maharagama, Negombo, Anuradhapura, Kiribathgoda, Kurunegala, Kandy, Galle, Ratnapura, Trincomalee and Jaffna will see a further 40 such customer centers,  now open only on Saturdays, convert into fully-fledged weekend units.


Adding to providing exceptional customer service, HNB will also introduce a unique door-to-door service for customers who have applied for a personal or housing loan. A dedicated banking agent will visit the residence or business premises to complete necessary documentation.
