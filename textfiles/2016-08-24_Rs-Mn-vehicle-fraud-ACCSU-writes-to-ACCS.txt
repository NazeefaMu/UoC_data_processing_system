Rs. 1,000 Mn vehicle fraud: ACCSU writes to ACCS


	

The All Ceylon Customs Service Union (ACCSU) has written to the Director of the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat (ACCS) reminding him of a complaint it made about a vehicle fraud at the Customs resulting in a Rs.1,000 million loss to the State.

In its complaint, the ACCSU said the state had incurred the loss due to the release of 112 Toyota Prado vehicles after imposing a special levy of Rs.1.6 million on each of the vehicles despite a pending investigation on the import of these vehicles.

“Two months after the complaint was lodged, investigations were launched and statements from the officers who seized the vehicles recorded. Statements were also recorded from ACCSU officials but the Finance Minister, the main respondent in our complaint, had still not been questioned,” ACCSU Secretary J. A. Gunathilaka said in his letter.
