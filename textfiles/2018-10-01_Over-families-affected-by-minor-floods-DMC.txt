The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said today some 700 families were affected by minor floods in the Galle District.

DMC Spokesman Pradeep Kodippily said Karapitiya Road in Galle, Beligaha, Galagediya, Moragoda, Dangedara, Kahaduwawatte were under water because of the heavy rains over the weekend, however, by last afternoon the water had begun to recede.

The DMC quoted the Met Department as saying the prevailing rainy weather was expected to increase, particularly exceeding 100-150 mm in the North-Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and Uva Provinces during next few days because of the atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.

People have been warned to take precautions to minimise the damage caused by lightning. (Yohan Perera)
