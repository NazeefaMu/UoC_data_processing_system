I was thinking that the pair of shoes I was offered was too big for me when I was given the Finance Minister post, new Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.

Making his maiden speech in the Parliament as the Finance Minister Mr. Samaraweera stated the Finance Minister post is a serious post which had been held in the past by political giants like J.R. Jayawardene and Dr. N.M. Perera. "That was why I felt this pair of shoes is too big for me" he said.

He promised that he would introduce economic reforms that would suit to the 21st century in order to uplift the country. He stated that his government took over a country similar to the Meethotamulla garbage dump. (Sujith Hewajulige and Ariyarathna Ranabahu)
