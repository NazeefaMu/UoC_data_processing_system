The ownership of the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Airport in Mattala (MRIA) and the Hambantota Port would not be handed over to private companies, a United National Party (UNP) Deputy Minister said today.

“The ownership of MIRA will not be handed over to any one as the Government is only considering signing a management contract with a private company and the situation is same with the Hambantota Port,” Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith Perera said in response to questions raised by journalists at a media briefing.

Accordingly, the ownership of the airport and the port will remain with the Sri Lankan Government, while they will be managed by private companies.

This statement comes despite reports that Sri Lanka’s second international airport is to be privatised. (Yohan Perera)
