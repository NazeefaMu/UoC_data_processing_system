Annual Intl Research Symposium - 2018 Changing World, Challenging Boundaries
	
Dr. Saumya Liyanage and Prof. Rustom Bharucha
The International Research Symposium 2018 organized by the University of Visual and Performing Arts (UVPA) was held from December 5-7 at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI). Limitless perspectives of contemporary arts-based research in diverse fields of humanities and social sciences were invited to view society under the chosen theme Changing World, Challenging Boundaries.This was the first time in the history of the University that the event was executed on an international scale.
The three-day programme encouraged discussion and interaction between artistes, researchers and academics who are currently involved in research areas pertaining to social sciences and humanities within and beyond Sri Lanka. Dr. Priyeshni Perera, a lecturer of the UVPA emphasized on how the participants were allowed to expand their horizons through the wealth of knowledge disseminated by the event. 
Day ones inauguration ceremony featured a vibrant musical item by six performers of the UVPA. And later, the gathering welcomed its keynote speaker for the day- Prof. Rustom Bharucha: an internationally acclaimed academic, cultural theorist and theatre practitioner. He delivered a thought-provoking lecture titled Rethinking the Intercultural Paradigm in Troubled Time: A Search for new Practices Within, Across and Beyond Borders whichwas introduced and chaired by Dr. Saumya Liyanage. Prof. Bharuchas critical discourse addressed the concepts of interculturalism, nationalism and globalization in the wake of rising sectarianism, authoritarianism, and coercive migration, the role of theatre in such troubling times and confronting the deadlock of existing conflicts in order to imagine new transformative possibilities of being.
The following two days welcomed Dr. Rob Conkie and Prof. Raj Somadewa as their respective keynote speakers. Dr. Rob Conkie who is a senior lecturer at La Trobe university, Australia spoke on eTwistermology: Embodied and Collaborative Writing, which examined the methodological affordances of synthesizing embodied and collaborative modes of thinking and writing.
A section of the audience
Prof. Raj Somadeva, one of the well-known archaeologists in Sri Lanka and a professor at the University of Kelaniya, presented his keynote speech onA Quest for Roots of Creativity, which explained the creative endeavours of the early inhabitants of Sri Lanka inspired or rooted in the historical periods. 
The keynote speeches of each day segued into the parallel presentation-sessions by the local and foreign participants whose submissions a panel of reviewers had selected. A wide spectrum of research topics were covered, including sociology, history/politics, gender studies, theatre historiography , media and communication, literature, management/economics etc. The relevant subject matter was discussed in the form of paper, group, poster and workshop presentations, video documentations and creative demonstrations, in either Sinhalese or English. 
On the first evening of the event, the organizers also held a cultural show at the UVPA premises. This was a fusion of both Sri Lankan and Iranian cultures in the form of music and movement. The show featured the Iranian folk compositions of one of the presenters Dr. Pooyan Azadeh who spoke onPersian classical piano music, fused with rhythmic, Sri Lankan drums. It also showcased an arrangement of traditional vannam and prashasthi weaved into classical, choral music and a story telling choreography. 
Understanding the endless scope of the arts, the University accepted its submissions from a variety of themes this year enabling them to not only welcome a greater response but also a global one. As stated by Dr. Perera, the whole initiative is a path to conquer boundaries by promoting New research, new ideas and new solutions to the problems we face in this modern era.

Authoritarian trends in power game
	
The science of Megapolis and Hubris Syndrome
The history of madness is the history of power. Because it imagines power, madness is both impotence and omnipotence. It requires power to control it. Threatening the normal structures of authority, insanity is engaged in an endless dialoguea monomaniacal monologue sometimesabout power
- Roy Porter in A SocialHistory of Madness.
Former Minister of Megapolis, Patali Champika Ranawaka presenting the proposal in Parliament to suspend finances for running the ministries of the Rajapaksas controversial Minority Government made a rare, informative and persuasive oration on Friday, Nov 30.
The well-read man quoted, beginning from Sir Isaac Newton [On his now defunct 300-year old Law of Gravity] to many scientific thinkers, political philosophers, Karl Popper, Adolf Hitler and political psychologists Owen and Davidsons Hubris Syndrome.
He touched on Karl Poppers Falsification Theory to prove a point that Our Constitution though not clear on how to dois very specific in showing the way of un-doing things.His meticulous and in-depth analysis of the above supported his claim, I have experience in lecturing at Moratuwas Engineering Faculty.
Who is this Karl Popper
Austrian-born Karl Raimund Popper was a 20th Century British philosopher, who specialised in the philosophy of science andpolitical philosophy.
Poppers basic doctrine was that scientific theories must be verifiable and could possibly be falsified or contradicted by counter-evidence.
Theories which are not verifiable or falsifiable are merely metaphysical dogmas or pseudo-science, he asserts. He also became famous for attacking Marxism, [Champikas Moratuwa Undergraduate day passion], and he was knighted for this, and not for his controversial theory.
Influenced by Vienna Circles Positivists, Marx put forward his theory or dogma. Popper received his doctorate from the University of Vienna. However, the widely discredited Positivists views, diverged fromhis views.
Poppers doctrine itself is a scientific theory, and therefore it applies to itself; if it is factual, we can never verify that it is so! This doctrine according to many scientists is uni-dimensional it neglects many other characters a scientific theory possesseslike internal consistency and compatibility with other theories. Even most philosophers have discarded it as unsophisticated at best, though physicists generally accept it.
Scientists are great philosophers, but bad politicians!-Anon
Ranawaka, when he switched to areas alien to a scientist, like Constitution and economics, the many learned lawyers and economists in his side looked beleaguered as we witnessed over live telecast, while the rest, most of his 122 audiences were seen surfing their modern smartphones, probably, unable to comprehend the
advanced vocabulary
The other side of the chamber was empty as the Government members visited the hallowed premises for tea, refreshments and media briefings at the cost of the tax-payer However, when Ranawaka was referring to Mahinda Rajapaksas shamelessness in holding on to the position of PM [By quoting political psychologists Owen and Davidson] even after he has lost Parliamentary Approval four times and that Mahinda as an arrogant man, who never listened to anybody, but tried to glorify himself as a person who knew everything; some of the Ranil loyalists were seen grimacing with disapproval.
Who are Owen and Davidson and what is Hubris Syndrome
According to Ranawaka, the Iraq war inspired the two psychologists to undertake a study of UK Prime Ministers and US Presidents over the past 100 years. They propounded a psychological theory calledHubris Syndrome.
Let us discuss this acquired personality disorder. David Owen and Jonathan Davidson believe that severe hubristic behaviour is a syndrome, comprising a collection of features evoked by a power, and usually dispatching when power fades.
This syndrome is seen as an acquired state. The main concept is that it is a disorder of the possession of power, mainly power which has been linked with overwhelming achievement, held for a period of years and with minimal restraint on the person in charge.
Autocrats, according to the researchers are particularly prone to the syndrome because there are only a few constraints on their behaviour. Ian Kershaw, Hitlers biographer, entitled his first volume 18891936 Hubris and the second 19361945 Nemesis. In Stalins case, it was not as noticeable or as progressive as Hitlers. Mussolini and Mao both had hubris.
Castigated the Rajapaksas unforgivingly presenting facts and figures proving that he was qualified to do so having been in the Rajapaksa Circus for its full term
The capacity to make quick decisions, sometimes based on flimsy evidence, is of particular significancearguably essentialin a leader. Likewise, a thin-skinned individual will not be able to stand the procedure of public scrutiny, harassment by opponents and back-stabbings, without some form of joy over success and grand conviction about his own assignment and importance.
The syndrome is acquired over a period. The full-blown hubris, related to holding considerable power in high position, may or may not be transitory. External proceedings can manipulate the variation both in strength and time of inception. Ranawaka cited only three or four out of 14 characteristics of Hubris as time-constrained; the rest is interesting too: Hubris Syndrome was formulated as a pattern of behaviour in aperson who:
Has a tendency to take action primarily to enhance personal image; Shows disproportionate concern for image and presentation; Exhibits messianic zeal and exaltation in speech; Uses the royal we in conversation; Manifestly has contempt for others; Shows accountability only to a higher court; Displays unshakeable belief that they will be vindicated in that court; Loses contact with reality; Resorts to restlessness, Recklessness and impulsive actions; Allows moral rectitude to obviate consideration of practicality, cost or outcome; and Displays incompetence with disregard for nuts and bolts of policymaking.
Do we have more Hubris sufferers in Sri Lanka than in US and UK Of course, one can rest assured that most of our big and small party leaders past and present, [Albeit R Sampanthan] are Hubris characters.
Plotting and scheming in power game
As analysts observe, in Coups and Conspiracies in Sri Lankan politics, a noteworthy feature is the UNP leaderships demonstration of cunningness and brain power in effectively hatching a scheme, or countering such action against them, compared to their opposition. [Of course, invariably, backed byoutside forces].
Can one construe that the likes of JR Jayewardene, Lalith/Gamini and Ranil Wickremesinghe, could be a class that could be quoted as top shining examples that our post-independent periodhad produced
In the opposite camp, S.B. Dissanayake and Basil Rajapaksa stand tall as master strategists among a relatively low profile group. SB in the past was very effective though he failed miserably in his manoeuvrings at the recent debacle; it appears that his days are over. Considering inter-party cross-over scenario a distinctive feature of the UNP is that it had been the winner in almost every such instance, while SLFP and its associates were the losers. It has never happened the other way aboutthat the SLFP or its allies launching a conspiracy on UNP. In running a nation that kind of wisdom, sagacity and skill invariably becomes extremely important attributes of a leader, which the SLFP as a party badly lacks.
Relieved SWRD to make way for Dudley1951
The first PM of independent Ceylon, D. S. Senanayake, used his loyal nephew Sir John Kotalawala, who was number three in the hierarchy of the government and UNP, to implement his plans to pave the way for son Dudley to succeed him. Sir John Kotalawala misapprehended the masters exercises, concluded it would make him the next in line to replace the grand old man someday. He obliged the boss to and vilified the senior-most contender, SWRD Bandaranaike, who claimed the position of heir apparent in the 1947-52 Government.
CP de Silva Group Cross-over to Topple Sirimavo in 1964-
J. R. Jayewardene was the master manipulator of all the Parliamentary manoeuvres that went to topple the government in 1964-- Ceylon Observer: December 20, 1964. This has a close parallel to the current debacle. It happened fifty-four years ago, on December 3, 1964, during the Throne Speech vote. A betrayal by SLFPs second-in-command, Minister of Agriculture, Land and Irrigation C. P. de Silva, [Also from Polonnaruwa], and it was J.R. Jayewardene and Esmond Wickremesinghe, (Father of Ranil), who played the roles of master manipulator who got CP and 15 government MPs including Mahanama Samaraweera, father of Mangala and few others to change loyalties, and defeat the government by a mere one vote.
Sirimavo, who sat in the lower house, remained a Senator throughout her tenure on hearing the bad news she rushed to the house and met some of those who were tipped to cross over, and was successful in convincing just two of them to remain. Had she been there, surely she could have won over a few others but she intervened too late causing the fall of her democratically elected government by 74 to 73 votes.
Back to the House by the Diyawanna: the former member of the Scientific Cabinet of Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government, Champika Ranawaka who now occupies Opposition benches that holds the Bhahutharaya in a House sans Government members, castigated the Rajapaksas unforgivingly presenting facts and figures proving that he was qualified to do so having been in the Rajapaksa Circus for its full term, aiding and abetting them in all their endeavours with absolute loyalty.
Can we add a fifteenth characteristic to Owen and Davidsons Hubris Syndromes fourteen

Citizens as suckers
	
So Sri Lanka! Thats a tourism promotional line. Its more subtle and of course far less pretentious than Aasiyaave Aascharya (Miracle of Asia). In a way its more Sri Lankan come to think of it. In other words, we are a pretty laid back nation. Of course some may disagree. So lets consider the current political situation. 
We had a powerful (note the inverted commas) movement intent on delivering good governance (some would say it was more anti-Rajapaksa than pro anything else). Some in that movement were determined to abolish the executive presidency. Some talked of reestablishing democracy. To this end, they scuttled the undoubtedly anti-democratic 18th Amendment and introduced the 19th Amendment. Nihal Jayawickrema, constitutional expert, even said that the 19th had effectively pruned 80% of the presidential powers. 
Well! Today, following a court order regarding the Prime Minister and Cabinet following the sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa in his place, theres just one individual with power. Thats Maithripala Sirisena, President. Sure, all that could change once the Supreme Court (finally) delivers its determination on the issue of dissolution, but for all intents and purposes, as of now, power and the president are roughly synonymous.
At any rate, let us not put things in the hands of god so to speak. Thats a mischievous hope, let me admit
	None of the prominent political leaders are operating in the peoples interest
The true test of power or rather in whom or what position most power resides is resolved by answering a simple question: which individual can effect the most amount of change with the least amount of effort Well, we know the answer to that question now. Sirisena signed a couple of papers and a few weeks later So Sri Lanka is a country without a prime minister or a cabinet, it has a Parliament thats like a circus, a Speaker who thinks hes the Executive and a judiciary that is sitting on a decision (of course probably for good reason). 
No riots, no great public agitation. Nothing like France, for example. That could all change very quickly, but six weeks after Sirisena did the unthinkable, so to speak, life goes on. Let that not lull us into complacency though. More importantly, let us be wary of the do-gooders of the moment. 
Am I saying that those who are concerned are mischievous and have motives that have little to do with their rhetoric No. It is good that people are concerned and that they voice their concerns. The problem is that the main issue is being skirted, in the main. 
Lets get some facts straight. None of the prominent political leaders are operating in the peoples interest. None of the major political parties are interested in the people. They will say they are for the people, they will claim their politics is to further the best interests of the nation, but one doesnt need to have studied politics deeply to understand that personal goals are what matter most. In the case of parties, it is about obtaining or retaining power. 
Just think of the democracy-demanding set. Were they really ever serious about democracy or are they suddenly upset because certain political developments have tripped Ranil Wickremesinghe and the United National Party Some may argue that Sirisenas moves exceeded by quite a margin all anti-democratic acts perpetrated by the Yahapalanists (Wickremesinghe and the UNP included) since January 2015. The issue is that a crime is a crime. Wrongdoing is wrongdoing. We can talk relative merits or demerits, but one has to hold ones nose before supporting any wrongdoer. 
As of now, the entire state apparatus, judiciary included, is designed for wrongdoing; it is patently anti-people. You leave apparatus and process intact while arguing for change or rather batting for one party or another, one individual as opposed to another, and you are essentially supporting one crook or set of crooks over another. For whatever reason. 
At some level it is ridiculous to talk about elections or quibble about the integrity of the existing system or scream about upholding a constitution that is anti-people. The question is and should be sovereignty. The constitution along with amendments do not support sovereignty. The institutional arrangement does not affirm sovereignty. The processes are not people-friendly, they dont affirm the notion of sovereignty. 
In short, all demonstrations by all parties to this conflict are essentially framed in a manner that does not in any way threaten the overall status quo. That status quo is not about political personalities or political parties, but a system of exploitation, a system which constantly sanctions oppression of one kind or another. 
All those who talk politics without factoring in people (outside of the rhetoric that is) and ignoring the overarching structural realities are essentially negotiating for political advantages of one set of crooks over another. 
One word about protests and protesters. Scratch most of them and youll find a colour. A colour associated with a party. A good rule of thumb is to figure out who they are targeting. That will tell you who they are supporting and protecting. That will show the colour of their bias and the extent of their servility. 
Can we go beyond all this Perhaps. First and foremost, we need to shed illusions about democracy and the system (constitution and judiciary included) and sever fixations to personalities and parties. That might get us somewhere. If not, we might as well call ourselves citizen suckers. That would be So Sri Lanka sad to say, but we can reinvent ourselves so that we can be So Sri Lankan in a more affirmative manner, that recognizes realities and do something about it. Maybe we are all biding our time. Lets hope so. 
At any rate, let us not put things in the hands of god so to speak. Thats a mischievous hope, let me admit. The entire process is being determined by individuals and their religious convictions could come into play (lets hope they rise above all that, but let us not be too innocent either). There are born-again democrats and born-again theists in this game. Think about it.

In a world of  contradictions
	
The heavy debates regarding the present political crisis in the country continue on social media, especially on Facebook, leaving the country at large rather peaceful.At present there is no prime minister, government ministers and a Cabinet, but with only a president in office this nation continues to function; giving hiccups to the outside world which has been critical of the present political situation in Sri Lanka.
When it comes to facing crises there is something about Sri Lanka. The islanders have some inner ability to bounce back after a fall, largely when the crisis is associated with a natural disaster. But the man-made disasters often take quite some time to be settled; the best example being the war against Tiger rebels which was finally finished off after a struggle which lasted for almost three -decades.
We have negotiated well the effects of world recession and the often occurring floods, but we mustnt get cocky. This time a tsunami erupted in parliament due to a faulty Constitution and the high handed acts of the Executive. Now the country is worried about a 2019 Budget that must be presented and passed in parliament.
Despite the political stalemate President Sirisena carries on functioning as if not bothered by the fact that the state establishment is severely jolted
	Sirisena has said that there is no disruption or violence in the country because the people are nurtured by the Buddhist culture
	He has said that the media has played the issue up as a crisis. Sirisena has added that the present political issue isnt a serious matter in his opinion
	But the JVP claims that the president is taking the credit for the positives of the 19th A and passes the buck on its negatives to the others
	We are a nation that appoints the most unsuitable representatives to Parliament and then tolerate their nonsense
	We are only short of bad politicians who would not know how to fatten their purses if they were given an opportunity to serve the people
A Government needs finances to function. The present impasse and court cases indicate that a solution to the stalemate would be delayed before it finally arrives. Parliamentarian Dr. Harsha de Silva warned that an economic crisis is in the offing. De Silva says that the president has no power to control state finances. He adds that the president is not vested with the power to spend finances for the four months starting January. There is another impending danger of Sri Lankas financial mess being dragged to a further low if the Supreme Court judgement on the dissolution of parliament is not delivered by December 14. This is because the Court Vacation commences after this Friday (December 14) and continues till early January.
Despite the political stalemate President Sirisena carries on functioning as if not bothered by the fact that the state establishment is severely jolted. He has praised the people of the country for the peace that prevails. Sirisena has said that there is no disruption or violence in the country because the people are nurtured by the Buddhist culture. He has also acknowledged the contribution by all religions to the moral conduct of the citizenry as a whole. Sirisena also knows or believes that the political impasse will not create bloodshed on the streets; akin to some Middle Eastern nations. The biggest critics of the Government have been Britain, Japan and the USA.
But Sirisena maintains that the foreign nations remain friends of Sri Lanka. He has said that the media has played the issue up as a crisis. Sirisena has added that the present political issue isnt a serious matter in his opinion. But the British Government has maintained that it is extremely concerned about Sri Lankas current political situation which is causing great damage to the country, both politically and economically.
positive piece of legislation
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution was passed during the Yahapalana regime with Sirisena as the president. The amendment annulled the powers the president had to dissolve parliament anytime; a privilege the the 18th Amendment gave the president. But the president went back on the promise which he gave the people regarding this clause by dissolving parliament before the stipulated four and a half years finished. Naturally the president has been labelled as a man full of contradictions.
Sirisena has maintained that the 19th is a positive piece of legislation. The president has said that the 19th strengthens democratic institutions, upholds human rights and ensures judicial independence. But the JVP claims that the president is taking the credit for the positives of the 19th A and passes the buck on its negatives to the others.
President Sirisena vowed to restore the present political crisis within a week., but has later said that he would wait for the Supreme Court decision on the case filed against his order to dissolve parliament. Now we see a woman filling a petition in court seeking a court order to examine the presidents state of mind.
Given all what the president is saying and doing the countrys citizenry is awaits patiently to see what hed do next. This is because there is only Sirisena that they have to deal with given that there are no other members forming the lawmakers collective; which under a normal circumstance wed call the Cabinet. For the record this situation arose following a court order banning the members of the Sirisena-Rajapaksa Government from functioning in their capacities as ministers.
We are a nation that appoints the most unsuitable representatives to Parliament and then tolerate their nonsense. We voted for this president and can now only grieve due to the position he has put us in. The president has the gumption to tell the media that there is no violence in the country because the people have put the country before self. Isnt this a virtue that all government ministers should adopt in their thinking
We are not short of food, drinking water and fuel apart from the cold environment in December to comfort us during this crisis. We are only short of bad politicians who would not know how to fatten their purses if they were given an opportunity to serve the people.
As the political tug-of-war continues we have no other option but to grit our teeth and and watch....but for how long

However, the final decision will be taken after the Supreme Court rules on the case challenging the legitimacy of the new government that was formed on October 26. (Kelum Bandara)

Not ready to work with Ranil at any cost: Prez
	
In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling today, President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have told the parliamentary group of the UPFA that he is not ready to work with UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at any cost.
After the court ruling was announced, the group met with the President. At this meeting, it decided not to be party to any national unity government with the UNP hereafter.
A party source said that if any of their members join hands with the UNP, it could not be construed as a party decision but an individual decision on the part of this member. (Kelum Bandara)

Parliament still should be dissolved: Anura
	
While praising the verdict delivered by the Supreme Court that President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to dissolve Parliament was unconstitutional and illegal, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today parliament should still be dissolved.
Speaking to the media after the deliverance of the verdict at the Supreme Court premises, he said there are three steps that needed to be taken in parliament, such as making laws to punish the conspirators of this political crisis, passing the 20th amendment and bringing in a resolution to dissolve Parliament.
It is clear that both Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa have acted unconstitutionally and undemocratically. Lets not forget that the undemocratic tactics of Ranil Wickremesinghe,
Hence, the JVP is of the opinion that there is no moral and democratic right for the team of Mr. Wickremesinghe to represent people in Parliament. The current parliament does not reflect the public opinion, Dissanayake said.
He said they would continue to launch their struggle to restore real democracy.
Nevertheless, he said one of the main reasons to end up in this political turmoil in this country is the executive presidency and therefore JVP would bring in a resolution in parliament to get the 20th Amendment passed. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Parties gear up  for elections pending court ruling
	
Ahead of the court ruling, the UNP opted to move a vote of confidence in Parliament for its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to become the Prime Minister.
The political gridlock takes a turn for the worse each passing day pending the ruling by the Supreme Court on Fundamental Rights Applications filed in regards to dissolution of Parliament. It is even compounded by the fact that the Court of Appeal has restrained Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Cabinet from functioning.
Against this backdrop, President Maithripala Sirisena convened a meeting of the Government members, including Rajapaksa, on Monday to take stock of the current crisis and to decide on the way forward. The Cabinet Ministers opined that a huge volume of work remained incomplete at their ministries since they had no way of dispensing with them under the current circumstances triggered by the restraining order
If the court rules to the effect that the dissolution of Parliament by the President is alright, it will be a political bonus for the Government which is agitating for a General Election
	The faction led by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) commonly called Pohottuwa group stands for relinquishing office in the Government to reorganise the party if the Court rules out dissolution
They said that there were vital functions to be discharged only with their signatures, but nothing could be done due to the restraining order. As such President Sirisena said that he would engage the Supreme Court through the Attorney General to give the ruling as early as possible. The Government is truly engulfed in a crisis. It is at a loss how to break the impasse. Let alone, it decided to work out its next strategy only after the Court ruling is given.
Pending the court ruling, the Government decided to be ready to face any eventuality. If the court rules to the effect that the dissolution of Parliament by the President is alright, it will be a political bonus for the Government which is agitating for a General Election. Otherwise, the Government or the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has to give mind to what should be done. If that is the case, the Government decided at the meeting that it would honour the verdict by the countrys highest court and work out the next political strategy depending on the circumstances.
The UPFA is divided on this matter and harbours two schools of thought. The faction led by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) commonly called Pohottuwa group stands for relinquishing office in the Government to reorganise the party if the Court rules out dissolution. Nevertheless, the other group, primarily consisting of the UPFA allies, opines that fresh attempts should be made to strengthen the government and proceed without allowing the UNP to take over power.
For the second time in a week, the UPFA gave serious thought  to the present predicament when it met again with the President on Tuesday evening at the Presidential Secretariat. The meeting lasted for an hour.
Come what may, the President instructed all the alliance partners to remain as a well-knit group to face future elections. He said the year 2019 would be an election year, and therefore all the political forces, opposed to the United National Party (UNP), should firm up. Citing that any discord among these parties and group would not augur well for the future, he asked them to meet at least once a week to sort out issues cropping up on and off.
At the meeting, the MPs such as Wimal Weerawansa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara interpreted the Constitution to drive home their point that dissolution of Parliament could be referred to approval of people by referendum in case the Supreme Court rules otherwise.
According to the Constitution, the President can refer to the people by referendum any matter which is of national importance in his opinion. These two Ministers referred to this particular clause in the Constitution. The President did not give a direct reply to them. Instead, he asked a public opinion to be created in this respect. 
Besides, at this meeting, he was, once again, critical of UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. In his latest tirade against the UNP leadership, he said that Wickremesinghe did not allow him to do anything during the last three and half years. He said Wickremesinghe was so enraged by the release of the report on the Central Banks bond fraud that he behaved like a mad man.
Subsequent to the release of the report, the President said certain investigative officers were threatened and some even tried to flee the country in fear.Kalutara district MP Vidura Wickramanayake chipped in at this point and asked as to why the President, as the Head of State, did not retort Wickremesinghe.Mr. Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister. But, you are the President. You could have retorted him with more vigour if he tried to undermine your work, he told the President. Afterwards, the President responded saying that he had to restrain himself on such occasions. 
Parties brace for elections
Whatever the court ruling might be, both the UNP and the SLPP are preparing for elections by reviving their organisational mechanisms at grassroots level. SLPP convened all its electoral organisers for a meeting on Tuesday in Colombo to weigh the present status of politics and gear up for any election at any given time. Likewise, the UNP is conducting its electoral organisations meetings (Bala Mandala) countrywide in an apparent move to position the party to face elections.
Ahead of the court ruling, the UNP opted to move a vote of confidence in Parliament for its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to become the Prime Minister. The UNP moved such a motion yesterday despite the tough stand taken by the President not to reappoint Wickremesinghe to the post, no matter what.
In general, the idea for a change in the party leadership has gained ground at present. Be that as it may, the UNP believes Wickremesinghe should be appointed as the Prime Minister this time. For that purpose, it is wooing the support of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to obtain the required majority of 113 MPs. It involves a political cost for the UNP. The TNA, at least a section of it, insists that the UNP should commit to address some of their key grievances as a condition for their support.
The acceptance of these demands such as the merger of the north and the east and the release of the LTTE suspects would cost the UNP dearly in doing politics in the Sinhala majority areas of the country. As a result, UNP Chairman of the Kegalle district MP Kabir Hashim was at pain at a political meeting in Ruwanwella on Tuesday to assure people that no such agreement was reached with the TNA for its support in Parliament.
No smooth sailing for UNP
All the parties position themselves for elections next year in this manner. Even if the Supreme Court rules out dissolution, the political parties will be compelled at one point to go for a parliamentary election by passing a resolution in Parliament with a two-third of the votes. For that purpose, there is clear- cut constitutional provision.
In case, the UNP forms a new Government using its parliamentary majority ensured by the TNAs support, it wont be as strong as it used to be prior to October 26, 2018. It is bound to be a minority Government. First and foremost, the UPFA will not team up with the UNP again to form a national Unity Government. Alongside, the UNP will have to work under the President who is even more hostile to it under the latest developments.  
The President would assert himself in full measure when such a Government discharges its duties, using powers vested upon him as the Head of State. By all accounts, it will not be smooth sailing for the UNP to administrate a Government. Finally, the circumstances would prevail upon all the parties, willingly or unwilling, to opt for a general elections at an agreed time. Already, discussions are underway in this direction. It will happen probably during the first half of next year.

Prez requests UPFA MPs to create public opinion
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have asked for creation of public opinion on the conduct of a referendum on dissolution of Parliament, in case the Supreme Court rules out.
At the meetings of the parliamentary group of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that a referendum would be appropriate at this time to seek public opinion on the dissolution of Parliament.
The President, however, did not commit to call for a referendum. Instead, he asked these MPs to create public opinion in this regard.
According to the Constitution, the President has the power to refer any matter of national importance, in his opinion, to people by referendum. However, the verdict of people at a referendum is not legally binding. (Kelum Bandara)

Rebel cadre turned politician  rules out  re-emergence of war
	
K. Thulasi is a former LTTE cadre who had been well versed in handling firearms when LTTE activities were at its height in the north. However, he had given up the use of firearms during the final stage of separatist war that took place in Mulliwaikkal in Jaffna and surrendered to the Sri Lanka Army. Following rehabilitation, under the Sri Lanka Army, he entered politics and became the leader of a political party on behalf of militants. The political party he leads operates under the name Liberation Campaigners of the North. This is how he expressed his views about the war that concluded in the north in reply to questions asked by journalists. According to the present political system in the country, I state with responsibility that no such war would erupt again in this country. If somebody thinks that a solution can be found by means of such a war, it is an act of sheer folly because I do not think that such a person has gained the experience in war like us. I can talk about the war with responsibility because I continued gaining experience as a militant and handled firearms until the finals hours of the war in Mulliwaikkal. All leaders of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), including Prabhakaran, were killed in the presence of our eyes. After that incident, we surrendered to the Army for want of a leader, said Thulasi before answering a barrage of questions.
Excerpts:
Q Let us speak about the war at first. What are your views about another war Will it erupt again There was an environment in which people were in a quandary about the war in the recent past. What is your view given the experience you have had
As I already told you, I repeat with responsibility that a war will not erupt again. The people who live at present are not those who lived during the wartime. All have changed. Whether they are Tamils or Sinhalese, they all have understood that the war is unnecessary. Although we waged war for 30 years, there is nothing that we earned.
Q Even though nine years have passed after the war, it has a huge impact on the people, even today. The loans obtained by Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people during wartime are being repaid by them at present. Your comments.
If there was no war, we need not have spent more than Rs 20 for a kilo of sugar. A kilo of flour might not have cost more than Rs. 30. The price of fuel would not have gone up. That is the reason why a wage earner who obtains about Rs.1000 or 1200 daily and buys goods for this money can carry them in a single shopping bag. That is how the war has impacted the ordinary man. In these circumstances, nobody except a fool, would think that a war is necessary.
If somebody thinks that a solution can be found by means of such a war, it is an act of sheer folly because I do not think that such a person has gained the experience in war like us. I can talk about the war with responsibility
The people who live at present are not those who lived during the wartime. All have changed
Although we waged war for 30 years, there is nothing that we earned
There were nearly 600,000 people in the areas under the control of LTTE. Despite all these developments, we could not win Eelam
Q There are various allegations and one is that since there are former LTTE leaders still alive there is a possibility of a war erupting any time. What is your opinion
I would like to tell the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people one thing as a member of a political party as well as a former LTTE cadre. During the war, 70% of the management was under the LTTE. Likewise, 20,000 members were recruited by the LTTE directly. Prabhakaran came under their security. The Tiger leaders were armed to the teeth with most modern military equipment. There were nearly 600,000 people in the areas under the control of LTTE. Despite all these developments, we could not win Eelam or achieve any of our targets. There is not an iota of truth in the statements made by the people outside Sri Lanka that their demands can be won by waging war.
We are the ones who were at the forefront during the final stage of the war at Mulli Waikkal in Mullathivu. It was on the night of May 17, 2009 that we surrendered to the Sri Lanka Army. It was then only that Major General Kamal Gunarathna came to the scene. Even, he was not in a position tell who died and who survived nor could Karuna Amman or Daya Master talk about those who died or disappeared. We, who were in the battlefront say that all Tiger leaders including Prabhakaran died during the final stage of the war. Those who surrendered to the Army were the other cadres who accepted the fact that a war was not necessary. We understood it during the final stage of the war. We say so as people who carried arms, having observed all that happened with our own eyes, but not by using YouTube or a book.
Q Do you think persons who were rehabilitated and those who didnt follow this process are of the opinion that there is a need for a separate state or separate form of rule
There is no problem in the Tamil people living under a unitary state. But Sinhala people think it is as a problem. In the same way, all of us who returned to our homes after rehabilitation look forward to receive a fair decision. Then, nobody would think that it is necessary to divide the country, have a separate form of rule or stage another war. This country would not have deteriorated if the Sinhala and Tamil leaders got together and took a decision following discussions. By this time, the loss in terms of people and properties cannot be estimated in the form of money. It was not only the Tamil leaders, among the dead were Sinhala leaders and ordinary people. All this was a result of the war.
Q What is your opinion regarding the problems that emerged due to war and the problems associated with the people who disappeared and the intervention of international forces
On behalf of all the Sinhala people who died during the war, we extend an apology at this moment to the Sinhala people. All this happened due to the war in which our organization fought in order to fulfill our objectives. In the same way, we request the Sinhala people to look into the grievances of the Tamil people whose family members died at Mulli Waikkal. We are the people who live in the same country. It is we who should have discussions to find a solution to the problems that may emerge. I pointed out to members of delegations from America and Canada who met me recently about the problems that Tamils face. The problems that emerged due to the war have been referred to a third party. But, I say that these problems have been aggravated due to the fact that we referred them to the international community.
We are not late. Let us discuss and find a way in which all people in the country can live together. Then, we may have a good future. We should not tell others about our problems. We should settle our problems by ourselves.

We who were in the battlefront say that all Tiger leaders including Prabhakaran died during the final stage of the war
We say so as people who carried arms, having observed all that happened with our own eyes, but not by using YouTube or a book
This country would not have deteriorated if the Sinhala and Tamil leaders got together
On behalf of all the Sinhala people who died during the war, we extend an apology at this moment to the Sinhala people
Q What made you take up politics after resorting to an armed struggle and subsequent rehabilitation
It was not the Tiger organisation alone that resorted to a struggle. They waged war due to the prevailing political environment in the country. After the war, it was understood that the Tamil people would not be benefitted by Tamil politics. That is the reason why we decided to enter politics. As former Tiger cadres, we were confronted with economic problems when we returned home after rehabilitation. There is no proper employment. Nine years has passed after war, but many people are unemployed. They should be employed. For instance, education is not required for jobs like security guards in a hospital or jobs in the Civil Security Force. There is a problem about their age limits. I think it is better for the government to provide employment opportunities after considering everything.
Q What is your opinion about the prevailing political situation in the north and east after taking to politics
As a result of the Provincial Council Elections held in 2013, Tamil people experienced some sort of change or redress. In future, whatever the election that is held, there is a ray of hope that Tamil people would support the Tamil National Alliance because Tamil people do not like division in their votes. It is a sheer waste of time to talk about Vigneswaran or Anandasangari or Ananda Shashidaran or other minority parties. They do not do anything good for Tamil people or the country. Our party has teamed up with the Tamil National Alliance. We hope to do the best we can on behalf of the Tamil people.
Q What are your plans for the Tamil people and the country in the future
I would like to give a message on behalf of our party to the people comprising all communities. During our youth, without any employment or a sound education, we lived in the forests and waged a war. We even kept aloof from our community. We lost our youth. But, after the war, we mixed and mingled with our community. They accepted us. It is now only that we have begun to live happily.
We have removed the word war from our minds. Therefore, we would like to tell one thing to this Government. The LTTE wasnt an organisation that blindly waged an armed struggle. There were very rich as well as educated people among its cadres. Likewise, there are similar members of the society in our party as well. We are ready to serve our country well.

SC rules dissolution of parliament illegal
	
A fuller Bench of seven Supreme Court (SC) Justices today unanimously ruled that President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to dissolve parliament on November 9, before the completion of four and half years, was unconstitutional and illegal.
The highly anticipated judgement, delivered before a packed court of lawyers, MPs and journalists, further upheld that the Presidents action was an arbitrary Executive act which had violated the fundamental right of equal protection of the law(Article 12(1)) of the Petitioners.
Chief Justice Nalin Perera, Justices Prasanna Jayawardena, Priyantha Jayawardena, Vijith K Malalgoda, Buwenaka Aluvihare, and Murdu Fernando (six Justices) agreeing in one judgement decided that the President had violated the Constitution and exceeded his legal limits by dissolving the parliament. The Judgement held that the President had violated the rights of citizens and parliamentarians, and ordered that the gazette proclamation be quashed and pronounced null and void. The Bench also ruled that the said proclamation was null and void, and had no force or effect in law.
Justice Sisira de Abrew, while agreeing with the CJ's judgement, gave a separate judgement saying that under Article 70(1) of the Constitution, the president could not dissolve parliament before four and half years at his own will, or without a two-thirds resolution being passed by parliament. And he declared that the proclamation made dissolving parliament on November 9, 2018 by the President be void ab initio.(S.S. Selvanayagam, Farook T. Thajudeen and Shehan Chamika Silva)

Sugar tax and sugar-coated proposals
	
President Maithripala Sirisena who was once appalled by the sugar content in a popular malt beverage, is now stoically silent on a move to slash a sugar tax. His silence about efforts to reverse his own initiative, where he made a public call to extend the sugar tax to all sweetened beverages, comes as no surprise however given the ongoing political stalemate in the country. 
In the midst of the power struggle that Sri Lanka is embroiled in, the finance ministry earlier this month ordered an immediate 40% reduction in the duty, following a meeting with industry stakeholders. While beverage manufacturers cheered on, the move was quick to receive criticism from health advocates, including former health minister Rajitha Senaratna, who condemned the move as irresponsible and damaging towards the fight against non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
The levy was introduced last year, where a tax of 50 cents per gramme of sugar was imposed on sweetened beverages. These taxes were part of the previous governments strategy to suppress the alarming spread of NCDs in the country. A leading beverage manufacturer in Sri Lanka revealed that it experienced a 30% drop in sales volumes following the introduction of the tax in November 2017. It also encouraged several beverage brandsto introduce sugar free variants of popular drinks. 
Sri Lankans are used to consuming a lot of sugar with their tea, even as much as nine teaspoons per day on an average, which was a boost for the manufacturers
Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardena noted, that the business community was grateful for this concession, adding that the Finance Ministry was directed to exempt soft drinks which contain less than six grammes of sugar and sweetened fruit beverages by up to nine grammes from the levy. The Ministry has been instructed to cut the tax to 30 cents from the earlier 50 cents per gramme of sugar. 
Efforts undermined
Health campaigners however are not pleased with this move. Director of the Non-Communicable Disease Alliance of Sri Lanka, Dr. Mahen Wijesuriya says the move only benefits manufacturers of sweetened beverages but not the consumer. The consumer would make purchases according to their preference of a beverage, nobody measures the sugar content in their food, Dr. Wijesuriya said. But the drop from 50 to 30 cents per gramme is something we dont appreciate. We feel it is done not for the benefit of the general public but for the benefit of the manufacturer alone. That may be the business angle of it but we are deeply worried that further reductions and similar measures would come about. We dont like this trend of reductions, he exclaimed. 
He points that while there was no sugar tax before, former minister Senaratna implemented the tax through a Cabinet decision, noting of the strong the advocacy behind the implementation. This tax prevailed until the new government as you call it came into power. We had been requesting authorities to analyze the content of sweetened beverages to make it mandatory for manufacturers to indicate the sugar content on labels of all beverages. This too did not materialise, Dr. Wijesuriya laments. He added that efforts were also underway to establish a similar practice for solids such as cakes and other sweetened foods by younger consumers. 
He believes that Sri Lankan consumers were gradually getting accustomed to this reduction. What we were trying to do is not to eliminate sugar completely but to reduce consumption. Sri Lankans are used to consuming a lot of sugar with their tea, even as much as nine teaspoons per day on an average, which was a boost for the manufacturers. We never received a consultation on the subject. I dont think the minister of the previous government would agree with the move but today there is no law and order, so they can do whatever they want. This is what we are worried about. Asked of his organisations next move, he said that they would make an appeal as soon as a new government is in place.

Nation at risk
Dr. Wijesuriya is not alone in criticising the reduction. While analysts predict that new measures could reduce soft drink prices by 30% public health advocates took to twitter to condemn the governments negative public health policies. Meanwhile the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) issuing a statement urged authorities to refrain from taking a final decision on the matter, in a letter addressed to Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Asked if they had received any response to their request, Dr. Haritha Aluthge of the GMOA said there has been no response as there is no government in place. A trade union leader of a local beverage manufacturer has however expressed concern over the GMOAs statement. Their concern was that our statement would persuade the government not to reduce the taxes imposed on sweetened beverages which could affect their industry. Yet, the worrying factor for the GMOA is not the economic aspect of this, but the health aspect. What we have said in our press statement and the letter addressed to the new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is that if the government wants to promote the industry and also to reduce the taxes, the only way around it is that you improve the technology. This way, you can safely reduce the amount of sugar and promote the beverage with the reduction of taxes, Dr. Aluthge opines. 
He opines that the government puts the health of the nation at grave risk. As everyone is aware, NCDs like diabetes and hypertension are rising rapidly. In about 20 to 30 years the nation will face a severe crisis, if the trend continues. This is our concern and I have already asked the trade union leader who approached us to make a formal representation, he said. Though he isnt confident that any trade union will make such a representation as they are already aware of the stance taken by the GMOA. We will await a representation to discuss the matter, he adds. 
Of the total number of deaths reported here, more than three quarters are caused by NCDs. In 2016, it was estimated that 10,000 deaths are caused by diabetes each year. Females were identified to be at more risk with the prevalence of diabetes related risk factors
The GMOA meanwhile has requested the health minister of the new government Chamal Rajapaksa to appoint a committee in order to make a technical evaluation on the matter. The GMOA strongly believes that such matters should be deliberated. If you take Glyphosate for instance, the agro-chemical was banned on technical grounds, but later on they decided to lift the ban on political grounds, not taking any technical details into consideration. This is a similar situation where the taxation was carefully drafted and discussed while health advocacy was taken into decision making. However without any input from the health ministry, they have just taken a political decision to reduce the taxes. This is wrong and we have requested an opportunity for evaluation to consider both sides of the argument. he notes. 
The GMOA also said it held a meeting with the Health Secretary where they requested to have formal representations made with the relevant authorities. Even though there is no government, the secretaries of ministries are capable of taking decisions with the President, Dr. Aluthge commented. 


Why a sugar tax
Of the total number of deaths reported in Sri Lanka more than three quarters are caused by NCDs. In 2016, it was estimated that 10,000 deaths are caused by diabetes each year. Females were identified to be at more risk with the prevalence of diabetes related risk factors. 
Health experts point out that a daily intake of sugar exceeding the recommended amount will eventually lead to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and tooth decay among a host of non-communicable diseases. They also stress on the need to inculcate the habit of a sugar free lifestyle, especially among youngsters. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a solid daily intake of sugar should not exceed more than 25 grammes per day.
Their guidelines state that in order to prevent obesity and tooth decay, adults and children must reduce their consumption of free sugars to less than 10% of their daily energy intake (equivalent to around 12 teaspoons of table sugar for adults). Governments meanwhile are recommended to take a number of actions to improve availability and access to healthy foods, to encourage healthy diet choices.

70th Commemoration of Intl Human Rights Day  We cant train HR defenders; they are  born in strugg
	
Honouring the day the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the Civil Society and Trade Unions Collective assembled a group of people who stood by the ideals of democracy, freedom and independence.
In the afternoon of December 10, 2018, at the Jasmine Hall, BMICH, the organizers lined up an array of charismatic speakers to address an audience comprising religious leaders and human rights activists. 
First up was Philip Dissanayake, Executive Director of the Right to Life Human Rights Centre. This year we have gathered to celebrate International Human Rights Day as an anarchic state without a government, he began. It only seemed apt that the line of discussion for the evening examined the current political crisis of the country which was controversially threatening civil rights. He went on to identify the driving force of the human rights movement, which was to defeat this political coup. 
He described how the 19th Amendment enabled the judiciary to rise to its present status of power, allowing it to have taken the decisions it did with regard to the constitutional crisis. This, he stated, allowed the people to restore their faith in the legal institution. Furthermore, he said that over time the amendment had dispensed a level of independence among government servants. The intervention of the Police Commission to prevent the arbitrary executive action of transferring 54 policemen was the example he provided. 
With regard to the ordeal at hand, he expressed, This political struggle has paved the way for progressive people of the nation to flock together regardless of racial, religious, party and colour differences...people who have never come forward before have taken to the streets in the name of democracy, J. C. Weliamuna Presidents Counsel while also pointing out the importance of preserving the 19A in the light of securing fundamental human rights, addressed the underestimated sovereignty of the masses, their decisive role in the political arena and the consequent changes they are capable of making. He presented three requests in honour of the ceremonious day: For the masses to support the rights of the policemen whose institution has made vast progress since four years ago, for the media to preserve and promote human rights and be weary of the ethical disruption fed through television screens to youngsters and finally for political leaders to kindly follow the very constitutional laws taught to children on state-issued textbooks. 
The forum accommodated the views of several human rights defendants representing institutions like the Uva Shakthi Foundation and the National Trade Unions Front. They presented issues about the rights of female government workers, maternity leave rights that have been denied to them, the disregard of employee reports made to commissioners etc. 
Dr. Nimalka Fernando, Commissioner, Office on Missing Persons recalled the struggles of the past, the self-sacrifices of local human rights activists whose efforts should not be belittled nor reversed in the face of this current breach of order. We cannot train Human Rights defenders, they are born in the struggle, she quoted Pakistani human rights activist Hina Jilani.
It is a dissipation of hesitation and fear in the common man that these speakers claimed they strive for. Their goal is to conquer the unlawful, which according to Mr. Dissanayake, is a battle won by over 80%. Having even engaged in over a fortnight of silent protesting at the Viharamahadevi Park, they expressed their determination to withstand these political obstacles, keeping in mind that according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all men and women are entitled to the right to life, liberty and nationality, to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, to work, to be educated, [and] to take part in government.

The Return of Rahul - EDITORIAL
	
Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. - Napoleon Bonaparte

Till a few days back Rahul Gandhi had a nickname that no poll victory could erase off. Its Pappu which means loser. However everything has changed overnight. The Congress partys spectacular victory in the assembly polls in Hindu hinterland of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh has made people see the young Congress President in a new light. There is a metamorphosis of a new leader. By the time Rahul Gandhi completed one year as the President of Congress party on December 12, the Gandhi scion was seen as a well-worthy candidate for premiership of India at next years Lok Sabha elections.
While farmer woes, unemployment, demonetization, GST and a plethora of other factors have been attributed to the ruling BJPs defeat in the Hindu heartland, the Congress and other opposition parties have pointed out to something else too that mattered. That is the attitude  the arrogance of the BJP leaders in the face of the mounting grievances of the ordinary man. Besides Rahul Gandhi even former Prime Minister Deve Gawda commented on this fact. People have made this nation arrogance-free by voting out BJP Gawda who is the national President of the Janata Dal party has said.
With PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, both not being people persons, there was an apparent gulf between these leaders and the common man which continued to be widened. Perhaps the BJP thought that playing the Hindutva card was a panacea for all ills. Given their authoritarian nature the party rank and file too could not muster courage to convey the mounting public grievances to these two stalwarts. The result was an unexpected drubbing, a virtual rout at the recently held assembly polls.
One cannot but wonder, if this was the result of the Hindu hinterland, what awaits the BJP in other states where there is a strong minority presence, at next years Lok Sabha polls. Given the strong far right-wing policies adopted by the Modi government with the mockery of racism it had made in States like Uttar Pradesh and the manner in which the regional and fringe parties are now rallying around Rahul Gandhi, it is certain that 2019 is going to be a tough year for Narendra Modi.The leader of the BahujanSamaj Party (BSP) and four time chief minister of Uttar Pradesh(UP) Mayawati yesterday extended support to Congress to reach 116- seat majority in Madhya Pradesh. The Samajwadi Party led by former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav too has said Congress has his partys support in the state.
Among the many strategies adopted by Rahul Gandhi in the recently concluded polls was the move to get the youth leaders work in tandem with the old guard. One of the obvious mistakes made by Congress at past elections was the two-level leadership during campaigns -- with seniors working with Sonia Gandhi while young leaders who mostly are Rahul Gandhis personal friends working as another team. With Rahul Gandhi taking over party mantle last year there had been some genuine efforts to bring the youth leaders and the veterans under one umbrella.
This time in Madhya Pradesh young Jyotiraditya Scindia worked together with senior hand Kamal Nath while young Sachin Pilot joined hands with veteran Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan to oust BJP Chief Minister Vasundara Raje Scindia of the prominent Scindia royal family. Incidentally Vasundara is the aunt of Jyotiraditya Scindia.
PM Modi has tweeted that he accepted the peoples mandate with humility and had congratulated Congress in a true gentlemanly manner. Perhaps Prime Minister Modi could have narrowed the margin of defeat and even carried away the state of Madhya Pradesh if he practised more humility and narrowed the gap between party leadership and the ordinary voter.

Theresa May survives confidence vote of Tory MPs
	
Prime Minister Theresa May has won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party by 200 to 117.
After securing 63% of the total vote, she is now immune from a leadership challenge for a year.
Speaking in Downing Street, she vowed to deliver the Brexit "people voted for" but said she had listened to the concerns of MPs who voted against her.
Her supporters urged the party to move on but critics said losing the support of a third of MPs was "devastating".
The prime minister won the confidence vote with a majority of 83, with 63% of Conservative MPs backing her and 37% voting against her.
The secret ballot was triggered by 48 of her MPs angry at her Brexit policy, which they say betrays the 2016 referendum result.
Speaking shortly after the result was announced, Mrs May said she would be fighting for changes to her Brexit deal at an EU summit on Thursday.
"I am pleased to have received the backing of my colleagues in tonight's ballot," she said.
"Whilst I am grateful for that support, a significant number of colleagues did cast a vote against me and I have listened to what they said."
She spoke of a "renewed mission - delivering the Brexit people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that really works for everyone".
Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for the confidence vote, said losing the support of a third of her MPs was a "terrible result for the prime minister" and called on her to resign.
Brexit-backing Tory MP Mark Francois told the BBC it was "devastating" that more than half of backbenchers not serving in the government had abandoned the prime minister.
"In the cold light of day when people reflect on that number - 117 - it's a massive number, far more than anyone was predicting. I think that will be very sobering for the prime minister. I think she needs to think very carefully about what she does now."
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling conceded there were "lessons" for the prime minister and the party in the result but former cabinet minister Damian Green said it was a "decisive" victory for the prime minister, which should allow her to "move on and get on with the job in hand".
Conservative grandee Nicholas Soames urged Brexiteers to "throw their weight" behind the PM as she sought to address the "grave concerns" many MPs had about aspects of the EU deal.
The result was greeted by cheers and applause from Tory MPs as it was announced by backbench Tory chairman Sir Graham Brady.
The prime minister still faces a battle to get the Brexit deal she agreed with the EU through the UK Parliament, with all opposition parties and, clearly, dozens of her own MPs against it. (BBC)

To reach a port one must sail
	
Nelson Mandela
A few days ago Radhika Coomaraswamy wrote that many of us existed in a state of suspended disbelief thanks to chicanery in the political sphere.Well, we have now descended to being firmly impaled on the spiky realities of life and what was formerly a disbelieving situation has now become horrifyingly real.
Being a student of history (But a totally non-political person) I have taken to recalling uplifting incidents and the courteously statesmanlike behaviour of many men in the past. Yes, even in our own country if we look hard enough.

Politics can be gentlemanly if we try
	We have now descended to being firmly impaled on the spiky realitiesof life
	Leaders of those times did not seem to hold too many grudges. Or even if they did, the grudges remained private
One of my favourite presidential figures was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the USA for an unprecedented three terms who died just before World War 11 ended. He was actually contemplating an unheard of fourth Presidential term (such was his popularity). The only son of a rich and aristocratic Hudson Bay family of Dutch descent, he brought a charm and folksy attitude to his office. He was hated by the rich (his own kind) but loved by the majority for the New Deal he offered them. He became specially known for his famous Fireside Chats which brought him and the affairs of the nation closer to the people. A lesson to be learnedhere perhaps!
I particularly like this story of the start of his regime. Apparently, he wanted to replace Averill Harriman in some public office although Harriman was also enormously wealthy and was a well-known Diplomat, Entrepreneur and public servant. Averill Harriman politely resigned when requested to do so and even attended the swearing in Ceremony of his successor.
Appreciative of this gesture and pleased with the smooth transition of power in his Cabinet, Roosevelt said of Harriman, That is how a gentleman resigns. Another lesson to be learned from the past.
Statesmen can come from all walks of life. It is not an attribute of wealth or birth. Roosevelt came from a mansion; Lincoln from a log cabin yet both had that indefinable quality of greatness
Who can write about gentlemen in politics without first thinking of Nelson Mandela - the absolute political icon of our times. Imprisoned by the appalling Apartheid Regime he was held a prisoner for Twenty seven endless years in Robben Island, Pollismoor and Rivonia Prisons. It never embittered him.
We all know that when he came out of jail and could have taken revenge, he did no such thing. He behaved with a magnanimity that was almost unbelievable, forgiving his persecutors and teaching all politicians, what it meant to be a STATESMAN and not just anelected official.
And what of his actions while still a prisoner Apparently, he soon became so loved by his guards ( who were all white) that they even looked the other way when his wife smuggled in their baby grandson to see him. He encouraged the young men guarding him to complete their studies and not remain, guards, all their lives. One man, in particular, Philip du Prez, said that Mandela harassed him so much about studying he eventually gave in and Matriculated. Mandela was a father figure to us all said Christo Brand. He became the Father of a nation which was founded on the behaviour of a generous and politically non-revengeful man.
Abraham Lincoln
Perhaps Abraham Lincoln best epitomises the generous mind and heart of any President and yet he was a poor boy who educated himself with difficulty and had many failed careers. He was not a President to whom money was important and he never used his office as President to make it. After the Civil War ended he was acutely aware that many army deserters of both sides did so because of the appalling conditions under which they had to fight. He did the best he could to save young men from being court-martialled and given the death sentence whether they came from armies of the North or the Confederate Army of the South.
Churchill was Prime Minister of Britain when Roosevelt was President of the USA and the two were friends, albeit a trifle guardedly. Apparently, after a meeting each leader would ask his aides, What does he think of me Both Leaders were of aristocratic birth and both had a plethora of witty come-backs in conversation.
Our leaders of that time could not have visualised or even believed that the violence, the levels of treachery and the corruption of today would become the norm
One of my favourite stories concerns a time when Churchill was a guest at the White House. Churchill liked padding around his room without the restriction of clothes whenever he could and shed his clothes in private at the drop of a hat. He saw no reason not to do so in the privacy of his room at the White House.
One afternoon Roosevelt suddenly remembered he had forgotten to remind Churchill of an important point and he barged into Churchills room without knocking to find the British PM totally nude. Completely unfazed Churchill looked upand beamed.
Come in Come in, he boomed. As you can see Mr President, Britain has nothing to hide. An embarrassing momentwas averted. Statesmen can come from all walks of life. It is not an attribute of wealth or birth. Roosevelt came from a mansion; Lincoln from a log cabin yet both had that indefinable quality of greatness. Are we looking for it vainly in Sri Lanka as we watch our national institutions disintegrating before our eyes
Winston Churchill
Our own politicians of the past did engage in these gentlemanly exchanges I am sure but I know of none. I know of one story. SWRDs generosity to a beaten candidate is worth the telling. After his resounding political victory, he allowed Sir John Kotelawela, the badly defeated PM, to take his money out of the country, to the UK legally so that he could live there as comfortably as he had done in Sri Lanka.
Leaders of those times did not seem to hold too many grudges. Or even if they did, the grudges remained private. Our leaders of that time could not have visualised or even believed that the violence, the levels of treachery and the corruption of today would become the norm.
Who can write about gentlemen in politics without first thinking of Nelson Mandela - the absolute political icon of our times. Imprisoned by the appalling Apartheid Regime he was held a prisoner for Twenty seven endless years in Robben Island
As do many of us I frequently read for comfort and one of Roosevelts writings I find particularly aptright now..
He says:
To reach a port one must sail.
SAIL, not lie at anchor
SAIL, not drift.
I leave the reader to decide what is happening in Sri Lanka atthe moment.

UK PM May says she will quit before next UK election
	
British Prime Minister Theresa May has confirmed that she will step down before the country holds its next scheduled national election in 2022.
Arriving at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, May said I think it is right that another party leader takes us into that general election.
Late Wednesday May survived a no-confidence vote among her Conservative Party lawmakers, triggered by unhappiness in the party at the way she is handling Brexit.
She secured victory by 200 votes to 117 after telling lawmakers at a private meeting that she would hand over power to another Conservative leader before the next election.
But May has not said what she will do if, as many expect, Britain faces an early national election triggered by divisions over Brexit.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May confirms she will quit before next UK election, scheduled for 2022.

Will PM May survive the no confidence vote
	

Theresa May tried to quell the Tory revolt today by delivering a broad hint that she wont be in charge at the next general election. 
The signal from Mrs May that she is ready to step down once Brexit is delivered came after she vowed to fight with everything Ive got to beat the Eurosceptic coup bid. 
The contest is being held after hardliners secured the 48 letters from Conservative MPs needed to force a ballot that could bring her time as leader to a shambolic end. 
At a rowdy PMQs this afternoon, Mrs May warned Brexit will need to be delayed beyond March if she loses and Jeremy Corbyn might end up in power. 
More than 110 MPs have publicly declared that they will back her, putting her seemingly on course to survive tonight - although as it is a secret ballot there is no guarantee they are telling the truth. 
Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful Tory 1922 committee, emerged this morning to announce the threshold of 48 letters had been exceeded. 
Mrs May will deliver a make-or-break speech to MPs behind closed doors at 5pm before the secret ballot opens an hour later. The crucial result will be declared as soon as the 315 votes have been counted.

Daily Mirror learned that the President is reported to have said at the meeting that he would be committed to protect the UPFA from the UNP and requested the UPFA MPs not to ask UNP to form a coalition government.
The reason as to why I dissolved parliament was to put a full stop to the undemocratic tactics of the UNP. I would take all possible actions to prevent UNP from coming to power again, the President said.

Yellow Vest protesters demand more from Macron
	

Daily Mail, 11 December 2018 - Yellow Vest protesters demanded even more concessions from Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday even after he caved in to their demands for more pay and lower taxes with a 9billion spending splurge on Monday night. 
Thomas Miralles, a Yellow Vest spokesman in the southern Pyrenees-Orientales department, said Macron had failed to listen to protesters and vowed to come to Paris this Saturday for his first demonstration in the capital. 
Meanwhile thousands of students angered by Macrons education reforms joined the Yellow Vests on the streets for a black Tuesday of unrest, further complicating matters for the French President. 
And even Macrons traditional allies in Europe warned they will be closely monitoring his spending plans to check whether they fall within EU limits. 
Rules passed in the wake of the 2008 market crash require all member states to have a deficit of less than 3 per cent of GDP, debt at less than 60 per cent of GDP, and for any member state with debts over 60 per cent to take steps each year to reduce it.
