The world-renowned Andrew Lloyd Webber production of ‘The Sound of Music’ will be performed in Sri Lanka from February 14th to 18th, marking the first time an award-winning West End show of such calibre is performed in the country.


Nations Trust Bank has created several exclusive offers for American Express (Amex) card-members in Sri Lanka to enjoy one of the world’s most popular musicals as well as experience an exclusive, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet the cast and crew.


The Andrew Lloyd Webber production of ‘The Sound of Music’ is a unique one, incorporating songs from both the multi-award winning 1959 Broadway production and the Hollywood movie released in 1965. This special production of Andrew Lloyd Webber has been a hit on London’s West End, and will feature all the well-loved Rogers and Hammerstein songs, performed by a stellar cast, handpicked for each role.


The performance in Sri Lanka will be the first time this Lloyd-Webber classic is being performed anywhere in South Asia, an indication of Colombo’s rising prominence as an entertainment and lifestyle hub in the region.


Nations Trust Bank, in partnership with Cinnamon Life enable an exclusive 10 percent savings on show tickets, which will be on offer to all card-members using their Nations Trust Bank American Express Cards to purchase their tickets. Continuing the legacy of providing exciting and exclusive lifestyle opportunities and experiences to Amex card-members, an unforgettable cocktail evening to meet and greet ‘The Von Trapp Family’ and the rest of the cast and crew has been organised by Nations Trust Bank on February 17th at the Rooftop Amphitheatre at the Nelum Pokuna, Colombo 07, exclusively for their card-members.


“The partnership with The Sound of Music is yet another example of how we create global experiences for American Express card-members,” says Nations Trust Bank Chief Marketing Officer Shaan Wickramasinghe. “Sri Lanka is fast-becoming a hub for entertainment, innovation and cosmopolitan lifestyle experiences and we want to ensure our loyal card-members enjoy every such experience and opportunity.”
