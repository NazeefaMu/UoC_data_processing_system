Memoir to Grandpa - Lucian Peiris


	

He rose with the sun and spoke of the light,
“The brave and the kind”, he said, “shone brightest at night”
He conquered his fears while cool he kept his head,
For a home he kept, and to those in need, more than a pound of bread.
A braver man I’ve not met, my grandfather himself.
These few lines cannot hold a lifetime of the goodness of one man as his.
Shakespeare, Thackeray, Haggard and Milton frequented his thoughts,
And the lines of Casablanca he recited so often like a song.
Not that he became a President nor worked to gain on another’s merit,


 

Thus, God blessed them both with lives blameless to the end. A love like no other, as people have seen, my grandma and he, Cherished and doted his first love and the mother of three.



Neither did he climb a stage to an award of someone else’s sweat,
But he built a house of love and a smile on his wife’s face he kept,
Thus, God blessed them both with lives blameless to the end.
A love like no other, as people have seen, my grandma and he,
Cherished and doted his first love and the mother of three.
To all those who knew, a model of honour was they,

Earned it fair by the sweat on their brow and goodness of heart.

People complaining how unfair it is with them, this life;
Tells he ought to knock-over anyone who crosses his ways.
But my Grandpa, a noble gentleman he was and wise,
“My dear, two wrongs maketh not one right,” he says.
Young men these days be like big wheels and slim fit!
But how about principles and morals they should have instead?
My Grandpa, he lived a life filled with patience, wisdom and courage;

 


Tells he ought to knock-over anyone who crosses his ways. But my Grandpa, a noble gentleman he was and wise, “My dear, two wrongs maketh not one right,” he says. Young men these days be like big wheels and slim fit!


 


Be more like him, the world will be a better place.
This is in memory of Lucian Peiris, a great man and great-grandfather, who lived a fulfilled, blameless life and died a peaceful death on 23 May 2018 at the age of 98.
May his soul rest in peace in the arms of Jesus,
To be reunited with Lorainne Peiris, his beloved wife.
Until we all meet again and be happy like we once were!
Much love from, Nilufer Fernando (Daughter), Ranil Fernando (Son-in-Law), Romanthi Fernando (Grand-daughter) and Baby Shenaya (Great-Grand-Daughter)
