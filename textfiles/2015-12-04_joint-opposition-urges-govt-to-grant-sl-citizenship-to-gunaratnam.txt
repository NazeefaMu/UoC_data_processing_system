The Joint Opposition today urged the government to grant Sri Lankan citizenship to Frontline Socialist Party Central Committee member Kumar Gunaratnam.
MP Dullas Allahapperuma told a news conference that Mr. Gunaratnam should be granted the Sri Lankan citizenship as the government had already awarded dual citizenship to some 2,000 expatriates.
