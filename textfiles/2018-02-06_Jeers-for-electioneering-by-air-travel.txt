A politico couple who visited a village in the backwoods by helicopter to campaign for the party candidates were booed away by a large crowd, they say.

 


This couple has made it a practice to visit remote areas in the country by helicopter for electioneering. 
People of the area where some of them booed the politico couple are living in dire straits sans basic amenities. The couple has incurred the wrath of these people for lavishly spending money on air travel when at least part of it could be used to develop their area, they say.
