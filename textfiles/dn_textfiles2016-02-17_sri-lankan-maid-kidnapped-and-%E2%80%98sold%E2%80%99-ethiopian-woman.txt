Sri Lankan maid kidnapped and ‘sold’ by an Ethiopian woman

Two absconding maids found themselves victims of an Ethiopian woman who sold them in cahoots with a taxi driver to two men, Indian and Bangladeshi, for KD 100 each. The victims, Sri Lankan and Nepalese, were both forced to get involved in immoral activities. Detectives were able to rescue them and arrested the two men. They are still looking for the Ethiopian and the driver. (KuwaitTimes)
