Anti-IS forces struggle to gain ground in Raqa
	

BEIRUT AFP July7, 2017 - US-backed forces struggled to gain ground against the Islamic State group in Syrias Raqa on Friday, facing a wave of car bombs and mortars unleashed by the jihadists, a monitor said. 
The Syrian Democratic Forces penetrated Raqas Old City earlier this week after US-led coalition air strikes pierced two holes inits ramparts. 
But the SDF and a unit of allied Arab fighters called the Syrian Elite Forces have made little progress inside the historical quarter, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. 
IS is using car bombs, mortar fire, and snipers to wage a counter-offensive inside the Old City, Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said. 
The Observatory estimates that up to 30 percent of Raqa has been captured by the US-backed forces since they entered the city on June 6. 
Mohammad Khaled Shaker, a spokesman for the Syrian Elite Forces, told AFP there had been no notable advance on Friday.  There are some clashes, but we have not reached the city centre yet, he told AFP. 
IS overran Raqa in early 2014 and it has since become infamous as the de facto Syrian capital of the groups so-called caliphate. 
An estimated 2,500 jihadists are left defending Raqa, according to theUS-led coalition. 
The global alliance is providing the SDF with air cover, weapons, equipment, and special operations forces on the ground as advisers. 
The Observatory reported on Thursday that the coalition delivered a large shipment of weapons, ammunition and armoured vehicles to the SDF via Iraq.

At least 28 killed in bloody Mexican prison fight
	

REUTERS, 07th JULY, 2017 - At least 28 inmates were killed when a brutal fight broke out in a prison in the Mexican Pacific resort of Acapulco on Thursday, one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the countrys troubled penal system in recent years.
Acapulco is the biggest city in Guerrero, one of Mexicos most lawless states and a center of opium poppy production that has been a major concern to U.S. officials. The prison carnage was particularly embarrassing to Mexico as it came the same day U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was visiting Guerrero, in Mexicos southwest.

Education TUs rebuke Minister's logic on dengue eradication
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasams logic to wear long sleeved clothes to protect school children from dengue was hilarious and worthless, Education Trade Unions claimed yesterday.
Speaking on the matter All Ceylon Teachers Union (ACTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin said Minister Kariyawasam had made no concrete suggestion to protect schoolchildren nor had he taken any action regarding it.
He alleged the spike in dengue fever among students was due to the inefficiency of the education authorities.
Mr. Stalin also said the authorities should pay more attention to fogging at schools and also implement other solutions to ensure childrens safety.
Meanwhile, Ceylon Teachers Services Union General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said the Provincial Education ministries had not taken sufficient measures to eradicate dengue in school premises which had resulted in hundreds of students contracting the fever.
He said the country was in the middle of an epidemic but the Provincial Educational Ministries had not taken any preventive measures. He added that the authorities should immediately start a dengue prevention programme with the support of the health sector to make schools a dengue free zone.
Childrens right to education and the students themselves should be protected at any cost, Jayasinghe said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

NMCRP complains to IGP over alleged lottery scam
	
The National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection (NMCRP) yesterday handed over a complaint to IGP Pujith Jayasundara over an alleged bogus lottery scam in the market.
NMCRP Chairman Ranjith Vithanage said the association received a Govisetha Lottery which was not printed the draw numbers or any other security symbols through a customer.
He said the NMCRP suspects the particular lottery among one of the others that circulating in the market of the controversial Govisetha lottery issue, could be a bogus lottery scam involved.
He had requested the IGP Jayasundara to probe the matter as there could be a possible lottery scam operating behind the scene that double-deal the customer and earn money.
Earlier this week the joint opposition revealed an alleged malpractice in National Lottery Board (NLB) lottery printing. JO parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardana said according to the Procurement Report 2016 issued on 2017, the Auditor General has exposed that the NLB had printed lotteries against the procurement process and called for an investigation.
Meanwhile, when contacted NLB Chairperson Shyamila Perera said the board lodged a complaint with the Crime Investigation Department (CID) about the matter and were investigating whether it was a mistake or deliberate scam.
Ms. Perera said the board issuing the lotteries to the dealers and before it receives by the customer it is going through the agent and the seller, therefore any mistake should be notified by them before it is released to the market and such lottery tickets with mistakes were returned to the board by them.
She said it is possible for someone to print an art work of the lottery however the board can detect any fraudulent lottery ticket with its barcode, QR code and security code.
Ms. Perera requested the public to inform the NLB regarding lottery issues via TP: 0114607000, 0112433631 or made a complaint to the NLB website - www.nlb.lk (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

No way of calling off Uma Oya Project: Amaraweera
	
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera ruled out the possibility of abandoning the Uma Oya Project because 70 per cent work had been completed already.
The minister, who is a member of the Cabinet subcommittee inquiring into this project said the controversial Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UMDP) was the first-ever project undertaken by Iranian contractor FARAB and the machinery used in excavating the 18-kilometer tunnel was not suitable for such work.
"The government cannot abandon this project because nearly 70% of the US$529 million project has been completed with the government meeting 15% of the cost and an US$450 million loan from the Export Development Bank of Iran. But only US$50 million has been paid because of the fall out from the US trade embargo," he said.
The minister rejecting claims that more than 7,000 houses had been damaged and a similar number of families affected said only 52 houses had been damaged.
"The government believes that the UMDP is a government-made-disaster and the cabinet sub committee has recommended that excavation work be suspended to obtain modern excavators to minimize the damage caused to the environment and to ground water resources. Norwegian experts will visit Sri Lanka shortly and there are plans to modernize the excavators as well," he said. I visited the Uma Oya project with other members of the committee -- Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka and Wijith Vijayamuni Soyza. We met the residents, the engineers, officials and the clergy in Badulla and Bandarawela and we found that the UMDP has been launched in haphazard manner without a feasibility study or an environment impact assessment done."

Origin of life on earth and its end
	
Nothing in the world has perplexed man more than the great mysteries above, and the Supremely Enlightened Beings pronouncement on them presented here in reverse order to retain their thematic sequence provides the ultimate statement on the issue. They also afford a profound topic of insight meditation on impermanence,first of the three immutable characteristics of existence, an unfailing path to liberation. 
At Vesali Buddha said, Bhikkhus, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, unstable, non-pleasurable. This alone is sufficient to be detached from them, to be liberated from them. Bhikkhus, there comes a time when no rain will fall for many a year, many hundreds of years, many thousands of years, many hundred thousand years. When there is no rain, varieties of seeds and plants, medicinal herbs, grassesand giant trees of the forest will wither, completely wither and cease to exist. Bhikkhus, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, unstable, non-pleasurable. 

The great enigma of lifes origin was unraveled at the apex of wisdom through Brahmajala and Aggangya Suttas, two long-length discourses of the Blessed One.

This alone is sufficient to .
Bhikkhus, someday after an extraordinarily long period of time there will appear a second sun. When it appears the minor rivers and lakes will run dry, totally dry. 
This is sufficient to. 
Bhikkus, after a further long period of time, a third sun will appear. With the appearance of the third sun the great rivers Ganges, Yamuna, Achiravathi, Sarabhu and Mahi will run dry, totally dry.
This alone is sufficient to. 
Bhikkhus, a long time thereafter a fourth sun will dawn and the great lakes Anothaththa, Seehapaththa, Rathakara, Kannamunda, Chaddantha and Mandakani from which the great rivers arise will become dry, totally dry.
This alone is sufficient to..... 
Bhikkhus, there will come a time some day after a long lapse when a fifth sun appears. With its appearance the waters of the great ocean will recede by a hundred yojuns, two.... three.... seven hundred yojuns. The level will come down to a height of seven palm three.... six..... five..... a single palm tree . To seven fathoms..... six.....five...... a single fathom. To a height of a man, to his waist..... to his knees and hisankles. As when in autumn large drops of rain fall they fill hoof prints of cattle here and there, so will there be water in the ocean here and there. It will not have water to reach the joints of ones fingers.
This is sufficient..... 
Bhikkhus, there comes a time after a long period when the sixth sun will appear. When it happens the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains will smoke and smoulder, thoroughly and properly smoke and smoulder.
This alone is sufficient to.... 
Bhikkhus then a long time thereafter, there will come a day when a seventh sun appears. The great earth and Sineru the king of mountains will ignite and burst into flames, become one great mass of fire. Flames ejected by the earth and the great mountain stoked by wind will reach the Brahma world. The peaks of the great mountains Sineru, one, two..... five hundred yojuns high consumed by the blazing, destructive inferno will crumble and collapse. Neither ash nor soot of the burnt earth and the king of mountains will be seen, just as the ash and soot of burnt ghee cannot be seen. Bhikkhus this alone is sufficient to be detached from all conditioned phenomena, to be liberated from them. 
Bhikkhus, who other than a Sothapanna would believe that the great earth and the king of mountains will burn out, be destroyed in this manner and cease to exist 
Dighanikayattakatha gives a fascinating account of the abodes of rebirth of earths inhabitants according to their karmic destinies when the great earth becomes an arid plane prior to its destruction. The scripture notes, at the end of the sermon Sattasuriyagamana Sutta five hundred Bhikkhus practicing meditation of impermanence attained Arahanthood in the places they were seated. Could a mundane earthling be faulted if he questions what he is experiencing in his world today are perhaps the remotest, very earliest symptoms of Buddhas pronouncement made over twenty five centuries ago Interestingly only recently were astrophysicists able to discover the formation of a new sun in the distant galaxy. How many could be the undiscovered ones out there and those yet to come 
Secondly, the great enigma of lifes origin was unraveled at the apex of wisdom through Brahmajala and Aggangya Suttas, two long-length discourses of the Blessed One. Long, long after the flames that burn the earth die down, the world is engulfed in absolute, total darkness where sun, moon and the stars are invisible, where day and night, weeks, months and seasonal changes are indistinguishable. Buddha explained, after an extraordinarily long period of evolution, rich earth is established on water in the manner of skim forming on the surface of heated milk. It is lucid, fragrant and flavoursome like a bees hive free of larvae. Attracted by it a being from Ahassara Brahma world with happiness as his only food, resplendent in body, descends upon it to make it his habitation. Many others from the Brahma world follow suit. In inquisitiveness, a greedy one amongst them is driven to taste a speck of the earth which he finds satisfying, and avarice overcomes him. All his companions do the same, whereupon their natural radiance disappears.  Then there appears the sun, moon and the stars. The world is thus born. A long time after they continue to consume the earth they become coarse in body, the complexions turn ugly in some. The fairer ones begin ridiculing those dark in colour. Pride, excessive pride overcome them, resulting in the disappearance of the tasty earth, followed by the appearance of spontaneous mushrooms on its surface.  Having to survive on mushrooms their complexions become markedly different form one another than before. As derisive speech among them proliferates, mushrooms too disappear giving rise to different types of plants all spontaneously arising. Feeding on them they grow even more rough and coarse, eventually female and male organs show on them which lead to their gazing at each other for long periods of time.
Lust arises, followed by cohabitation and quarrels and abusive language become a common feature. In order to conceal their frequent cohabitative practice they start to build dwellings. They engage in hoarding food for future use, thereafter setting limits and demarcations on land become a necessity. One leads to another and thievery, falsehood and assault become commonplace. 
In that scenario a consensus forms among them that they ought to have a leader, a ruler to impose punishment on wrongdoers who will be designated the king. As time passes, in progression they become capable of distinguishing good from bad, right from wrong, piety from impiety.
Likewise the four groups Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra come to be established in society. Developing the mind some attain absorptions ( jhana ) and reach the heavens, others are born in woeful states according to their karmic destinies. The Blessed One concluded the sermon that in this world and beyond it is Dhamma that always holds sway.  Scientists have been probing interplanetary penspermia for decades now, but only a Samma Sambuddha with sarvagnatha gnana delivers the conclusive statement on it.

Overcoming  emotional trauma
	


In life, we dont always get what we want. Wed love our lives to be perfect; we wish that we didnt have to face the loss of loved ones. However, death is a part of life. Both for oneself and others. In my life, there have been so many situations where I wish I could go back to the past and change what happened. However, one needs to realise that in life things dont go the way we want and we have to make peace with that fact. Similarly we have to make peace with the fact that in life, invariably we are going to face losses and that too of dearly loved ones. We cant go back in time and wish they didnt die. Thatll never happen. Now the person who was my father is no more. He is undoubtedly reborn and very likely in a very good place as he was such a good human being in this life. And I need to make peace with that. 

Lord Buddha in no uncertain terms has said that losing loved ones is a part of life, and that sorrow and lamentation- in short grief is a part of life. As children we are carefree and dont feel the intensity of loss unlike when being an adult. As adults one has to go through such a wide range of emotions
As humans we have minds, and a mind is an amazing thing. Where is it One cant see it. But its there! The Buddha spoke about mind objects. Mind objects are whatever comes and goes in the mind. And as humans, we proliferate on mind objects

From a young age, I knew that Ill have to experience the deaths of first my grandparents and then my parents. My grandfather lived to a good old age and I had no regrets. I loved him completely and I made sure he knew I loved him. However, my own fathers death made me a complete wreck. I was inconsolable. Id turn to friends and relatives desperately for emotional support. I never imagined that my fathers death will make me suffer so intensely. Some children lose their parents at a very young age. I am blessed that I had my father to hand me over to my husband on my wedding day. He lived to see my son. At least as a child. Latterly, my father and I bonded in a very close way. He was more like a good friend to me.I neednt feel sorry for myself for having lost my father. I was happy with my father and as the Buddha said, its my love and attachment to him that caused me to suffer. 
Lord Buddha in no uncertain terms has said that losing loved ones is a part of life, and that sorrow and lamentation- in short grief is a part of life. As children we are carefree and dont feel the intensity of loss unlike when being an adult. As adults one has to go through such a wide range of emotions. And grief is one such. 
Kisa Gotami was the wife of a wealthy man of Savatthi. Her story is one of the more famous ones in Buddhism. After losing her only child, Kisa Gotami became desperate and asked if anyone could help her. Her sorrow was so great that many thought she had lost her mind. An old man told her to see the Buddha. The Buddha told her that before he could bring the child back to life, she should find white mustard seeds from a family where no one had died. She desperately went from house to house, but to her disappointment, she could not find a house that had not suffered the death of a family member. Finally the realization struck her that there is no house free from mortality. She returned to the Buddha, who comforted her and preached to her the truth. She was awakened and entered the first stage of Arahatship. Eventually, she became an arahat. 
The following Dhammapada verse is associated with her story: 
Though one should live a hundred years 
Without seeing the Deathless State, 
Yet better indeed, is a single days life 
Of one who sees the Deathless State. 
The story is the source of the popular aphorism: The living are few, but the dead are many. 
( Source for Kisagothamis story above :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Kisa_Gotami) 
Lord Buddha gave a very special word for clinging to attachment- The word is Upadana. In this context it would mean attachment to loved ones which makes it hard for one to let them go when death happens.As human beings we have egos which basically make a self out of oneself. We must realise that this is the ego which is grieving. And just that. 
After my fathers loss I had a lot of self pity. I pitied myself for losing my one and only father. I would feel so much self pity that Id go off food, and be unable to eat. The act of eating would be distressing to say the least. I would not have any appetite whatsoever. I need to be aware that I am creating my moods. I am the creator of it. And in this instance its a mood of self pity.I asked myself why I should be sad. Theres no reason to be sad about. My father is in a good place. If so, why should I feel sorrowful I should feel happy. Its always me , me , me all the time. Thats what self pity is all about. My loss. My suffering. My agony. 
When we are grieving, its very important to be occupied by some activity. Otherwise the human mind will go berserk with grief and make us needlessly suffer. Its always better to be happy than suffer. Its also good to be a little detached in general. This leads to the topic of Equanimity which to me personally is a very beautiful and potent quality. To be equanimous without going into the two extremes of happiness or sorrow. Its a very soothing mental state which if cultivated well will lead to peace. Immense peace, ease and relief as well. The Buddha labeled it Upekkh. 
The person who cultivates Upekkhor equanimity is literally walking the path of the wise. By being equanimous one can help others. Otherwise one cant. To cultivate equanimity one has to let go of both the past and the future. Namely regretting the past and anticipating the future. Mudita - Joy at the happiness of others- is also a wonderful quality to cultivate. It takes oneself away from oneself and one can feel actual joy for others.For me, personally, to see any person smiling, brings me so much joy. And I too cant help smiling then. Cultivating equanimity and joy at the happiness of others helps in reducing the pain of constantly dwelling on the loss of a dearly loved one. 
As humans we have minds, and a mind is an amazing thing. Where is it One cant see it. But its there! The Buddha spoke about mind objects. Mind objects are whatever comes and goes in the mind. And as humans, we proliferate on mind objects. The human mind, constantly verbalises. While I write, my mind is having verbal thoughts which I am jotting down in front of me. In this instance in English. When suffering the loss of a loved one, one needs to be aware of when the sorrowful feelings originate in the mind. It can originate verbally. One needs to observe and just let the pain all go. The time period of suffering becomes shorter and shorter when one cultivates awareness whenever the feelings of loss and grief arise. 
Empathy to an abnormal degree creates suffering. I feel so much for people who have lost loved ones of people going through cancer. ( My father died of cancer). I feel so much that Id choke with empathy. This is not very healthy. If I am to really help someone going through what I went through, I need to be at my best, meaning mentally strong. If Im not, then how can I help. I am realising that I can give strength to people because I know what it feels like to really suffer the agonising pangs of grief. Buddha saw suffering and the way out of suffering. He didnt advise anyone to dwell in feelings of sorrow and needlessly suffer and torment oneself. Practising metta or loving kindness invariably bring about joy. Practising loving kindness towards other beings and doing good things in life and doing good for others helps reduce the suffering. Doing social work keeps ones mind occupied and so the grief one feels as a result of losing loved ones lessens. Making people happy is a way out of suffering. 
The Wisdom the Buddha spoke about is a process and a realization. I am on a journey. A spiritual one and I cant help thinking how it must feel like to finally realise Nirvana- to be free from all that mass of suffering. Oh what bliss! I hope one day I achieve it. May you too realise the supreme bliss of Nirvana! With Metta, 
Namali.

The Attorney General yesterday informed the Colombo High Court that Colombo's former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekera was found accountable in the investigations carried out by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) into the misplacing of Wasim Thajudeen's body parts.
The State Counsel said the prosecution was awaiting the investigation report from the SLMC.
The inquiry was put off for August 24.
The HC inquiry was held on a revision application filed by Prof. Samarasekara challenging the order made on September 15 last year by Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe, who refused to grant anticipatory bail to the JMO saying the investigation into the missing body parts could be hampered in such a case.
Prof. Samarasekara denied the charge against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

World leaders braced for tough talks
	

Leaders from the worlds top economies prepared for tough talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on climate change and trade on Friday as a Group of 20 summit got underway in Germany amid the threat of violent protests.
The meeting in the port city of Hamburg comes at a time of major shifts in the global geo-political landscape, with Trumps America First policies pushing Europe and China closer together. Trump will meet Russias Vladimir Putin for the first time on Friday afternoon, an encounter that will be intensely scrutinized following allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the U.S. election to helpTrump win.
The summit also brings together Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a time when Washington is ratcheting up pressure on Beijing to rein in North Korea after it test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile and threatening the Chinese with punitive trade measures.
Amid the big egos and seemingly intractable conflicts, the host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, faces the daunting task of steering leaders toward a consensus on trade, climate and migration - all issues that have become more contentious since Trump entered the White House half a year ago.
Trumps bilateral with Putin was scheduled to take place just 15 minutes after the start of the discussion on climate, a scheduling conflict that could complicate a deal.
Merkel, as the G20 host, must not sacrifice ambition for unity. Instead, we need a G19 commitment to climate action that demonstrates the intent to implement and even go beyond what 195 nations agreed to in Paris, said Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace, referring to the climate accord Trump has pledged to leave.
