	Commissioner of Elections Mahinda Deshapriya today said the Police could use maximum power to stop any forceful act that could be carried out by any persons at polling stations during tomorrow’s Presidential election.
	Asked whether the Police could shoot any perpetrator below the knees, he said the Police could shoot right on the head.
	“Police could take such action if any one tries to grab ballot papers away,” he said.
	He said security forces were kept standby to face any situation that might arise during today’s election.
	“No one, including me or the Inspector General of Police (IGP), had called for any forces. I have inquired from the Army Commander and he too confirmed this position. But I found out through some documents that forces are kept on standby to face any eventuality,” the polls chief told a media briefing last morning.
	The Polls Chief expressed his confidence that the Presidential Election would be free and fair. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
