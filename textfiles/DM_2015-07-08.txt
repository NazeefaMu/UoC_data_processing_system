Bank head puts his foot down
	
This politico from the Kalutara district is an original Green. Later he turned Blue to escape from a winter of despair. He held portfolios at Cabinet rank from both parties. He threw in his lot with the new regime rather late in the day and had to be content with a deputy office.
This politico recently called a head of a leading bank in the country. I say, he barked at the bank head. I find that you are giving jobs to only those on the Ministers lists. I, as a Deputy also have to look after my constituents. You have to give jobs to those on the lists I am sending!
The bank head, a highly qualified and respected banker was not prepared to take the Deputys accusation lying down.
What did you say Repeat what you said now! the bank head told the Deputy. I said that you are giving jobs only to the Ministers people. You have to give jobs to my people as well. The bank head: Dont make false allegations. First please withdraw your false allegation!
What is the false allegation I made You said that I give jobs to the Ministers people. I have not given a single job on anybody request. We recruit candidates selected through competitive exams. You first withdraw your allegation. I can give you a hearing after that, the bank head said.
Okay. I am withdrawing the allegation, a subdued Deputy said.
Thats good. In future, I can look into the possibility of helping your constituents. Remember please that intimidatory tactics will not work with me! said the bank head.

MR from Kurunegala; Chamal from Hambantota
	
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be contesting the August 17 Parliamentary elections from the Kurunegala District, while the Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa would be contesting from the Hambantota District, a reliable SLFP source told the Daily Mirror yesterday.
	He said both would contest as group leaders of the UPFA of their respective districts and the former President would also campaign island wide for the alliance.
	The source added Chamal Rajapaksa had decided against retiring from politics as speculated by certain media recently.
	Meanwhile, the SLFP yesterday admitted that there were mistakes and lapses when the UPFA ruled the country, but there would be no repetition of those omissions in the new UPFA government formed after the August 17 polls, General Secretary of the SLFP Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said.
	Addressing the media at the party office yesterday, Yapa said the SLFP had been modernised since President Maithripala Sirisena became the leader of the party and that was why he agreed to give nomination to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa putting behind all differences.
	All decisions in respect of electing candidates for nomination including that of former President Rajapaksa, the district from which they contest and the party manifesto would be taken by the Central Committee of the UPFA headed by President Sirisena, he said.
	Mr. Yapa said the UPFA manifesto would be released soon after the closing of tendering nominations on July 13 and a team of academics and senior members of the alliance were attending to the preparation of the manifesto of the UPFA.
	It is no doubt that we have many ideas, proposals and policy matters to discuss as the UPFA is an alliance comprising 14 political parties, he said.
	But we are capable of resolving all these issues through dialogue and come to compromise as our final target is to defeat the UNP and form the next government, he stressed.
	Now that the two factions under President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa have come to an understanding on how to face the election, there will be no separate rallies or press conferences by the faction led by President Rajapaksa, he said.
	Mr. Yapa said discussions on matters affecting the UPFA were scheduled to be held even today among constituent partners of the UPFA and among party leaders including President Sirisena.
	However, all these discussions and suggestions must come to an end tomorrow as we will have to finalise the nomination list to all districts by Thursday. No more discussion or alteration of nomination lists will be entertained after Thursday, he added.
	Mr. Yapa stressed that while rejecting nominations to applicants with controversial characters despite their political standing, the nomination board of the SLFP had given nominations to academics and professionals and had increased the number of female candidates. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Desperate kinsmen and cohorts on war path!
	
With political wilderness and even a fate worse than that staring them in the face, the former lot and their surrounding members, immediate and distant, have begun resorting to desperate measures to retain their hold on former Blue party Diyawanna members, they say.
The entire crowd is said to have gone into panic mode following information that the new Big Boss is seriously reconsidering his earlier decision to grant nomination to his predecessor. This new development has sent certain family members on the war path. Their first victims have been the former Blue party Diyawanna members. A former Blue party Diyawanna member said: Certain cohorts and  family members of the deposed leader are now using intimidatory tactics on Blue party members who are likely to contest under Maithris leadership. In fact, they have already warned some of us that the Nil Balakaya will suitably deal with every Blue party member backing the Maithri leadership come August 18. He said that the party leadership should take immediate effective measures to allay the fear psychosis spreading among the Blue party members.

The loyalists of the former madam the other day organized a special Pooja at the Sri Dalada Maligawa at 9. 30 in the morning to mark her 70th birthday.
Everything was cut and dry for the planned Pooja; all invitees and Nilames were eagerly waiting for the arrival of the birthday girl. But she failed to turn up for the Pooja. Highly disappointed, the participants left the Maligawa one by one.
However, the madam did arrive for the Pooja, four hours late. Of the large crowd that had gathered by 9.30 in the morning, only about 50 were there cooling their heels at the Maligawa precincts to welcome the madam in case she showed up. 
Now that the scheduled time for the Pooja had long lapsed, the madam had to be content with a simple religious ceremony at the Maligawa.
They say the madam had added insult to injury by declining an invitation to a sumptuous lunch arranged by the organizers and well-wishers at a leading hotel in the hills.

This politico hailing from a political family has changed his party colour several times in his brief career and now back in the Blue party he is holding a key portfolio in the Yahapalanaya government.
A typical ladies man, his flings with fair ones from time to time have provided ideal stuff for juicy gossip.
Recently someone green with envy had phoned up a once powerful madam that her latest protg was having a good time with a beauty in a luxury apartment in the city. Enraged by this disturbing news, the madam had gate-crashed the apartment and found the couple honeymooning inside. Thereupon, the madam had castigated the politico using some choice words and had also come out with some sordid details from his family history as well. Not content with the tongue-lashing, she boxed his ears hard several times! I put you in charge of an important constituency because of the trust I placed in you. Remember if you dont stop this kind of dirty affairs, you will not get nomination either, was her parting warning.

Lebanese suspect injured in police firing at Pamankada
	
	 The Havelock Town Pizza Hut would have turned into slaughterhouse yesterday but for the prompt action of a policeman who stopped a Lebanese man armed with a machete going on a hacking spree against three women.
	Three female employees of the renowned Jonathans Studio in Havelock Town had gone to have a quick snack at the nearby Pizza Hut at around 4.30 pm.
	Moments later, to their horror, an irate man stormed into the place carrying a long, heavy knife and charged at them spewing obscenities. The terrified women had retreated to the rear of the store to escape from the man and finally ended up inside the toilet.
	The store had quickly turned into a pool of blood with the women screaming in pain, and fear of the furious man who was trying to chop them to pieces.
	The screams and commotion inside the store had attracted the attention of a police constable who was on Traffic Duty at the nearby roundabout.
	He had managed to save the women by shooting the attacker, who had turned to attack him, with his pistol.
	The man who had been shot in the shoulder and the three women who had severe injuries were rushed to the National Hospital, Colombo, by the police who arrived on the scene soon after. The condition of one woman was said to be serious.
	Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said all four persons had been employees of the studio. The Lebanese, who was employed as a graphic designer, was a permanent resident of Sri Lanka and married to a Sri Lankan woman.
	He had been sacked by the studio management on Tuesday for unknown reasons, and reportedly had also had a dispute with the three women over an unsettled debt.
	He had earlier lodged a complaint with the Wellawatta Police against the women over the financial dispute and also sworn to get his revenge on them. Police had warned him against taking the law into his own hands and said that an inquiry would be held soon.
	But the man who had learnt that the women were at the Pizza Hut had rushed there to get his revenge. He is being treated at the hospital under police guard.
	The Wellawatta Police are conducting investigations. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

The banks ability to reach this milestone within a very short span of time is also a testament to the effective manner in which the bank engaged and interacted with its social media enthusiasts.

Irked by this seemingly unfair demand, Minister Ranawaka who invited the Indian scientist to grace an energy symposium here organized by his Ministry, complained about it to the new Big Boss.
Although, the yahapalanaya government has taken office, Vaas policies and Vaas rates continue to operate in the Foreign Ministry, he told the Big Boss.
The Big Boss decision was instant. Dont hire the Foreign Ministry vehicle. Take the best vehicle from among the ones available for my use for the use of the Indian visitor. Finally they placed at the disposal of the former Indian President, the best vehicle available in the Presidents Transport Division with no cost at all instead of a Foreign Ministry vehicle at a daily rental of Rs.90,000!

The two and half hour session was attended by close to 40 compliance officers and senior compliance officials of banks in Colombo and was held at the Hatton National Bank Training Centre under the auspices of the Association of Compliance Officers of Banks (ACOB).
Standard Chartered Compliance Head Inam Cassim commenting on the session said, These sessions are facilitated by Standard Chartered as part of its efforts to add value to the banking industry in Sri Lanka through sharing expertise on key subjects through a senior resource person like Ananth. It is clear now that the traditional way in which banks used to manage compliance, on a rules based one size fits all approach has to change. Instead, compliance risk management should now focus on a Risk based approach which takes into account the size, geographical reach, management structure, complexities, risk profile and risk appetite of banks.
Some salient points of general interest coming out of the session included the fact that increasingly in the current financial climate, banks have to now manage several risks related to compliance such as operational risk, outsourcing of services risk, customer impact risk, cross border risk, etc., and the management of these risks must become integral to the banks compliance risk management structure. The compliance officer now assumes a critical role in the management structure and should be part of the senior management with a direct line to the Board of Directors or Management Committee, with no interference in his right to express his views.

Wariyapola assault: suspect pleads guilty
	
Robert Dasanlage Chandra Kumara alias Selva, who was slapped by a girl at the Wariyapola bus stand and led to a social media sensation, pleaded guilty for sexually harassing the girl and other offences.
The video recording of the assault of Selva by a girl following the alleged provocation resulted in the video going viral and a debate on womens rights and sexual harassment in the country.
The suspect pleaded guilty at the Wariyapola Magistrates Court today.
He has pleaded guilty of the offence he had committed under Section 345 of the Penal Code.
Section 345 of the Penal Code states that whoever by assault or by criminal force sexually harasses another person by words or action and causes sexual annoyance cause the offence of sexual harassment.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Counsel Sudharshana Gunawardena, who watched the interests of the girl, said initially the defence lawyer wanted to plead guilty for a lesser offence under Section 343 of the Penal Code.
Although the defence counsel wanted to plead guilty under Section 343 of the Penal Code for Provocation they finally agreed to plead guilty under Section 345 following the objection by Thilinis counsel, he said.
The sentence and compensation are to be decided on the July 29.
A Fundamental Rights Application is also in the Supreme Court against OIC of Wariyapola Police for illegal arrest of Thilini Amalka. (Chathushika Wijeyesinghe)

They were all stumped by the unexpected question
	
The Nomination Board of the Blue party appointed by the Compassionate One interviewed the hopefuls last week.
A certain unexpected question put forward by a member of the selection board had made the nomination aspirants squirm in their seats, they say.
As soon as an aspirant sits down before the board, this member, a Ministerial one, would ask him: From which camp are you, Mahinda or Maithri
Some nomination seekers had later complained to the party high ups about the embarrassing question put to them.
The secretarial one of the Betel leaf party, an avowed loyalist of the deposed strongman had later made an appeal to Senior Banda from the Hills not to put this embarrassing question to thenomination aspirants.
We are doing our best to unify the divided party. You are asking a question that surely leads to the division of the party, the secretarial one
had remonstrated.

TN denies LTTE Threat to Mullaperiyar Dam, to file SC affidavit
	
The Tamil Nadu State government will file an additional affidavit in the Supreme Court leaving out the section of an Intelligence Bureau report that cites the threat to the Mullaperiyar dam by the remnant cadres of LTTE, the Hindu reported.
Reacting to the Opposition parties condemnation of the government for citing the IB report in an earlier petition seeking deployment of Central forces for dams protection, O. Panneerselvam, Minister for Finance and PWD, clarified on Monday that the Chief Secretary had merely brought to the Centres notice the IBs Industrial Security Inspection Report on Mullaperiyar dam in his letter on May 12.
The report had strongly recommended the replacement of the Kerala police personnel by CISF or CRPF to guard the dam on priority basis. Requesting the Home Ministry to deploy CISF or any Central force, the Chief Secretary had only sent his letter as an annexure, Mr. Panneerselvam said.
Unlike the Oppositions charge, the Tamil Nadu government had not blamed the LTTE at any point in its petition. However, the Chief Minister, after reading media reports, had consulted him and the officials concerned.
The details of the IB report which state that the key installations, including the Mullaperiyar dam, face threat from Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Naxalites were explained to her. In section 4.4, the report talks about the efforts of the remnant cadres of LTTE to regroup.
Even if there was no specific threat, the report has suggested precautionary measures to be taken. Nowhere the IB report specifically states the LTTE to be a threat to Mullaperiyar dam, Mr. Panneerselvam clarified.

Two of the disillusioned faithfuls to seek Green party nomination
	
Two Blue stalwarts have informed the party hierarchy that they would cross over to the Green party if the deposed strongman was given nomination to enter the fray at the coming polls.
One of them is a prominent figure in the city and the other hails from Trinco. Both of them are said to be harbouring the fear that they would lose their minority vote base if the former strongman staged a comeback to the party in a big way.
The twosome have reportedly begun negotiations with the Green leaders and the response they have received is encouraging, they say. What beats all interested parties is the whys and the wherefores for the change of heart on the part of the city bigwig who had been close to the deposed strongman over the years. His son who is in politics also had been a strong supporter of the former strongman.The stalwart from Trinco is among the first few Blue Diyawanna members to quit the previous regime to back the Compassionate One and are now left high and dry due to the latters unexpected decision to take on board the deposed strongman.

Video: MR candidature a positive phenomenon: Ranjan
	
The candidature of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the general elections should be considered as a positive phenomenon, United National Party member Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
Mr. Ramanayake told a media briefing that President Maithripala Sirisena should be thanked if the former President was given nomination as he would be providing slogans and a proper rival at the election if the latter was given the ticket.
The former UNP MP said he hoped Mr. Rajapaksa would contest from the Gamapaha District as he could be a direct rival to the former President in such a scenario.
Former Presidents action to contest the election to become an MP is like doing Ordinary Level examination after sitting for the Advanced Level examination, he said.(Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
