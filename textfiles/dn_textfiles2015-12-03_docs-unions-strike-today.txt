Docs, unions to strike today

Seventeen Unions, including the GMOA will engage in a countrywide strike from 8.00 a.m. today against the 2016 budget proposals, Convener, Joint Committee of Executive Officers in All Island Services, Dr. Nirmal Karunasiri said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA), Dr. Karunasiri said that it is just the beginning and the strike will be called off considering the government's response.
He said the strike action is being taken against the reduction of benefits for public servants, including doctors.
"Not all politicians are professionals therefore they do not respect the service rendered by the professionals to the country," he said.
Dr Karunasiri emphasized that they seek a practical solution to its issues before the Budget 2016 approved by the Parliament.
The GMOA and the other unions decided to resort to strike action as the authorities failed to respond to its key issues with respect to several proposals suggested in the Budget 2016, Government Medical Officers Association Spokesman Dr. Naveen Soysa said.
He pointed out that certain proposals in the 2016 Budget discouraged state sector employees and added that this is an attempt to privatise the state sector.
"The decision to go on strike was the last option the association had. The government failed to respond to our letters and the discussions through which we attempted to solve the issue. The GMOA held discussions with Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne but he could not give an assurance to our demands," he added.
All the 17 associations are not asking for something new but request the government not to reduce the prestige of the government servants, Dr Soysa said.
"The government servants work on behalf of the people. Therefore people should stand against the proposals made by the government that affect the government servants and the people in general," he said. The GMOA also protested against the cancellation of duty free vehicle permits to government officers including doctors. GMOA Secretary, Dr Nalinda Herath said the unions do not intend to cause danger to the lives of the patients.
He said that The Lady Ridgway hospital, De Soysa Maternity Hospital, Castle Hospital, Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children's Hospital in Peradeniya and island wide cancer hospitals will not engage in the strike action.
However, accidental service and the emergency units of all the hospitals will functioning as usual. Professionals representing all the seventeen unions were present at the media conference.
