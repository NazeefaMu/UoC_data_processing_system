Former senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe was released on bail with two sureties of Rs.1 million each by Pelmadulla Magistrate Janitha Roshani Perera today.

He was ordered not to influence witnesses, to handover his passport to the Court and to report to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) on the first Monday of each month.

The SDIG was arrested by the SIU in connection with the investigation into the killing of a UNP supporter in Kahawatta on January 5, 2015 in the run up to the presidential election.

He was accused of protecting the suspects by not taking action against them.  (Ajithlal Shanthaudaya)
