The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered the Department of Immigration & Emigration to arrest a suspect on arrival or departure, after he was named as a suspect by the CID in a case involving the creation of fake facebook profiles and blackmailing people through them.
The CID informed Court that the alleged suspect had created fake facebook profiles of women and befriended several wealthy persons and blackmailed them.
The CID told court that the suspect had been functioning from both inside and outside the country.
The CID informed the Magistrate that they had received information that the suspect had fled the country on January 17 and requested court to direct the Department of Immigration & Emigration to arrest the suspect on arrival or departure and inform the CID. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
