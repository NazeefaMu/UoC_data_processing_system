The coordinating aide of a Diyawanna member had quit his post following a heated exchange with the member’s wife.

 


During the altercation triggered by an issue over a dog the duo had used the words, ‘dog’ and ‘bitch’ while trading epithets, they say.


The Diyawanna member’s wife had abused the Coordinating Secretary when the latter had faulted her for using his official vehicle for transporting her poodle and he had hit back hard. 


When the coordinating aide had reported the incident to the Diyawanna member later, the latter had said: “That woman deserves the shelling she got from you!”
