The brand ‘BOC’ was recognized as the number one Sri Lankan brand by the very first Interbrand Best Sri Lankan Brands convention conducted at The Hilton Colombo recently.


Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the chief guest graced the occasion pioneered by Interbrand, the world’s largest and most influential global brand consulting agency, in partnership with the Daily FT newspaper.
Currently, Interbrand is a New York-based with 21 offices in 17 countries. It is highly recognized for its globally influential ‘Breakthrough Brands’ and ‘Best Global Brands’ reports and Webby Award-winning ‘brand channel’.
Sri Lanka being in the Interbrand catalogue of countries is important as a chance for local companies to be on the global stage. The prime minister stated that it is impressive to see state banks performing well among Sri Lankan brands. 


Interbrand Global Director Brand Valuation Mike Rocha, Strategy Director Nation Branding Guido Van Garderen, Interbrand India Managing Director Ashish Mishra, Sri Lankan partner for Interbrand Michel Nugawela and several other officials from Interbrand were also present at this occasion. Bank of Ceylon Chairman President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera and General Manager D.M. Gunasekera received the award on behalf of the bank.


Interbrand has calculated Bank of Ceylon’s brand value as Rs.31.12 billion based on a well-stipulated criteria for brand valuation. 


The financial performance of the brand, its role in influencing the customer’s choice and the strength of the brand to secure the company’s financial position and many other key elements are taken into account when calculating the brand value. Many indigenous well-established brands operating in the country have been taken into account.  
Bank of Ceylon’s ‘BOC’ has been ‘The No.1 Brand’ in the country for the last nine years as determined by Brand Finance Lanka too. 


With the pledge to commit as ‘Banker’s to the Nation’ since its inception, the bank has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide the financial assistance they require.
