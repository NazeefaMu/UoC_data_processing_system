Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe today advised Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera to act according to the given conditional court order and restrain from amplifying high levels of noises using loudspeakers between 5 am to 6 am in the morning at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda.

The Thera was present today in court after being noticed to appear in court over the personal complaint (lawsuit) filed against him in Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court earlier by four complainants on the allegation of high noise levels sustained by the residents living around the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple due to the Loudspeakers operated by the temple.

Considering the submission made by the counsel appearing for the complainant that the Thera did not act according to the court order but continued to amplify high noises from the temple, the Magistrate advised the Thera that religious rituals should be practiced considering the inconvenience that could occur to others and without obstructing or harming them.

Subsequently, the court fixed January 24 to file legal and preliminary objections for the respondents over the case. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
