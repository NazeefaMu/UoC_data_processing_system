Fun Facts :
We eat a lot of Toblerones! So many Toblerone bars are sold each year that if they were to be laid end to end, they would go on for 62,000km which is longer than the circumference of the Earth.
A jewel thief made off with $28 million dollars of gems in 2007 because he was able to gain the trust of the guards working the bank in Antwerp, Belgium, by repeatedly offering them chocolates.
