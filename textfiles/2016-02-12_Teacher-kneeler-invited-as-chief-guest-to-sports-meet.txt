Teacher ‘kneeler’ invited as chief guest to sports-meet


	

The Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) has requested the Education Ministry to inquire as to why the Navagaththegama Navodya School Principal had invited former UPFA North-Western provincial councillor Ananda Sarath Kumara -- who was remanded for forcing a female teacher to kneel down before him last June -- for the school’s inter-house sports-meet.

CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said the politician who was charged with this offense had attended the sports-meet at the invitation of school Principal Malcom Peterson despite opposition from parents and teachers.

“This is an insult on the entire teacher profession. The politician, who forced the teacher in charge of discipline to kneel down before him for asking his daughter to lengthen the hem of her school uniform, has attended this very same school’s sports-meet as the chief guest. We urge the Education Ministry to investigate this matter and take action against the principal if found responsible for this despicable act,” he stated. (Piyumi Fonseka)
