For the 06th time, Mobitel recently hosted loyal customers to an unforgettable aviation experience with a once in a lifetime ride in a Helicopter. This initiative combined fun with awareness by outlining to loyal customers on board, the widespread nature of Mobitel’s 4G network, whilst highlighting its investment in providing holistic coverage to those across the country.

Past tours included sight-seeing of Galle, Ampara, Anuradhapura Trincomalee, Negombo as a part of this island-wide campaign that is now on its 06th leg.  Mobitel constantly lives up to its “We Care. Always” brand promise, and the roll-out of 4G LTE is testament to its promise to create equal access to the internet throughout the country at affordable rates. Here, the winners of Mobitel 4G Nation Campaign pose for photographs with the helicopter before taking to the skies.
