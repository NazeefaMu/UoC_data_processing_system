The Joint Opposition today questioned the non-emphasis on Palestine and Cuban issues in the recent address of President Maithripala Sirisena at the UN General Assembly in New York.

Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella, who was speaking during the Committee Stage debate on the budget, said all Sri Lankan Heads of State in the past had mentioned the Cuban and Palestine issue but this position had been for the first time changed in the recent speech."We would like to know whether Sri Lanka had changed its stance on the Palestine and Cuban issues," he asked.

He said it was sad to see the Minister of Foreign Affairs leaving these matters out during his speech and speaking on scams that have taken place in the past.

"There is FCID, CID and the Bribery Commission to deal with such matters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should not be worried about those," Rambukwella said. (Yohan Perera)
