Joining in the community spirit of the Vesak festival, Serendib Flour Mills (SFML) held a Banis Dansala near the Narahenpita Police Hospital for the local community for the third  consecutive year. The Banis Dansala was organized in partnership with Miyurasa Bakery in Narahenpita where 15,000 buns were distributed to an eager throng of people. The buns were prepared hygienically and packed in environmental-friendly paper bags. The Dansala commenced with a Buddhist priest chanting the gatha while blessing the event which drew a large crowed. This event also coincides with Serendib Flour Mills’ 10th Anniversary of successful operations. To mark the occasion, SFML has embarked on an annual campaign on the theme of ‘Nourishing The Nation’. As part of this initiative, 2,500 loaves of bread were distributed at the Piliyandala Dansal and 1,750 loaves of bread were distributed at the Mahiyangana Dansal by the company. SFML plans to conduct a similar Dansal for the upcoming Poson Poya as well.
