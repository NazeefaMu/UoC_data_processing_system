He foiled their plan to share the limelight!


	



 

Number One in yahapalanaya visited the flood-hit parts of the Kalutara district recently. He was due to participate in a shramadana in Pahiyangala area as well.

 

Media had given much publicity to the shramadana that Number One had planned to attend and Diyawanna members, purohitas and white-collar high-ups of the Kalutara district rushed to Pahiyangala and were waiting for the arrival of Number One for the event.


Number One on arrival in Pahiyangala saw the political and white collar bigwigs wearing gloves and boots waiting all agog at the venue of the proposed shramadana obviously for the purpose of posing for a picture with him.


Wise to the ways of publicity seekers, Number One after greeting them told them: “You all wait at this end. I’ll go over to the other end to start the shramadana. 


Having thus made it clear to the politicos and white collar bigwigs that they were not expected to follow him, Number One walked away.


Thus disappointed, the politicos and white collar ones had faded from the scene one by one, they say.
