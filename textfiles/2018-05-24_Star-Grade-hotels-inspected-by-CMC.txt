Municipality’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Ruwan Wijayamuni has instructed the PHIs to inspect the hotels for their food hygiene standards.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Medical Officer of Health (Central Colombo) Dr Subash Mendis said most of the hotels were found with minor incidents of food safety regulation violations.

“The hotels were inspected for food hygiene standards, including food preparations, freezer room conditions, garbage control, pest control and food labelling.

“Some hotels have not labelled food items, which were placed in freezers. The date of preparation and the date of expiry should be mentioned in these food items,” he said.

He said the Health Department had informed the management of these hotels about the violations of food safety regulations found in the hotels.

Dr Mendis said Chief Medical Officer Dr Wijayamuni had instructed to conduct more such hotel inspections next week as well.

A team of health officials including Dr Mendis, Chief Food Inspector Lal Kumara and a number of Public Health Inspectors (PHI) inspected the hotels yesterday under the instructions and guidance of Chief Medical Officer Dr Wijayamuni. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
