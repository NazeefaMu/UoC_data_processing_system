“Close the door on politicos!”


	



 

The country’s national body governing the gentlemen’s game has been a hotbed of power struggles over the years and several issues that had been simmering for some time in the recent past are about to trigger an explosive situation, they say.

 


Certain issues brewing for years took a back seat when the two main rivals closed ranks to put an end to the sway held by a willow-wielding family over the national game. 


However, the intolerant and overbearing attitude of the one who took over the reins has led to the imminent explosive situation, informed sources say.


Three outstanding characters associated with the game have now dug in for a pitched battle to oust the incumbent head and put back in the seat a seasoned player from a ‘new world’ (though not new to the game), who has always been keen on starting a ‘fresh innings’.


Meanwhile, independent high-ups involved in looking after the game at national level are unanimous in the opinion that closing the door on politicos is the only way to dispel for good Saturn’s malefic aspect over the game.
