The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) today recorded a statement from MP Lohan Ratwatte in connection with alleged irregularities which occurred during the construction of the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex.

The parliamentarian said he had given statement to the FCID as he was a director of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Foundation where the constructions of the sports complex was carried out.

He said President Sirisena had sent a letter to the FCID to commence an investigation into the construction of the sport complex alleging there was financial irregularities.

“I deny the claims made by the President and would like to state that the sports complex was constructed using funds from a number of individuals. This is a slander against those who are against the government,” he said.

The complex was constructed and is maintained by the army. (DS)
