Influenza: Nebulizer liquid not upto standard- GMOA


	

The nebulizer solution imported from Pakistan to be used for the prevailing influenza was contaminated and could pose more dangers to users, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) charged yesterday.

It also called for the resignation of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.

“It was proved in a Microbiology Investigation that one of the packs of the nebulizer solution was contaminated,” GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen de Zoysa said a news briefing. 

The GMOA charged that the nebulizer solution imported from Pakistan to be used for the prevailing influenza was not upto standard.

 “This situation would create further complexities, when somebody uses the nebulizer with germs. This would put victims of this influenza into further danger,” Dr de Zoysa said.

“One thing is clear that Minister Rajitha has been unable to tackle with the outbreak properly. The Government is still unable to declare properly whether the prevailing outbreak in South is influenza or not,” Dr. de Zoysa added.

He said the Government should be more responsible and should take prompt steps to mitigate the epidemic without letting it spread to other districts.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
