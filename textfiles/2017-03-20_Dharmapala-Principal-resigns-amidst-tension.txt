Dharmapala Principal resigns amidst tension


	



The growing protest by students and parents of Kottawa Dharmapala College compelled its newly-appointed Principal K.K. Wijeratne to tender his resignation today, Western Province Education Director Srilal Nonis said.

The claim that the principal’s appointment being politically influenced made headlines during the recent past.

By sending a letter yesterday to the School, Sri Jayawardenapura Zonal Education Director W W N K Ekanayake had informed about the resignation of the principal and had ordered Vice Principal S. G. Premasiri to act for the Principal until a new appointment is made.

According to the All Ceylon Teachers’ Union (ACTU), there had been a political influence behind Mr Wijeratne’s appointment and the appointed principal had scored fewer marks at the selection interview.

The parents who protested last Friday (17) on the issue accused that the assigned principal did not deserve the position as the Principal of Asoka Vidyalaya Y. S. Yasaratne had obtained the highest marks in the selection interview.

Commenting on the matter ACTU secretary Joseph Stalin said the Ministry should immediately intervene in the matter and stop political interference in the Education sector. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
