Some ministry subjects which fell vacant with the exit of six ministers who left the government after voting in favour of the No-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were temporary handed over to four existing ministers by President Maithripala Sirisena today.

Minister of Special Assignments Dr Sarath Amunugama was sworn in as the Acting Minister of Skills Development as well as Minister of Science and Technology Development in addition to his present Portfolio of Special Assignments. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was sworn in as Acting Minister of Disaster Management in addition to the subject of Renewable Energy and Petroleum Resources.

Minister Fazier Mustapha was sworn in as the Acting Minister of Sports in addition to his Portfolio of Local Government and Provincial Councils while Malik Samarawickrama was sworn in as the Acting Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare and Minister of Labour Relations in addition to his Portfolio of Development Strategies and International Trade.

Subject of Skills Development was previously held by Chandima Weerakody, Disaster Management was held by Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Sports by Dayasiri Jayasekera. S. B Dissanayake held the subject of Social Empowerment, Labour Relations was held by W. D. J. Seneviratne while Susil Premajyantha held the subject of Science and Technology Development.

All six of these ministers resigned from their posts as they decided to sit in the Opposition as a separate group after they voted in favour of the No-faith motion against the Premier.

Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena had informed the Ministers that a full reshuffle of the Cabinet would be done after the National New year.
