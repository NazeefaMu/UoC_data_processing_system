Britain said that Sri Lankan military has a crucial role to play in country’s commitment to addressing long-standing issues of reconciliation, accountability and human rights.

“The UK is supporting the Sri Lankan government in these efforts to build a peaceful, prosperous and united future,” the British High Commission in Colombo said issuing a statement on the visit of newly appointed UK non-resident Defence Advisor for Sri Lanka, Captain Stuart Borland and a team of defence delegation from UK Ministry of Defence last week.

The appointment of a UK non-resident Defence Advisor for Sri Lanka was announced last year following a meeting between Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Malta.  
 
At the invitation of the Sri Lanka Navy, Captain Borland and Deputy High Commissioner Laura Davies toured the Naval and Maritime Academy (NMA) in Trincomalee. Captain Borland also laid a wreath at the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery in Trincomalee.
 
In Colombo, Captain Borland accompanied the High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris, to meetings with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Commanders of the Army, Navy and Air Force.  

Captain Borland also accompanied a delegation from the UK Ministry of Defence, led by Deputy Head of International Policy and Plans (Military) Patricia Parkin, to meetings with representatives from the Ministry of Defence, civil society and the diplomatic community.  Discussions focused on opportunities for defence engagement activities in areas of mutual interest and concern.
 
Captain Borland said: “ I very much look forward to working with all three Services of the Armed Forces through defence engagement activities designed to support the Sri Lankan Government’s commitments to reconciliation, accountability and human rights.”
