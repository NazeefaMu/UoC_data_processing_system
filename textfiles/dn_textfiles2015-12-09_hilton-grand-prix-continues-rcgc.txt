Hilton Grand Prix continues at RCGC

The Ladies Section of the Royal Colombo Golf Club recently concluded the 13th round of the Hilton Grand Prix recently. The Grand Prix has been combined with the 16 monthly medal tournaments and is without doubt one of the most prestigious events on the RCGC Ladies Calendar, as it is played over a period of one year. The top 10 placings at the end of the year reflect the player's talents, stamina and enthusiasm for the game as the more rounds played, the better the chances of being ranked in the top ten.
The Hilton Hotel Colombo has sponsored the Grand Prix, thus titled Hilton Grand Prix, for over 15 years. At the end of the year, the Hilton hosts a gala prize giving and party for the over 125 golfers. The Hilton itself boasts a number of venues for dinner and entertainment and while traditionally the Hilton Grand Prix prize giving has been held in the Ballroom, this year it will be held at "THE BLUE" the newest and chicest venue at the Hilton.
At the conclusion of the 13th round, the top 10 ranked players and their respective scores are as follows:
1.Sumudu Desinghe (1096), 2.Iman Sangani (1059), 3.Sumethra Ukwatte (924), 4.Ruvani Desinghe (920), 5.Fran De Mel (914), 6.Kumari Herath (834), 7.Suni Nirmalalingam (822), 8.Chris Benjamin (759), 9.Niranjalie Amarasuriya (748), 10. Sharon Hall (732).
However, with another 3 rounds to go, there will be fierce competition as the final winners are considered the RCGC's most capable and talented lady golfers.
