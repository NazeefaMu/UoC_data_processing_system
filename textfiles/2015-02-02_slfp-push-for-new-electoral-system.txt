	Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), as the main opposition, stressed the need for the change of current electoral system to the mix of the First- Past -the Post System and the Proportional Representation System during the 100-day programme of the new government, party officials said yesterday.
	Senior SLFP MP John Seneviratne told the Daily Mirror yesterday both the government and the opposition gave an undertaking to enact fresh legislation to provide for such electoral reforms and it would be proper for both sides to honour the pledge.
	Mr. Seneviratne said SLFP was ready to cooperate with the new government in the exercise.  
	“We propose the First-Past the Post System to ensure representation for each electorate. Likewise, a certain quota of MPs should be elected under the Proportional Representation System. That is to ensure representation for minor and minority parties,” he said.
	Mr. Seneviratne who is also the Chief Opposition Whip said his party would not mind the extension of the dissolution of Parliament after the 100-day programme for a few more months to find time for the delimitation of electorates under the proposed system.
	Earlier, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane also pressed for electoral reforms to be implemented under the new regime.
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at that moment that the government would appoint an all-party committee  to work in this regard.(Kelum Bandara)
