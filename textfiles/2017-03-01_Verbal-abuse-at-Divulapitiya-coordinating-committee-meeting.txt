Verbal abuse at Divulapitiya coordinating committee meeting


	

When the Divulapitiya Divisional coordinating committee meeting was in session yesterday, an argument between the Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment and Social Welfare Ranjan Ramanayake and Gampaha District MP Indika Anuruddha grew so tense that the meeting had to be abruptly adjourned.

The meeting had commenced yesterday with the Co-chairmen of the committee presiding. The controversial Divisional Secretary Ms H.M.L.S. Herath was also present. When the Deputy Minister Ramanayake questioned the OIC of Kotadeniyawa Police Inspector D.D. Wickramasinghe about an incident involving a soil excavation in Waradala, MP Indika Anuruddha had mentioned about a petition received by the committee on the same matter where after obtaining permit for excavation of 500 cubes, 60,000 cubes had been excavated.

This led to arguments and counter arguments and slating each other using improper language. When the hurling of abuse became so severe and the temper of the duo rising higher, supporters of both parties and the security personnel stood up to separate them. However, the arguments continued for about 45 minutes and the Director of Planning Ms Asha Siriwardene declared the meeting as adjourned.

The police and the supporters accompanied the warring duo out of the meeting hall.(Pushpakumara Mallawarachchi)
