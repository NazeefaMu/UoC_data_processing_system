Resolution on Sri Lanka
'Goes beyond levels of mechanism on war crime investigations'

Criticizing the recently tabled resolution on Sri Lanka by the US, Sri Lanka and other partners at the UN Human Rights Council, the National Patriotic Movement yesterday said at a discussion held at the Abhayarama temple in Narahenpita, that the resolution reflects an R2P type intervention by the US.
The Movement's General Secretary Dr Wasantha Bandara said, the resolution in question is one that goes beyond levels of war crime justice or mechanism on war crime investigations.
He said," Under the pretext of transitional justice, the US-proposed resolution is seeking to punish military personnel of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces without even court hearings having to be held in terms of the the allegations concerned through two Commissions, namely the Truth Commission and the Commission on the Disappearance of Persons."
He said, "the functions of the two commissions have already begun due to the disappearance of Ekneligoda over which a number of military intelligence officers have been taken into custody even before the establishment of what would be a shared justice mechanism as per the resolution."
"It seems that this process would be carried forward indefinitely, regardless of the proposed justice mechanism," he said.
If the international community has so much confidence in Sri Lanka's judicial system since the advent of the new government, there is no need for them to have any participatory role in carrying out its functions, he said.
"It is very clear that the proposed judicial mechanism with international participation is going to take place in Sri Lanka," he said.
The guest speakers on this occasion were Mohan Samaranayaka and Shamindra Ferdinando.
