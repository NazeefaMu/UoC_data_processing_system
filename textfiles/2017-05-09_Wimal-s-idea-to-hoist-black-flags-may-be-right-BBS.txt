Wimal’s idea to hoist black flags may be right: BBS


	

The government had done all the preparations to make this country a colony of India and it should be stopped, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said yesterday.

Addressing a media conference in Colombo, the Thera said MP Wimal Weerawansa may be trying to point out the reason, why we should hoist black flags during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modiour and when our country becomes a colony of India.

Mr. Weerawansa, at the May Day rally held in Galle Face green, had requested the people to hoist black flags in protest over Modi’s visit and handing over of Trincomalee port to India.

He had stated that Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka during the Vesak festival would not be in favour of the country and therefore, requested to hoist black flags.

The Thera said the President should not deceive the people by issuing statements saying the government would not take any steps to sell the country’s assets to foreign companies.

“Patriotic forces in the country and even the BBS have a doubt on the reasons to invite the Indian Prime Minister to celebrate Vesak and this should be analyzed in a different perspective,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
