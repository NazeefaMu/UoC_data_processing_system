A conspiracy is being hatched by NGOs using foreign funds to create religious and communal disturbances in the country and to attribute it to Ven. Gnanasara Thera, Chairman of Anti Corruption Front Ven. Ulapane Sumangala Thera said yesterday.

"These NGOs are attempting to tarnish the image of the Maha Sangha and the Buddha Sasana through false propaganda. However, the court meted out justice today and settled the issue in a fair manner," the Thera said addressing the media after bail was given to Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven.

Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera. “We want every citizen in the country to be equal before the law without being subject to discrimination or due to communal or religious allegiances. Any law applicable to Ven. Gnanasara Thera should be applicable to others, including individuals engaged in illegally clearing the country’s forest reserves.

Meanwhile, BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said the BBS had been facing allegations that it was taking a hard line on events taking place in the country and were involved in making hate speeches around the country. “We cannot stop raising issues that affect the country today. Henceforth, I will leave this campaign in the hands of our well-versed, well-cultured and scholarly Buddhist monks,” the Thera emphasised. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Yoshitha Perera)
