A successful journalist should have an eagle eye, must work hard and have an inquiring mind, Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said today at the Asidisi Journalist Scholarship Award Ceremony held at the Government Information Auditorium.
“Journalism is not a bed of roses. Journalism cannot be confined to air conditioned rooms. Unwavering effort and dedication should be the qualities of a successful journalist. In brief, an individual who is keen to be a good journalist must be infected by the journalism bug,” the minister said.
He was the Chief Guest at the Award Ceremony where several journalists were awarded scholarship certificates.
The minister said a journalist had a duty to keep the people informed about what was happening in the country. (PiyumiFonseka)
