A mother of two children, who was driving her own vehicle accompanied by her eight-year-old daughter, was the target of an unidentified gunman recently in Weligampitiya, Ja-Ela.   


The injured was rushed to the Ragama teaching hospital by a council member of Jaela Pradeshiya Sabha for urgent treatment. However she succumbed to the injuries she had sustained.   


The deceased had been identified as Warnakulasuriyage Anne Rasika Rowel (40), a resident of Kurunduwatte area in Weligampitiya Ja-Ela. She was a past pupil of De Mazenod College Kandana. Her husband, Deepal Costa, is employed in Italy. Sources revealed that after marriage the couple had a stint in Italy and on their return had nurtured the idea of opening a preschool in the Ja-Ela area.   

 


This car which was travelling on the same route suddenly overtook her vehicle. Shots were fired at Anne Rasika’s car using a firearm



On the day of the incident Anne Rasika had visited the Weligampitiya Roman Catholic Church accompanied by her eight-year-old daughter to obtain blessings for the new Pre-School she intended opening soon. They had been returning home around 12.30 noon on Sunday (September 30) unnoticed that a car was following them. This car which was travelling on the same route suddenly overtook her vehicle. Shots were fired at Anne Rasika’s car using a firearm. The firing had damaged the door of the car. The bullets that had come through the door had hit her body in several places. The child, who was with her, had miraculously escaped injury.   
The onlookers who surrounded Annes car first did not want to help in taking her to the hospital. Vipula Jayakody, a council member who stepped forward, braved the occasion and opted to take her to the nearest hospital for treatment. The injured person was first taken to the Ja-Ela Hospital and later transferred to the Ragama Teaching Hospital. Despite the exhaustive efforts of the doctors, Anne succumbed to the injuries she had sustained.   


Anne after returning to Sri Lanka had been keen on enhancing the future of her twelve-year-old son Julian and eight-year-old daughter Elisha. With this aim she had admitted the two children to St. Thomas International College in Seeduwa. All hopes she had for their futures now appears to be shattered.

   
Police suspect that Anne Rasika had been the target of a contract killing by a group of individuals. But the Police believe that this could be a case of mistaken identity and suspect whether Anne was actually the intended target for the killing.
