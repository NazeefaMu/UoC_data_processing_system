Israeli-Palestinian clashes, three attacks rock West Bank

JERUSALEM: New violence erupted in the West Bank Thursday with four Palestinian attackers shot dead by Israeli forces, as Israel recoiled over a video showing Jewish extremists celebrating a Palestinian toddler's death.
The upsurge in violence came after nearly three months of attacks and protests but with the violence having become less frequent in recent weeks.
The ongoing unrest has led to a sharp decrease in pilgrims travelling to the West Bank city of Bethlehem, where the Bible says Jesus was born, for Christmas Eve celebrations and the traditional midnight mass at the Church of the Nativity.
Early on Thursday, a Palestinian stabbed two security guards at an entrance to an industrial zone at the Jewish settlement of Ariel, the largest in the north of the occupied West Bank, before being shot dead.
Both of the victims suffered moderate wounds, police said.
The assailant was identified as Mohammed Zahran, 23, from the nearby village of Kafr Addik.
Later, a Palestinian tried to attack soldiers with a screwdriver at a checkpoint near the West Bank city of Hebron and was shot dead. The Palestinian health ministry identified him as Iyad Idaissat, 25, from the village of Yatta.
A third incident saw a Palestinian shot dead attempting to ram his car into a military post near the Adam junction northeast of Jerusalem, the army said. Bilal Zayd, 23, was from the Qalandiya refugee camp between Jerusalem and Ramallah, where clashes broke out Thursday between Israeli security forces and Palestinians.
Israeli forces were said to have entered the camp to arrest three suspects, local officials said. Seven people were wounded, including two from gunshots to the head, according to camp official Jamal Lafi said.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli army said the forces were "assaulted by a violent mob" of Palestinians shooting at them and throwing rocks, Molotov cocktails and explosive devices.
"The force responded to the immediate danger and fired toward the gunmen. Hits were confirmed," she said.
A wave of violence since the start of October has claimed the lives of 129 on the Palestinian side, 19 Israelis, an American and an Eritrean.
Many of the Palestinians killed have been attackers while others have been shot dead by Israeli security forces during clashes.
A number of them have attempted attacks with kitchen knives in what some analysts have described as virtual suicide missions.
Palestinians have grown frustrated with Israel's occupation, the complete lack of progress in peace efforts and their own fractured leadership.
Meanwhile, Israeli officials vehemently condemned a video showing gun-wielding Jewish extremists at a wedding celebrating the death of a Palestinian toddler in a firebombing, with authorities saying they opened an investigation.
The video, broadcast by an Israeli news programme, has spread online and drawn strong condemnation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the images "shocking" and called participants "a danger to Israeli society."
Representatives of all of Israel's political spectrum, including the far-right Jewish Home, spoke out harshly against the group of so-called hilltop youths depicted in it.
The video shows guests at the wedding of a radical right-wing couple dancing with guns, knives and at least one unlit Molotov cocktail, while also stabbing a picture of the toddler killed in a firebombing blamed on Jewish extremists.
That attack killed 18-month-old Ali Saad Dawabsha, and fatally injured his parents. The toddler's four-year-old brother was the sole survivor from the immediate family.
