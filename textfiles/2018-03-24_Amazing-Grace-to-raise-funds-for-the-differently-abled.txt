‘Amazing Grace’ to raise funds for the differently abled


	

Prestantia Music School Junior Concert Choir

 

“Amazing Grace”- An Easter Choral Reflection will be presented by the Prestantia Chorale on March 25, (Palm Sunday) at 6.30pm at The Methodist Church Wellawatta, 1st Chapel Lane, Galle Road, Colombo 6. As in the past, this event will be free and open to anyone interested in music. The chorale intends to raise funds for the Ceylon Schools for the Deaf & Blind in Ratmalana (CSDB) through ‘Free will donations.’  


The Prestantia Chorale will present an Easter choral programme for the fifth consecutive year and promises an evening of reflective, spirit-filled choral music to celebrate the season. The choir will play a prominent role towards communicating a variety of emotions through songs ranging from Classical to Contemporary Repertoire. It must be emphasized that the Prestantia Music School, a leading Performing Arts School, outside the Colombo city was successful at its very first attempt at a choral competition! According to Dr. Priyeshni Perera, one of the core objectives besides coaching for this initiative was for her teams to exercise ‘soft skills’ such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, punctuality, tolerance and social responsibility which are becoming increasingly challenging to observe in a competitive millennial society.   


Why raise funds for the CSDB ? It’s the largest and the oldest school in the country set up in 1912 for special needs children and provides meals and accommodation for free besides the special needs education to 700+ students.  With the rising cost of food and other costs, a donation of any kind goes a long way towards meeting their basic needs, explained Desmond Perera, the principal of the school. The Deaf & Blind School is governed by the Board of Trustees and the Diocese of Colombo (Anglican Church) which strives to raise funds through well-wishers and donors.  


 In raising funds for this worthy cause ‘Prestantia Junior Open Choir’ of the Prestantia Music School will join-in with the Chorale this year too. The instrumental ensemble will consist of (Dr.) Priyeshni P. Perera (Piano), Christopher Prins (Percussion), Saranga Cooray (Cello) , Sachiththa Fernando (Violin), Nimalka Marian (Keyboard Synthesizer), and Sound Engineering Support by Janaka Fernando of “Xtreme Entertainment” and Madhawa Perera of “Ad Lib Pictures.”
