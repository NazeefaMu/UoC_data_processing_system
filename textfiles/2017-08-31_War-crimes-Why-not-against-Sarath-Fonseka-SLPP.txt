War crimes: Why not against Sarath Fonseka: SLPP


	

In the wake of lawsuits filed against ex-army commander and Sri Lanka's former ambassador to Brazil, Jagath Jayasuriya, the Ex-servicemen's Association affiliated to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna today asked why similar charges had not been filed against ex-army commander and MP, Sarath Fonseka.

Its convener Ajith Prasanna said Mr. Jayasuriya served under Mr. Fonseka who was the then army commander and asked whether it was because Mr. Fonseka had become a stooge of this US-sponsored government that he had been exempted of such charges.

“These allegations levelled against Jagath Jayasuriya is a serious blow to the Sri Lanka Army. We condemn these allegations by the Tamil diaspora,” Mr. Prasanna said and pointed out that proper procedures had not been followed when appointing Maj. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake as Army Commander and Rear Admiral Travis Sinniah as Navy Commander.(Sheain Fernandopulle)
