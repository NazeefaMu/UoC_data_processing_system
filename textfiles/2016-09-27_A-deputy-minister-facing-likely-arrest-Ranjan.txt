A deputy minister is expected to be arrested soon because the investigations into his deals have been completed, State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.

He told the media that this arrest would be historical because it would be the first instance where a deputy minister in office would be arrested on corruption charges.

“This will prove that even a minister will not be able to get away with corruption under the present administration,"

the state minister said adding that the Bribery Commission had questioned nearly 15 ministers.

He claimed that even Minister Rajitha Senaratne had been questioned a few times.

“I and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Vijitha Herath have requested that the rear gate of the Bribery Commission be kept closed so that these ministers cannot get away secretly. Most of these MPs get away from the rear gate in vehicles with tinted glasses," the state minister said. (Yohan Perera)
