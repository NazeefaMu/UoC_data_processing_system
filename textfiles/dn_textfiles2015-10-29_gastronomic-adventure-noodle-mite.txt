Gastronomic adventure with Noodle-Mite

Hot on the heels of its recent launch of Chocolate-Mite, Unilever Sri Lanka takes the gastronomic adventure to another level with the launch of yet another innovation – Noodle-Mite.
Conjured by Sri Lanka’s celebrity and revolutionary chef Koluu, Noodle-Mite is not simply a deliciously mouthwatering dish of noodles with minced chicken or beef and Marmite. It is more than that. It’s a carefully orchestrated ensemble of well-balanced flavours which seamlessly blend with the meats. That correct dash of Marmite brings out a palette of distinctive flavours which then gradually travel on one’s palate to climax in an exhilarating explosion of tastes … making one crave for more.
“My raison d’etre and passion have always been to create new culinary experiences. There’s a lot of hidden magic in matching and mixing flavours to tantalise the taste buds and please the palate. As a child, Marmite was always to me a soup or a spread. But today, years downs the line, I’m delighted to work with Marmite and take off on a yummy culinary ride with Noodle-Mite”, chef Koluu enthused.
“Marmite has been a trusted companion of thousands of Sri Lankans over the past many decades. They have literally grown up with the taste of Marmite. In our journey of creating Marmite Mealtime Magic we are delighted to join hands with celebrity Chef Koluu and create lots more adventure with Noodle-Mite which will be exclusively available at Ginger in two options - Chicken and Beef”, Unilever Sri Lanka Brand Manager Marmite Bianca de Silva stated.
