He dealt equally with people of all walks of life


	

It is 10 years since the passing away of Justice Ramanathan. I remember the first day I met him, thirty eight years ago, as if it was yesterday. It was at the residence of my dear friend, Tony Fernando. I was just a law student. Tony’s father was a District Judge and Mr. Ramanathan was High Court Judge - Matara. I was introduced to Justice Ramanathan by Tony’s late father, as a law student. That great gentleman immediately put me at ease and spoke to me as if he had known me for many years. My admiration for him grew ever since. I found in him a great source of inspiration, as did many others who had the good fortune of associating with him closely. I am reminded of the words of Professor G L Pieris, when he spoke at the six months remembrance of the Late Justice Ramanathan - when he said, “he was one of those people who felt genuinely at home and comfortable with people of all walks of life”.   

Justice G P S de Silva, former Chief Justice, an equally admirable gentleman, was a close friend of Justice Ramanathan. He was Additional Solicitor General, head of the Criminal Division of the Attorney General’s Department, when he summoned me one day and said, “I am sending you for the next session, to prosecute before Rama. Make the maximum out of this opportunity and learn”. What I learnt before Justice Ramanathan, was not just the law. The manner in which he conducted himself on the bench, endeared him to counsel as well as litigants. No one left a court presided over by him with the sour feeling that he did not get a fair hearing. Justice Ramanathan was courteous. Never did he use a harsh word on anyone who came before a court presided over by him. He patiently listened to a submission made by the most junior counsel, as he did when a senior Queen’s Counsel made submissions before him. I often felt, judging by our mortal standards, he was a person of limitless compassion 
and patience.   


He was stern and firm as expected of a judicial officer. None could read his mind when making submissions. All that one was assured of, was a just Order. Yes, he did it his way.   
Deshamanya P Ramanathan was a descendent of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan. He was educated at St Joseph’s College - Colombo, was a Barrister-at-law, and a Bencher of Gray’s Inn. During his distinguished and multifaceted career, he served as a State Counsel, a High Court Judge, a Judge and also the President of the Court of Appeal, a Judge of the Supreme Court, member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, Governor of the Western Province, Chancellor of the Uva Wellassa University, and Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.   
Outside his official activities, the late Justice Ramanathan, was an active member of the Medico Legal Society of Sri Lanka, and once served as its President. He was a past president of the British Scholars’ Association and of the Rotary Club. He was well known for his participation in the activities of the Kennel Club where his Dachshunds won awards at many competitions.   
He was a man blessed with many virtues. He carried them with unimaginable grace and humility. He was a genuine friend on whom one could rely. Many junior members of the legal profession looked up to him for guidance. They saw in him a reliable friend.   


One of the most notable features I observed in the late Justice Ramanathan’s character is his sensitivity to problems of others. He was sensitive to problems of those who worked under him, in a way any person could rarely be. On numerous occasions I had seen, members of the staff and even helpless juniors come to him with their problems and difficulties, and thereafter, Justice Ramanathan responded as if it was his own problem. He was indeed a great man.   
A beautiful verse, the author of which I am unaware, but quite often quoted by my good friend Kumar Arulanandam, reads as follows:   
“The world is full of froth and bubble - but two things stand as stone; Kindness in others troubles - and courage in your own”   


In the late Justice Ramanathan, I saw this quality in abundance.   
Though, I had associated with Justice Ramanathan quite closely, I did not have the opportunity of meeting Mrs Mano Ramanathan until a few years ago. However, her late Father Mr Subbiah Saravanamuttu, was an advocate of high repute, with an extensive practice who used to appear before the High Court of Batticaloa, when I was prosecuting there. I still remember when I was introduced to Mrs Ramanathan her spontaneous response was, “Oh! So you are this Palitha Fernando, of whom Rama used to speak quite often.” I could think of no better honour or compliment!   
The Late Justice Ramanathan has been described as a good judge, a fine prosecutor, a jurist of very high calibre, and those are but a few of the accolades achieved by him during his career spanning over 40 years. But to me, without fear of contradiction or accusation of adulation, I can safely say, that above all, he was one of the finest human beings I have ever met.   
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Moksha!
