Rotaractors of National School of Business Management create platform of power

When beauty and brains combine the result could be a formidable force! The effect of the combined synergies of Dr. Janaki Kuruppu, Rosy Senanayake, Kaishika Rodrigo and Stephanie Siriwardhana caused a ripple effect in the hearts and minds of those present at a forum at LakshmanKadirgamar Institute on November 25.  

Setting the pace for the event, held under the theme ‘Women of Change’, were the Rotaractors of National School of Business Management, who paved the way for the interesting, thought-provoking and radical ideas to be shared from ‘womb-to-tomb’ transition of women and also men in contention.  

This event was a success due to the patronage of Youth Magazine Sri Lanka (the strategic partner of the event), Brandix Lanka Limited and Millennium IT (Platinum Sponsor).  

Powerful themes 

Themes ranging from girl-child to motherhood, parenting patterns, part-time and professional work, societal attitudes, taboos, stereotyping and empowerment in essence were discussed in order to feed the minds of youth and society at large. These topics have the power to serve as change-agents and empower women. The topics also have the potential to positively influence the thinking of men.  

Dr. Kuruppu reiterated the strong influence of her father as being contributory to her professional success in ‘perceived’ male-dominated realms such as mathematics, which enabled her to step out of traditional cocoons and compete on equal footing with men.   
Dr. Kuruppu champions the ideals of motherhood and the power of a mother’s love. She is invited to corporate meetings, corporate boards and has been at the helm of commerce and enterprise in Sri Lanka, at Tea-Board and Mother Lanka, owing to her brilliance, business acumen and resilience.  

Echoing her sentiments Siriwardhana, who having grown-up with three brothers, a supportive father, and now a fiance, as well as a mother who championed her dreams and ideals, is a unique example of a woman whose brains and beauty have showcased Sri Lanka at international beauty pageants, as a contestant and judge.  

Championing her intrinsic talents in Latin American dance, she is undeterred by societal criticism or norms and has delved into Pole Dancing, with elegance and fervour.  

First Sri Lanka female comedian Contrary to Siriwardhana, Rodrigo faced challenges to champion her plethora of talents, which ranged from drama, music, public speaking, debating and sports. She was finally able to fund her unique niche of being a stand-up Comedian; a first for a Sri Lankan woman!  

She endorses the fact that siblings of different gender should ideally be brought up by parents on an equal footing and given opportunities for talents to emerge and develop, rather than be kept dormant.  

Touching a chord with children and women, a globally well-known face in the spheres of beauty, deportment, grooming and also in politics, Senanayake commands respect. She has an inimitable persona which speaks of courage, compassion and yet takes on the every challenge and battle with strength and zeal.  Her forthcoming initiative ‘Think Equal’ will be mooted in schools, montessori and will permeate across society to parents, teachers and caregivers.  

It’s envisioned as a powerful tool set to shatter mindsets that debar positive thinking and progress. There is hope that a new paradigm shift in thinking will benefit for the girl-child and boy-child alike.  

Her many citations of being discriminated in politics, degraded and side-lined struck a chord of sympathy for the marginalised women in Sri Lanka, India and the rest of the world.  

Her determination and strong voice for equality and justice, through policy and legislation should be applauded.  

Alles in her address to the gathering spoke of heroines, such as women who trudged for miles to fetch water, to feed their children and then went to work.  

She shared an emphatic story of a selfless woman, who shared her property and erected a tube-well; the memories she recalled capturing the imagination of the affluent men and women who formed the audience.  

The event generated much interest and thought-provoking new ideals for empowerment, action plans for change and the power of a collective voice to resonate around the world, through media and like-minded forums, to benefit all Sri Lankans.  

Ushan Samarakone, Brand Activation Manager, was present on behalf of Youth Magazine Sri Lanka to endorse the event.  The event was organised and executed by Rtr. Farshard Samsudeen and Rtr. Tabit Jeffrey and their ‘Women of Change’ Team from Rotaract Club of National School of Business Management  

The public is invited to collaborate with the organisers for future themed events which will be catalyst in positive change.
