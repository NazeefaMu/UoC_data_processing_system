The Special Task Force (STF) camp in Mannar which was established in 2010 has been shifted to Parayanakulam with effect from yesterday, the STF said.

“The camp was on a land belonging to the National Youth Corps. We vacated the premises when we were informed that the National Youth Services Council needed it for its activities,” STF Commandant Senior DIG M. R Latiff said.

The Ministry of Law and Order allocated a 38 acre land in Parayanakulam about two months ago, he said.

Responding to a query about Tamil political parties requesting the government to shift the said camp, the DIG said move was logistical and not done under political pressure. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
