Aloysius never offered us money: Hadunnetti
	
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti said Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., owner Arjun Aloysius had never offered any money to Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MPs and pointed out that Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake was trying to prove his innocence by even involving our members.
He told Daily Mirror that the JVP MPs were not engaged in corrupt politics or deals and that money or other inducements could not buy them over.
If Aloysius wanted to buy us, we are the ones who may have been sold for the highest price because we led the probe on the bond scam through COPE. But he never even attempted to approach us for support as he knew we can not be bought over, he said.
Commenting on Deputy Minister Ramanayakes claim that he and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake were the only two MPs who had refused to accept money from Aloysius, Mr. Hadunnetti said Aloysius had never contacted Mr. Dissanayake on this matter.(Ajith Siriwardana)

An encounter that transformed the world
	
Nothing else in recorded history has created as much a sensation or evoked as much sentiment among living beings as that rarest of events on earth, the attainment of Absolute Omniscience and discovery of the liberating law by Gautama Buddha over twenty five centuries ago. Its origin runs back to the extremely hazy past,where a young Brahmin named Sumedha received a definitive assertion from Piyamatura Buddha of his impending Buddhahood. The episode as revealed by the Blessed One through His absolute psychic power of recollection provides a veritable window into the astoundingly wondrous world of a Bodhisatta, a Buddha in the making.
In plentiful and resplendent Amarawathie likened in the canon to paradisiacal city of Alamakanda was an immensely wealthy young Brahmin called Sumedha who had lost his parents in childhood. Still in the prime of youth he reached the zenith in veda, study of history and lineaments (lakkhana) contained in the ten thousand Purana texts. In solitude the deep thinker engaged himself in an incisive process of philosophical rationalization that almost borders a subliminal homily of a Perfectly Enlightened Being to be found in scripture.
He reasoned, in this cycle of re-becoming conception is painful, so is disintegration of the body. There necessarily ought to be a path of escape, and I shall discover it. He reasoned further. If birth and suffering are perceived in the world, so should be non-suffering and non-birth. Where there is evil there is also lenity, so also when existence is manifest in the world non-existence too ought to be equally manifest. If a man smeared in excreta avails not of a water filled pond it is no fault of the pond, so also if one fails to shed his defilements it is none others blunder. As a man freeing himself of a rotting carcass dangling from his neck, so I shall abandon this body of mine of gross impurities without reservation.

Being constantly absorbed in the concentration of this superior knowledge, he failed to observe any of the thirty two extraordinary phenomena that accompanied the conception of Deepankara Buddha
Even as men and women having cast aside excrement move away with indifference, so too I shall cast away this body filled with loathsome odours. My ancestors departed this world leaving behind this immense fortune, but when I leave I shall certainly take it with me to the next world. So saying be opened the doors of his treasure houses allowing anyone and everyone, rich or poor, straight or crooked to remove whatever and however much he wishes and left for the foot of the Himalayas to embark on a regime of sheer asceticism is search of the perennial truth.
Covered in tattered robes with twelve-fold immanent features of holiness, seated under a tree signified by the ten-fold meritorious characteristics, consuming only ripe fruit fallen off branches, he attained the five magical powers abinna within a week. Being constantly absorbed in the concentration of this superior knowledge, he failed to observe any of the thirty two extraordinary phenomena that accompanied the conception of Deepankara Buddha, His birth, the Total Awakening and preaching of the first Great Sermon.
One day while traveling through air with the rag rustling in the wind, he observed the inhabitants of a border town clearing a pathway with delightful enthusiasm. On descending, he was informed that they were anticipating the arrival of Deepankara Buddha who has made His appearance on earth. Elated beyond expression, uttering the words Buddha, Buddha he too began clearing a stretch of road assigned to him at his request. Before he could complete the task Great Being Deepankara, accompanied by four hundred thousand bhikkhus, arrived amidst unprecedented jubilation of men and of Gods who were visible to all. Ascetic Sumedha let loose the knotted hair and lay himself prostrate on the leather spread on the ground with half-open mouth in awe. Let Samma Sambuddha and the multitude of great Arahants tread upon me without soiling their feet. A thought came upon him, if I wish I could burn out all the cankers today, but of what use is it I must attain that state of omniscience of a Samma Sambuddha myself to rescue the mass of men and heavenly beings from recurring misery. The eight conditions-existence as a human, being a male, adequate merit to attain holiness in that birth itself, seeing a living Buddha, having gone forth, possession of the eight attainments, willingness to sacrifice ones life in the cause, a fervent desire of Buddhahood  with these the resolve succeeds.

The knower of the worlds Deepankara Buddha came near him and declared, Do you see this very severe ascetic, this matted hair ascetic Innumerable eons from now he would be a Buddha of the world. Leaving the delightful city of Kapila he will perform the austerities with great vigour. On the banks of river Neranjana, he would partake of the milk-rice accepted under the Ajpal and proceed to the foot of the Bodhi tree along the magnificent path prepared by the luminous ones; there the Great Awakening of the Unsurpassed One will take place. His mother will be Mahamaya and father Suddhodana. He himself would be Gautama. The upper age limit of the Awakened One will be a hundred years Denizens of the ten thousand planes rejoiced and sang paeans over those words of the Peerless One. If we miss this opportunity of the sorrowless state before Piyamatura Buddha we would definitely reach it in Gautama Buddhas dispensation, they said.

In solitude the deep thinker engaged himself in an incisive process of philosophical rationalization that almost borders a subliminal homily of a Perfectly Enlightened Being to be found in scripture
This solemn occasion was marked by an event of extraordinary nature. A young girl in the crowd approached the ascetic with a bundle of flowers in her hand, eight of which she offered him and three kept behind with a prayer that she be his companion through his long journey right to the end. The prayer came true, she was his partner in life up to his last birth of Siddhartha as Princess Yasodhara.
When all were gone, the Bodhisatta rose from the ground and sat cross-legged right there, elated, entranced, enraptured. In the ten thousand world systems there isnt an austere ascetic like me, neither in mastery of the five powers. All strange omens visible during previous Bodhisattas conferments by Samma Sambuddhas were present on this occasion too.

Amidst a myriad such miraculous occurrences and benign pronouncements of the exultant Gods and Brahmas, Bodhisatta Sumedhas resolve was unshakeable. There is no doubting a Buddhas word. Seated cross-legged he contemplated the celestial and human worlds, the ten directions and Parami (Perfections) required for the Great Awaking, liberality, morality, renunciation, energy, forbearance, truthfulness, resolution, loving kindness and equanimity. Parami of ultimate liberality denotes letting go in the manner of a downturned pot, of all possessions priceless, mediocre and inferior. The mass of people in the hall where Deepankara Buddha was partaking of his midday meal lay sprawled on the ground in fright. The Great Seer allayed their fears that ascetic Sumedha is examining as did all previous Bodhisattas the necessitudes of omniscience, hence the occurrence of strange phenomena, whereupon the people returned to worship Bodhisatta again. The Bodhisatta then paid obeisance to Deepankara Buddha from where he was and retreated to the great forest to perfect the Paramis.

Amidst a myriad such miraculous occurrences and benign pronouncements of the exultant Gods and Brahmas, Bodhisatta Sumedhas resolve was unshakeable. There is no doubting a Buddhas word
In the fathomless journey from ascetic Sumedha of Amarawathie to Prince Siddharatha of Kapilawattu there wasnt virtually a life unlived by him or a role not played - the mystery of samsara. Yet mundane, there was no sin uncommitted or precept not violated sans the fourth, of uttering falsehoods since he was on an unfailing voyage in search of the Universal Truth. Save the blazing Niraya and the five pure abodes, there wasnt a world he was not born in. If born on a pure abode I would not have returned to the human world declared He. On occasions he was an adulterer and a robber chief. He was born a lion, a fox, an ape, a serpent, an oxen and as other creatures but none smaller in proportion than a snipe. At every such turn he was leader of the group.
Likewise the times he ruled districts and kingdoms and was born a Wheel Turning Monarch (Sakvithi) were countless. Consummation of the ten perfections brought forth a plethora of wonders in his final life such as the thirty two great male features, just to mention one. Yet, as explained in Pilopadana Sutta, He faced twelve hindrances even in Buddhahood by way of residue kamma.
The Sumedha narrative as enunciated by the Blessed One defines the limits of intellectual and spiritual endeavour that precede Buddhahood and as masterfully prefaced in Buddhawamsa of Kuddhaka Nikaya, is indicative of the path to elimination of human ego, lingering sorrow, lifes tedium and the last fetter.

Another case of criminal waste of public funds
	
It has come to light that a former purohita, a typical political turncoat from the upcountry, had spent some Rs.20 million on converting to his Ministry office a three-storey building taken on rent.
What is worse is the payment for making the necessary structural changes to the building, which incidentally had cost a monthly rental of Rs. 1.2 million, had been made to the purohitas wife who appears to have handled the job herself.
However, this building had not been put to any productive use and the errant purohitas successor has already brought this colossal waste of public funds to the notice of those in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya, they say.

There is a sidekick of a powerful purohita having his political base in Digamadulla and he is said to have once aimed a kick at the chair of a woman white-collar high-up at divisional level in a bid to win brownie points from his master.
This sidekick, incidentally, a member of a local body in Kandiya area had screamed obscenities at the same woman white-collar one at a recent sitting of the local body, they say.
Practically all members of the local body including his own party ones had taken exception to the crude language used by the purohitas sidekick to abuse the divisional white-collar high-up. A tape-recording of the sidekicks harangue has been sent to his mentor, they say.

Awards bonanza  for SL,Bangladesh at 8th SAARC Film Festival
	

It was a rich harvest of awards for Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the 8th SAARC Film Festival which concluded here on Sunday. While Sri Lanka bagged the Best Director, Best Actor and Best Sound Recording awards and also a Special Jury award, Bangladesh walked away with the Best Feature Film, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Music Direction awards.
India too acquitted itself creditably, though not to the same extent as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It also got four awards; those of Best Actress, Best Screenplay and Best Short Film. One of the two Special Jury awards also went to India.
While the Pakistani entries were quite a few among the 26 films shown from May 22 to 26, they were crassly commercial with little or no artistic content.
The Bhutanese and Maldivian films, on the other hand, were outstanding, whether in content, acting or technical values.
These films came as a pleasant surprise given the fact that these countries have no presence yet in the world of cinema. The Bhutanese and Maldivian films on show dealt with burning social issues boldly and brought to light aspects of Maldivian or Bhutanese societies which the world around was not aware of.
But it was disheartening to find on the awards giving day, that none of the films from Bhutan and the Maldives had made the grade in the estimation of the jury. The three-member jury comprised: Ms. Han Sunhee of South Korea, who is Dean of the International Film Business Academy of the Busan Asian Film School; Amable Tikoy Aguiluz of the Philippines who is a leading light of the alternative film movement in his country; and Christophe Henri of France who is an international actor and filmmaker.
Sri Lanka
The Best Director award went toSri Lankan Director Prasanna Jayakody for his film 28 (Twenty-Eight). The jury described his work as poignant storytelling about marginalised characters. The director captivates the audience through very clever cinematic storytelling, continuously surfing on the cutting edge of irony and humour.
28 is the story of a village woman who had been raped and murdered and dumped in a mortuary. Her husband identifies the body, and to carry the body to his village, he tricks a van driver into transporting an empty coffin. En route, the coffin falls off the rooftop rack and the dead body gets exposed. Though shocked and angry, the driver agrees to resume the journey. At the village, the people vent their anger against the womans husband for her death. But she addresses the mourners bereft of fear (as she is dead), providing a powerful testimony on the plight of women.
Mahendra Perera of Sri Lanka got the Best Actor award for his work in 28, which was distinguished for the depth, realism and sincere heartfelt portrayal of his character who gradually releases his emotion and connection to the corpse.
Sasika Ruwan Marasinghe of Sri Lanka got the award for the Best Sound Design for his work in Bahuchithawadiya (The Undecided). It accurately reproduced the sounds of the environment and locations of present-day Sri Lanka, the citation said.

Malaka Devapriya got a Special Jury award for the way he directed Bahuchithawadiya (The Undecided). As per the citation, it was a daring movie that pushes the cultural boundaries of traditional Sri Lankan values, in a humorous and accurate way.
The film is about the distressing world of lower-middle class underpaid and frustrated youth. Sasitha works as an underpaid delivery boy in an internet-based gift agency. Through it he develops liaisons with bored and sex-starved wealthy women. But soon the horrors of the real world catch up with him and he begins to use Facebook and Skype to have liaison with girls of his own class working overseas.
Bangladesh
Like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh too grabbed key awards. Tauquir Ahmeds Halda about the troubled Halda River in Bangladesh, walked away with the Best Feature Film award. The citation said the film addresses serious environmental issues of real day-to-day Bangladesh life, emphasizing the struggle of the people through cinematic language. Its about sustainability of the life of the rural people.
The Best Cinematographer award went to Enamul Haque Sohel of Bangladesh for his work in Halda. The award was given for the light and shadow interplay of the lives and drama of the people in the river Halda. Amit Debnath was given the Best Editor prize for his work in Halda. He was praised for enabling the fluid and balanced flow of the story.
Halda got the award for the Best Original Music Score too. The citation praised the work of Tauquir Ahmed, Pinto Ghosh, and Sanzida Mahmood Nandita for its beautiful conversion of traditional Bangladesh music into contemporary flavour.
Halda is about the dwindling quantity of fish in the increasingly-polluted Halda River which had been a major breeding ground for fish in Bangladesh for centuries. Driven into abject poverty, fishermen and their women fall prey to the designs of rich men. Fisherwomen were forced into marriages with affluent old men who treated them as slaves and not as wives.
Director Tauquir Ahmed had made a gripping film based on his own script written to perfection through 17 drafts. He derives satisfaction from the fact that the Bangladeshi Government woke up to the issue of pollution, and today, Halda river is back to being a major breeding ground of fish.
India
The Indian child star Vaishnavi Tangde bagged the Best Actress prize for her portrayal of a rural working class girl hungry for a school education to get ahead in life. In the Marathi language film Kshitij (The Horizon), Vaishnavis portrayal of the village girl was honest, innocent and realistic, the jury said.
Prashant Pandey & Shreya Dev Verma got the Best Screenplay award for their work in the Indian film Poorna. The film is a triumph of the spirit story with a compelling and accurate narration of true events that project the hardships of climbing Mt. Everest.
Directed by Rahul Bose, Poorna is a true story based on the life of Poorna, the youngest girl to climb Mt. Everest. Though a poor village girl, she does amazingly well in a rock climbing competition, and is picked up for formal training in mountain climbing. She struggles to keep it up but ultimately succeeds in achieving every mountaineers dream: to climb the Everest and also be the youngest to do so.
Manouj Kadaamh of India got the Special Jury award for his film Kshitij (The Horizon). Commending his work the citation said that it was a sincere and relevant portrayal of the need for education of the youths in India, especially young girls.
The Indian short film GI directed by Kunjila Mascillamani was adjudged the Best Short Film and commended for using the cinematic language to tell a story about a girls sacrifice for her grandfather.

C.V. Vigneswarans  de-legitimization  of remembrance
	
A decision by a local bank to suspend two of its employees for commemorating the war dead of the final phase of the Eelam war has now caused a fresh wave of controversy. The disciplinary action was purportedly taken after Sinhala nationalist social media highlighted the incident. The Bank said in a media statement, HNB takes very seriously any sentiment or act that is in violation of, or poses a threat to the morale of citizens of Sri Lanka. As a Bank that stands for all Sri Lankans, our goals, interests and initiatives are all aligned to the vision and greater good ofour Country.

We regret an unauthorized incident that took place recently in one of our branches, which does not reflect the values of the Bank. The matter has been investigated and necessary action taken.
The management response has however drawn condemnation from Tamil society, and Tamil diaspora groups, who are unlikely to have accounts on the HNB anyway, have called for a boycott ofthe bank.

The third question however is political connotations behind these events
This incident raises several important questions which go beyond the usual contentions over the amount of control that an employer can have over its employees. In general, companies that try to control private lives of their employees are loathed, sued and discredited. Whereas, there is no consensus as to how much control the employers could wield over the professional conduct of their workers. The problem get complicated when the private conduct of the employees are intertwined, or viewed as such, with their professional lives. Commemorating the war dead in an impromptu event inside the Kilinochchi branch of the HNB during the working hours falls well within the employers purview. However, businesses do celebrate many events, ranging from religious and national festivities to the Indian Ocean tsunami. On the other hand, if the HNB employees in Hambantota choose to commemorate those who perished in the JVP uprising in 1989, one would wonder whether the bank would act with the same diligence. This lead to the second question of what is permissible  and what is not. That is a tricky question, more so in the context of ethnic polarization and political fragmentation in the country. Suspended employees have defended their action, claiming that they had commemorated the dead civilians, and not the LTTE. Sinhala nationalist right in the South thinks otherwise, and the bank has cowed into their pressure. Leave aside the discredited claims of zero civilian casualties , a claim which effectively handed over a propaganda victory to the Eelam Tamil fringe, there is no gainsaying that a considerable number of civilians perished during the war.
The governments repeated failure to give an accurate death count, which is not so much to provide, unless of course, there is a concerted effort by either side to distort the numbers , has now given rise to various concocted figures. If those suspended employees in Kilinochchi, have family members perished in the conflict, the bank decision obviously raise serious moral questions. That is the same moral question that Sri Lanka as a country is faced with in responding to the remembrance day on May 18.

This lead to the second question of what is permissible  and what is not. That is a tricky question, more so in the context of ethnic polarization and political fragmentation in the country. Suspended employees have defended their action

The third question however is political connotations behind these events. They are no longer a matter of remembering the dead, but, are becoming purveyors of militant Tamil nationalism, the same kind that drove Tamils to Mullivaikkal in the past. The vast majority of victims of the war may desire to keep away from these increasingly polarizing political polemics. However, their politicians, and a microscopic minority of hard core have other calculations. The incendiary speech by Northern Chief Minister C.V.Vigneswaran, in which he announced an annual Tamil genocide day on May 18 and called for international intervention is a case in point. Tamil political leadership has historically resorted to loaded language and trumped up grievances.And they were essentially anti-Sri Lankan. From the very beginning of the independence, they set the tone for confrontation: In 1950, much before the much lamented Sinhala Only Act, the Federal Party disowned the Sri Lankan Flag. All that incremental escalation finally metamorphosed into a nihilistic terrorism, which in a twist of fate for its early advocates, pounced on them, before eating two generations of Tamil children. 
Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran who has fallen out with the TNA leadership is probably plotting to use another generation of Tamils as pawns. He has exploited new relative freedoms to advance his personal political ends.

All that incremental escalation finally metamorphosed into a nihilistic terrorism, which in a twist of fate for its early advocates, pounced on them, before eating two generations of Tamil children
He follows a well-trodden self- destructive path of gradual escalation. He has vindicated the fears of Sinhalese nationalists as to where a compromise would finally lead.
Tamils as a whole would not take stocks of his folly, as it had happened with different brands of charlatans and megalomaniacs in the past, until it is too late to push the reset button.Tamils remembrance of their own dead could well be the first casualty of his polarizing approach. But, that may not be the only one, if things are allowed to degenerate.

Govt. must take a cue from PM Mahathir: Duminda
	
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Minister, Duminda Dissanayake said today that by now legal action should have been taken against those of the previous government alleged to have committed acts of fraud and corruption had the government acted in a manner similar to Malaysian Prime MinisterMahathir Mohamad.
The Malaysian people requested newly-elected Premier Mohamad to punish corrupt politicians of the previous regime. After assuming office, he took immediate action as demanded by the people to arrest all those, including politicians, Government Officials and Police Officers known to have committed fraud and corruption, he told journalists in Anuradhapura.
The minister said however investigators in Sri Lanka are reluctant to investigate the charges levelled against politicians and multi-millionaires.
They are very prompt in implementing the law when it comes to ordinary citizens who are alleged to have committed minor offences. Some influential individuals even seek court orders to evade arrest when cases are to be filed against them. The law must be applied equally to all citizens, he said. (Athula Bandara)

48-hour rail strike from today
	
The Railway Technical Services Trade Union Committee (RTSTUC) yesterday said that they would launch a 48-hour token strike from 4 p.m today (29) claiming that the authorities had failed to fulfil their demands.
RTSTUC President P. Sampath Rajitha told the Daily Mirror they held discussions with several officials in the Transport Ministry including Transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abesinghe in Battaramulla last evening.
The Railway Department had taken steps to increase the salaries of several employees by 12 per cent based on favouritism. Therefore, we demand the authorities to grant a pay hike of 12 per cent for all 12,000 railway employees. Incentives have not been provided to employees since 2004 and we demand an incentive payment be given as well,he said.
Following the discussion, the Deputy minister had reportedly told the RTSTUC to wait until the issue was discussed with the Sarath Amaunugama Committee.
During the token strike, Railway gate operators, Tail track inspectors, railway operator technicians and compartment connectors will refrain from their duties from today. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

I declined PTL money: Ranjan
	
Perceptual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius offered me money in 2015 but I refused to accept it, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.
Mr. Ramanayake told a media briefing that he was among many MPs who were offered money by the Perpetual Treasuries Chief.
I was offered money by Aloysius but I refused to accept saying I dont want to associate with them, he sai
"JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and I were the only two MPs who had refused to accept money from Aloysius, he added. The Deputy Minister was a member of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in Parliament which carried out a probe on it.
Mr. Ramanayake said prominent members of clergy belonging to all four main religions, journalists, artistes, MPs, provincial and local politicians were among the 118 persons who had obtained money from Perceptual Treasuries Chief. He said he learnt this from reliable sources.
Those who dont criticize former Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who had been charged with obtaining money from Perceptual Treasuries Chief are the ones who have also taken money from Aloysius. Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake was asked to comment on Dayasiri Jaysekera but he had refused to do so. Only Bandulalal Bandarigoda and few others have criticized Mr Jayasekera and I ask the MPs in my own party to criticize Mr. Jayasekera and prove their innocence, he said. He said the criticism made by SLPP Chairman Prof. G L Peiris was commendable.
He also said Mr. Jayasekera should return the one million rupees to Aloysius.
Further he said Aloysius and Palisena are revealing details of the people to whom they gave money from prison.
Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena assured me that he would soon reveal those who got into deals with the corrupt right from January 8, 2018, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.
Mr. Ramanayake the President made this assurance when speaking to him over the telephone last morning. President called me after seeing the statement I made last week that those who pledged to arrest the corrupt within 24 hours of coming to power but gave helicopters for them to get away. He told me that he was not involved in those matters. I told him to make a public statement and disclose everything to the people. Therefore he agreed to make a public statement and disclose everything, Mr. Ramanayake said.
The Deputy Minister said the President also instructed him to send application to his office asking for the names of 118 persons who had obtained cheques from Perceptual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius under Right to information Bill (RTI) and he had already sent an application.

India orders closure of Vedanta plant after deadly protests
	

AFP, 28th MAY, 2018- Indian authorities on Monday ordered the permanent closure of a controversial copper plant, which was at the centre of deadly protests last week with 13 people killed by police fire.
The violence erupted when thousands marched in southern Tamil Nadu state last week, demanding the closure of the factory owned by British-based mining giant Vedanta Resources over fears that it was polluting the environment.
In an order Monday, the state government said it supported concerns raised by its pollution regulator about the Sterlite Copper factory located outside Tuticorin city, and ordered it be shut permanently.
In the larger public interest, the government endorse the closure direction of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and also direct the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to seal the unit and plant permanently, the order said.
The pollution board last week ordered that electricity to the factory -- the second-largest copper smelter in India -- be switched off.

Italian President  faces impeachment calls
	

Italys president is expected to ask a former International Monetary Fund official on Monday to head a stopgap government amidst political and constitutional turmoil, with early elections looking inevitable. 
The far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which had spent days drawing up a coalition pact aimed at ending a stalemate following an inconclusive March vote, responded with fury to Mattarella, accusing him of abusing his office. 
5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio called on parliament to impeach the mild-mannered Mattarella, while League chief Matteo Salvini threatened mass protests unless snap elections were called. If theres not the OK of Berlin, Paris or Brussels, a government cannot be formed in Italy. Its madness, and I ask the Italian people to stay close to us because I want to bring democracy back to this country, Salvini told reporters. 
President Sergio Mattarella has called in Carlo Cottarelli after two anti-establishment parties angrily abandoned their plans to form a coalition in the face of a veto from the head of state over their choice of economy minister. 
In a televised address, Mattarella said he had rejected the candidate, 81-year-old eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona, because he had threatened to pull Italy from the single currency. 
The uncertainty over our position has alarmed investors and savers both in Italy and abroad, he said, adding: Membership of the euro is a fundamental choice. 
After Mattarellas move, the euro gained ground, adding 0.6 percent against the Japanese yen and ticking up against other major trading partners as well.

Residents in several villages north of the upcountry main city have become victims of sound pollution and lung disease because of a metal quarry now being operated in the area by a close buddy of a very powerful political authority, they say.
No action has been taken so far, either to close the metal quarry or provide necessary safety measures in the interest of residents of about seven to eight villages located around this metal quarry either by the authorities sporting Dharmachakra insignia or those committed to the vision of a clean and green environment through service excellence despite numerous complaints made to them so far, they say.

He said they had also failed to arrest the thieves, much to the disappointment of the people and pointed out that by delaying to investigate the cases of fraud and corruption of the previous government, the thieves had been transformed into heroes and heroes into thieves.
"People voted for this government to expose the thieves and to take the country forward, but those who robbed the government are still at large. The government had completed three and a half years of its term but not a single thief has been arrested. If 118 politicians were paid by Arjun Aloysius, then all of them have to be sacked," the minister said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

PTLs Rs.1 mn soils Dayasiris hands
	
Former sports minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has run into a storm of controversy after it was revealed in court last week that he accepted a cash cheque of Rs.1 million from a company linked to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. (PTL), which is implicated in the Central Bank bond scam. 
He admitted that he had received the money and that it was meant to be used for his campaign at the 2015 general election. Dayasiri, who was one of the 16 parliamentarians to quit the government recently after voting in favour of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, says the disclosure is nothing but a witch-hunt by the government. 
The former minister argued that though he had received the money prior to the elections, he had in no way acted to defend the interests of the company. 
During our election campaigns, various people extended support. I admit, that this company also gave me some money for my campaign, but I never represented their interest at any time. It is a known fact that some businessmen extend support not only to parliamentarians but also to some pradeshiya sabha members during election campaigns, Dayasiri had told a newspaper. 
His arguments seem cosmetically sound and can vindicate them by pointing out that he had even voted in favour of the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister in the bond scandal. But the only hitch is that he had received the money from Walt and Row Associates affiliated to primary treasury bond dealer PTL after the bond scam was revealed. Didnt he know at the time of the donation that PTL had been accused of one of the largest scandals in the countrys history Yet, the timing of the disclosure with regard to his dealings with the PTL subsidiary gives some credence to his claim that it was a witch-hunt. 

Why Are the businessmen so generous to toss off millions without expecting any returns
Dayasiri is the second politician whom those investigating the bond scandal had identified as having obtained cash from PTL. The other one was former minister Ravi Karunanayake who was compelled to resign from his portfolio following the revelation of his financial dealings with PTL owner Arjun Aloysius. 
While we leave him to defend himself, it is pertinent to note a point he had made on election funding he had stated in his defence. It is a known fact that some businessmen extend support not only to parliamentarians but also to pradeshiya sabha members during election campaigns, he said. When former minister S.B. Dissanayake was accused of building a mansion in Hanguranketha by spending more than Rs.40 million, in the wake of his defection from the Chandrika Bandaranaike government in 2001, he too said it was his businessmen friends who had helped him to build the house. Once a politician from the Matara District had accused one of his rivals of having spent more than Rs.10 million for an election campaign. They all are said to be supported by businessmen. 
Why Are the businessmen so generous to toss off millions without expecting any returns What might have been the rationale behind the donation of a million rupees by a company located in Colombo to a politician contesting from the Kurunegala District On the other hand, do not these politicians who obtain financial support from businessmen during election have a sense of obligation towards the latter The funding by businessmen during elections is not an isolated phenomenon where only a certain politician has been supported by a certain businessman. As Jayasekara states it is a widely prevalent practice. 
So, the apparent bottom-line is that businessmen support politicians to come to power and the latter runs the affairs of the administration, at the local level or national level, according to the whims and fancies of the former, while gaining more and more economic benefits from him. The communist theory on the capitalist State is thus proved. 
This clearly shows that the entire system is fraught with fraud and corruption and in urgent need for a mechanism to monitor election funding. It may not eradicate corruption completely, but is likely to be curtailed to some extent. 
For the past several years, the election monitors have been stressing the need for such a mechanism, but ludicrously it has to be expected from the same politicians, majority of whom seem to be hand in glove with corrupt officials and businessmen.

Railways Union launches 48-hour token strike
	
The members of the Railway Technical Services Trade Union Committee (RTSTUC) launched their 48-hour token strike from 4.00 p.m. today.
RTSTUC President P. Sampath Rajitha told Daily Mirror that they had stopped work over several demands including the demand for a 12 per cent salary increase to all 12,000 railway employees. He said it had been earlier granted only to some employees based on favouritism.
We demand the payment of incentives withheld to employees since 2004, Mr. Rajitha said.
He said all railway gate-operators, rail-track inspectors, railway operator technicians, compartment connectors and support staff of the train service will refrain from carrying out their duties during the token strike.
Deputy Transport Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe said he had instructed the Railways General Manager to cancel leave of all railway employees and that stern action would be taken against the striking employees.
Railway drivers, guards and station masters will be on duty and should be provided safety. I requested IGP Pujith Jayasundara to assign police personnel to prevent any sabotage by the strikers, the deputy minister said.
However, the Railways General Manager S.M. Abeywickrama said the minister had not instructed him to cancel the leave of employees.
We cannot cancel the leave of employees, but we will take action against those who do not report to work without informing the relevant department. Action will be taken according to regulations of the relevant department, he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rajitha said they would go ahead with the token strike irrespective of the action taken by the authorities.
No one can stop our strike action without granting our demands. If anything happens to any of our employees, this strike action will continue indefinitely until all requirements are met, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Sketches from the South: Wewurukannala
	

Human beings love being reminded of what awaits them after they die. Heaven or hell, earth or purgatory, they want to know. And by knowing, they either work to make their afterlife a reality or do their best to change that afterlife.
We all want to ascend to paradise, after all, and even if we dont, we want to be born in this paradise of ours we call Earth. This is true of the Sinhalese and the Buddhists, especially those who plan out every deed they do in the name of what they will encounter once they leave home. And to a considerable extent, the hopes, fears, sorrows, and joys which this sense of karmic expectation compels from us is reflected in the way we depict our faith on temple walls: intense serenity on the one hand, for those who do good and merit, and intense suffering on the other, for those who do bad and evil. Visit a typical temple and chances are youll come across more of the former: in places of worship as with businesses, crowds come in to know how they will be benefited. They want to be reminded of the path to heaven. The path to hell, for all they care, exists elsewhere. 
For atheists, agnostics, and rationalists, heaven and hell are metaphors denoting extremities on earth: starvation in Africa versus opulence in America. According to the Buddhists texts, this is false. Even the rationalists who say theyve found in Buddhism the ultimate religion to square with their scientific outlook overlook the fact that no less a figure than the Buddha himself contended that such realms do exist and they are not a state of mind. (To call them that would be to invite censure the way Rahul Gandhi did when he called poverty a state of mind.) While I am certainly not equipped to write at length about Buddhist hells and heavens (which are different from their Christian counterparts on the basis that no matter how divine the reward or horrible the punishment is, people always return to this realm, and are not sent to those realms for eternity), I would recommend a careful reading of the Devadutta Sutta from the Majjhima Nikaya for the lay reader who wishes to know more about this subject. That, and a visit to those temples which lay down the torments of the underworld. 
Buddhism has no art to speak for itself; much of the art which cropped up, years and centuries after the passing away of its founder, was secular, conforming to standards created in the human mind. And more so than their Christian counterparts, who depicted fanged demons as guardians of hell, Buddhist temple painters seem to have found out eventually that either of two ways served to frighten or embolden the people into doing good. (Back in the early days, when worship was as integral to daily life as going to a job is to us today, most of those people took the precepts of Buddhism seriously, to their hearts, and made them a pivotal part of their lives.) The first way was by externalising the various torments of hell. Here, the paintings depicting those torments were etched out side-by-side with paintings of onlookers and visitors from heaven. The Beauvais Cathedral resorted to this method, with devils subjecting sinners to pain through boiling vats and prongs to the discomfort of those heaven-sent onlookers. The message was clear, even to the most illiterate and juvenile. 

For atheists, agnostics, and rationalists, heaven and hell are metaphors denoting extremities on earth: starvation in Africa versus opulence in America
The second method was easier, though rarely resorted to: turn those hellish torments into veritable exhibits. Here the disturbed onlookers werent messengers from heaven, but the viewers themselves, us. The thin line between us and the punishments of hell was the imagination of the artist involved in drawing up the latter, which is why these paintings tended to be labelled, meticulously, with stanzas and allusions to religious texts, particularly (when it comes to the Sri Lankan temple) the Buddhist canon: so that we would know that these werent just figments of that imagination, that they were a reality. As I pointed out above, however, Sri Lankans, especially Sinhalese Buddhists, prefer to know the consequences of doing good on earth: they want to be emboldened into accumulating kusal (good karma), and that by discerning the various pleasures and comforts of life in the higher realms. Over the years, though, because of rising crime rates and vagrancy and other indicators of social evil, artists may have had to rethink on this issue, and consider depicting the consequences of bad deeds. 
This latter phenomenon has neatly, I should think, tied up with rising tourist arrivals and the tendency of Westerners to exoticise the faith of the majority, Buddhism, in terms of paintings, drumbeats, and fragrances, once theyre here. Sri Lankans are howling at the fact that certain hotels are restricting them from entering their premises and instead favouring tourists, the outsiders, but the truth is that there is another side to this: because of the Westerners fascination with those paintings, drumbeats, and fragrances, the guardians and gatekeepers of certain other tourist spots, including temples and other holy sites, take in more money from them than from natives like you and me. On both counts its discrimination, and on both counts, the owners of the tourist sites want to cash in on the tourist, with respect to profits for accommodation (hotels and restaurants) and with respect to places of worship and the need to sustain them financially (temples). Depicting hell, as opposed to heaven, while obviously necessary with rising crime rates here, also spells out good business with the tourists who will be asked, politely and kindly, to contribute to the temple coffers once theyve looked around. As far as Buddhism goes, hell is the nearest destination to their Westernised minds that theyd want to see as a tourist pastime, especially since while the concept of heaven in Buddhism is different from that in Christianity, the punishments meted out to sinners in hell are virtually the same in both faiths. Theyll pay to see how theyll be flogged, stabbed, burnt, boiled, and brutally mutilated. 
At Wewurukannala Viharaya, which is situated in Dickwella, near Matara, youll come across a tunnel to hell which compounds all these points, facts, and trends. Its at once a reminder for the Buddhists, even non-Buddhists (and non-Sri Lankans: I came across Indians who visit for purposes of worship); a tourist hotspot for the Westerner; a cultural site for the historian; and a paradise for the ardent photographer. Since I was a little of all these things, I found Wewurukannala, and not just the tunnel, more than just fascinating.
Composed of three parts  a budu medura in the front; the tunnel to hell in the middle; and a large seated Buddha statue, measuring at 160 feet, the largest in Sri Lanka, and resting against a building filled with paintings from the life of the Gauthama Buddha along with a museum containing various cultural exhibits, further away  Wewurukannala dates back to the 18th century, to the reign of Rajadi Rajasinghe.

At Wewurukannala Viharaya, which is situated in Dickwella, near Matara, youll come across a tunnel to hell which compounds all these points, facts, and trends
While most people will remember the second and third of these sections, particularly the third (which, I rather thought, was more fascinating and colourful than the hellish exhibits), the budu medura at the front wasnt all that bad either; in fact thats where tourists are compelled or encouraged (depending on the time theyre in) to donate. Among those who had donated to the medura, and its paintings, I was pleasantly surprised to come across a patron from Kolamunne, in my hometown, Madapatha.
Advertising is alien to Buddhists, since its probably the most lawkika (materialistic) of all forms of secular communication today, but just outside the tunnel there was an inscription which revealed to me just how well the Buddhist has been able to advertise and market his faith to the lay outsider. The inscription, or quatrain, read as follows: 
wmd l kakg Tn leu;s ke; 
tmd m lrkakg ;=ka fodka le; 
Wmd hla fukak bka je,flkak we; 
md olajkak nrmekg foka we; 
 

Heres a rough translation: 
Desire, you do not, to suffer the torments of hell
Commit not, then, the sins that will lead you to hell
There exists a way out from the path to those torments
And that by extending your hand to help sustain us
Its a neat roundelay, almost a rallying cry for Buddhists: keep away from hell and the sinful paths that lead to it; do your best to commit good in this life; and its a good deed to donate towards the temple and the tunnel in particular. In other words, its a good deed to help us market the consequences of bad deeds to the world! I dont really want to consider this an advertisement, since that would be a rather crude way of rationalising what this particular quatrain (siv padaya) represents, but thats the closest to a contemporary method of communication I can think of when describing these lines. (The quatrain might have been a recent addition; if it wasnt, it proves that advertising or rather marketing was not alien to the Sinhalese Buddhist culture.) 
Located 1.5 km down the Dickwella-Beliatta Road, 22 km away from Matara town, Wewurukannala presents to us a paradox: do we celebrate the tunnel as a masterpiece in design, cut it off from its cultural roots, and consider it as a veritable display, or do we take its message for what it is I certainly couldnt figure it out, partly because Sinhalese culture (secular, particularly when it comes to the arts and crafts) and Buddhism have intermingled in ways which are rather paradoxical. But considering it as a paradox is enlightening in a way: it gets us to think of the other paradoxes that exist in this world of ours, and how we can escape them, firstly by doing good, secondly by avoiding evil. In that sense, Wewurukannala was a treat.

The present moment is wonderful  !
	

Twenty Six Centuries ago, an incomparable teacher of divine beings and humans, the Gautama Buddha was asked the following question: Those who dwell in the forest, peaceful,
Leading the holy life, eating, but a single meal a day;
Why is their complexion so serene
The Blessed One, the Tathagata gave a very crystal clear and profound answer as mentioned below: 
They do not sorrow over the past, Nor do they hanker for the future.
They maintain themselves with what is present.
Hence their complexion is so serene.
Through hankering for the future, Through sorrowing over the past, Fools dry up and wither away, Like a green reed cut down.
The nature of the human mind is to constantly wander and persistently roam. Science of this unfathomable occurrence and incomprehensible phenomenon is indescribable and indefinable in words. 
Once the Buddha said thus: 
 Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing that changes so quickly as the mind. It is not easy to give a simile for how quickly the mind changes
In the teaching of the Buddha, MINDFULNESS is the paramount and eminent technique which tremendously helps people to train and tame their wandering mind. 
Lack of mindfulness and lack of practice has drastically directed and horrendously led multitudes of individuals into the quagmire of unresolvable conflicts and psychological traumas. 

Lack of mindfulness and lack of practice has drastically directed and horrendously led multitudes of individuals into the quagmire of unresolvable conflicts and psychological traumas

Some of them have created distresses and miseries by themselves. Some findings and records have revealed that some innocent and powerless people have been traumatized by cruel and atrocious people. What we daily encounter and experience is utterly shocking and unimaginable.

Mindfulness perfectly helps us to look within and scrutinize the true disposition and the temperament of the mind. Untrained and untamed minds, those who are not well cultured and well mannered, those who are intoxicated with egocentric tendencies very easily and promptly provoke to commit any cruel activity or traumatize any being. 
This is the veracious and true nature of the untrained and untamed mind. 
Once the Blessed One said: 
Bhikkhus, the mind is luminous, but it is defiled by adventitious and extrinsic defilements.
The great Master, the Buddha has vividly emphasized and effulgently highlighted thus: 
 Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing that , when untamed, unguarded, unprotected, and unrestrained, leads to such great harm as the mind.

Mindfulness creates clearer, more focused thinking and improves efficiency at work and home. Mindfulness improves confidence and emotional resilience

Not only negative facets, but also positive aspects have been disclosed by the Master thus: 
Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing that, when tamed, guarded, protected, and retrained, leads to such great good as the mind.
Many scholars, professionals, experts and practitioners confidently recommend the practice of mindfulness for numerous common ailments such as insomnia, difficulty of falling asleep, chronic fatigue, frequent infection, anxiety, and depression and so on in the western countries at present. 

Not putting it into practice
Unfortunately those who were born to this religion and those who are boasting about this teaching never put it into practice in their daily lives. I have personally encountered and counselled many individuals who have experienced indescribable emotional agonies and psychological traumas which have been caused by wicked and cruel perpetrators. 
I have learned that most of them are not capable of managing and controlling their anger, lack of tolerance and mindfulness, incapability to cope with their own temperament and petulance have blindly led them to become wild and cruel. Psychologically they are the first victims of their own defilements and impurities. 
This is why Gautama Buddha has advised his disciples to be mindful and careful of their own thoughts. Mindfulness is the well trained security guard who diligently and attentively monitors ones thoughts. This is not a physical exercise. No need to sit and be still all the time, but one should be mindful of ones act, speech and thought at the present moment. 
Many people are very devoted and enthusiastic about their daily physical exercise and even for this purpose, mindfulness can be applied to achieve targets. 
Though many individuals dedicate their time and energy to train themselves to be physically healthy, unfortunately most of them have overlooked their psychological well-being and mental health. Some people may think that patients, who are in psychiatric hospitals, are mentally sick, but the reality is contrary to what most people think. Those who arent capable of controlling their anger, jealousy, craving and hatred are more dangerous than patients who are in psychiatric hospitals. Those who are intoxicated with wealth, political power, academic achievements, money, social status, physical health, inferiority complex and ego are the worst and unreliable psychopaths. 
Few professionals who serve in the domain of psychology and intellectuals who practice in the realm of psychiatry enlightened me that sometimes it is hard to identify and diagnose some psychopathic characters in psychopaths because they never disclose their true character in public. One of the scholars revealed to me that a classic example is domestic violence. He said that most offenders and perpetrators act and speak like saints, but realities are hidden. 
Most people are stressed and depressed due to lack of mindfulness. When one is mindful the individual always dwells in the present moment and never concentrates on the past; which specially brings sorrow. When one is mindful, one does not waste time dreaming of the future which brings confusion, irritation and burden.

Being compassionate
Mindfulness is about observation without criticism and makes the individual compassionate. 
Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what were doing and not overly being reactive nor overwhelmed by whats happening around us. 
Mindfulness reminds us to concentrate on what we are doing at the present moment. Mindfulness guides us to be the present.
If we leave it to its own devices our mind habitually wanders from the present moment. It constantly engages in the replaying the past and the projecting of the future. In other words, were very rarely fully present in the moment. 
Mindful attention, however, is completely engaged in the present moment the here and now. We let go of the tension caused by wanting things to be different, the tension of constantly wanting more, and instead we accept the present moment as it is. 

Mindfulness reminds us to concentrate on what we are doing at the present moment. Mindfulness guides us to be the present

Its now being taught in schools, in workplaces, in hospitals and in homes around the world. As people discover themselves the incredible benefits of living mindfully, the interest continues to grow. 


There is now a huge body of research on the benefits of mindfulness. 
Mindfulness reduces stress, anxiety and other destructive emotions. (Mindfulness actually shrinks the brains fight or flight centre and the amygdala. This primal region of the brain, associated with fear and emotion, is involved in the initiation of the bodys response to stress.This is the part of the brain responsible for so many destructive emotions like fear, unhappiness and anger.)
Mindfulness reduces depression (clinical trials are showing that mindfulness is as effective as medication and has no side effects!). 
Mindfulness reduces insomnia, increases your sense of well-being , reduces lethargy and increases energy both mentally and physically. 
Mindfulness is also very effective for pain management. 
Mindfulness sharpens your memory and increases your focus and attention. 
Mindfulness improves your emotional and social intelligence and develops your empathy and compassion. It is also shown to improve relationships. 
Mindfulness improves health and boosts immunity. In fact, mindfulness is shown to have beneficial effects on many serious illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. 
Mindfulness creates clearer, more focused thinking and improves efficiency at work and home. 
Mindfulness improves confidence and emotional resilience. 
Mindfulness reduces compulsive and addictive tendencies and also works better than any diet for effective long-term weight loss. 
These are the certain outcomes and positive and benefits, if one honestly practises mindfulness. 


May All Beings Be Well and Happy !

Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Birth of   Buddhist Revival Movement  145 years ago
	


The world famous debate; the Panaduraa Waadaya held on August 26 and28, 1873
	Dutch rulers discouraged the practice of other religions including Catholic faith by introducing severalDraconian laws
	In 1711, the Dutch framed laws, banning the practice of Hinduism and Buddhism, naming them ascannibal-faiths

Miguel Silva who later became silver-tongued scholar monk Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, was born on February 9, 1823 at Balapitiya.He studied Christianity, Latin and English at Wesley College, Colombo before serving in the Editorial Board of Ceylon Observer as a layman. The redoubtable controversialist, passed away at Kotahena Deepaduttarama, in the morning of September 21, 1890, at the age of 67. 
When the Dutch invaded Ceylon in 1650s, their Missionaries targeted Catholics more than Buddhists. They publicly declared that Buddhist, Hindus, Muslims and Catholics were not fit to hold state office; and in 1711, they framed laws, banning the practice of Hinduism and Buddhism, naming them as cannibal-faiths.
A comprehensive account of all eight speeches delivered at the world famous debate, the Panaduraa Waadaya held on August 26 and 28, 1873 , was published two years later under Buddhism and Christianity Face-to-Face by Dr. James Martin Peebles, Ph D. in America. 
Several scholarly Christian Missionary priests and Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera assisted by a team of Buddhist scholar monks took part in the debate. The Christian team included Wesleyan priests [Methodist], who were well versed in Buddhist chronicles; of them, William Harvard authored books in Sinhala; B. Clouch, the editor of Sinhala-Pali Dictionary; D.J. Gogerly, a Buddhist scholar and Spence Hardy, a writer in Sinhala literature and Buddhism. 
Work of Missionaries
Dutch rulers discouraged the practice of other religions including Catholic faith by introducing several Draconian laws: special privileges were accorded to Protestants. Catholic marriages registration was brought under Protestant priests and the fee was enhanced by a huge margin. This forced Catholic priests, Gonsalvass, John de Vass, to seek refuge in the Kandyan Kingdom. 
thousands of Sinhalese after learning English had become Christians in order to gain their livelihood. A Sinhalese villager could be trained to attack Buddhism within a year, and in those days a salary of Rs. 20 a month was enough to make him offer his services as a Catechist to preach in the villages against other religions -Anagarika Dharmapala
Col. Henry Olcott and Dr. Peebles 
J M Peebles 1822-1922 the President of Psycho-Therapeutic Society of London and a member of similar bodies dedicated to the pursuit of esoteric and arcane subjects. A large audience estimated at five to seven thousand thrilled to the cut and thrust and party of the disputant, and in a period given to developing confrontations between Christianity and resurgent Buddhism, this particular debate excited much interest and produced the greatest impact. Dr. Peebles on his third visit to the island in 1897 teamed up with Col. Henry Olcott, [1880-1906] whom he had known for almost twenty five years in promoting Buddhist revivalist movement in Ceylon  H. A. I. Goonetilleke-- Images of Sri Lanka through American Eyes: - [1983: pp-236].
The debate 
Ceylon Times special reporter on the first days proceedings, 
long before the hour, thousands of natives were seen wending their way, attired in their gayest holiday suites, in to the large enclosure in which stood the ample bungalow where the adversaries were to meet. By seven the green was one sea of heads. Each district has sent its quota of villagers, and Colombo was represented by a few intellectual looking, silk garbed young Sinhalese, determined to give up all for the great champion of Buddhism .The Protestant party, too was very strong. From Monday, catechists and clergymen of every denomination, Baptists, Wesleyan and Church Missionary, flocked from all parts of the island into the large house prepared for them the temporary building at the scene of this polemical strife, was a neat cadjan-roofed structure with a raised platform, and parted in the middle; one portion was occupied by the Rev. David de Silva and his party, and the other by the Migettuwatte Thera along with several learned Nayake Bikkhus. 
On one side of the hall were Reverends David, S. Coles, Catechist F. S. Sirimanne, C. Jayasinghe, P. Rodrigo, R. Tebb, S. Lagden, Joe Fernando, Juan de Silva, J. H. Abhayasekera, Nathanielsz, G. J. Gunasekera, Dr. Staples, and Proctors Jayasinghe, Daniel and Alwis, Mudaliyar de Soysa, and Hunupola Nilame. 
On the other side of the stage were Ven. Mohottiwatte Gunananda Thera, Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala, Waskaduwe Sri Subhuti Thera , Ven. Potuvila Indrajoti, Ven. Koggala Sanghatissa, Ven. Talhene Amaramuli, and Ven. Mulleriyawe Guneratana. 
Rev. David de Silva, a Sinhala Pastor of the Wesleyan Mission at Panadura opened the debate for Christians. He argued on soul according to Buddhist and Christian teachings the Pali/Sanskrit scholar, rose to speak as clock struck 8 on August 26, 1873. Speaking fluently in Sinhala, he quoted from Buddhist scripts. He said, the doctrine of Dhamma is centered on Soul according to Buddhism; Satta, sentient beings are constituted in the five Khandhas, namely, rupakkhanda the organized body, vedanakhanda the Sensations, sannakhanda the perceptions, sankharakhanda the reasoning powers, and vinnanakhanda consciousness. In proof of his claim, he quoted from Samyukktha Nikaya a section from Sutra pitake. Panchimebikkhave khande dessisami panchaupadhanakhanda etamsunata. Katame ca bikkhave panchakkhanda yam kimchi bikkhave ruupam. 
The Ceylon Times CT, [later Times of Ceylon], and Ceylon Observer sent special reporters to cover the event; debate received wide coverage in the local Press; they were obligatory to observe rules laid down on fair reporting. However, it appears that the Observer was biased towards Christians. On Sep 5, 1873 issue of CT, the writer came across a Letter to the Editor, by one Dr. George Elliot, a reader challenging Observer Correspondent for an utterly unfounded comments reported as, 
Migettuwatte had to give into his superior in Pali,Rev. Fr. David Silva, on three very material pointsthe priest lingered and still lingers along with his confreres, to attempt to answer 

When the Dutch invaded Ceylon in 1650s, their Missionaries targeted Catholics more than Buddhists. They publicly declared that Buddhist, Hindus, Muslims and Catholics were not fit to hold state office
The debate revolved around the concepts ranged from God, Karma, Nirvana, Soul, Rebirth, and the doctrine of Dependent Origination. Rev. de Silva argued on the concept of no soul or irreducible self or Aatma in Buddhism, quoting Tripitaka
Rupam bhikkhave anattam, yadanattam netam mama neso hamismin esoattati., [Organized form, monks is not self, that which is not self is not mind, I am not that, that is not to me a soul]. He argued that this means that there is no fundamental difference between human and the rest of the animals. He argued that there would be no rewards or punishments following death for what one has done in this life. If there is no soul or athma, one would have nothing to fear if one commits sin. He quoted the Bible to affirm that we do have souls.
Migettuwatte Thera replying took a swipe at Rev. Davids authority in the Pali language, proposing that someone who makes vital errors in it cannot be likely to comprehend of metaphysics explained in it. The prelate continued to make clear how rebirth works according to Buddhism in the absence of a soul: that there is some kind of continuity, that goes beyond the demise of the physical body.
He charged that some translators of the Bible have committed various tricks like interpreting jealous into Sinhalese jwalita, which in fact means glittering or shinning. Also of leaving out stanzas like Leviticus 17:7, saying, they should not make offerings to various divine beings that they have prostituted themselves to. He concluded by appreciating Catholics who have not rewritten their Bibles in the style of some Protestants.
Many others believe so, but a broad study of the eight speeches made by the scholars create a doubt who won and who lost; The Dhamma, as professed by the Buddha is not an ideology, a doctrine, or a philosophy; it is the truth and reality, no mundane effort by an erudite scholar, as long as he stands on the pratajjana pedestal, cannot prove or disprove it. Like in Cricketing parlour what is important here is not who won and who lost, but to judge how the debate was conducted; and the impact of it on vicious elements and the final outcome. 
In 1991, President R. Premadasa writing a foreword to Prof. Wimal Abeyasunderas book on Panadura Debate says: The most valuable lesson we could learn from the debate is the peaceful way of settling disputes.

Water rages through flooded Maryland streets
	

By Justin Jouvenal, Michael E. Miller, Allison Klein  (c) 2018, The Washington PostMay 28, 2018 - A flash flood raged through historic Ellicott City, Maryland, on Sunday evening, sending residents and tourists scrambling for higher ground and sparking a massive response by rescuers.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, R, announced he had declared a state of emergency in Howard County and huddled with emergency officials to assess the extent of the damage, which was not fully known. No injuries were immediately reported.
The National Weather Service called the flooding an extremely dangerous and potentially catastrophic situation as the rains pounded the city Sunday evening. Amid the flooding, the Howard fire department warned people trapped on the citys Main Street to climb to the second floors of buildings as they awaited rescue and said the damage could rival devastating flood that occurred there in 2016.
Officials said there were reports of collapsed buildings. Hundreds of rescuers had converged from as far away as Northern Virginia, officials said, and Howard opened an emergency operations center to manage its response.
Videos taken on Ellicott Citys Main Street show roiling brown water flowing down, carrying debris and trash. The water spilled into doors and windows and twisted traffic lights. Some people on Twitter reported seeing cars floating down streets.
Jeff Halverson, professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland Baltimore, said the storm could drop 10 or so inches of rain total before it wound down. He said he thought the flooding could ultimately be worse than what was seen in Ellicott City in 2016.
