World accepts our commitment to democracy - PM

The resolution on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, co-sponsored by the government and member States, is an ample testimony that the world had accepted our commitment to democracy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the 50th Anniversary celebrations of CIMA Sri Lanka at Colombo recently.
"We no longer need to face the pressures that we had been facing for the past five to six years as the world had accepted that we are building a democratic society," the Prime Minister said.
He said the government had agreed to a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, under the country's own judicial framework that will include the office of a special counsel, which will investigate alleged human rights violations.
"They will certainly have the support of not only Sri Lankan but also Commonwealth and foreign judges and lawyers. But all this has to be authorized under Sri Lankan law," the Premier said.
He added that measures will be taken according to and under the Sri Lankan Constitution.
"One of the biggest issues faced by our country for the last five to six years has been removed. Now we can face the future with confidence," Premier Wickremesinghe said.
He said there had been great fear that the country would have to face economic sanctions as a result of international action.
The Prime Minister told CIMA officials: "You have a vital role to play in creating a million jobs, in making Sri Lanka a highly competitive market economy, in raising the income of the people, creating a strong middle class and uplifting our rural economy."
CIMA Global President Myriam Madden said Sri Lanka is now developing at a rapid pace and its growth is encouraging. "CIMA members contribute to business development in a significant manner as all our members are of high standard with regard to work ethics and discipline," she said.
"At present, Sri Lanka has over 13,000 CIMA students, 4,000 members and another 1,500 members outside the country. They can play an important role for the country's economic development," she said.
Over 60 percent of students are women. This can be a role model for other countries. CIMA is a global qualification. Most Sri Lankans, including women, hold top positions in the corporate sector, she said.
Ministers, CIMA CEO Charles Tilley, business leaders, past CIMA Presidents and the current leadership participated.
