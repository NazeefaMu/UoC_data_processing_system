The Indian foreign and economic policies are dictatorial and overpowering in relation to neighbouring countries; however, Sri Lanka should not abandon her relations with India but should remain alert when dealing with it, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayeke told a news conference that Indian policies are maintained in a way that is advantageous to that country as such the government should pay more attention when signing agreements with the India.

“No country can survive in isolation. But an agreement should be advantageous to Sri Lanka as well,” he said and added that a bilateral agreement should not pose any threat to the country’s economy or leave room to incur huge losses to state institutions.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
