Casinos are needed: Dy. Minister
	
Casinos are required to bring in additional high-spending tourists, Tourism and Christian Affairs Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando told Mirror Business.
I know different people have different views, but my view is that casinos are needed, he said.
He added that casinos are a major source of entertainment for the type of high-spending tourists Sri Lanka aims to attract.
But we shouldn't let locals enter. We should have them in a separate place, like the US has in Las Vegas, Fernando said.
Singapore has made a fortune in tourism through casinos but is discouraging locals by charging excessively for their entry.
Casinos were the centre of major controversy last year. Australian casino king James Packer was invited to open shop by the past regime, with locals such as John Keells Holdings also seeking to start operations and Dhammika Perera hoping to extend his current casino business as well.
The current regime, while in the opposition, had rallied religious leaders to their cause in blocking the casinos.
Jetwing Group Chairman Hiran Cooray had later gone on to suggest that an isolated destination such as the under developed Kalpitiya zone be developed into a casino strip.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake recently said that casinos will not be started by the new regime.Govt. eyeing Hawker Streets
The government will be evaluating the possibility of facilitating Southeast Asian style Hawker Streets and providing funding to existing vendors to increase tourism spending in Sri Lanka.
In Malaysia and Thailand, there are food stalls on the street. Here, we should see if can get the help of the Colombo Municipal Council to set up temporary huts in a road like Marine Drive in the evening for food stalls, Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando said.
Singapore is world famous for its hawker street food with stall owners providing both regional and international cuisine. They used to cater to the local lifestyle, but became a culinary tourism phenomenon following the turn of the century. Most have become permanent hawker centres.
Fernando said that the government will look at setting up a funding scheme for small scale vendors as well.
We have seen that the pineapple and fruit vendors in Thailand cut their fruits in different designs and place them on ice as a presentation. In our country, our pineapple sellers are selling just like in the past. We want to help them, he said.
He added that stall owners around cultural attractions such as Sigiriya will also be given such funding and assistance to upgrade their service quality and increase tourism spending.
We have to do things like this from the grass root levels right up to the top levels. We have to help the industry, he said. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Video: Govt. action shows suppression of peoples rights: NFF
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera said yesterday the police attack on students of the Higher Diploma in Accountancy showed the governments suppressive reaction to the peoples demands.
He said by yesterdays attack on the students, who were only asking for their reasonable demands to be granted, the government had laid the foundation for police rule in the country.
The government has proved it was not interested in good governance but in Yama Palanaya in the country, Mr. Samaraweera said adding that instead of assigning such a vital portfolio to the minister of highways the government should have appointed a Higher Education Minister who would be sensitive to the demands of students.
He urged the students to join hands with the progressive forces of the people to win their demands rather than protesting on their own.
Only thorough a joint struggle can the students ensure their rights are safeguarded, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

She said this was the first time that she had participated in a protest.
Colombo National Hospital doctors had recommended her to undergo a CT scan, also called an X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) due to her constant head pains, she said.
After the photographs were published, the attack on the students came in for severe criticism by the people. (Piyumi Fonseka)Pix by Lahiru Harshana

Lankan born elected mayor in Australian city
	
Samantha Ratnam, whose family fled Sri Lankan riots for a better life in Australia has been elected Morelands first Greens mayor, Herald Sun<U+200E> reported on Friday.
South Ward councillor Ratnam won the mayoral vote 6-5 over Labor candidate Cr Lita Gillies, bringing an end to the ALPs stranglehold on the mayorship.
Cr Ratnam had been unsuccessful in the previous two mayoral votes, but secured the vote of independent councillor Helen Davidson, who had backed Labor candidates in previous mayoral votes.
I was more confident this year than the past two years, when I was pretty sure I did not have the numbers, but until the hands went up I was not sure it was going to happen, Cr Ratnam said. The night was quite surreal and its just still sinking in.
The ascension to mayor has capped an incredible personal journey for Cr Ratnam, who arrived in Australia with her family in 1989 having fled war-torn Sri Lanka and spent time in Europe and Canada.
Aged 6 at the time, Cr Ratnam said she remembered the 1983 riots in Colombo that gave rise to the countrys 30-year internal war, including her family being split as they took refuge when Sinhalese Sri Lankans burnt Tamil Sri Lankans homes.
I remember seeing the streets burning and for the first time seeing adults crying, she said.
It was an experience that changes you in many ways, but going through it together with family helped the healing.
Her family left Sri Lanka in 1987 and Cr Ratnam said it wasnt until she moved to Brunswick seven years ago that she felt at home.
She said her experiences fuelled her interest in social work and motivated her to take the program manager position at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.
Looking forward, Cr Ratnam said planning issues would be high on her agenda.
She said she would advocate that Planning Minister Richard Wynne approve the Brunswick Structure Plan, Environmentally Efficient Design policy and Apartment Design Code with minimal or no changes.
We need these rules set so people have certainty and clarity, she said.
She said other major projects in the next 12 months would include the design of the Oak Park pool redevelopment, construction of Pascoe Vale Community Centre and transport infrastructure, including improvements to Upfield Shared Path.
The major challenge facing Moreland Council, and all local governments, would be rates capping, Cr Ratnam said.
Cr Ratnam said being head of what had at times been a divided council could be challenging but she was confident councillors would work together.
It should be an interesting year and there has certainly been a change in dynamic of the council, she said.
But I have faith that everyone will put their best foot forward and make the last year of this council a successful one.

No difference between MR and MS: IUSF
	
The Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) today condemned the manner in which the police handled the demonstration by students of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) where several students were injured.
The IUSF said President Maithripala Sirisenas governance was no different to that of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa when considering the manner in which they were handling student agitation.
IUSF convener Lahiru Weerasekara said they had no problems with the police and the police behaved in an unruly manner not because they wanted to but because they were ordered to do so by the education authorities.
For his political campaign, President Sirisena had used the photographs and video footage of our members being beaten by the police during the Rajapaksa regime. He had even appeared in advertisements promising to end the brutal and aggressive manner in which the police acted towards students. We don't see any difference between the two presidents. When we inquired from Western Province Senior DIG Pujitha Jayasundara he said he was not aware as to what happened. The President is likely to tell the people that he too was unaware of what happened. This is how the so-called 'Yahapalanaya' is functioning after pledging to protect free education and students rights, Mr. Weerasekara said.
The HNDA students began their protest march from the Fort Railway Station supported by the IUSF and IUBF (Inter-University Bikkhu Federation) demanding that the the diploma be similarly recognised as the Bachelor of Commerce degree.
Equal recognition was granted in 1990 but the Mahinda Rajapaksa government issued a circular cancelling the degree status provided to it.
Mr. Weerasekara said the police and the anti riot squad had unleashed a brutal attack on the students including girls and Buddhist monks by firing tear gas, using water cannons and baton charging them. He said they would complain against this inhuman act to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and continue their struggle till these matters have been resolved.
Police Media Spokesperson Ruwan Gunasekara rejected the allegations made against the police and said they were only performing their duty to maintain law and order.
Meanwhile, the 39 students who were arrested on Thursday were granted bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate today.
The IUSF said eight students were still under treatment at the Colombo National Hospital.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Secretary justifies lavish tour for CEB officials
	
	The lavish Rs.10.4 million training tour to Austria for eleven senior CEB officials that caused so much controversy for misusing state funds was justified by the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, who explained that it was not public funds that were spent on the programme.
	Ministry Secretary, Dr. Suren Batagoda, who vehemently denied that the six-day training tour to Vienna, Austria to be held from November 9 to 13, was a case of misusing State funds, said that the CEB was a commercial organization and no public funds would be wasted in the exercise.
	The Daily Mirror last week exposed the story of how ten senior Engineers and an accountant of the CEB were planning to go on an expensive training programme on Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to be held in Vienna, Austria despite a recent government circular to minimize the use of state funds.
	Although there were enough and more facilities to hold this programme in Colombo for a sum of USD 100 per trainee, the necessity to undertake such an expensive foreign visit, even though it was a training tour, had raised many eyebrows.
	When asked about the necessity to have an expensive foreign training when ample local facilities were available here Dr. Batagoda was of the view that their officials should be given the opportunity to explore the world and learn new things instead of remaining here like 'frogs stuck in a well'.
	The Secretary, who also justified the fact that three senior officials included in the list were set to retire from the beginning of 2016, said it was the practice of the CEB to arrange such trips for officials after taking into account their long service to the board.
	The course fee alone would cost the CEB a minimum of Rs.10.4 million while the expenditure on air tickets and a personal allowance of USD 2, 500 would also add to the expenses, it was revealed. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Proceedings at the PRECIFAC had to be suspended today when the evidence given by ITN Chief Internal Auditor appeared began to contradict himself, an official said.
A senior PRECIFAC official said ITN Chief Internal Auditor Majula Alagiyawanna had contradicted what he had said previously and resulted in the recording of his evidence being stopped halfway through.
He said proceedings were postponed for November 19 and 20.
Former president and Kurunegala district UPFA MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who appeared before the PRECIFAC for the fourth day yesterday to give a statement over the alleged non-payment of bills to the state-owned ITN.
He told the media that the ITN would have to pay him back going by the way the proceedings were moving.
If the proceedings continuing in this manner, I think ITN will have to pay me. Now a huge amount had been reduced from the amount previously mentioned. It seems that the figures are being changed for political revenge, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said it was a mental harassment to be summoned so many times.
Former ministers Keheliya Rambukwella, Dullas Allahapperuma and Susil Premajayantha also gave statements before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC).
