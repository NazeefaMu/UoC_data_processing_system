During a meeting with Indian Transport and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari at the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi last evening, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a four-lane traffic system had been proposed to be built from Jaffna to Mannar, Mannar to Colombo via Kurunegala and Mannar to Trincomalee via Vavuniya.

He said building such a system would help strengthen the relationship between the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

Responding to the Premier’s comments, Minister Nitin Gadkari said the Indian government would facilitate the proposed construction.

“India has the latest technology for road construction. Constructing roads using cement and concrete can last for more than fifty years without any maintenance. When comparing road construction rates with other countries, Indian technology is much cheaper,” Minister Gadkari said.

Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, Secretary to the Prime Minister Mr. Saman Ekanayake, Additional Media Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetti, Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India Chitranganee Wagiswara, Chief of the Five Year Plan Arjuna Mahendran and several other delegates participated at the meeting.
