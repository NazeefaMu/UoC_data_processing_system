Swapping political aspirations!


	



 

A long-standing loyalist of the former Madam, this Diyawanna politico at state level from Gampaha is widely considered a Blue party stalwart in the district.

 


Now that the general polls are around the corner, the politico held a meeting of the party’s electorate level organization to meet the party’s rank and file to feel their pulse. 


A good number of party activists and supporters had turned up at this meeting, but what most of them told him gave the politico a jolt: “Sir, we’ve come out of our respect for you. But we have now decided to back Pohottuwa. If you need our continued support, please join the Pohottuwa party.”


The politico thanked them for being frank with him and told them that he too would like to be equally frankly with them. 


He told them that he had already decided to join the heritage party. “The leader of this party holds an influential position in this government and this party has entered into a political alliance with the core party of yahapalanaya. And as a member of this party, I hope to get nomination to contest under the banner of this alliance at the coming general polls.”


The party activists and supporters expressed their surprise at his decision, but not their support or endorsement, they say.
