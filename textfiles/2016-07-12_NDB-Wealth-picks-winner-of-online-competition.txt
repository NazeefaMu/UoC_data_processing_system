Retired Commissioned Officer (Katunayake International Airport) and mother of two Prasanthika Gayani De Mel, from Homagama, hasbeen selected as the winner of the NDB Wealth “Share Your Savings Stories and Win!” online competition. 
Promoted widely across NDB Wealth’s fast growing online community, this competition attracted significant interest as a result of content deployed via Facebook, Youtube, etc.
Conceived to empower people in discovering savings alternatives that are ‘more than banking’, and hosted by expert financial planner NDB Wealth on its “It’s Time” FB page, this competition offered up a platform for people to share their smart savings stories, enabling the conversation about unconventional savings options to be kickstarted via the posting of unique questions. The winner was then handpicked by the NDB Wealth team based on real life experiences shared in the comments section of the NDB Wealth “It’s Time” FB page.
De Mel was gifted a free of charge NDB Wealth account of Rs. 10,000, which will serve as an initial investment in her journey towards creating a secure financial future.
Commenting, NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera said, “Thanks to the comments by De Mel and others on the NDB Wealth ‘It’s Time’ Facebook page, more and more people are getting involved in the conversation about what constitutes true savings for the future, especially since it is always a good thing when people look at financial planning in a way that is ‘more than banking’. Eventually, this will result in people considering options beyond traditional bank savings accounts and fixed deposits, and ultimately lead to customised wealth management plans to meet their unique requirements, which is the best possible way to having true financial freedom.” 
He added, “We at NDB Wealth would like to congratulate Ms. De Mel for submitting a thought-provoking story. We would also like to encourage everyone to keep checking in and commenting via NDB Wealth’s multiple social media accounts, which may even allow them to take part in and win future competitions.”
