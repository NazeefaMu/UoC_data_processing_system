BBC journalist Azzam Ameen, who had been asked to report to the Cyber Crimes Unit of the CID this morning (10) over a tweet, said the Police asked him not to visit the CID.

“I was informed by the Police via phone and through a letter this morning that it was not necessary for me to visit the CID. They regretted any inconvenience caused,” Mr. Ameen tweeted yesterday morning adding that “I am grateful to those who expressed their support to me in many ways on this issue.”

Earlier, it was reported that  Mr. Ameen was summoned over a tweet made by the President’s Media Division’s (PMD) twitter handle in response to one of the tweets made by President Maithripala Sirisena’s official twitter account.
