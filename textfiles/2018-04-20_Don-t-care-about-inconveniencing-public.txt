Don’t care about inconveniencing public


	



Interviews were held about two years ago to select qualified pharmacists to fill over 80 vacancies existing in 25 pharmacies in a city which is a haunt of many leading politicos, but the appointment letters to the selectees are yet to be issued, they say.

Pressures being brought on the authorities by some politicos to give appointments to their favorites who have failed to meet the stipulated qualifications is said to be the reason for the inordinate delay in filling the vacancies. People calling at the pharmacies in this city with doctors’ prescriptions are compelled to cool their heels in long queues due to the unavailability of a sufficient number of pharmacists to serve them, they say.
