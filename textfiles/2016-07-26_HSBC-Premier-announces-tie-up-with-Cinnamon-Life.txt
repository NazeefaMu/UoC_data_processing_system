Internationally renowned Architect, Artist and Engineer, Cecil Balmond, the design visionary behind some of the most popular buildings in the world, including the ArcelorMittal Orbit in London and the CCTV Tower in Beijing will be bringing this inspired concept to life. The construction contractors include a Consortium of contractors headed by Hyundai Engineering and Construction.
