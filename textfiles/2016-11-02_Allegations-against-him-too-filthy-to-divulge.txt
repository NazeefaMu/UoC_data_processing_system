Allegations against him too filthy to divulge


	

A group of white-collar high-ups attached to an office concerned with pharmaceuticals appeared before the COPE following summons served on them. 


Asked to freely air their grievances, the ladies among the high-ups had broken down in tears.
Then the COPE members had urged the ladies in tears to come clean with their grievances. Thus encouraged, the ladies had come out with plethora of allegations against their chief. They also told the committee members that certain allegations that they had to make against their boss were so sordid and seedy, it went against their grain to divulge them. 


They also named a certain political authority who is protecting their boss despite his misconduct and the gravity of offenses being committed by him.
