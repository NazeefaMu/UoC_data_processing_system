Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed the legal unit of the United National Party (UNP) to check and inform him whether it would be possible to hold the local government elections before February 4 next year.

Sources close to Mr Wickremesinghe told Daily Mirror that he had given these instructions because he believed that the elections should be held as soon as possible.

According to information received, a meeting of political party leaders in Parliament would be held soon to ascertain whether there were provisions for Parliament to intervene and ensure that the elections were held. (Yohan Perera in India)
