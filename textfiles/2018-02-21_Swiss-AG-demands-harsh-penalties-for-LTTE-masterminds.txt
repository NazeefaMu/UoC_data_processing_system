In the indictment plea in the Tamil Tigers’ trial, in Bellinzona, which lasted for almost two days, Swiss Attorney General Juliette Noto has requested that the 12 Tamils be found guilty of participating or supporting the LTTE.

The newspaper Neue zürcher zeitung said the federal prosecutors are clear that the accused Tamils have financed terrorism and supported a criminal organization with the Tamil Tigers.
For most of the 13 defendants, the federal prosecutor attested grave offenses and a high level of criminal energy.

The 12 Tamils have contributed to maintaining an efficient and complex system in Switzerland over the years with the sole purpose of illegally raising funds and then channelling them through tortuous routes to the LTTE.

In the main, the federal prosecutor requests that the 12 Tamils be found guilty of participating or supporting a criminal organization.

The only exception is the former bank employee. Most of them also have to answer for fraud and forgery, some also for money laundering and extortion.

In particular, for the mastermind of Tamil Tigers in Switzerland, the prosecutor demanded high fines.

For the head of the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which was considered an offshoot of the Tamil Tigers in Switzerland, she demanded an unconditional imprisonment of 5 years and a fine of 180 daily rates of 80 francs.

The Chief Financial Officer of the WTCC is to receive an unconditional imprisonment of 6.5 years and a fine of 180 daily rates of 100 francs.

For the other defendants, the federal prosecutor demanded prison sentences of between 18 months and five years as well as fines.

In essence, the prosecution considers it has been proven that the Tamil Tigers were a criminal organization that attacked civilians and recruited child soldiers.

The defendants had financed their monetary payments therefore terrorism.
