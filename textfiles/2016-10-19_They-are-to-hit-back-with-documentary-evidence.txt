The JO leaders who have vowed to expose the corrupt deals of 10 top team members in yahapalanaya are in the process of collecting incriminating documentary evidence against them.

 


The 10 purohitas whom the JO has targeted for exposure are said to be powerful members at the top table and two of them are from Anuradhapura and the remaining eight hail from Colombo, Kandy, Kegalle, Mannar and Gampaha, they say. 


The JO high-ups propose to hand the ten dossiers on the 10 top men to the FCID and the Bribery Commission in the first instance and in the event of these two bodies failing to take prompt positive action, they have planned to file cases in courts against them.
