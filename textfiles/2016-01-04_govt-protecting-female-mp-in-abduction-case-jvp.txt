The Government is protecting a particular female parliamentarian who was charged with the abduction and assault of a man recently in Dematagoda, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) claimed today.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said she was being protected and her wrong doings were being covered up because she was a member of the ruling party.  (Piyumi Fonseka)
