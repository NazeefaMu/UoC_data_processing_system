Mathivanan and Seneviratne nominations for VP rejected
Nishantha, Thilanga and Jayantha get greenlight to contest SLC presidency

 
The Objection filed against the nominations of Nishantha Ranatunga, Thilanga Sumathipala and Jayantha Dharmadasa for the post of president of Sri Lanka Cricket were overruled by a committee headed by Director General of Sports K. D. S. Ruwanchandra yesterday thus paving the way for them to contest the elections on January 3.
The fourth contestant for the post is Sumith Perera.
However the nominations of K. Mathivanan and Asanga Seneviratne for the post of Vice Presidents were rejected on the grounds that they had not served in the executive committee for a minimum period of two years.
On the same grounds Eastman Narangoda's nominations for the post of treasurer was also rejected. Mathivanan the Daily News learns may seek legal redress on the decision.
According to the constitution of Sri Lanka Cricket all contestants should have served a period of two years in the executive committee after been elected.
However those who have represented Sri Lanka in Test or one-day international cricket need not have served in the executive committee. Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lanka's World Cup winning captain has qualified to contest for the post of vice president on those grounds.
The disqualification of Narangoda for the post of treasurer leaves only Shammi Silva as the only contestant for the post.
However Silva is also contesting for the post of vice-president and it will be interesting to see which post he will finally settle for.
If Silva withdraws from contesting the vice-presidency Dharmadasa and Arjuna Ranatunga will be uncontested for the two posts of vice-president.
