20A without repeal of 13A  will be disastrous
	
Stand Alone is a term that was used a lot during the discussion on the power of the President to dissolve parliament. The issue was whether the clause preventing dissolution until Parliament completes four and a half years supersedes the surreptitiously inserted clause permitting dissolution. That insertion was pernicious as was the entire 19th Amendment, clearly introduced for partisan purposes by the chief architects, meaning representatives of the United National Party and the Tamil National Alliance (Jayampathy Wickramaratne and M.A. Sumanthiran respectively). That the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) voted for it should be noted and seen as an example of political puerility. 
Well, thats been resolved by the Supreme Court. At the end of the day, much heartache was caused to die-hard UNPers thinly disguised as born-again democrats. They are cured now and the chances are that they will retire their democratic urges until the partys political future is next threatened. 
There were positives. The notion of a national government, in effect rather than in constitutional edict, was sorted out. The UNP plus the Sri Lanka Musilm Congress will not add up to national government. So, although the national government clause was inserted (against surreptitiously and against the grain of good governance as well as rhetoric regarding cabinet size), the cabinet will be limited to 30. Secondly, the post of Leader of the Opposition went to the true Opposition instead of a staunch pro-government adjunct, the TNA, that is currently a tail wagging the dog as the adage goes.
Theres a third positive. Its a positive that might jog the memories of retired leftists whove found lucrative positions in the NGO industry, have long since forgotten class struggle, have no qualms about being quiet on capitalism and would love people to believe that the UNP is the vanguard of the democratic revolution. Simply, Maithripala Sirisena is the first President of the country to actually speak up against neoliberalism. 
His word Well! But thats a different matter. Its a small positive, thats it.
The talk now is about the Executive Presidency. Thats where the stand alone matter comes into play. People talk about the Executive Presidency as the Mother of All Anti-Democratic Evils. Make no mistake, theres nothing angelic about the executive presidency. On the other hand, we need to remember that it is not the only evil around. And, as evil goes, it has its redeeming features, especially with respect to what I consider the most pernicious piece of legislation to follow J.R. Jayewardenes constitutional tinkering exercise, i.e. the 13th Amendment. The people of this country were conspicuously absent(ed) in that process. It was thrust down our throats to resolve a mis-defined conflict and (partially, according to some, including the aggrieved) exaggerated grievances. And today, ladies and gentlemen (especially those chest-beating democrats who came out of the woodwork recently), no one seems to really care about Provincial Councils. Six PCs are effectively non-functional. The terms of three more will expire in a few months. Not even the TNA, a party that wants more than what the 13th gave by way of devolution, doesnt appear to mind the current state of affairs. As for the people, they have not uttered one word of concern. 
Ideally, the people should have the opportunity to state their opinion of this lot in a General Election. This side of such an eventuality, it is appropriate to point out the danger of constitutional tinkering by this Parliament
That said, the 13th is still a part of the Constitution. This is where the 20th Amendment (which proposes to abolish the Executive Presidency) comes into play. The executive president is a key part of the 13th Amendment because it carries the safeguards against moves by provinces to break away.
Any move to abolish the executive presidency that does not at the same time address the impact of such an amendment to the operationalising of the 13th is erroneous and irresponsible. Patali Champika Ranawakas party, the Jathika Hela Urumaya has consistently reminded lawmakers and others of this danger. What Ranawaka has to say now will indicate to what extent the party (and of course he himself) has dissolved its ideology for political profit. 
A related issue is the fact that it would be a travesty of justice if these 225 Members of Parliament touched this constitution. Sure, thats part of the Job Description as per the constitution, but theyve demonstrated beyond any shadow of doubt that they are absolutely incompetent. Only one member, Sarath Weerasekera, objected to the 19th Amendment, let us not forget, and that is as mentioned above a piece of garbage.
Moreover they had the opportunity to do away with the executive presidency (Note: Sirisenas manifesto mentioned change and wwnot abolish). They didnt. Events proved that the 19th, as far as pruning presidential powers, was eyewash. The checks introduced, namely the independent institutions, constituted a monumental joke considering the composition of the Constitutional Council (politician-heavy, federalist-heavy) and in terms of the appointments they oversaw (bypassing seniority in appointing judges for example). 
Today, after being stumped by the hero-turned-zero Sirisena, those who used him and turned a blind eye to his many faults, want to bulldoze his office. Thats what it boils down to. And thats exactly the wrong reason to engage in constitutional reform. You dont do things just because you like the immediate beneficiary or because it helps you checkmate with a political opponent. Thats the logic that has prevailed in the 40 years that passed after the Second Republican Constitution was instituted. Apart from the 17th, it was all about political expedience (leaving out the 13th because it was extracted from a weak UNP President who, like his successors didnt have faith in the citizens of this country) and not about the larger interests of the nation. 
This parliament has outlived its usefulness on account of incompetence, subterfuge and downright disrespect for the people. Theyve prostituted the word democracy enough. They are not to be trusted. Today, the movers and shakers in Parliament are essentially the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the TNA, the former a shameless lackey of the UNP and the latter operating as though the UNP is its lackey. Both parties have terrorist pasts: the JVP in 1971 and in 1988//89 and the TNA as the mouthpiece of the LTTE. They are batting here with the UNP, which while in power unleashed terror and disappeared some 60,000 Thajudeens, Ekneligodas and Lasanthas. The SLFP has its own violent history (1971). All these parties have shamed themselves to the point that they really dont deserve the right to use the word democracy. 
Ideally, the people should have the opportunity to state their opinion of this lot in a General Election. This side of such an eventuality, it is appropriate to point out the danger of constitutional tinkering by this Parliament. The 20th, as proposed, is a mischievous and dangerous document which can only make sense if the 13th Amendment is repealed simultaneously. 
The UNP, fighting shy of holding even PC elections, ought to salivate at the prospect of not having to face the people before a General or Presidential Election, but this is not about the political tastes of a particular party. It is about sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is also about the blood and lost body parts of all those who fought against separatist terrorists. That memory must also be factored in. 
If true representational democracy, territorial integrity and sovereignty are babies, then you can make a case for calling the executive presidency bathwater but lets not forget that the baby will be at risk of all kinds of infections if you throw THAT bathwater out whilst keeping the toilet wash that is the 13th Amendment.

## Title: Are we Sri Lankans, one people Where are our leaders
## Section: Opinion

Are we Sri Lankans, one people Where are our leaders
	
Politically, it may appear that we are not one people. We have a long history of ethnicity-based politics within a small island with a measure of ethnic diversity unrivalled in countries of our size. But socially and culturally the reality appears to be different. Our ethnic communities are closer to each other culturally and socially than in many others, whether in South Asia or elsewhere. While there are regions in which one or another of the ethnic groups is dominant, many contain mixed neighbourhoods. People in these neighbourhoods not only visit their neighbours of different ethnicity but often participate in celebrating their festivals, notably Sinhalese/Tamil New Year and Christmas.Further our children play together in mixed teams.
Many of our political parties and major cricket clubs have ethnic names
	Our political leadership continues to be dominated by feudal elite
	Segregation was contrary to our cultural heritage
Though some of our major sports clubs bear ethnic names (Sinhalese Sports Club, Tamil Union, Moors Sports Club, Burgher Recreation Club, etc.) this is largely a colonial heritage derived from a divide and rule policy extended into participation in sports activities. But segregation was contrary to our cultural heritage, and the exclusiveness in sports has progressively broken down. For a long time virtually every sports club has, in composition and representation in sports activities, been multiethnic,although many of them have not shed their ethnic names adopted in colonial times. Thus, for example the Tamil Union cricket team today is predominantly non-Tamil. These are welcome developments.
The two major political parties do not have ethnic names but are dominated by Sinhalese, many of whom regard this country as essentially Sinhalese. In fact these parties have been progressively deserted by significant sections of the minorities who were originally loyal to these parties
Many of our political parties have ethnic names, again a colonial heritage, reflecting ethnicity based representation in government till the Donoughmore Reforms around 1930. These reforms included voting rights for the lower social classes of men and for all women, bitterly opposed by a revered conservative and sexist national leader as casting pearls before swine. However, ethnicity has got embedded into our politics. The two major political parties do not have ethnic names but are dominated by Sinhalese, many of whom regard this country as essentially Sinhalese. In fact these parties have been progressively deserted by significant sections of the minorities who were originally loyal to these parties. Their desertion, reflects the unfortunate rising tide of ethnic divisiveness in our politics.
New ethnicity-based parties with more extreme policies than the earlier ethnicity based-parties are being formed. The Sri Lankan Tamils and the Hill Country Tamils always had their political parties but the main Muslim party, the Sri Lankan Muslim Congress (SLMC), was formed many years after independence, and has absorbed many Muslims who were previously members of the United National Party (UNP) or the Sri Lankan Freedom Party (SLFP). We now have a bewildering array of political parties, many of them with ethnic labels. The old order appears, indeed, to be yielding to the new, but in many respects the new is worse than the old.
While many corrupt political leaders are scrambling for office so as to enjoy the perks of such positions, it is heartening to come across spirited action by two courageous youth Surin Chamara and Kasun Ukwatta who have made bold public statements against the prevailing political culture of corruption and servility towards those holding political power. As reported by Ruwanthie deChickera (HTTPS://groundviews.org/author/ruwanthie-de-chickera/), at the annual National Youth Awards Ceremony held at Nelum-Pokuna on November 28, 2018, these two young artists refused to accept their well-earned awards from the chief guests, politicians Udaya Gammanpila and Duminda Dissanayaka. They eventually received those awards from public officials.
Our political leadership continues to be dominated by feudal elite, linked to each other by corrupt rival clans that derive power from caste pedigree and family wealth, whether inherited or newly ill-gotten
On another theme, that of teaching history for national reconciliation, there is an excellent article by another youth, Awahnee Mendis(http://www.ft.lk/) / Opinion and Issues (http://www.ft.lk/opinion/14) Teach Everyones History For Reconciliation. For many decades, enlightened scholars have been pressing, with little success, for a radical change in the teaching of our history. It is on this theme that Awahnee concludes that;
If the history of the Sinhala and Tamil people are tied together and taught positively, about how for centuries before colonialism, the people lived in harmony, we can ensure that understanding and a feeling of national pride and inclusion is felt by people.
By formally accepting, acknowledging and teaching that this whole country belongs to everyone and has been this way for centuries before colonialism, we will allow for an organic, long-lasting,sustainable unity. 
While the actions of the Head of the Executive have been deplorable, those of the majority of the Legislative and, above all, that the Judiciary have been reassuring. Our political leadership continues to be dominated by feudal elite, linked to each other by corrupt rival clans that derive power from caste pedigree and family wealth, whether inherited or newlyill-gotten.
By formally accepting, acknowledging and teaching that this whole country belongs to everyone and has been this way for centuries before colonialism, we will allow for an organic, long-lasting, sustainable unity
Most welcome is that we now see courageous leadership emerging from a younger generation, devoid of such credentials. We are greatly encouraged by the initiative of youth like Surin Chamara, Kasun Ukwatta, Awahnee Mendis and Ruwanthie de Chickera. After very many depressing years, the futurelooks promising.

Coca-Cola set to brighten up the festive season with its iconic Christmas Truck roadshow
	
From as far back as the 1930s, Coca-Cola has continued its legacy of bringing families and friends together to share moments of happiness and refreshment during Christmas and New Year's. In keeping with its iconic holiday tradition which brings the joy of the festive season to consumers across Sri Lanka, Coca-Cola Sri Lanka Private Ltd. recently launched its annual Christmas roadshow. Featuring a Coca-Cola truck of choristers and a host of exciting games and giveaways, this years Christmas roadshow will be running from December 14  25 2018.
Spreading the holiday cheer from factory to town, the roadshow kicked off from the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Biyagama and is rolling-out across various locations from Colombo to Negombo. With an enlivening choir delivering a non-stop line-up of Christmas carols to keep the festive spirits flying high, the brightly-lit Coca-Cola truck will travel to nearly twenty locations including supermarkets, Arpico Hyde Park &Thalawathugoda, Cargills Rajagiriya, Ja-ela, Katubedda & Negombo, Super K Negombo, Laugfs Negombo, Spar Thalawathugoda and selected Sathosa and Perera and Sons outlets. An array of interactive games and programmes will also be conducted at Scope Cinemas - Colombo City Center,Savoy Wellawatte and at the Majestic City. To further spread the magic of the season, the Christmas truck will also reward loyal Coca-Cola fans with a range of exciting gifts and surprises along the course of its journey.
Gearing up for the iconic annual holiday tradition, Mario Perera  Country Marketing Manager, Sri Lanka and Maldives stated, We are excited to launch yet another Christmas roadshow, which we hope will encapsulate the magic of the season, by bringing families and friends together to create and share joyous moments and experiences. Spreading cheer, happiness and the spirit of togetherness has always been at the heart of the Coca-Cola brand and we look forward to doing just that through this grand holiday activation. With our cheerful carolers and musicians brightening up the streets, we hope that this much-loved annual event will be a delightful and memorable occasion for Sri Lankans of all ages and walks of life.
Coca-Cola has always created heart-warming and striking adverts, campaigns and activations that have helped brighten up the holiday season across the globe. The modern-day image of Santa Claus can also be attributed to Coca-Cola, as it was the brand that commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to first develop advertising depictions and imagery of Santa as a jolly, friendly and plump bearded man in a red suit. This image of Santa has now become an integral part of popular culture and is synonymous with the holiday season in all corners of the world.

Field Force OIC remanded for allegedly accepting bribe
	
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratna, today, remanded the OIC of the Police Field Force Headquarters until 2 January, for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs.50,000 to provide a recommendation letter to reinstate an Inspector of Police who had been interdicted.
At the outset of the inquiry Counsel Srilal Dandeniya making submission on behalf of the suspect OIC, submitted that issuing recommendation letters to a person who was under interdiction was not within the authority of the OIC.
He also said the interdicted IP is a person with a history of bad remarks. The Counsel said the complainant was in the bad books of the Police Department and had been charged in court for corrupt and dishonest actions.
The Counsel also contended that the Complainant had taken money from the suspect OIC by giving promissory notes which they could produce to the court during the inquiry.
Therefore the Counsel stated that the complainant had fabricated the story with ulterior motive.
The Magistrate ordered the Bribery Officer to conduct an impartial inquiry into the Counsels submissions and to file the report in court on the next date of hearing.(T.Farook Thajudeen)

Fuel prices to be reviewed tomorrow: Mangala
	
Fuel prices are to be reviewed tomorrow by comparing prices in the world market, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
We would compare the fuel price with the global market prices and will do a fresh review tomorrow, he said.
While speaking to the media he said that the fuel prices had come down in the world market, so prices should be reduced in Sri Lanka as well.
The pricing formula will be active from now on, and any fluctuation in the global market should have an effect here, he said.
Earlier, the fuel prices were reviewed based on the pricing formula on the 10th of every month based on global prices.
Former Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa used to reduce fuel prices based on the world price.
Former Minister gave fuel price concessions with the use of our fuel pricing formula, he said.
We do not give false reliefs to people as what was done by the former Finance Minister. Those reliefs were worthless, Minister Samaraweera said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Gamata Tech Opens Avenues for Youth Entrepreneurs across Sri Lanka

Gamata Tech Opens Avenues for Youth Entrepreneurs across Sri Lanka
	
Gamata Technology, an accelerator platform initiated by youth-tech entrepreneurs covering every corner of Sri Lanka was officially launched recently at a ceremony held in Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre. The event was delegated by young entrepreneurs, leading tech companies, renowned personalities and Locals covering 19 Districts over Sri Lanka.
The concept of Gamata Tech was build based on a research done on technological usage for several years, across Sri Lanka. The research exposed how a high percentage of youth misuse the technology at their hands due to lack of knowledge and empowerment. On the other hand they explored the lack of technological knowledgeof government officials and other parties. Drawing along the conclusions received, the founders explored the avenues and potential of the youth in rural areas who lacked a platform to enhance their strengths and execute their innovative ideas.
The event was also used as an arena to introduce several innovative mobile applications to strengthen the technological revolution in rural areas introduced and innovated by I.C.A.N Advertising. The applications included Friends Belt (A genuine social media platform suitable to Sri Lanka), Gedarata Plus (A multi-vendor shopping platform from home), Esenin (A taxi app which passengers and drivers use) and Paara.lk (A comprehensive directory).
The event had several sessions which educated and shared the opportunities for youth entrepreneurs from rural areas in Sri Lanka. One of the highlights of the day included the panel discussion which cultivated Dialogue on Digital Sri Lanka with the participation of erudite speakers of the industry. The experienced panelists included Kushil Gunasekara, Founder and the Chief Trustee, Foundation of Goodness, Achala Samaradiwakara, co-founder Good Market, Fathhi Mohamed, Co-founder of PickMe and Yoho Bed, Isura Silva, Consultant, Strategic Management of Sarvodaya Fusion and Dr. Ashan Perera, UN SDG Action Award Winner 2018, Youth Advocate, Social Entrepreneur and Founder of The Road to Rights Youth-Led Organization. The panel was moderated by Dr. Nirmal De Silva- Co founder and CEO of Paramount.
The discussion was built around subjects such as opportunities and challenges of the rural entrepreneurship in SL, Responsibility of a society powered with technology, Why Sri Lanka needs entrepreneurship, Social entrepreneurship and a wide range of subjects that cover the arena of rural entrepreneurship.
Welcoming the gathering Dr. Ashan Perera commented on the importance of a platform such as Gamata Technology While we were conducting the initial researches, I met many young Sri Lankans who had wonderful innovative ideas; web sites to promote tourism, integrate and notify people and business places, platforms to reach the international audience of historical monuments while being at their own hometowns. But these innovators lack the technology and the knowledge to execute these ideas. So if we all can take the right technology and right technological resources to the rural areas, we can build our countrywith these ideas to great heights. Eventhough theres people are waiting to change the world in rural areas, theres no stage built for them to do so. World is moving in great speed with technology. If we do not transport technological knowledge and skills to rural areas, we wont be able to join the international arena.
He further added This launch of Gamata technology program, we hope to take the program to the people in all 25 districts. We will be meeting the youth, government officials etc. If we can give the right technological knowledge to these groups, we can find many resources for every industry. These resources are the ones which will change Sri Lanka, strengthen the culture, traditions and the unity we hold. We should identify them. I welcome Business sector, Entrepreneurs, Policy makers to join with us in strengthening them. The people who are behind this program can change the cities, our country and win the world.
The generation of innovative ideas was given much attention at the panel discussion as the panelists discussed how the trend of business models has given way to the course of evolution. They emphasized how businesses are no longer profit oriented, but socially responsible businesses modeled around changing the society can sustain in the market. Achala Samaradiwakara, co-founder Good Market mentioned that it is all about using the current issues of the system, and changing the system using technology. Its not always about doing something new, but doing it differently adopting to the context and customers. Co-Founder of PickMe Fathhi Mohamed added. Environment and other social crisis are discussed at every platforms today, and the panelists provided examples on how we can prepare ourselves as a country to face such adversities in the future through social entrepreneurship, by solving the issues in the rural areas, by the youth entrepreneurs, using technology.
Isuru Silva, Consultant, Strategic Management of Sarvodaya Fusion explained how norms and attitudes of education in Sri Lanka has to change. They discussed how as opposed to the popular myth, we can elevate and promote traditions and culture of Sri Lanka through technology.
Many businesses complaint how Sri Lankas market is less competitive as we are limited with a population of 21 million. The panel conversed on how such factors does not matter, as long as a strong business model with flexibility is used. The probability of expanding Sri Lankan initiatives such as Pick Me into the global market was also discussed.
Gamata Tech is an independent national initiative collaborated with The Road to Rights Youth-led Organization and Mithuru Mithuro Movement. The event was supported by I.C.A.N Advertising; a grassroots initiative which has made an impact on lives of people in over 15 districts through tech-based platforms. I.C.A.N has been engaged in the technology and advertising industries for over three years and with a team of experts in this field for over six years.

Marketing plays a key role to build sustainable entrepreneurs
	
Creating more and better jobs is an emerging challenge for the Sri Lankan economy. Indeed, it is an issue that concerns a diverse group of stakeholders in the country. For several years now a debate has been raging as to why Sri Lanka does not have as many entrepreneurs as most of its regional counterparts.
Some attribute the reason many Sri Lankans do not opt for self-employment to cultural norms, family pressures and an anxiety of failure. Obviously, one aspect that differentiates entrepreneurship from employment is the amount of risk incurred. An employee has a relatively low amount of risk.
In most situations, the employee is only responsible for his/her work responsibilities during designated business hours and they are often entitled to certain benefits from the organization. This form of employment is ideal for an individual who wants a higher degree of stability and predictability for their careers. In other words, they appear quite satisfied to remain in the relative safety of what is referred to as the Comfort Zone.
In developing countries such as ours it has been widely recognizedthat more entrepreneurship is essential not only to solve the problem of unemployment but also to achieve higher levels of economic development and growth.
Statistics from Sri Lankas Ministry of Industry and Commerce suggests that 75% of all enterprises fall in the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) category, contributing to 52 percent of the countrys GDP and 45 percent of employment.The statistics indicate that Sri Lanka needs a five-fold increase in entrepreneurs and SMEs to fuel economic growth.
Mr.DulithHerath, the Founder of Kapruka.com is a prime example of a successful local entrepreneur. Kapruka is by far the largest e-commerce company in Sri Lanka. Its revenue amounts to Rs. 1.2 billion annually and itlists 16,000 products online, while it executes around 700  900 orders a day.
Ms. Vindya Vithana, the Chief Editor of Public Relations and Marketing at Xtream Youth is another such example. Vindya has been named as one of the 50 Most Influential Global Digital Marketing Leaders by the World Marketing Congress.While candidates from 60 countries are considered for this award, Vindya at 25 years became the youngest recipient of this award in 2016. She also runs her own firm called Apostrophe, a company focused on content marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Beside this, she is also known among the nations start-up bloggers as one who shares her experiences and lessons about start-ups
Such successful entrepreneurs provide value to the customer by focusing on innovative products or exemplary customer serviceto stand out from their competitors.In the Sri Lankan context that is what most businesses today lack in satisfying their customers.
The need for entrepreneurial marketing in the country is strongly relevant with the changing economic environment. Entrepreneurial marketing campaigns attempt to highlight the company's greatest strengths, while emphasizing their value to the customer, through focusing on innovative products or exemplary customer service, to stand out from competitors.
Entrepreneurial marketing is less about a single marketing strategy and more about a marketing spirit that differentiates itself from traditional marketing practices. It utilizes a toolkit of new and unconventional practices to help emerging firms/individuals gain a position in crowded markets.The easiest way to identify an entrepreneurial marketing effort is to observe the companys marketing strategy. Emerging companies use entrepreneurial marketing to help establish themselves in start-up industries.
Entrepreneur and proprietor of Lanka Grills, Mr.Remon Issac Rajamoney said: We are problem solvers and we need the perseverance to continue to become successful. You have to be happy and passionate about what youre doing. I do not count risks as risks but as challenges. Specially facing market risks among the competitors is a huge challenge. Marketing is a vital process for entrepreneurs because no venture can become established and grow without a customer market. Its all about differentiating the brand from competitors and occupying a special place in the consumer mind. We must create the design, the product, set the price and take the offer to the market with confidence. In my point of view an important part of gaining the market's acceptance is building brand awareness, so in that case having a sharp knowledge of marketing as an entrepreneur will help gain higher results in the industry that you are competing in.
Entrepreneur and Co-founder of Skazka Clothing, Ms.Nevindee Amarasinghe said: There is a need to nurture entrepreneurs as opposed to ad hoc entrepreneurship. I think Sri Lanka compared with other locations has the most number of entrepreneurial people on earth. You will observe some Sri Lankan somewhere doing really good work and being highly successful. A big constraint faced by entrepreneurs is the lack of information available on markets and marketing skills. Many also lack the necessary know-how to market their products accordingly.

## Title: Political crisis not over yet
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 20 December 2018 12:00 am
Political crisis not over yet
	
For a parliamentarian, the biggest concern is to get re-elected to Parliament over and over again until he or she retires from politics.
When President Maithripala Sirisena finally succumbed to pressure and reappointed United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesimnghe as the Prime Minister, the dust looked settled as far as the political crisis was concerned. Instead, it was a relative lull. The crisis is not yet over as the UNP is struggling to finalise the list of Cabinet Ministers.
It is true by all means that the path is cleared for the UNP to form the Government. Be that as it may, it would not be a smooth sailing for the UNP to run the Government under a President who is now even more hostile towards it. Also, this UNP-led Government would not in anyway be as strong as it used to be before October 26.
Before October 26, the UNP led unity Government enjoyed a clear cut majority in Parliament. In fact, it fell short of a few seats only to muster the two-thirds. Today, it is bound to lead a Government that has to depend on the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in the opposition for crucial support as and when the situation demands.
The UNP faces some electoral compulsions in counting on the TNA to run the Government. Giving into the demands put forward by the TNA will be an unpopular move in the Sinhala majority electorates of the country. The release of the LTTE suspects commonly called Tamil political prisoners and the evolution of a constitutional package are among the TNAs demands for it to support the UNP while being in the opposition during this trying time. Yet, for the UNP, it involves a political cost to implement these demands. Against the backdrop, some UNP MPs such as Patali Champika Ranawaka insist that it should win over at least ten MPs from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) to clinch the simple majority of 113 in the House. 
It is nothing new that the MPs cross the floor of the House to join another party. It happened both during the last and the present Parliament.
The three UPFA MPs- Gamini Wijith Wijeyamuni Zoysa, Lakshman Seneviratne and Indika Bandaranayake- crossed the floor of the House on Tuesday to join hands with the UNP. The wide perception is that such crossovers are triggered by horse trading. The MPs are lured to switch allegiance from one party to another through the offer of cash inducements. One cannot rule it out. In fact, it has marred South Asian politics today, let alone Sri Lanka.
All  in all, it is not the sole reason that compelled parliamentarians to break ranks with their parties and join another in politics. For them, there are other reasons as well. For a parliamentarian, the biggest concern is to get re-elected to Parliament over and over again until they retire from politics. According to the present electoral system of proportional representation, an electoral district returns a certain quota of members to Parliament. Then, each political party and independent group in the fray have to fight for a limited number of slots. When the political situation in the country develops or unfolds, some serving parliamentarians get well entrenched in politics and are able to consolidate their electoral holds. Alongside, there are others who are pushed to the margin triggering concerns about their inability to be re-elected from their present political party of choice. Under such circumstances, these MPs who sense their imminent defeat tend to look for opportunities in another party. Accordingly, crossovers are sometimes a phenomena triggered by such concerns.
As for the latest crossovers, it appeared to be the most plausible reason. MP Gamini Wijitha Wijeyamuni Zoysa contested the election from the Moneragala district last time. He could not get elected, but was later nominated to Parliament on the National List of the UPFA. It is difficult for him to get elected from that side next time either. As a result, it would have compelled him to look for an opportunity with the UNP this time. The same goes for Seneviratne and Bandaranayake.
The UNP faces some electoral compulsions in counting on the TNA to run the Government. Giving into the demands put forward by the TNA will be an unpopular move in the Sinhala majority electorates of the country
However, the UNP is at a loss on how to accommodate these crossovers in the Cabinet. According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the size of the Cabinet has to be restricted to 30 except in the case of a national government. During the last Cabinet prior to October 26, there were 32 UNPers holding Cabinet posts. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has proposed to give Cabinet posts to MPs Ravi Karunanayake and Palitha Range Bandara. It means four UNP MPs who served in the previous Cabinet should opt out to accommodate these MPs and to restrict the number of Ministers to 30.
According to UNP sources, the party initially expected its senior MPs such as Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and D.M. Swaminathan to stay away this time. But, neither of them stepped down. So, UNP MP Malik Samarawickrama, at the UNP parliamentary group meeting on Tuesday, offered to remain without a portfolio this time. Along with him, MPs Mano Ganeshan and Rishad Bathiudeen agreed to do so. Let alone, the UNP insisted that they should remain in the Cabinet as vital stakeholders of the Government.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa sounded a warning against giving Cabinet posts to those tainted with allegations of corruption and frauds. Our party has gained a bit now. We have to improve on it. We should not fall back again by appointing fraudsters to the Cabinet posts, he said.  
Ravi K insistent on Finance Ministry MP Karunanayake is adamant that he should be appointed as the Finance Minister. It is reported that he boycotted some meetings as a mark of protest over some MPs reluctance to give him the post. Most MPs dont mind him being given a Cabinet portfolio, but not the Finance Ministry. It has created an impasse in the appointment of the Cabinet Ministers.
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), headed by President Sirisena, had its Central Committee meeting on Tuesday evening. It is the first such meeting after the party severed its ties with the unity government.
Tension at SLFP CC meetingThere was tension at the meeting after some MPs such as Dayasiri Jayasekara proposed to take disciplinary action against those who teamed up with the UNP regardless of the partys decision to remain in the opposition.
MPs Duminda Dissanayake, Mahinda Amaraweera and Mahinda Samarasinghe confronted it saying there was no basis for such action. If we take such action against them, we will have to institute disciplinary action against those who obtained the membership of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), they said.
This created dissension within the SLFP with one section making the allegation against the other that it was clearing the path for the UNP to lure the SLFPers. After such tension, the SLFP, however, discussed the need to revive the party. For this purpose, a membership drive will be launched lasting one month, early next year.
Political crisis a loss for SLPP on the one hand, and a gain on the other
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is also to undertake a re-organization campaign early next year. Its population was a bit on the wane after it was forced out of power through parliamentary and judicial actions. In one aspect, the party lost a bit in terms of its popularity. At the same time, it also made gains from this whole exercise. First, its leader Mahinda Rajapaksa managed to become the Opposition Leader in Parliament. Also, it denied the UNP two-thirds majority in the House.
As the main opposition, it will also get substantial representation in the Constitutional Council that makes vital appointments in the Government sector and the judiciary. The political crisis ended with a defeat for the SLPP on the one hand, and a gain on the other.

Professionals to replace politicians
	
There remains less than a year until Sri Lanka braces for its next elections. With the recent series of political dramas that unfolded, it is no surprise for Sri Lankans to witness the advent of new parties or old alliances being reborn. That is what happened during almost all the elections that have taken place. While the most asked question who can measure up to be a politician remains debated in a country where there is no formal qualification to serve as a politician, a collective of Sri Lankan professionals, activists and artistes gathered at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) on December 17 and formed a movement called National Peoples Movement (NPM).
Absence of a feasible alternative
They emphasised that Sri Lanka as a country is eroding on multiple fronts  socially, economically and culturally. The professionals pointed out that the power of people is the strongest and it can solve almost all the burning issues in the country.
They stated that a power struggle and rivalry among main political parties may eventually pave the way for the evolution of a brutal dictatorship or even anarchy, in the absence of a feasible alternative to the people ofthe country. 
The NPM platform is a collaboration of 17-member organizations including United Professionals Movement, Deshodaya Organization, Vinivida Foundation, Lawyers for Equal Rights, Sri Lankan Engineers Association, Trustees (Gte.) Ltd, Jathika Janatha Commission, Jathika Parisarika Sanvidana Ekamuthuwa, Alliance for Political Conscience , Paramparika Ha Deshiya Waidyawarunge Ekamuthuwa, Jathika Guru Balaya, Udara Sri Lanka Organization, Independent Organization to Protect Depositors, Mihithala Mithuro Environment Development Foundation, Janatha Niyojanaye Purogami Sabhawa, AI Imam Shafi Center for Education & Development and Dambulu Govijana Vyaparaya.
The people in power have become disconnected from the citizenry. They develop interests separate and apart from the voters. They push policies that benefit themselves and harm the broader population
The members of the NPM said that the movement was formed with seven main objectives. These objectives include being an active force that empowers people to create an impactful social, economic and political transformation, build a people friendly, modern and an efficient nation free of corruption, where equity, equality, justice and respectfulness prevails, develop a national agenda/road map through an inclusive process to address the social, economic and political challenges we face, ensure the establishment of a new constitution through a wide consultative and participatory process, establish a stable environment for innovation and creativity based home grown industries, promote national unity, ethnic and religious harmony and reconciliation and finally developing a new political leadership and a political culture to build the nation by identifying most suited individuals to run for government, while retaining power with the people.
Serving instead of ruling
NPM Media Spokesman Gamini Nanda Gunawardana began his speech with a stern reminder: The people in power have become disconnected from the citizenry. They develop interests separate and apart from the voters. They push policies that benefit themselves and harm the broader population.
He believes that by being an individual pressure group, there isnt much an organisation could do in order to make a positive impact on the society and its citizens.
We have gathered here today and formed our movement not to support an individual purpose, but for a common purpose. Public representatives should serve the nation instead of ruling the nation, he said. He suggested that people of Sri Lanka should no longer wait till politicians fulfill their election promises. Responding to a question, Gunawardana said that the members of the NPM may contest upcoming elections.
Transformation
Public interest lawyer Nagananda Kodituwakku believes that the Sri Lankan political system has become extremely corrupt and very unfair leaving people with no faith in it. This sorry state of affairs reflects what we have become. It is just a system of Government, which we built, and which we could replace. So why dont we replace it with something better he asked.
He pointed out that all the 225 MPs in Parliament dont serve public interests, but that most of them are self-serving. He was of the view that those who have offered support to the NPM are not exploiters of public money and resources.
People in both South and North have the same problems despite their ethnic differences. All like-minded individuals and organisations are invited to join us and transform the present political system to a more democratic and participatory system of governance, he said.
Sri Lankan women
Representing the females, Samitha Ethuldora Arachchi, a psychologist, stressed that although Sri Lankan women have been given all the rights, they have unfortunately failed to create a strong and effective ideology in the society.
Sri Lankan women have to break barriers and come forward to protect the country from evils just like they protect their babies, she said.
Ethuldora Arachchi affirms that Sri Lankan women have to not only fight for their own rights but also must join hands with organizations such as the NPM to ensure a better country for the future generations.
It is just a system of Government, which we built, and which we could replace. So why dont we replace it with something better
Stand tall
Meanwhile, National Organizer of the NPM Palitha Abeywardana said that the professionals who make their voices heard only when they need to obtain vehicle permits and salary increments, should feel ashamed. We were waiting to remove the tag professionals and go right into the people as a peoples movement. For years, we have been working on this concept, he said. Abeywardana stressed that the NPM isnt another so-called trade union that works on a personal agenda.
The speakers said that Sri Lankan leaders who have ruled over 70 years since independence, have at various points in the history ventured to amend the Constitution with the basic intention of ensuring their political longevity and constitutional loopholes for their personal benefits, while eroding the rights of each citizen. 
They also said that the leaders have also failed to manage not only the economy, geopolitical relations, socio-economic advancement of the populace, but also the preservation of the countrys environment and culture. They also invited other professional organisations to join them in co-creating the NPM to fulfill its seven objectives.

SLs rocky road to restoring democracy Where do we stand today
	
Sri Lanka experienced52 days of chaos which ended up on a rather smooth note thanks to the judiciary. However, the on-going recovery period seems challenging. This is because it has much to do with shame, economic losses and abuse of power.
Sri Lanka, has now come under the spotlight and the international community is being observant as to how fast it will recover. As the clock ticks , there seems to be a delay in appointing the cabinet; once again raising doubts among onlookers. But, on a rather positive note, the crisis period offered an opportunity for all citizens to voice out for their rights; which was in the name of democracy. And the fight continues.
Hence, the Daily Mirror spoke to a few individuals, who actively protested to bring the country back to normalcy, to find out what they now expect from those who will wield power in a few days time.
Prez likely to interrupt RWs agenda
-Wijesooriya
Following the Supreme Court ruling, President Sirisena had to reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) as the Prime Minister, but he specifically mentioned that he didnt want to work with him, recalled Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya, Convener of the Movement for a Just Society. This is a warning that he will not allow RW and the cabinet to function smoothly. Therefore it is highly likely that he would interrupt the agenda of the yet-to-be established government and try to prove that RW cannot do anything. We are already witnessing a delay in the appointment of the cabinet and ministerial portfolios, said Prof.Wijesooriya.
A politicians responsibility is to win the hearts of the public and stay clear of allegations
Prof. Wijesooriya further said that the United National Front and the Prime Minister should adopt the criteria suggested by Prof. Siri Hettige in appointing cabinet ministers. He has drafted this document on a scientific basis, so that politicians with less allegations and accusations could be appointed to their posts. In this backdrop nobody can hope for any development until the crisis situation is fully settled, he added.
Referring to the appointment of cabinet ministers, he further said that neither the seniority nor the close ties between them and the premier should be an added advantage for these appointments. Those who have failed in their duties should be debriefed and opportunities should be given to young blood. A politicians responsibility is to win the hearts of the public and stay clear of allegations or accusations if he or she wants to have a successful career in politics.
he said.
The Presidential system doesnt suit our country
-Viyangoda
We recently faced the biggest challenge after 2015, said Gamini Viyangoda, co-convener of the movement Puravasi Balaya. The President said that he will not support the PM and therefore it is clear that he would not allow the government to run smoothly. In this situation we cannot talk about development or the way forward. If they dont compromise we will have to go in for a Presidential Poll. Somehow it has been proved that the Presidential system doesnt suit our country. After 1978 the past few weeks have dragged the country back to square one. he said.
The President said that he wont support the PM and therefore it is clear that he would not allow the government to run smoothly
People of this country deserve better
-Wickramasinghe
As far as many of us are concerned, the fight for democracy is not over yet, said Aritha Wickramasinghe a lawyer by profession. Over the last 50 days of this crisis, many of us were on the streets demanding the upholding of our Constitution, the rule of law and a fresh political culture. The Constitution is at the very heart of our Republic but we are deprived of our rights and freedom. People expect those responsible for this attack on the very foundation of our country to be held accountable for their actions. The Supreme Court was very clear in its judgment that no one is above the law. We expect our representatives in Parliament to take note of the Supreme Court judgment and to take action against all persons responsible for unconstitutional acts. We also demand a new political culture. Many people thought this would have happened beginning in 2015, but clearly it hasnt. People are tired of constantly being given a raw deal by their politicians. The people of this country deserve better, he opined.
We expect politicians to take note of the Supreme Court judgment and to take action against those responsible for unconstitutional acts
Time for politicians to uphold rights of citizens
- Ruwanthie De Chickera
During the period of the Constitutional crisis, several groups took to the streets and protested in the name of democracy. Among these groups was a protest done by a collective of women representing various fields of expertise. The women joined during a heavy shower and handed over a petition to the President himself. Airing her views on the need to restore democracy, renowned dramatist Ruwanthie de Chickera, who was also an active participant at this protest by women, said that as Sri Lankans we are a long way from achieving democracy. It is a long process. Politicians are still not held accountable for democracy. They are enjoying impunity, perks and benefits. But it is important to note that everybody is equal before the law. However, what is significant is that after a long period of being inactive or partially active, minority groups have started to fight for democracy. All citizens saw how easy it is for politicians to create chaos overnight and how shaky our foundations of democracy are. They have seen how fragile our democracy is and now they have begun to claim it as their own right. Now, different people are willing to fight for their principles. said de Chickera.
She further said that the crisis isnt over yet. The citizens have to continue with holding politicians accountable for democracy. We dont have a constitutional crisis anymore, but we now have a crisis in terms of democracy. It is a severe crisis in terms of leadership and governance. We saw how citizens stood by politicians during the period of the Constitutional crisis. Now that it has been solved, we have to question whether the politicians will standby the citizens in bringing about democracy. It would be interesting to see if they would continue with upholding the rights of the citizens. Every one who took to the streets had undertaken risks. There was a chance that people whom we were protesting against would have returned to power,she said.
We saw how citizens stood by politicians during the period of the Constitutional crisis. Now that it has been solved
She further said that we have a morbid culture of politics. The next steps depend on whether the politicians and the citizens would work together rather than against each other. Politicians have to show that they are responsible, decent and humble and are ready to accept valid criticisms against them. They should have the humility, honesty and integrity to acknowledge change. But if they dont do that, people will have to protest against them, de Chickera said.
Public should engage in civil rights activism
- Chandrasekaram
The main objective of protesting was to restore democracy rather than protect politicians or their interests said Visakesa Chandrasekaram, a fiction, screenplay and creative writer, a film director who is also practicising as a human rights lawyer, a community legal educator and a diversity practitioner in both Sri Lanka and Australia. The public therefore should engage in civil rights activism. The crisis situation was an ideal opportunity for civil rights movements to participate in protests, write opinion pieces and engage in public discussions. The distance between communities has also minimized due to technology and the effective use of social media. There is another task vested upon the people. That is, as much as we allocate our time to sleep, for recreation and other purposes I think we also need to allocate our time for civil rights activism. If it doesnt happen it will not become a priority for the people, said Chandrasekaram.
When asked what immediate measures have to be taken to restore democracy, Chandrasekaram said that it is important to bring about stability in the government. They should elect the cabinet soon. Then they should move a motion in Parliament to abolish the Executive Presidency and it should be done within the next six months. Its important to ensure the rule of law. People now have some faith on the judiciary after its judgment. The law is equal to everyone and all criminals-those involved in the Constitutional conspiracy, those involved in the bond scam and other abductions and murders- should be punished. he affirmed. Chandrasekaram said that in the long-term, it is important to establish the independence of the public service. Everybody from the labourer to the executive officer should be appointed on a merit-based system. It is also important to ensure the independence of quasi-judiciary institutions and while doing all that we need to awaken the public, he concluded.

Solidarity could lift people out of poverty
	
After more than 50 days of unprecedented political turmoil, the new United National Front government has recommitted itself to work towards its 2015 vision and goals -- a just, peaceful and all-inclusive society with interracial and inter-religious unity in diversity. Such pledges have often been made before and most people have become justifiably cynical. Thus we hope that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes government will practise what it preaches and preach only what it practises. More than ever before Sri Lanka needs political leaders who are gifted with the virtues of honesty and integrity with the grace to sincerely, sacrificially and selflessly serve the people, especially the millions who are caught up in a poverty trap. For too long, most politicians -- perhaps corrupted by power and the resultant greed to get more -- have been doing business in politics. This must stop and stern legal action taken against those found to be involved in bribery, corruption or other frauds.
These reflections come to mind as the world today marks the United Nations International Human Solidarity Day with the world body saying the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) agenda is centred on the people and the planet, underpinned by human rights and supported by a global partnership determined to lift people out of poverty, hunger and disease. It will be thus built on a foundation of global cooperation and solidarity.
According to the UN, today we need to celebrate our unity in diversity. It is a day for governments to remember their commitments to international agreements, a day to raise public awareness of the importance of solidarity, a day to encourage debate on the ways to promote solidarity for the achievement of the SDGs including poverty eradication and a day of action to encourage new initiatives for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources.
Solidarity is identified in the Millennium Declaration as one of the fundamental values of international relations in the 21st Century, wherein those who either suffer or benefit least deserve help from those who benefit most. Consequently, in the context of globalization and the challenge of growing inequality, strengthening of international solidarity is indispensable. Therefore, the UN General Assembly, convinced that the promotion of the culture of solidarity and the spirit of sharing is important for combating poverty, proclaimed December 20 as International HumanSolidarity Day.
Through initiatives such as the establishment of the World Solidarity Fund to eradicate poverty and the proclamation of International Human Solidarity Day, the concept of solidarity was promoted as crucial in the fight against poverty and in the involvement of therelevant stakeholders. 
The concept of solidarity has defined the work of the UN since the birth of the organization. The creation of the UN drew the people and the nations of the world together to promote peace, human rights and social and economic development. The organization was founded on a basic premise of unity and harmony among its members expressed in the concept of collective security that relies on the solidarity of its members to unite to maintain international peace and security, the UN says. But there are major questions as to what extent these goals have been achieved, especially in this era of populism and extreme nationalism. For instance we regularly see United States President Donald Trump scoffing at the UN goals and even describing the vital issue of climate change as a Chinese hoax.
In Sri Lanka where people of four major religions live, we have the potential to achieve unity in diversity, poverty alleviation and make significant progress in the battle against global warming or climate change. What is lacking is good political leadership and example and we hope we will see that in the coming year or two when provincial, presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held.

## Title: Sri Lankas first experience with Singles Day successful!
## Section: Press Releases

Sri Lankas first experience with Singles Day successful!
	
Sri Lanka recently experienced the worlds biggest online sale, 11.11. or Singles Day. The event was introduced for the first time to the country by Daraz, the fast growing online retail platform. With over 2 years in Sri Lanka, and with the acquisition of the platform by e-commerce giant Alibaba, Daraz has played a pivotal role in introducing global trends, events and technology to the online retail industry.
Following 11.11., Bart Van Dijk  Country Manager of Daraz Sri Lanka, stated that the sale was an overpowering success with a record of approximately 60,000 orders and LKR 160 + million worth in value. The numbers are significant for a market the size of Sri Lanka and indicates the growth of the online retail market. Daraz has been growing 300% YoY and this has definitely had an impact in the success of 11.11., commented Bart.
The campaign was not only driven through traditional media but had the support of social media influencers creating their own content for the sale. The technology such as the personalized mobile app and the partnerships with leading banks like HSBC, Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Seylan Bank ensured flexibility, better offers and an enhanced shopping experience to customers.
Features such as the Mystery Boxes -gift boxes that the brands were able to create for their customers where they offered great discounts - and exciting bundle offers, especially for electronic items, created a hype much before the sale went live. Social Media Influencers added their worth by making their Top 10 picks in their own relevant fields of tech gadgets, fashion and lifestyle brands.
Bart made and interesting observation in terms of the trends in shopping behavior and purchases. We saw that the Chinese, mid to high range mobile phone sellers were performing much better in their category. This is generally a Huawei and Samsung market but we noticed more traction coming for Chinese brands. This is also something we can expect to happen in the next few years, he stated. However, overall there was a decrease in purchases; the average order value was lower than usual. This could be mainly due to the current economic situation. People were buying more products but at low values, he added.
Daraz.lk is no stranger to hosting large campaigns, having introduced the Black Friday concept for the first time to Sri Lanka two years ago. However, the team saw that 11.11. was going to be a bigger challenge as the concept was not familiar in the country. With much excitement and the added inspiration that generates from the figure of Jack Ma and Alibaba, the sale received a highly positive response. The fact that Alibaba initiated 11.11 had a lot to do with the acceptance. What Alibaba does well is to add the entertainment factor to these sales, than offer mere blanket discounts. In other markets, it is a gala event with singers, artists and fashion shows. We look forward to bring this aspect to Sri Lanka as well to make it a much more fun shopping experience, explained Bart.
Speaking about their plans for the coming year Bart emphasized that they would focus on expanding the logistical hubs by increasing it from the current 14 to over 20 across the country. A swipe-on-delivery option will be added, which will be exclusive to the DEX (Daraz Express) rider base. In addition Daraz will consider bringing in a global collection to fill the gaps of demand. This will lead to curated products by both local and global sellers, ensuring that customers will have what they really want.
The development of local sellers to succeed in the e-commerce industry will continue in forms of physical workshops through the Daraz hubs and a few initiatives with the state education sector.
Daraz has become a catalyst in introducing global trends to Sri Lanka and setting international standards for selling online is one. As these standards are accepted globally, it becomes beneficial to other e-commerce platforms as well as start-ups. For instance, the Daraz University is an ideal knowledge source for the whole industry. In a bid to push for a cashless society, the company will also consider activating the debit card base so that Daraz will be open for transactions with anyone who has a bank card.
Addressing a key factor that online retail has had to overcome through the years, which is trust, Bart explains that it is essential to be transparent about the products and where they come from. Explaining further he said, There are 2 ways of rating a seller  operations is one, where we monitor factors like delivery time and the number of product returns. The other and most valuable metric is the customer review. Daraz sellers are given ratings based on their performance and reviews. This genuine feedback builds credibility amongst customers and is a decisive measurement in terms of the exposure the seller enjoys on the platform.
Daraz in general is transforming from a start-up to a much more mature company. Therefore we should expect better results from ourselves and we have set our targets higher to ensure that we provide a service that is as positive as possible to the customer, concluded Bart.

Takas.lk Flagship Store launched in Colombo 4
	
Sri Lankas most trusted and innovative e-commerce platform, Takas.lk, has launched its Flagship Store, to enable its customers to enjoy a seamless shopping experience that encompasses online, mobile and bricks-and-mortar options.
The opening of the Takas.lk Flagship Store featured a number of high profile business leaders including Takas (Pvt) Ltd board members and investors as well as several of its main suppliers.
Located in the heart of Colombo, at 288 Galle Road, Bamabalapitya, this new Flagship Store is a first for Takas.lk, marking its shift to an omni-channel, or multichannel, sales approach that will undoubtedly provide even more convenience and benefits for its customers.
Takas.lk, being the largest pure play e-commerce site in Sri Lanka, is excited to explore the omni-channel experience and its many potential benefits to our loyal customers and partners. We feel the store concept will aid in online consumers being confident in terms of online buying, so the trust element will definitely increase, said Lahiru Pathmalal, Co-Founder/CEO of Takas (Pvt) Ltd.
Elaborating further, Mr. Pathmalal noted, The omni-channel experience has been a huge success in India. And we have been looking and learning from India for some time, and when possible we have adapted and deployed innovations we think will work in Sri Lanka. We did this with Cash on Delivery, which has proven to be a great success for Takas.lk.
Established in 2012 by Mr. Pathmalal and Co-Founder/COO Murtaza Moosajee and Dilendra Wimalasekara, Takas.lk quickly distinguished itself as Sri Lankas largest online shopping mall.
Today, Takas.lk has consolidated its position as the most innovative e-commerce provider in the local marketplace, while also having evolved into one of the markets most dynamic players. Further, Takas.lk has repeatedly outperformed its competitors in terms of delivering best-in-class innovations, as well as truly sensational promotions and offers, which have proved popular among both merchants and end-consumers.
Following the launch of its Flagship Store, Takas.lk plans to roll out similar stores in all major towns across Sri Lanka. Around 6% of the revenue for Takas.lk currently comes from Monaragala, and we also do really well in Gampaha and in other key local markets. Really any town has the potential to be very successful so we are looking at all locations, revealed Mr. Pathmalal. 
Known for its many local firsts, such as being the first to introduce Cash On Delivery and even tokenized Credit Card (one-click) payment options, Takas.lk currently delivers more than 13,000 high quality products, ranging from electronics to furniture, across its omni-channel platforms.
Takas.lk is widely regarded as one of the most innovative companies both locally and internationally. In 2018, the Takas eCommerce Solutions (TES) arm of Takas (Pvt) Ltd was also introduced, to help other e-commerce and logistics companies automate.

When an unchanging man promises change
	
Ranil Wickremesinghe (left) taking oaths as premier for the 5th time
The United National Part (UNP) has gone from strength to strength reminding the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of an old saying united we stand, divided we fall.
The UNP was in tatters many years ago when a sizable section of the party rebelled against its Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was on December 16 (Sunday) sworn in as Prime Minister for the fifth time.
Being a shrewd politician Wickremesinghe survived all that, including a series of election defeats by the Green Party, to hold on to the party leadership. Later on, probably due to the maturity of other Green Party members, the rebel movement within the UNP died a natural death. During the recent 52-day political crisis witnessed in Sri Lanka, UNP members stood behind its leader like never before; showing that they couldnt be bought over for money. This was a time when one parliamentarian who showed an interest in crossing over to strengthen the Rajapaksa-Sirisena regime was allegedly offered as much as rupees 500 million. The UNP showed through its actions that democracy cant be undermined and is invaluable.
Ranil has not changed as a person regardless of whether he is in the government or the opposition
	Sirisenas national thinking policies were often undermined by the Western influenced Wickremesinghe
	The prime minister isnt a people friendly person to obtain such a large number of votes
Today the SLFP can only envy the Green Party. SLFP parliamentarian Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, who has decided to sit on the side of the Government, told Parliament about the woes of the SLFP. But whats important at this juncture is that Zoysa along with Lakshman Senewiratne and Indika Bandaranayake choosing to throw their weight behind the Government to be formed by the newly appointed Premier Wickremesinghe. Zoysas shift in alliance may not be because he fancies Wickremesinghe, but could be largely influenced by the fact that he felt that the country was suffering due to the selfish motives of politicians and something had to be done about it.
The individual who caused this chaos, Sirisena, gives all indication that he would give the Wickremesinghe led government a hard time. The president has informed all SLFPers not to accept posts in the Cabinet to be formed. Sirisena has said that he would not take disciplinary action against any SLFPers who offer support for a UNP led alliance that intends forming the new government. But Sirisena, with his back to the wall, can at this time be a ruthless individual. Though the 19th A clips some of his executive powers he can annul certain decisions taken in Parliament. A good example is when he annulled the approval of an increase in the salaries of Government ministers by over 200%.
What Ranil sees
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe clash leaves a trail which if closely viewed shows that there is a confrontation between the thinking of the elite and those from the village. Sirisenas national thinking policies were often undermined by the Western influenced Wickremesinghe who believes in the thinking that the brains of foreign nations would bring the much needed solutions to the islands economic woes. A good example is the hurriedly signed Free Trade Agreement Sri Lanka entered into with Singapore. Many are of the opinion that this FTA would not provide any significant or worthwhile benefit to Sri Lanka.
Sirisena continues to warn that foreign powers are looking for an opportunity to get involved in the affairs of Sri Lanka. This is nothing new given that Sri Lankas geographic location is so important to countries like India, China, Japan and the USA. But Wickremesinghe has seen what Sirisena has failed to see in the form of an opportunity that has arisen for Sri Lanka to develop its country through the brains and finances of other nations. But whats of concern are the attempts by Wickremesinghe to sell off government assets to foreign nations.
Now Wickremesinghe is busy getting ready to form a new alliance by the name Democratic National Front (DNF). He claims that he has the support of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, All Ceylon Makkal Congress, Jathika Hela Urumaya, Tamil Progressive Alliance and some members of the SLFP who are threatening to break away.
Wickremesinghes idea to form an alliance is probably backed by the realization that the UNP alone would not in the future have the numbers to form the majority in Parliament. The UNP badly needs the support of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). But the TNA has put its support on hold pending receiving the UNPs approval or consent regarding the many demands by the Tamil Ealam Liberation Organization; a constituent party of this alliance.
Wickremesinghes idea to form an alliance is probably backed by the realization that the UNP alone would not in the future have the numbers to form the majority in Parliament
If the Wickremesinghe initiated NDF is formed and the goal of mustering two thirds of the votes in parliament is achieved, it would help abolish the executive presidency. If this happens Sirisena would be reduced to a puppet. The shrewd thinking of Wickremesinghe unfortunately seems to fuel his ambition to retain power for ever; rather than lift the country from the financial mess it is in. The large crowds that gathered at Galle Face green on Monday (December 16) dont really say much about the real support for Wickremesinghe. . Much of the crowd looked like they were there on the promise that they would be well looked after later in the evening.
But Wickremesinghe has got the approval he most needs. And that has come from the European Union, United States of America, China, Canada and Australia. These foreign forces have commended Sri Lanka for peacefully resolving its political crisis keeping in accordance with the Constitution. And that Sri Lanka is now headed by Wickremesinghe and eventually hed take ownership of the compliments paid to this countrys legislators by the outside world.
Better living conditions
Wickremesinghe early this week promised the people of this country better living conditions in the future. For this to materialize the government to be formed must curtail extravagant spending by ministers and introduce a reasonable tax policy.
Wickremesinghe has not changed as a person regardless of whether he is in the government or the opposition. He is accused of wanting luxuries which is confirmed by the fact that the Yahapalana regime wanted more perks for ministers. He also sees his real opponent, Mahinda Rajapaksa, being the same unchanged person he is; both sharing one common trait and that is to hold on to power forever.
As far as ambition is concerned Wickremesinghe does not seem to be short of fuel. But given his age and the capacity needed for a seasoned politician to understand the real needs of the people, Wickremesinghe has really fallen short of expectations.
