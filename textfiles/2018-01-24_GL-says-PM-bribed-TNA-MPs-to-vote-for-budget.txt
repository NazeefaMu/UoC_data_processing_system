The Bribery Commission should probe the allegations made by MP Sivashakthi Anandan that 15 Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs had been bribed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's Ministry of National Policy and Economic Affairs, the Joint Opposition said today.

SLPP chairman G.L. Peiris told a news conference that with regard to the MP’s claims they were bribed to vote in favour of the Budget and that each TNA MP was paid Rs.20 million.

“The BC should probe these allegations, or else the President should take action against this incident. If not, the JO itself would file a case in this regard,” he said.

Mr. Peiris said this incident was as an insult to Parliament.

Meanwhile, he said according to the Constitution, the President did not have the authority to manage the country’s economy.

“All the ministries related to the economy are under the control of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and the UNP ministers. To make this statement a reality, he should take control of ministries such as Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. Otherwise, it will be a mere statement,” Mr. Peiris said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
