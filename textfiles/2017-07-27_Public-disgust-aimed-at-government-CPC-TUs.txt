Public disgust aimed at government, CPC TUs


	

People were greatly inconvenienced due to the strike carried out by Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation (CPC) Trade Union for the second day yesterday (26).

When Daily Mirror reporters visited several filling stations in Colombo they witnessed lengthy queues with motorists been made to wait for hours to get fuel.

Most of them said that they blamed the government for allowing them to suffer in such a manner; "What is the government doing without taking immediate actions to find a solution to this issue. It is utter nonsense,” they said.

One of them explained that he had been waiting in a queue to pump fuel since morning. "I request the government to bring an end to this problem and end this strike. Otherwise, we are the ones who are suffering, not the authorities,”

"I have been unable to attend to my duties both at my house and at the company owing to this strike, at the end of the day, we are not earning money but government officials are still making money" another person remarked. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
