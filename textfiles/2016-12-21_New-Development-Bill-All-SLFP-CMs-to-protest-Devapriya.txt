Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya today said that all Chief Ministers of the SLFP will protest the Development (Special Provisions) Bill as the Bill proposes to snatch certain powers away from Chief Ministers vested in them under the Constitution (13th Amendment).

He added that they also could not agree to the creation of a Super Minister that violates the Constitution.

He expressed hopes that Northern Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran would also fall in line with other Chief Ministers.

“The SLFP has no objection whatsoever for the reforms introduced to accelerate the development programme, the establishment of a new institution to attract Foreign Direct Investment, promote tourism and revitalise the industrial sector and new policy decision taken for the benefit of the country, Chief Minister Devapriya said.

Addressing the media at his office today, Chief Minister Devapriya said however, the Chief Ministers of any province could not agree to the move to attempt to transfer the Constitutional powers vested in the Provincial Councils to a newly established body under the proposed Development (Special Provisions) Bill.

Though the Western Province did not come under any new establishment, five Development Boards have been proposed under the new Bill to bring all other 8 Provincial Councils under them namely Central, Wayamba, Eastern, Southern and Northern Development Boards respectively which we cannot agree, Mr. Devapriya stressed.(Sandun Jayasekara)
