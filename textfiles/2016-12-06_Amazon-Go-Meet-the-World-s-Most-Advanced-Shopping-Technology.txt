Amazon Go: Meet the World’s Most Advanced Shopping Technology


	



Amazon Go is a new kind of store with no checkout required that means you take the products you want, and go! No lines, no checkout. (No, seriously.)

Amazon created the world’s most advanced shopping technology so you never have to wait in line. They call this shopping technology as “Just Walk Out Shopping” experience.

Consumers simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want, and go! No checkout lines or anything. 

This checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. 

“Just Walk Out” technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, Amazon will charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. That’s super neat.



Amazon unveiled a video about the new physical store that uses the Just Walk Out technology. The new shop will sell a mix of "grocery essentials" and ready-made meals. It is confirmed that the first store will be open in Seattle on early 2017, where Amazon is headquartered.
