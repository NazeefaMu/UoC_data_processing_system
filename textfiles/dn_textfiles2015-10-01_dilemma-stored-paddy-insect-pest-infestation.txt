Dilemma of stored paddy: insect pest infestation

Needles to introduce paddy as the source of our stable food, rice. However, it is quite sorrowful to learn that Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a remarkable loss of stored paddy due to infestation by insects. (See Table)
Present status of paddy farming in Sri Lanka
As the paddy production is seasonal, it is inevitable that the surplus production needs to be stored to meet the demand during the off seasons. Alternatively if paddy is imported, still needs to follow a storage period until released to the market. Although stored paddy is a durable agricultural commodity with low moisture content of about 13%, still it is subjected to deterioration by various external factors.
Studies conducted in Sri Lanka have revealed that nearly 80% of the storage losses of grains are due to insect attack. These losses include the loss of weight, nutrients and germ inability; poor smell and taste; grain discolouration; aggregation of grains; development of fungus; and finally the economic loss due to the reduced market value. This emphasizes as to why insects of stored paddy needs to be treated with top priority. Cleaned, well dried paddy is stored by the farmers either in bags of in bags of in bulk and by adopting good hygiene, the grain is kept insects free. However, in Sri Lanka, the use of insecticides for protection of stored grain in restricted to a small farming population.
As the damage is high, it is important how a farmer, trader or any other grain-handling personnel can detect the insect damage. This, of course, varies with the situation. For instance, a severe insect infestation in bag storage can be identified by a typical sound created when insects move out of the grain mass across the poly sack lining and land on poly sack surfaces. Also the insects are present outside the bags that contain grains. Insects can also be observed in the cracks and crevices of the warehouse.
The pest management entangles with the economy. It needs to be implemented in such a way that revenue gained by attending pest management needs to be higher than amount of money spent on management practices. If the density of insects is not that high, it may not be practicable to apply chemicals at that particular time but needs to monitor the fluctuation of insect population to see if it reaches the threshold level of damage within comparatively a short period due to high reproduction rate of insects. This population increase, of course, is backed by the environmental conditions which differ continuously. High temperature and high conditions favour the increase in the insect population density.
Identification of different insect species is also important as certain stake holders might be unaware of these insects. Rice weevil, lesser grain borer, Saw-toothed grain beetle, Red flour beetle and gain moth are main insect species that infest stored paddy.
Insect species
Rice weevil – Sitophilus oryzae (L)
Adult
about 2.3-4.5 mm in size
easy to identify by the long, narrow snout in the head
reddish brown black weevils
conspicuous, four, light orange-yellow colour spots on front wings
adult lives 4-12 months
Larva
Develop and feed inside the grain kernel undetected from outside
Lesser grain borer – Rhyzopertha dominica (F)
Adult
cylindrical body, 2-3 mm
shiny body, dark brown or black
front wings bear rows of small punctures
long lived (about three years)
live on grain surfaces or inside kernels, more active in the evening
one adult female lays 200-500 eggs loosely attached to grain, difficult to observe with the naked eye
Larva
Creamy white in colour and bear legs
Lives inside grain kernel
Angoumois grain moth_ Sitotroga cerealella
Adult
light, yellow brown, 8-10 mm long
fore wings pale brown-orange and often with a pale black spot in the distal half
wing span 10-15 mm
hind wings have a long fringe of hairs on the posterior margin
hairs on wings are longer than half the width of the wing
female lays tiny eggs singly or in clumps on the grain; impossible to observe eggs by the naked eye
Upon the egg hatching, the larvae bore into the grain
Pupa
Pupa lives inside the grain
Adults emerge from the infested seeds; emergence holes can be observed on the grains
Damaged seeds
Besides these species, the grain mites also attack stored paddy. All these insects and mites are small (about 3-4 mm), and hence may not be easily detected. Some insect species spend their life stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) inside the grain and makes it more difficult to detect. These insects are long lived (more than one year except the moths) and one insect female adult produces large number of eggs (a few hundreds) during its life time. These features aggravate the damage done by the alleged insects, and until destroyed the insects continue their role to destroy the stored paddy.
What can we do to reduce this damage?
Synthetic chemical has to be used is when the insect population is increased at a higher rate which is difficult to be suppressed by non-chemical methods. There are steps that we can adopt to prevent the insects being infested into to stored paddy/other grains. These include cleaning of the store before the intake of grains, clean the wooden structures on which the paddy is stacked, use of clean packing materials, drying of grains well before being stored, proper maintenance of a store, regular inspection of stored paddy. These initial steps may hinder the insect population build up and consequently the necessity of pest management. Margosa and Citrus leaves are kept in the “Bins” or bags to repel the insects. Wood ash obtained from the kitchen is mixed with paddy by some farmers in addition to the use of leaves. Certain farmers resort to insecticidal sprays on the surface of bags and for that purpose the insecticide “Actellic 50” EC is used. Besides the emulsifiable concentrate some farmers use actellic dust to protect bagged grain from insect. However, if the insect population is built up to higher levels, treatments may be necessary. Actellic 50% EC which contains the active ingredient, Pirimiphos – methyl is applied at a dilution of 1:150 as high volume sprays on the surface of bags and the entire warehouses.
Pirimiphos Methyl 50% EC 50 ml/4.5 l water for 100 m2 surface area of the storage bags (poly sacks). Spray insecticide in the evening.
Phoxim 500g/1 EC – 31 ml/10 l water. Treat surface of walls and floor at 5-10l/100 m2. Spray insecticide in the evening Bags should be turned be turned inside out and sprayed insecticide and air dried before use.
This treatment reduces the population of insects considerably. Spraying is done at least once in 3 weeks. In addition to spraying, warehouse is fogged with Actellic 50 EC at a dose of 120-240 ml per 4 liters of diesel. If the insect population cannot be reduced by fogging, the grain is fumigated by using phosphine gas provided in situ by Magnesium Phosphide plates and Aluminum phosphide tablets. Fumigation is carried out under gas proof sheets when other pest control processes fail to achieve a reasonable level of pest control. 2-3 gram of phosphine gas per ton of grain is used as the standard dose for grain. Pirimiphos methyl is recommended as a contact insecticide and phosphine fumigation can be done by authorized personnel. The contact insecticide has a residual efficacy over a certain period wheras the fumigation by phosphine offers no lasting protection due to the absence of insecticide residues following fumigation. Therefore, for a successful and viable management of insects in stored paddy/grains, the selection and use of methods have to be addressed tactfully. There are still other insecticides at the market that have proven efficacy on these stored-product insects at the laboratory level but have not yet been recommended in Sri Lanka. Moreover, there are some pest management methods used by developed countries for stored-product pests but not yet been tested under Sri Lankan conditions due to the unavoidability of funds resulting from the poor attention given by the local agencies on this burning issue faced by the country. Therefore, it is time alternative chemicals and methods are tested and recommended to reduce this damage caused by insects to stored paddy and other food items.
