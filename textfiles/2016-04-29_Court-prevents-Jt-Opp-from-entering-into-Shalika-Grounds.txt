Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today issued an interim order preventing members of Joint Opposition or SLTB Motor Services Union from entering into the Shalika Grounds on May Day.  

Narahenpita Police told the Magistrate that holding the Joint Opposition May Day rally in an unauthorized manner would tarnish the peace in the area.    

However, the Magistrate said no order would be issued obstructing freedom of expression and speech.
