Fmr. Pres. Wijetunga’s daughter to enter politics?


	

Former President D.B. Wijetunga’s daughter Chithrani Kumari Wijetunga today said she would consider entering active politics if she receives a ‘formal’ invitation.

She was speaking to the media at a Blood Donation campaign held in front of her late father’s statue in Pilimathalawa today.

“I may not have qualifications to be a politician in Sri Lanka, but I have more than enough qualifications to be a public servant. I have no habits of lying, using abusive vocabulary, cheating the public, misusing public property and spending so much money to obtain votes. I am confident that I can launch a good political programme on behalf of the entire Kandy District,” she said. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
