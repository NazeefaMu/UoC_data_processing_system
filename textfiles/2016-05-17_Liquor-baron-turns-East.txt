Liquor baron turns East


	



 

This son-in-law of a bigwig of a leading bank is a business tycoon who incidentally owns possibly the largest distillery in operation in the country. 

 


He is said to be now busy setting up another distillery on a 20-acre block of land in the East. His business success is mainly due to the influence being wielded by his father-in-law who is a close pal of a political heavyweight, they say.
