SC calls for Cabinet memorandum on Uma Oya

The Cabinet has taken a decision to provide certain relief to the people affected by the Uma Oya multi-purpose project, the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court yesterday.
Deputy Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe appearing for the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that the Cabinet of Ministers has taken a decision to provide certain relief, including a water supply project and providing compensation to the people whose houses were damaged owing to the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose Project.
Accordingly, Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Priyantha Jayawardena ordered the AG that a copy of the Cabinet memorandum be submitted in Court on November 23.
The Supreme Court made this order sequent to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice, and four individuals who are residents of the Bandarawela area and victimized by the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose Project.
The petitioners claim that as a result of the Uma Oya project, not only have their homes and crops been destroyed, but they have lost access to clean drinking water, citing this as a violation of their fundamental rights.
Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment N. Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture, the Central Environment Authority and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in the petition. Attorney-At-Law Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the petitioners.
