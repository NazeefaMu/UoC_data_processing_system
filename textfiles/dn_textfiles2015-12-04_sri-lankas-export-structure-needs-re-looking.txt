'Sri Lanka's export structure needs re-looking'

Sri Lanka's export structure should be re- looked as it hasn't changed over the last 70 years, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Despite the fact that Sri Lanka has graduated from a poor country to a lower middle income country, Sri Lanka's export structure is one of a poor country with the SME sector contribution to total exports remaining at less than 5%.
This is in a backdrop where other low middle income countries' SME sector contributing 30-40% to the total exports.
To address this issue, Sri Lanka should capitalize on its strategic location near major Indian sea lanes and skilled human resource to specifically increase re-exports from Sri Lanka which in turn will contribute to country's GDP.
We have a long way to go. Until we get there; we are never going to par this economy, Our inability to deal with fundamental issues is a huge cost, as a result some local industries are already in crisis, minister said adding that the local export community should take immediate measures to systematically boost exports rather than solely depending on Sri Lanka's inherited colonial plantation based economy.
"Corruption is a disease. Whoever is in the government; it's a disease that needs to be treated. Corruption will make you rich today, but it will make your children poorer tomorrow." Corruption is a cancer that destroys the social fabric of the society," the Minister noted.
Wickramaratne added the government is willing to work differently, not on the basis of patronage and favours for a few, but on the basis that the government will change the system to work in the industry's favour.
