Lankan asylum-seeker cleared of indecent assault


	

A Sydney District Court jury has found Sri Lankan asylum-seeker Daxchan Selvarajah not guilty of indecently attacking a sleeping university student in her bed.

Mr Selvarajah, 24, was accused of ripping through a flyscreen door at the student's home at Macquarie University in the early hours of February 21, 2013, before molesting her in her bed.

He beamed and began wiping his eyes as he stepped from the dock on Friday morning, after the jury's foreman informed the court he and his fellow jurors had reached a not guilty verdict on all charges.

The most serious of the three charges Mr Selvarajah faced was breaking and entering and indecently assaulting the young woman, who alleged she woke to feel a hand under her pyjamas.

During a two-week trial, Mr Selvarajah had told the court he left home in the early hours to buy cigarettes from someone who he thought was a fellow Sri Lankan.

"I knew he was living in that building but I didn't know exactly which unit," he said.(9news)

"I had gotten addicted to smoking that many cigarettes, I could not stop.

"That's why I could not fall asleep."

As the jury was led from the courtroom on Friday, an elated Mr Selvarajah hugged supporters and shook hands with his lawyers.

He was not held on remand over the charges but has been kept in immigration detention since 2013 after authorities refused him an Australian visa due to the attack allegations.

It was not immediately clear whether he would walk free from court a free man or be returned to Villawood detention centre. (9news)
