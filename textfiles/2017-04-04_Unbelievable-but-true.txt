Unbelievable, but true


	



 

Antics of sons of certain purohitas in the past who led an extravagant lifestyle at public expense while throwing their weight about like ordinary thugs are well known to the people in this country. The behavior of the sons of certain present purohitas too is more or less the same if not worse as those of their past counterparts in their hay day. Given this background, one might be amazed to hear that there is a son of a powerful purohita in yahapalanaya who goes about in a three-wheeler.

 


This youngster attends his school in the city either by a hired three wheeler or by bus from his residence located close to a well-known ‘hall’ as his father has strictly forbidden the use of any official vehicle for private transport by his family members.


The purohita has not allowed his son and the other members of the family to enjoy any perk he himself is entitled to either.
