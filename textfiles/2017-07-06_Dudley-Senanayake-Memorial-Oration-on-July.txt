The 17th Dudley Senanayake Memorial Oration would be delivered by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on July 27, 2017 at the Reception Hall of Temple Trees at 5 p.m, the organisers said.

The oration is held by the Dudley Senanayake Foundation and the Friedrich Naumann Stiftung. 

“It will indeed be an historic event as both of them share the rare privilege of having been Prime Minister of Sri Lanka four times. The venue is also one which has been occupied by both of them while in office,” they said. 

The vote of thanks will be given by Ruwan Wijewardene, Minister of State for Defence. “Entrance will be by invitation,” the organisers said
