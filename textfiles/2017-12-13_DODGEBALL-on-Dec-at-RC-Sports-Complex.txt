DODGEBALL 360°on Dec. 15  at RC Sports Complex


	



‘Fun-Duh-Mental’ was started as a community service project in 2006 by the Interact Clubs of Visakha Vidyalaya and Royal College, with the aim of addressing and improving some of the pressing issues in our community and inculcating a better outlook on the unseen aspects of society. In 2008, it won the award for the best project in the avenue of community service.   

For the first time in the history of Interact District 3220, in 2015, the Fun-Duh-Mental Committee undertook the great challenge of organising an inter-club dodgeball competition, ‘Dodgeball 360°.’ 

Dodgeball is a sport common to Western nations. It is played in two teams of 10. One team stands in a circle and the opposing team from within the circle dodges the balls thrown at them. All funds raised will go to a community service project. 

On December 15 at the Royal College Sports Complex from 8.00 a.m. onwards, come and prove you’ve got the dodge in you. 

Also, if you happen to cash in your bad luck and strike out at first, don’t hesitate to enter our separate crowd matches for people of all ages starting at 1.00 p.m. onwards. 

Proceeds will be used to uplift the living standards of underprivileged children this Christmas. Registration is Rs. 200 per person.
