Mihin Lanka should not be disbanded: Arundika


	

Tourism Development Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando said today that he would request President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to shut down Mihin Lanka.

Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters yesterday Deputy Minister Fernando said shutting down Mihin Lanka was not a good idea. It is hard to create a brand name like Mihin Lanka in the airline industry and the airline had been operated as a profitable service while serving domestically,” he said.

“People with expertise in airline services should be appointed to the top posts rather than filling them with unsuitable individuals. Because of these decisions the airline sector in the country could face a severe setback,” he claimed.

“There were other investors other than SriLankan Airlines that were keen on buying Mihin Lanka. I think the action which was taken regarding Mihin Lanka is wrong, in my opinion. The decision was taken after an unfavourable report was presented by top officials to the President and the PM,” he claimed.

“Many people in the previous government have to bear the responsibility for dragging SriLankan Airlines down. It became unprofitable only after it was taken back by the government during the time the previous regime was in power. Those who were put to manage the airline ruined the airline. Three Air Buses had been sold and that money was shown as the profits earned by the airline,” the minister pointed out. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
