‘Business Athlete’ Founder CEO, Bradley Emerson recently launched his book titled ‘Role: A Diagnostic Approach to Performance’ in which he discusses a plethora of practical elements contributing to the performance of management practitioners. In the comprehensive guide, business tycoon Emerson avows that though education and experience qualify employees for the role, sustaining the performance largely depends on the external factors influencing the role and internal drivers sustaining performance. Following are several comments made by vibrant personalities on the book:

 

“Framework to ensure individual career success”

Prof. Sattar Bawany
Chairman/CEO, Centre for Executive Education (CEE Global) & Strategic Adviser, International Professional Managers Association (IPMA, UK)

“There are two things we can say with certainty about the future: it will be different and surprising. Now, more than ever, employees at all levels have to navigate unfamiliar, challenging times, a quickening pace of change, increasing expectations, and a rising tide of rapidly-evolving conditions. I highly recommend this book as it provides a framework on ‘Role – A Diagnostic approach to Performance’ for every role or job position to ensure individual career success by examining the critical elements will impact ‘performance’ from both the perspective of the employer (organisation) and the employee.” 

 

“A must-read for everyone”

Datin Malliga Subramaniam
Certified Career Coach & Senior Managing Partner, Shadowdata Software, Sdn, Bhd

“This is a must-read for everyone who aspires to progress and maintain control over what’s important with their personal development. The diagnostic approach to role breaks down winning approach to understanding any role and ace it.” 

 

 

“Behaviour comes before performance”

Peter D’Almeida
Managing Director/Chief Executive, N*able

“I found it quite fascinating because Bradley draws attention to three things during the course of the book: role, behaviour and performance. First it lays out that the role is beyond a prescriptive role, it goes beyond your job description and he makes the case that in your role there are expectations from a bunch of people whom you may not necessarily be aware of. The book takes on a very unconventional implication that behaviour comes before performance. Bradley says sometimes we behave the role even before we execute it.

He proves that those who perform are those who keep their own future in their minds. If your goals are not aligned to the company goals, either you change and conform or you quit and move on. He implies that the transition from behaviour to performance can be done through visualization and purpose. Unless you are able to make this transition, you will never be a top performer. The book is a good example which proves that we need to focus on the simple things we can do to make a meaningful change in business and in the lives of people of this country.”   

 

“Driving performance through individual ownership”

Surani Amerasinghe
Head of Human Resources, Lion Breweries PLC 

“An excellent guide to taking charge of your own destiny, both in your career and personal aspirations. A vital handbook that would assist in driving performance through individual ownership.”   

 

 

 

 

 

“I was in for a pleasant shock”

L. Chiranthi Cooray
DGM HR/Chief HR Officer, HNB PLC 

“Simple, practical and a compelling read. Having scoured through many a management and HR textbook, I picked up the manuscript ready to retire into technical reading and purely to do the honours for a friend and professional peer. I was in for a pleasant shock. I was spellbound by the clarity, simplicity and the forthrightness of the book. It didn’t leave my hand until I got to the very end. Bradley has deftly woven decades of leadership experience into an authentic prescription to cure role related dysfunctions, a malaise that strikes many leaders, professionals and organizations today. This is an excellent read for those of us who hover the corporate world, seeking new learning and solutions, what to do and not to do as leaders, provided with practical insights.” 

 

 

“Commendable knowledge guide for managers”

Dr. Qaisar Abbas - Professor of HRD and Director COMSATS University, Lahore 

“It is a novel handbook for management practitioners with multiple hats that commendably guides on diagnosing their and that of their teams’ roles for harnessing excellence in performance in organisational and personal affairs turning this challenge into a simple, precise and achievable practice. This book remarkably integrates and simplifies necessary concepts that managers need to incorporate in routine exercise for paving success towards targeted achievements, goals and self-glory.  A commendable knowledge guide for managers with multiple portfolios!”
