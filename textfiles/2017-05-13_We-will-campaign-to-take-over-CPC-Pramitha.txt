Central Provincial Council's UPFA member Pramitha Bandara Tennakoone, who relinquished his portfolio recently, said steps were being taken to change the power equation in the council.

He told journalists after the council's monthly meeting that if the ruling party members were unable to voice the concerns of the people, they would hold a protest campaign.

Mr. Tennakone is known to have often criticised the activities of the council. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
