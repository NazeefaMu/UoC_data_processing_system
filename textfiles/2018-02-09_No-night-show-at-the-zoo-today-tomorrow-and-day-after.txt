The night show at the National Zoological Gardens in Dehiwela which came to be a tourist attraction in will not be held today, tomorrow and the day after because of the Local Government Elections, Zoological Gardens Director General Dammika Malsingha said today.

She said the night show being held from 7pm to 10pm has been cancelled because the Zoo employees had been deployed for election duty.

However, the Zoo will remain open from 8.30 am to 6 pm as usual.

Ms. Malsingha said the night show not being held would not inconvenience the nocturnal animals because there is sufficient staff to attend to the feeding of the animals. 

The night show will recommence from Monday. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
