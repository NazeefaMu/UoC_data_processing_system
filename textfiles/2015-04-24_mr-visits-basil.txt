Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the Rajapaksas were not thieves and said they had taken only political decisions.
He expressed these views when he visited his brother Basil who was transferred to Colombo National Hospital (CNH) from the Prisons Hospital to which he was admitted soon after the Kaduwela Magistrate ordered that he and two others be remanded till May 5.
Mr. Rajapaksa said there was no reason to remand Basil because the allegations were over a cabinet decision.
“Various allegations have been levelled against Basil, Gotabaya, Namal, Yoshitha and me. But these allegations have to be proved in Court,” he said.
When asked about the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Mr. Rajapaksa said he did not see anything that was wrong with it and said he hoped the MPs would approve it in parliament and added that the SLFP had proposed some changes to it.
