Over 54% schools have dengue breeding sites

 
Health authorities found that over 54 percent of schools have dengue mosquito breeding sites.
In addition, 40 percent of religious institutions and 36 percent of construction sites have either dengue larvae or dengue mosquito breeding sites, Director General health Services, Dr. Palitha Mahipala said. Addressing the media at the Epidemiology Unit, he said that 5,263 dengue cases had been reported countrywide during this year and the death rate has gone down to 1.5 percent. Fifty eight dengue deaths were reported last year.
According to Dr. Mahipala, a special mosquito eradication week will commence from March 29. A three day dengue eradication programme will be held on February 11, 12 and 13 focusing on high risk MOH areas.
Health officials, members of Armed Forces etc will take part in this programme. Special attention will be paid to schools.
Dr. Mahipala pointed out that people should seek prompt medical treatment from a state hospital, if they suffer from any type of fever for more than two days. Prompt medical treatment obtained from a state hospital can save lives, because dengue patients can avoid serious complications such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome by seeking medical treatment without delay.
Patients suffering from fever should only take paracetamol and should refrain from taking any other medications or pain killers. Other medications can lead to complications such as internal bleeding, if the patient is suffering from dengue fever.
