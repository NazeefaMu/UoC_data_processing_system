Difference between precept and practice
	
A provincial body despite having a stinking drain clogged with bottles, yoghurt cups, polythene bags and tins right opposite its premises, held the other day a seminar themed Environment is Sacred on a grand scale, they say.
The guests to the seminar which had cost several lakhs of public funds were conducted to the venue of the event in a colorful procession. Presentation of awards to many schoolchildren who had won top places in environment-related competitions was a highlight of the occasion.
If the provincial body spent the several lakhs of rupees allocated for holding the seminar to clean up the stinking drain just opposite its premises, it would have been a much more meaningful contribution to the cause of environment, say the people in the area.

Diving INTO AWHOLE NEW WORLD !
	
Niluka shares her amazing story of how she turned her love for the ocean into her occupation
Niluka Damayanthi is up at 2.00 a.m. each day to prepare for the long day ahead. This entails cooking for her household which include her mother, husband and children. She also prepares snack boxes for the snorkelers or divers she would be accompanying for the day. As one of the two female snorkelers at the Kalpitiya Diving Centre, Niluka never imagined that she would turn her love for the ocean into her occupation. 
Kalpitiya is now an attractive tourist destination in the country, with its rich marine sanctuaries and diverse range of habitats which range from bar reefs, flat coastal plains, saltpans, mangroves, swamps, salt marshes and vast sand dune beaches. These provide breeding grounds for many species of fish and crustaceans. It also is home to spinner, bottlenose and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, whales, sea turtles and even the elusive dugong. 
Steady increasein local tourists
Becoming a diving instructor was no easy task for Niluka. Her husband Samith, who earned the license early on, encouraged her to follow her passion and was her main support system. She underwent training for swimming, underwater skills and techniques, safety rules and theoretically understanding the ocean current after which she was able to obtain her license. Together with Samith, she now accompanies tourist groups which consist of 6-9 persons daily during the peak tourist season which is usually from September to April. Foreign and local tourists are charged $85 each for the training, diving session and snack box she prepares. In recent years, there has been a steady increase in local tourists, which has helped them create their own website and be rated on popular travel sites. She recalls the time when Kalpitiya Bar Reef was a colourful and vibrant tourist attraction. Niluka describes it as a dive into a whole new world!. 
Samith, started diving and snorkeling at age13, and has seen the bar reef in its heyday in all its splendour. Due to human activities, such as over fishing, dynamite fishing and high-speed boats, the coral reef has gradually deteriorated over the years and has lost its beauty. Now almost 24 years later, theyre working together with local authorities and UNDP to bring this natural ecosystem back to life. 
Environmentally Sensitive Areas
In October 2015, the United Nations Development Programme in Sri Lanka (UNDP) together with the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment initiated the Enhancing Biodiversity Conservation and Sustenance of Ecosystem Services in Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) project to address these issues. Though Sri Lanka has instituted a national system of Protected Areas (PAs) to safeguard its biodiversity, many of the globally important ecosystems, habitats and species continued to remain outside protected areas and face accelerated threats. 

Since it isnt possible to safeguard the nations wide-ranging biodiversity only through protected areas, strong measures are needed to put development on a more conservation-friendly trajectory by mainstreaming biodiversity into production activities, especially under the current context of rapid urbanization and high rate of economic development in the country. 
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded project contributes to safeguarding globally significant biodiversity. Development pressures have affected the Kalpitiya bar reef, impacting the potential benefits and economic gains. 
Restoring theBar Reef
The reef was hit by El Nino in 1998 and more recently in 2016. After a study and baseline survey in 2016, UNDP together with local authorities initiated a pilot project in Kalpitiya along the Kala Oya basin. The study revealed that the bar reef had been bleached and had collapsed with the average live coral cover being less than 6%. Under the ESA project, water buoys were deployed to demarcate the area for the next 5 years, which would leave room for the corals to revive itself without human disturbance.
Niluka and Samith together with their team, regularly visit this demarcated area to observe the restoration process. They report back on temperature, ocean current patterns and other relevant information that the local authorities require to monitor this progress. As parents they believe they need to protect the Kalpitiya bar reef for the love they have both for the ocean and the future generations of children. 
As a woman from a small village, I never thought that I would be able to voice my opinion on how better to protect the ocean, and use my expertise to help the restoration process. This makes me very proud,she said.

Euro 4 standard fuel from July: CPC
	
Euro 4 emissions standard Diesel and Petrol will replace the existing Super Diesel and Petrol stocks in the market commencing July, Petroleum Resources Development Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said the first shipment of Euro 4 emissions standard Diesel and Petrol stock would arrive in the country within next two or three weeks and the first order had already been placed.
The new stocks will be introduced to the same price as the super Diesel and Petrol. Our refineries do not have the facilities and technology to make Euro 4 emissions standard fuel and it will be very costly, Mr Marasinghe said.
Therefore, the Ministry had decided to import Euro 4 emissions standard Diesel and Petrol to the country as per 2018 budget proposal. Also, the European Union (EU) had requested the government, that it was the right time to shift to Euro 4 emissions standard, he said.
One litre of Lanka Petrol 95 Octane will be sold at Rs.148.00 and Lanka Super Diesel 4 Star sold at Rs.119.00
Mr Marasinghe said the usage of Euro 4 emissions standard Diesel and Petrol in vehicles would minimise the environmental pollution.
Euro four missions standard fuel will be imported at an exorbitant cost but it will be released to the market at the subsidized rate. New imported vehicles such as Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) require the new Euro 4 standard fuel. Mr Marasinghe said.
Meanwhile, the government has decided to import vehicles which are equipped with air bags, seat belts and new emission levels commencing July 1. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Germany to host Ukraine, Russia envoys
	

DPA, 11th JUNE, 2018 - Ukraine and Russia are set to pave the way for a relaunch of conflict resolution talks in the German capital on Monday, with Germany and France serving as mediators.
Pro-Russian rebels wanting to split from Kiev in the Russian-speaking majority east of the country have been in conflict with Ukrainian government forces since 2014.
In an interview with Bild newspaper on Monday ahead of the meeting, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he didnt expect the revival of talks to be easy: Ukraine and Russias interests and views lie far apart in many areas. The talks are intended to be conducted among the foreign ministers of these four countries, Maas said on a recent visitto Ukraine.
We will not leave you alone when it comes to resolving the conflict here in the east, Maas told his Ukrainian counterpart, Pavlo Klimkin, during his visit to Ukraine at the start of the month, which included a visit to the front line in the conflict.
Maas said he hoped to negotiate a date for the start of peace talks by early July, including whether to send a UN-backed peacekeeping mission to Ukraine. Maas said he would like to organize talks in the so-called Normandy format - including Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France - aimed at implementing a peace accord agreed in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, before the German parliaments summer break, which begins July 6.

How to reduce taxes: JO accepts PMs challenge
	
The joint opposition (JO) today accepted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's challenge to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to explain how he would reduce taxes by 20 per cent if he comes to power.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said they would accept the challenge on behalf of Mr. Rajapaksa.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe continues to mislead the people by saying that Rajapaksa era loans had resulted in economic hardships. To cover up their inefficiency, the UNP-led government is resorting to their famous Goebbel's Theory and blaming others, he told a news briefing.
Rejecting reports that loans incurred during the Rajapaksa era had crippled the country's economy, the MP said the Rajapaksa government was able to gradually increase the surplus income, even after loan repayments.
Meanwhile, the MP said the amount of state loans was Rs.2 trillion when the Rajapaksa government came to power and it increased to Rs.7 trillion within ten years.However, this government had obtained loans worth Rs.4 trillion within four years, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

It's my honor
	
President Donald Trump says 'it's an honor' to be meeting with Kim Jong-un, whom he expects to have 'a terrific relationship' with now that they've been personally introduced.
'I feel really great. I feel really great,' Trump told reporters as he sat down for a meeting with Kim devoid of policy officials and only their translators. 'Were going to have a great discussion, and I think a tremendous success. It's gonna be be tremendously successful. And its an honor, and we will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt.'
Kim told the U.S. president, 'It was not easy to get here...old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles on our way forward, but we overcame all of them.'
'I think that's true,' Trump replied, shaking his counterpart's hand and making what appeared to be joke that was audible to only the two men and their translators as reporters were led out out of the room.
Trump and Kim then held private talks with only their translators for some 45 minutes before walking together along a route that provided them with another opportunity to speak to press.
'Very, very good. Excellent relationship,' Trump told a tightly-restricted group of assembled journalists.
The U.S. president ignored a question from a member of the media on denuclearization.
Moments later, Trump and Kim rejoined senior officials from both nations for a meeting that would get into the nitty-gritty of a possible nuclear disarmament deal.
'Of course there will be challenges ahead but I am ready to listen,' Kim told the U.S. president in the group setting, through a translator.
Trump told him, 'We will solve [this]. We will be successful. And I look forward to working on it with you. It will be done.'
In their very first greeting, Trump set the tone for the talks, sending Kim an outstretched hand and patting the dictator's right elbow with the other. Neither man smiled during the formal photo, taken on a red carpet in front of alternating American and North Korean flags.
As they turned the corner to head into their first set of talks, however, in an area that Trump may have thought was off camera, the U.S. leader broke into a smile as he exchanged quiet words with Kim and another handshake that lasted several seconds.
A third grip-and-grin followed brief remarks to press inside the portion of their one-on-one meeting that was open to cameras. (Daily Mail)

KNUCKLES FOREST CONTROVERSY : Its time that UNESCO intervened
	
When Knuckles conservation forest, along with Sri Pada peak wilderness area and Horton plains, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2010, the World Heritage Committee came up with a set of recommendations. The purpose of this was to ensure that the successive governments of Sri Lanka prioritized the protection of these three sites, which form the central highlands of Sri Lanka.
The recommendations read that an overall management system for the whole property is required, to ensure consistency of management, monitoring and presentation of the property, in addition to that provided by the individual management plans (for three sites). Adequate and sustained budgets are required for the management of the property as a whole, and within each component.
Getting the central highlands of Sri Lanka declared a global heritage site, beating other contenders, was a major achievement of course for the previous regime. After all only two heritage sites were declared at the 34th session of the World Heritage Committee held in July, 2010 in Brazil. The other wasPapahanaumokuake a collection of atolls and islands in USA. Interestingly, its the present Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Faizer Musthapha who as Deputy Minister of Environment in the then Rajapaksa government that lobbied for Knuckles, Horton Plains and Sri Pada forest at the Brazil conference.
However, even the previous regime failed to keep the momentum of the move by implementing the recommendations.
Today we hear strong allegations that two ministers of the present UNP led government have offered some 21,000 acres of land in the Knuckles reserve to their close associates for private projects. Such was the gravity of the situation that it saw the prelate of the Malwatte Chapter the Most. Ven. Thibbatuwave Sidartha Sri Sumangala Thera raising concerns over the allegations and Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has sought a detailed report on the area ear marked for private development projects.
Of course predictably the two ministers have denied the reports and the audit report on the matter is pending.

Following the media exposure it appears the plan had been put on hold, for the time being
The news of the move to lease land from knuckles conservation forest area comes a couple of months after a move to alienate a 90 perch block of land of the Kandy Udawattakele forest reserve to a leading hotel in Kandy. Following the media exposure it appears the plan had been put on hold, for the time being. The sacred city of Kandy itself is a UNESCO World Heritage site declared in 1988.
Historic cities of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Galle, Golden Temple of Dambulla, Sigiriya and Sinharaja forest form the rest of the World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka.
While successive Sri Lankan governments have managed to preserve the ancient cities and sites in the list its obvious that they have not given adequate importance and care to look after the forests. In the absence of a buffer zone, the boundary of the Sinharaja forest continues to come under the axe of tree fellers and private companies that have bought adjoining lands for businesses. It should be noted that 60% of the trees in this last primary forest of Sri Lanka are endemic. The UNESCO has mentioned poor staffing of the authorities tasked with protection, as a concern regarding the preservation of Sinharaja.
UNESCO World Heritage Sites are legally protected by international treaties given their collective interest to humanity. The list is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. It comprised 21 state parties which are elected by their General Assembly. The program was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972. So far some 193 state parties have ratified the convention and some 1,073 sites are listed so far and Sri Lanka became a member in 1988.
While by listing Sinharaja and central highland forests, the UNESCO has made them a global responsibility successive Sri Lankan governments have failed to implement the recommendations by the UNESCO committee. This has put the future of both these forests in danger. In the interest of humanity it is high time that pressure is mounted on whoever is holding power in Sri Lanka to take better care of this heritage.

## Title: Leprosy Hospital in Hendala now  a museum

Leprosy Hospital in Hendala now  a museum
	
Leprosy Hospital in Hendala is believed to be the first hospital built in the country by western rulers. It also stakes a claim to be the oldest functioning hospital in the world. 
Built in 1701 and still continuing to function into its fourth century, Hendala Leprosy Hospital is recognised as the first leprosy hospital in Asia and it is also thought to be the first hospital established after the reign of the Sinhala Kings in the country. 
However in the past this hospital had remained as an isolated institute due to the fears people had regarding the leprosy disease. 
Leprosy wasnt a well-known disease in the past and as a result all patients were separated from their families and the society during their entire lifetime, so as to receive medical treatment. 
Dutch period

The first incident of leprosy in Sri Lanka was recorded around the year 1670. This was during the Dutch period when several Portuguese soldiers and few Dutch nationals were diagnosed with leprosy. 
There are evidences of several children of local mothers, married to foreign soldiers, having being diagnosed with leprosy. 
A Dutch doctor, who arrived in Sri Lanka accompanied by Dutch soldiers in the 1670s, stated in a letter that he had been sent by the Dutch Royal Council. The mission given to him was to do a door-to-door search and seek whether there were leprosy patients. The patients who tested positive for leprosy were believed to have been retained in tents prepared on other side of the Kelani River. 
In the past there was neither definite nor advanced treatment for leprosy. Patients presenting with a severe condition had disfigured and deformed bodies. Back then it was the practice in some countries to sent these patients into jungles or to an island to live, separating them from the rest of the society. 
The path leading to the hospital building

Social attitude 
The social attitude toward members of the leper community was also regretfully unpleasant. Most patients, after being cured, were reluctant to return home because they were unwelcome. 
But with advances made by Western Medicine with regard to treating leprosy patients the number of patients has drastically dropped. Authorities at Hendala Leprosy Hospital say that most patients return to their families after being cured. 
The patient who had the longest life at the Hendala Leprosy Hospital was 90-year-old E.A. Alwis. He was born in 1928 and had been brought to the hospital in 1943 when he was diagnosed with leprosy at the age of 14. 
I was then a student living in Dehiwala and the youngest of five brothers. One day a public health inspector came to the school where I was studying to check for small pox disease. During his routine examination he had found symptoms of leprosy on my face and had advised the principal to immediately remove me from the school. Later he had also forced my parents to admit me to the leprosy clinic at the hospital in Punchi Borella. My parents, who were in tears, reluctantly brought me to the Borella Hospital from where I was sent to this hospital. I was taken in a fully covered single bullock cart. I have been living here for the past 76 years. I could not stop weeping and crying for several months because I lost the love and company of my parents and brothers. From time to time they visited the hospital to see me, but by now all of them have died, reminisced Alwis with tears in his eyes. 
B.M. Kiribanda, aged 96, of Meepitiya Dodangaslanda is another inmate who has spent 62 years in the hospital. He has been an inmate of the hospital since 1956. He too was a student at the time he was brought to the Hendala Leprosy Hospital. According to Kiribanda there had been about 1000 patients in the hospital at the time he was being admitted. He said he had seen many deaths due to this disease during his stay at the hospital. 
Kiribanda learned to work as a cobbler while staying in the hospital. He has engaged in making shoes for the patient. He says making shoes for the fellow patients is a very difficult task as the legs of most patients are deformed and warped.

Spirit of a Dutch Prince 
There are many stories associated with the leprosy hospital. Both Alwis and Kiribanda related a story about a Dutch Prince whose spirit frequents the hospital in night. The prince is said to be seen mounted on a white horse. They say he loves those in the hospital and protects them. 
There are many antique utility items that have been used at the hospital during its long history. Among them are two carts made by the inmates themselves. These carts have been used to carry dead bodies to the cemetery; one for Buddhists and the other for Catholics. The washing machine found in the hospital is said to be the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. Its a British machine and has the brand name Thomas and is said to be made in 1934. 
At present the Leprosy Hospital has been restored as a hospital museum under the Ministry of Health.

No barrier for Gota to relinquish US citizenship: Gammanpila
	
Former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa could relinquish the US citizenship without facing any barriers if he wishes to contest the upcoming Presidential Election, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday.
Addressing a news conference, he said Mr. Rajapaksa had requested him to explain the true legal position and the procedure in respect of renunciation of the US citizenship.
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 is the governing law in respect of renunciation of citizenship. According to Section 349(a) (5) of the Act, any citizen who wishes to relinquish the citizenship can do so without any restriction. However, two restrictions have been introduced by case law. Firstly, if the citizen lodges the application, being in the USA, it will definitely be rejected. Secondly, if the applicant does not have any other citizenship, his application may be rejected, Gammanpila said.
The first step towards renouncing US citizenship is obtaining citizenship in another country. The second step is collecting requirements mentioned in form DS4079 to DS4083. Thirdly, the applicant should make the renunciation appointment with the US embassy, Gammanpila said
As the fourth step, you should attend the appointment with two persons to witness your signature. After briefing you about the consequences of renunciation of the citizenship, the documents will be executed. Thereafter, you will be issued with DS4083, Certificate of Loss of Nationality. It is like an insurance cover note or temporary driving license. It will be later replaced with a certificate issued by the Department of State. It is so simple and so quick, Gammanpila added.
Therefore, he said the US Citizenship would not be an obstacle for Gotabaya Rajapaksa to contest the forthcoming presidential election. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

On Somaweera  Senanayake and on television
	
Not too many years ago, before I found a job, I was involved with tracking down, calling, and interviewing veterans from various cultural fields who had contributed something substantive to Sri Lanka. I would summarise their lives and work and try to fit those into the (horrendously meagre) space of a 1,500 or 2,500 word article (which would sometimes be in two parts). It was a challenge I had to meet and a challenge I grew to like. So I went on, from filmmaker to actor to lyricist, until somewhere towards the end of 2016 I met Somaweera Senanayake. I had not read him, I had only read (into) his scripts of those many, many TV series I grew up watching and loving here, but with what I knew I did my best and put together a sketch for the papers.
The day after it was published, another to be deceased artist, Premaranjith Tilakaratne (who passed away, after a failed surgery, in 2017) called me. Everything youve written is correct, he informed me, But you missed one point: that Somaweera Senanayake is the only scriptwriter of his stature we have who came from the village. He is of the village in ways that no one in his field has ever matched, before or after him. I was confused, so I asked him about those others in his field. Premaranjith was adamant: I came from Ratnapura, Tissa Abeysekara came from Maharagama, and Tony Ranasinghe from Modera. None of us could be called villagers. Yes, we hailed from a rural backdrop. But we were not of it. We belonged to a fairly middle-class setting, and what we wrote, even of the village, was conditioned by that specific setting. Somaweera faced no such problem. When he wrote of villagers, he went into their skins. Perhaps the biggest irony is that he didnt get into those skins as often as this description of him might have guaranteed, since the truth of the matter is that Senanayake, who passed away last Saturday, seemed to be more concerned with the same middle-class lives that Tilakaratne, Abeysekara and Ranasinghe had known of.
Somaweera Senanayake will be remembered more than anyone else as the man who scripted those television series and dramas which helped transform television in Sri Lanka into a family affair. In India, film theatres and halls were springing up by the dozen throughout the eighties, while in Sri Lanka, those theatres and halls were coming down with the entire industry. Television was never conceived of as an alternative to the cinema, but here, it almost was. As with popular movies, therefore, television serials, once they made inroads into our television screens, talked about the prejudices and the emotions of those who lived in a twilight world: between the city and the village. Somaweera had lived in both. He had resided more completely in the latter. The values he projected in those series he had a hand in shaping, or writing, therefore, were values which would define the entire medium for years to come.

As with popular movies, therefore, television serials, once they made inroads into our television screens, talked about the prejudices and the emotions of those who lived in a twilight world: between the city and the village. Somaweera had lived in both
Part of the reason for this was the time in which all that happened. The eighties was a tumultuous decade for reasons which have already been examined by economists, historians, and writers. It was tumultuous because of the tragedies it entailed as well as the promises of prosperity it held back. Those promises were enough to cushion, if not embolden, a new middle-class, who while certainly not equipped enough to be masters of their fate the way the bourgeoisie were, nevertheless dreamt big and cashed in on lives governed by a bourgeois ethic. The free market mantra the eighties opened Sri Lanka to brought about an unlikely synthesis here: between an older generation which sent their offspring to the cities, to educate them and to find them jobs, and those offspring who repudiated the traditionalism of the elders to modernise themselves.
This was the era of Michael Jackson, video recorders, and instant noodles. It took decades for the popular culture to nurture a sensibility like this to claim as its own. But while it transpired, it gave rise to a tragic rift: that between the goals and preferred outcomes of the new middle-class, and the inevitably high failures of a great many from that middle-class to achieve those goals and outcomes. The elders had built up their careers in stable government jobs; they had pushed their children into the private sector, dreaming of more stable and secure and lavish lifestyles for them. But once a great many of them failed to catch up with those lifestyles, they lived a rather pathetic heenamana existence (inferiority complex), idealising their present with visions from their supposed future. (Think of that English-speaking fraudster of a father, played by Cyril Wickramage, from Kande Gedara.)



It was this paradox which Somaweera revolved many of his stories around. They engendered botched dreams, false promises, and a forever unresolved rift between the face of the middle-class and its fragile, delicate reality.
The heroes of Somaweera Senanayakes world were those who acknowledged this rift and were not afraid of calling out something for what it was. The elder son from Asal Vesiyo, the elder son from Yashorawaya (adapted from Senanayakes own novel, the first in Sri Lanka to be adopted as a university thesis), and Nilmini Thennakoons character from Doo Daruwo, to name just a few, are not idealists by any stretch of the imagination, but their strength lies in the fact that they are somehow able to tower over the dreams, the wishful thinking, and the fantasies of their elders. They were a voice of reason, back when reason had been evicted by avarice. Moreover, as with the movies of Lester James Peries, Somaweeras scripts are preoccupied with the family, but unlike Lesters films, it doesnt always become a unifying factor; more often than not, those families are defined by a conflict between those who dream and those who do. In Asal Vasiyo, the comedy thus comes out not just from Ellen Silvester and her daughters, but also from their tenants: between the pomposity of the father (the perakadoruwa who constantly blurts I know the law!) and the younger son Pradeep (the mechanic who parades as an engineer) on the one hand, and the long suffering, but persistent and unyielding humanity of the elder son Jayamangala on the other.

He seems to have affirmed the past, and in doing so, he seems to have turned those sons and daughters into heroes

It was a critique of modern society he seems to have offered (though like Martin Wickramasinghe he couldnt go beyond demarcating it as inevitable), and if it was, then the question arises: what would have been an ideal society for Somaweera The middle-class teetered uncomfortably between one extreme and the other, courting both superstition and rationalism, both tradition and modernity, but without actually linking themselves to the one over the other. This rising petty bourgeoisie, who as I wrote before found solace in petty professions (teaching, repairs, journalism, what not) in the private sector (while their elders had worked as government bureaucrats), either continued to rise or went down with a bang. This could compel censure and empathy, drama and pathos; Somaweera, who turned it into both tragedy and comedy, thus envisioned an ideal society with the sons and daughters who stuck by the way of life their elders had once stuck by. In other words, he seems to have affirmed the past, and in doing so, he seems to have turned those sons and daughters into heroes. The obedient and the good, in his stories, became the strong and the quick-witted.

But this also meant a turning away from the inevitability of modernity, a point which cropped up more and more uneasily with each passing teledrama in the eighties. It is hard, for instance, to watch Yashorawaya today and try to understand the writers attitude towards interracial marriage, and it is hard to comprehend why it would have been so difficult to marry into another community (Rathna Lalani Jayakody with a Tamil businessman, Gamini Hettiarachchi with a self-indulgent Burgher girl) back then. But the resultant clashes, the once buoyant hopes, the cruelly-dashed dreams here were as inevitable as they were hard to accord with. (Roughly the same argument can be made of the depiction of marriage between different social classes in Vasantha Obeyesekeres Palagetiyo.) It was not a limited vision, it was an all too real vision, firmly-underscored by what middle-class Sri Lankans, particularly Sinhala Buddhists (the Olcott Buddhists or the Protestant Buddhists, as they are sometimes referred to today) felt. Somaweeras solution may have been that we should all turn away (which wouldnt have worked). Or perhaps that this middle-class was ill-suited for what had worked well for other demographics, including interracial marriage. Either way, it was an idealisation of a pre-middle-class, pre-urban society, though to consider that this is all that Senanayake could do would be understating his real achievement.
With each passing generation, the past becomes another world. My parents probably know less about the ways of that past, and the lifestyles and the ethics which governed it, than their parents do, and their parents probably knew even less than their own. The past becomes something to be idealised, or thrown away. And once urbanisation becomes a way of life, people try throwing it away. Vasantha Obeyesekere depicted, brutally, the conflicts this exposed us to, in film after film. In a more humane, less savage way, Somaweera Senanayake did the same on television. The beauty of it was that his eyes were open to this clash, inevitable in a majestic, awful manner as it was, while his entire life had been conditioned and fermented in the village. Premaranjith Tilakaratne was right, I am inclined to say. He was of the village, he moved out of the village, and in character after character, he depicted the flaws of an entire generation which had moved out with him, but which was now refusing to look back as he was.

Pollution threat to wewa ruffles farmers
	
There is a factory belonging to a close kinsman of a leading politico in a paddy cultivating area in the country.
Peasant-residents had recently stumbled on an impending threat to their livelihood: the factory owner has got a gang to cut a drain from the factory leading to the Punchibandalage -wewa as a convenient means of disposing of the factory effluent and sewage.
This wewa (tank) currently serves both as an inland fisheries resource and a source for irrigating 500-acre paddy tract and the people in the area are highly concerned that the factory effluent and sewage would pollute the wewa posing a threat to both fish farming and the paddy cultivation.
Numerous complaints in this regard have been made to a white-collar high-up in charge of the Zone, but the drain-cutting continues regardless, they say.

Presidency -- Easier for UNP if Gota contests: Harin
	
It will be easier for the UNP if former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa contested the 2020 presidential election, UNP Propaganda Unit Chief and Minister, Harin Fernando said today.
He told a news conference the UNP would welcome Mr. Rajapaksas candidacy because there were many things to talk about. We have many things to tell the people about former the defense secretary and we will do so at the right time, the minister said. Mr. Rajapaksa always does things through militarization. Anyone who likes it could embrace militarization.
He said many have failed to understand the mature democracy that is prevailing in the country. Mature Democracy is the reason why people cannot understand the truth. Many think that this government is timid and has no backbone.
The President and the Prime Minister are attacked on Facebook. Some think that both of them have become jokers, there is mudslinging everywhere. Media can fabricate news. These are all features of a mature democracy, he said and added that even the head of state could be criticized amid an environment of a mature democracy.
That mature democracy was born only after 2015, he said. There are two kinds of laws -- the laws which people take on to their hands and laws enforced according to the book. We have not taken the laws into our hands. We have enforced the laws as it is in the book and had allowed the judiciary to deal with the wrong doers. There is a delay on the part of the judiciary as cases are postponed. One could get things done when he takes the law on to his hands while when you enforce the laws according to the book it takes time. When law enforcement gets delayed one concludes that this government is a failure. New laws have been approved in Parliament to set up special courts to hear cases daily. When this new courts are established everyone will be able to see how the wrong doers are penalized. (Yohan Perera)

President should re-think Masthans appointment: Vadivel
	
President Maithripala Sirisena must re-consider the appointment of K. Kader Masthan as the Deputy Minister of Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Affairs, UNP MP and Lanka Jathika Estate Workers' Union General Secretary Vadivel Suresh said today.
He said the President should take into account the fact that Mr. Masthan was a Muslim.
It would have been better if a Hindu MP was appointed to be in charge of Hindu Affairs. Any one appointed to be in charge of religious affairs should be from the religion concerned and not from another religion, the MP said.
He said that the President, Prime Minister and Speaker should ensure that the names of the 118 MPs who had obtained money from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. be revealed soon.
Revealing these names would allow innocent MPs to acquit themselves, while the people's right to know who the culprits are, would also be fulfilled, the MP said. (Yohan Perera)

Reflections of a literary genius
	
A chit chat with prolific writer and simple villager W.A. Abeysinghe
When Sinhala lyricists are talked about there are certain names that tend to be left out of the conversation. Given that sometimes even the great Mahagama Sekera is absented one should not be surprised that names such as Sunil Sarath Perera, Mahinda Algama and W.A. Abeysinghe are dropped. 
Wijesinghe Arachchilage Abeysinghe doesnt seem to mind. The twinkle in his eye is a permanent feature, so he always seems amused, but when asked about what some might consider an insult, he just chuckles and says thats how it is, isnt it 
Accolades dont seem to matter him. He is of course aware of things encountered over the years and has a decent enough idea of whats to come, but for the most part Abeysinghe is a present man. Unassuming and self-contained, hes done what he believed should be done to the best of his ability. All his life. 
Sarasavi Publishers are coming out with three books, two authored by Abeysinghe and one about him, on July 12 (Tuesday) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo. The first is a selection of what he calls all kinds of writing. Anandayen Pragnaavata (From bliss to wisdom) is edited by Sumudu Chathurani Jayawardena and Abeysinghes daughter Deppachandi Abeysinghe. 
Mage Lokaya Saha Ovunge Lokaya (My world and theirs) is the second volume of introductions, forewords, endnotes and blurbs hes written for various publications. 
The third is perhaps the most important. Its a felicitation volume edited by Chandrasiri Seneviratne and Udeni Sarachchandra. Abhaya Mudraava. The play on his name is obvious. The meaning however is not inappropriate. Technically the term means gesture of fearlessness. It could also mean reassurance and safety, dispelling fear and providing protection. 
Abeysinghe is all of this although none of it could come under a column called objectives of life in his case. 
The eldest in a family six, Abeysinghe was born on the 13th of September 1938. His father was a farmer from Kuliyapitiya. His mother was from a village called Etiyawala, also in the Puttalam District, but bordering Kurunegala District. His early education was at Etiyawala Boys School. Later he moved to Kuliyapitiya Central. 
There was just one book in the village school, a translation of Robinson Crusoe by Edwin Ranawaka. Kuliyapitiya Central was in comparison massive. There was a really well-stocked library which was complemented by a culture that appreciated the value of literature. It was a school that was grazed by the breezes of literature. The principal and teachers were well-read and encouraged students to follow suit. The library carried the A.L. Bright Story Reader Series. Almost all the classics of English literature were there in abridged form. I read them all. I also read the Sinhala literature available in the library. In fact we were exposed to other literatures too. I read Tagore, for instance. So the winds of world literature also touched me. 
We were also encouraged to write, not just to school magazines, but also to newspapers. Those days we loved seeing out submissions published in newspapers. he reminisces. 
Literature clearly had been an important part of his education and that of his fellow-students according to Abeysinghe. The time he spent in Kuliyapitiya Central also helped form his philosophy of life for there had been progressive teachers and even Marxists. 
Time spent aimlessly
After leaving school, he joined Maharagama Training College and became an English teacher. His first appointment had been at his alma mater where he taught for four years. Writing however was his passion and he joined Lake House towards the end of 1963 as a Sub-Editor for the Dinamina. That lasted only six months. Abeysinghe jokingly says that it was due to an erashtakaya or a malefic which saw him spend 10 years aimlessly. 
It wasnt that he was idling, though. He completed an external degree at Vidyalankara where he was in the first batch of students, reading Sinhala, History and Economics. He took on teaching jobs at the Vidyalankara Pirivena, Dematagoda, Sunethradevi Pirivena and at Buddhist Ladies College. While doing all this Abeysinghe also studied Law. It had taken him 7-8 years, but he took his oaths in 1974. 
During the erashtaka period, he worked for a while at a newspaper called Sirilaka, which was started in 1968 by Hector Kobbekaduwa with Karunasena Jayalath as the Editor-in- Chief. He also worked at Aththa, the party organ of the Communist Party. He also worked with Irvin Weerackody, who would become an advertising guru of sorts, and this is where he got to collaborate with a lot of singers for various radio programmes. 

Abeysinghe is self-effacing. Publicity has never been important. He says this may be because of the influence that communism had on him: the collective and the objective mattered; self never did.
Some might say that he dabbled in politics. He says he was in and out of the Communist Party. He had even contested the Kuliyapitiya Seat under the United Left Front in 1977, the year that the entire Left was wiped out electorally. In the late eighties he became a member of the Politburo of the newly formed Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya, led by Vijaya Kumaratunga. When Chandrika Kumaratunga became President he was invited to be the Director (Editorial) at Lake House and after a few years he was made a Consultant. In 2004 he was made Chairman, Library Services, a post he would be re-appointed to by the present Government, more than a decade later. He retired recently.
Through all this he practiced law off and on, and more importantly, he never stopped writing. Since he published his first collection of poems, neth dekak (two eyes) in 1965, Abeysinghe has published over 250 books which include collections of poetry and lyrics, novels, short stories (in English and Sinhala), translations into Sinhala and English, essays on literary criticism, educational publications and compilations, academic treatises, literature for young people and children and other miscellaneous works. 

Sarasavi Publishers are coming out with three books, two authored by Abeysinghe and one about him, on July 12 (Tuesday) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo
Marxism and Buddhism
He has written 300-400 songs, one of the earliest being the perennial favorite by Amaradeva, adavan vu denethin, a classic composition inspired by the Samadhi Buddha Statue in Anuradhapura. 
Clearly, Marxism and Buddhism have been important streams of inspiration. Abeysinghe doesnt see any contradiction here. 
I dont think its strange. I have embraced things to the extent of my ability to comprehend. I dont live within boxes. I find the notion dictatorship of the proletariat absurd. Its a crazy notion. However I have always found a lot of explanatory worth in Marxs Theory of Surplus Value, he opines. 
Abeysinghe attributes most of his thinking and ways of being to the social, cultural and philosophical environment he grew up in. 
Living is easy. Its easy for me to be a communist. Its easy to be a Buddhist. I can be a nationalist and an internationalist. The reason is that I grew up in a Buddhist culture. It taught me patience. It taught me to look for and obtain the core of things. Its in my genes, this collective consciousness that makes me be who I am. Im someone who belongs to a culture, unlike Marxists. Its a life culture and therefore I dont feel Im a misfit anywhere. Labels never mattered to me. Self-reflection is what I have always done. I didnt have to learn it and neither have I felt it necessary to talk of it like a political theory, he says. 
Abeysinghe is self-effacing. Publicity has never been important. He says this may be because of the influence that communism had on him: the collective and the objective mattered; self never did. And so, this man of many words lived, lives and will continue to live in the present, the moment. 
Ive lived with my convictions, which were honed by the simplicity of being that I learned from my surroundings, my village, my family. These things I recognize and acknowledge. Its not like someone from Colombo waxing lyrical about the village. I am from the village. I am a villager, he says. 
He married, raised three children and is now the grandfather of five. His wife spends much time with the daughters, he says, so he is mostly alone in Kuliyapitiya. 
We talked about a lot of other things. Abeysinghe wanted me to come for the launch of the three books next Tuesday. I ask him where he was going. 
I have to go to my daughters place in Narahenpita, he says and since I am going that way I offer him a ride. 
We talk as we drove along. He chuckles all the way to Narahenpita. I ask him what his plans are for the rest of the day. 
I will spent some time with my daughter and then return to Kuliyapitiya. 
How do you travelI ask to which he responds by saying By bus. 
As always, a simple man with simple ways, but endowed with a profound intellect and a prolific pen. Thats W.A. Abeysinghe. May he be blessed with good heath, contentment and simple joys, always.

Samsung Electronics ranked as No.1 brand in Asia for the 7th consecutive year
	
Samsung Electronics topped the Asia 's Top 1000 Brands leader board for the seventh year in a row, in a survey by Hong Kong-based communication marketing company, 'Campaign Asia Pacific' and Nielsen. Samsung's brand strategy that pursues "social goodness" has played a major role in the company's product competitiveness. Samsung Electronics ranked 17th in the survey in 2004, but has steadily climbed to the top for three consecutive years since 2009. The survey was conducted from 16th March to 11th April 2018 amongst consumers from 14 countries including Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, who were asked to name their most trusted brands across 15 industries. In order to ensure an accurate representation through this study, the survey targets age, gender and monthly household income to establish a balanced survey landscape.

Addressing evolving consumers needs and wants is essential in helping Samsung pave the way as a forerunner of the industry, with community engagement being an integral part of maintaining the rapport Samsung has with the communities it is involved in.
Every year, Samsung invests around US$14 billion in Research & Development to ensure that they are at the cutting edge of innovation. More than a fifth of their staff works in R&D and this dedication allows Samsung to remain at the top of their game, with their recent launches (listed below) reflecting the unwavering pursuit of excellence Samsung pursues.
Samsung Sri Lanka was awarded the Peoples Youth Choice brand of the year award at the recently-concluded SLIM Nielsen Peoples Awards. This accolade is a reflection of the electronics giants ability to lead the industry in Sri Lanka as well. Its recent introduction of Infinity Display to the local market has taken the brand to an aspirational level, since it understands consumer needs better than any other brand. This year, Samsung was focused on mobile digital advertising with products targeting and meeting the needs of the youth of Sri Lanka. Samsung mobiles offer diverse features for youth who are continuously craving better camera quality and advanced options when it comes to taking images or selfies to highlight their lifestyle and multitasking. Samsung is the only brand to cater to a wider audience with not only mobile devices but Gear VR which creates a virtual reality of experience for the audience.

SLPP won't support MS for 2020 presidency: GL
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which is under the de facto leadership of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, said yesterday it would never support President Mathripala Sirisena as a candidate for the next presidential election.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris told reporters the President was not only an integral part of the current government but also its pinnacle.
He said the newly appointed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa and National Organizer Duminda Dissanayake had recently said the SLFP would nominate President Sirisena as its presidential candidate.
The minister is quoted to having said his party would form a broad alliance with like-minded political parties to ensure the President's victory in 2020, Prof. Peiris said.
He said the people had suffered immensely at the hands of the current government and that the people should not suffer the same plight for another five years.

Trump and Kim sign "very important document"
	
President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un are signing a joint agreement, although the exact details are still unknown.
"We're signing a very important document, a pretty comprehensive document," Trump told the waiting reporters. He said he would discuss it "at great length" at an upcoming news conference, and indicated it would be made available publicly.
Kim said he wanted to express his gratitude to President Trump for making the meeting happen.
"We had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind and we are about to sign the historic document," Kim said through a translator.
A US official told CNN earlier the document would acknowledge the progress of the talks and pledge to keep momentum going.
It follows a day of historic talks at Singapore's Capella Hotel, on Sentosa Island -- the first meeting between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader.
No signing had been planned at the beginning of the day, although a large amount of time had been left free after a working lunch schedule for 11:30 a.m. local time (11:30 p.m. ET).
Trump first announced there would be "a signing" shortly after midday, during a stroll with Kim around the hotel grounds.

The North Korean leader landed at Singapores Changi Airport shortly before 3 p.m. Sunday and travelled in his armored Mercedes-Benz limousine through one of the island states swankiest shopping districts to the five-star St. Regis hotel.
The streets were lined with tourists and journalists trying to catch a glimpse of the enigmatic North Korean leader, who has embarked on his farthest journey - and the journey with the highest stakes - since taking power at the end of 2011.
Kims trip was prominently featured in North Koreas state media Monday morning.
Air Force One touched down with little fanfare at Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore, landing a few hours after Kim arrived in the island state. Trump waved as he stepped off the presidential aircraft, briefly greeted Singaporean officials on the tarmac and quickly climbed into a limousine to head to his hotel for the evening.
Asked upon his arrival how he was feeling about the summit, Trump told reporters, Very good.
Trump and Kim are scheduled to meet face to face Tuesday morning at 9 (which is 9 p.m. Monday, Eastern time), and they will see if they can forge some kind of agreement on North Koreas nuclear programme.
Kim and Trump are to meet at the Capella hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, usually better known as the site of Singapores Universal Studios amusement park.

US and North Korean leaders hold historic talks
	
Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have become the first sitting US president and North Korean leader to meet, an unprecedented development after a year of exchanging threats.
The pair shook hands at a luxury hotel in Singapore's Sentosa island after months of diplomatic twists and turns.
They are now set to discuss defusing tensions and nuclear disarmament.
Analysts are split on what it will achieve. Some see it as propaganda win for Mr Kim, others a path to peace.
The two men walked towards each other and firmly gripped each other's hands in front of US and North Korean flags.
In brief initial comments in front of the press, the US president predicted a "terrific relationship" with Mr Kim.
"I feel really great. We're going to have a great discussion and will be tremendously successful," the US president said.
Sitting alongside each other, the pair appeared relaxed against the odds.
"It was not easy to get here. There were obstacles but we overcame them to be here," Mr Kim said.
The leaders will now hold a one-to-one meeting, with translators, before a working lunch.
The talks - unimaginable just a few months ago - will focus on North Korea's controversial nuclear programme. (BBC)

Aircraft manufacturing: Limitations and enabling technologies
	
Aerospace companies are continuously experiencing globalization, intense competition, reduced time-to-market, faster build rates and the need to reduce costs while maintaining strict quality-assurance. These factors are forcing all the large players to move from traditional craft-based assembly and dedicated hard tooling jigs towards more agile and flexible solutions. A significant amount of work has been carried out to support the automation of aircraft assembly.
However, considerably more work has been directed towards the automation of wing assembly as compared to the assembly of the fuselage or other parts of the aircraft. Conventionally, dedicated tooling is used in the aircraft manufacturing industry for the assembly of aero-structure components to ensure that the final assembly meets design requirements (Fig. 1). However, the size and the resulting weight of aero-structure components is increasing and cost of the fixtures and labour are steadily rising. The use of manual assembly also represents a significant health and safety problem and an increased likelihood of component damage during assembly. Relying on product specific fixtures to provide part location and support during assembly offers advantages in terms of consistency, accuracy and quality, but has the disadvantages of high costs, long lead times and inflexibility in product types and production volumes. At present these jigs and fixtures are product specific and cannot be economically modified for use on other aircraft types.  
Currently the majority of automation solutions are based around large dedicated fixed systems
Currently the majority of automation solutions are based around large dedicated fixed systems. These systems are inflexible and involve high capital cost as well as long lead-time and can lead to capital bottlenecks. These factors have led to a renewed interest in the development of low cost flexible automation approaches (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). One way of achieving this flexibility is by introducing robots. However, the application of robotics to the assembly of large aero-structures has been limited by the large size and inherent compliance of the components involved. The compliance of the components is significant and simple pick and place approaches cannot be used due to the inherent dimensional variability between mating parts. 
Background literature suggested that there was limited work on flexible robot based systems used in the aerospace applications. In the past a number of robotic systems have been developed with varying degrees of success. All these systems require accurate positioning and fixture of the components within the cell to overcome the inherent flexibility of robot structures. However, robotic applications in the aerospace industry demonstrate that there is a significant amount of interest in the adoption of external metrology systems to improve the capability of robotic systems. Most of the existing research utilise metrology systems such as laser tracker, photogrammetry, and vision systems to provide vision-guided assembly and manufacturing operations. These installations have all supported greater levels of automation but they all required sophisticated expensive software and hardware for their implementation including training and familiarity with the technique. Each of the metrology system has its own particular merits and limitations. It is very rare that the use of a single sensor is sufficient for the aerospace applications. Integration of network of metrology either similar of different allow data from one set of metrology to constrain the analysis of another, takes advantages of their respective strengths while partially cancelling the weaknesses and results in a measurement system that provides maximise precision, breadth of coverage, long term stability, and fast response. Therefore a method of integrating an arbitrary number of metrology systems for the purpose of controlling automated assembly cell is important. 
Author of this article has published number of research papers regarding assembly of Aero-structure components, Aero-engine and Aircraft system components to show the possibility of solve the above problem by integrating an off-the-shelf laser metrology system, standard industrial robots, re-configurable end-effects, and best-fit mathematical algorithms. The metrology system used in this research is a low cost laser seam finder and provides a standard interface to the robot controller. This provides the ability to adapt to variability in the assemblies. This metrology system was used to determine the real position of the part before processing, accurate positioning of the tool, increased productivity and flexibility, simple set-up, and improved quality of assembly. The data can also be used to check gross distortion of components and to reject those outside the specification limits. The real innovation of this research is to develop a low cost system for the automated assembly of aero-structure components using low cost standard industrial robots. The use of non-contact metrology within the resulting cell will also considerably reduce the reliance placed on traditional Jigs and fixtures.  

Each of the metrology system has its own particular merits and limitations
	In the past, a number of robotic systems have been developed with varying degrees of success
The next generation of composite aircraft are likely to be a replacement of the current aluminium alloy based aircraft. Due to the potential increased demand for this class of aircraft, the considered production rates will be higher than the current rates for the single aisle aircraft. In order to achieve the rate existing manufacturing technologies have to be improved and new technologies and build concepts have to be developed.

## Title: At SCO, Sino-Indian differences persisted, but  enhanced trade could bridge gap

At SCO, Sino-Indian differences persisted, but  enhanced trade could bridge gap
	
Even as the Qingdao Declaration was being drafted at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, contradictions between India and China appeared, casting doubts about the success of the meeting held on June 9 and 10 at Qingdao in China.
While all other six members of the SCO, viz. Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan endorsed Chinas ambitious multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) involving the construction of roads, railways, ports and other infrastructural facilities across Asia and Europe, India refused.
India said the BRI brazenly violates its sovereignty and territorial integrity because the US$ 62 billion China-funded China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of the BRI, goes through Gilgit-Baltistan, a part of Kashmir which Pakistan holds but India claims.
India looks at CPEC as a brazen violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In his speech at the summit, where he delineated the principles on which the SCO should be based, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said all SCO projects must respect members sovereignty andterritorial integrity.
Indias objection puts China in a fix. The BRI and CPEC are ongoing multi-billion dollar projects from which China cannot conceivably withdraw. And if India does not endorse or cooperate with the BRI, the SCO will be that much less effective. And the SCO is Chinas chosen platform to present itself as an effective and responsible Asian and world economic and political power in succession to the US and Japan.

Indias objection puts China in a fix. The BRI and CPEC are ongoing multi-billion dollar projects from which China cannot conceivably withdraw. And if India does not endorse or cooperate with the BRI, the SCO will be that much less effective
Ticklish Issues
With traditional enemies India and Pakistan now in the SCO, obtaining unanimity on decisions might be problematic. Bilateral issues could bedevil the organisations functioning. And with many unresolved issues still plaguing relations between China and India, getting the SCO to pull together might be a challenging task.
Considering Pakistan as its all-weather friend, China does not see Kashmir as being part of India de jure. China views Kashmir as a disputed territory whose formal status remains to be settled by India and Pakistan through negotiations. China also disputes Indian sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh State in North Eastern India, saying Arunachal Pradesh is Southern Tibet and part of Tibet which is a region of China. To press home its point, China issues stapled visas and not regular visas to Indians from Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh.
China has been blocking Indias bid in the United Nations to list Pakistan-based Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, Hafeez Saeed and Masood Azhar, as global terrorists. To Indias chagrin, China says that more evidence of their alleged involvement in deadly terror attacks in India is needed.
China has also consistently blocked Indias attempts to become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which regulates nuclear trade. China objects on the grounds that countries which have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferating Treaty (NPT) should not be admitted in the absence of a new consensus-based policy on admissions to the NSG.
Then, in the latter half of 2017, in continuance of the never-ending border dispute, China stepped on Indias toes by encroaching in the Doklam region of Bhutan, an Indian ally. Chinese forces occupied an area India sees as being vital for the security of its North Eastern region. The 72-day standoff at Doklam was resolved diplomatically, but it did bring the two Asian giants to the brink of war.
The other bee in the Indian bonnet is Chinas economic encroachment in South Asia, which India considers to be its strategic and economic domain. China is not only executing the gigantic CPEC in Pakistan but is building multi-billion dollar mega infrastructural facilities in all the countries of South Asia, displacing India as the main development partner and aid giver.
India has warned the recipient countries about falling into a Chinese debt trap but the fund-starved South Asian countries, desperate to develop economically, have turned a deaf ear to Indias advice joined the BRI.
Sino-Indian bilateral trade, though large, is tilted heavily against India. There is now a US$ 36.73 billion trade gap between the two countries, with China not giving enough access to Indian goods. Indian manufacturers are also complaining of dumping by China, the latest complaint being from the solar power equipment sector.
On its part, India has been using security concerns to resist Chinas efforts to invest in the country, especially in its infrastructure projects. There is also resistance to Chinas efforts to penetrate the vast and growing Indian market through Indias Free Trade Agreements with other countries. Chinas invitations to Indian companies to invest in BRI projects in the region are given the cold shoulder because such projects are seen as strategic penetration into Indias domain.

China has also consistently blocked Indias attempts to become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which regulates nuclear trade. China objects on the grounds that countries which have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferating Treaty (NPT) should not be admitted in the absence of a new consensus-based policy on admissions to the NSG
Signs of Accommodation
Nevertheless, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been making overtures to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the latter appears to be responding, albeit cautiously.
Xi has told Modi that Sino-Indian bilateral trade should go up from the current US$ 84 billion to US$ 100 billion by 2020. He has agreed to Modis proposal to import non-basmati rice. To help mitigate floods in North Eastern India, the Chinese leader has consented to supply hydrological data on the Brahmaputra river which flows from Tibet to India.
The Chinese side has told India that it would encourage Indian pharmaceutical companies to register for high-quality Indian pharmaceutical products in the Chinese market. In response to President Xis suggestion for enhancing financial cooperation between the two countries and also helping trade, Prime Minister Modi said India was ready to permit the Bank of China to establish its branch in Mumbai. More generally, China has been promising to address the issue of trade deficit.
US$ 4.7 billion Special Lending Facility
Irrespective of bilateral difficulties, the Chinese President is forging ahead with his plans to make SCO a major force in the world.
Significantly, Xi pledged a US$ 4.7 billion Special Lending Facility to the member States. He did say that member States must coordinate with Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for shared growth, but he qualified by adding that coordination must come through discussion and collaboration. Countries must also put themselves in each others shoes to get to know each others needs, Xi added.
China is eager to provide legal support for economic cooperation and trade, Xi announced and offered 3,000 training opportunities for member States. He placed at their disposal, meteorological data collected by the Chinese Febgyun-2 weather satellites.
Stressing cooperation with all, Xi stressed the importance of working with the UN, World Bank, IMF and other international financial institutions.
The Chinese President pleaded for people-people contact to strengthen multilateral ties by building personal trust. He envisaged people-to-people contacts in culture, education, media and other areas including disaster relief.
While opposing the BRI, Indian Prime Minister Modi said India was keen on cooperating with SCO countries in building connectivity in the region and pledged to make the SCO a success. This throws the door open to Sino-Indian cooperation in some areas at least.
Sino-Indian watchers believe that progress in trade and investment, even if only incremental, will enable India and China to move closer in other areas, albeit slowly and cautiously. They stress that it will be too much to expect a sea change in the troubled relationship any time soon. Domestic political and national security considerations, which shape a nations policies, take time to change.

Cabinet approves kerosene relief for fisher folk
	
Cabinet approval had been granted to reduce the selling price of one litre of kerosene by midnight today, Fisheries Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said.
He also said that a decision had been taken to grant more relief on other fishery facilities.
Sources said that the fishing kerosene would be of different colour.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror the Minister said at the Cabinet meeting held today headed by President Maithripala Sirisena was the proposal was approved.
The Cabinet approval was granted to change the dye of the kerosene intended for fishing boats, he said.
The normal kerosene is dyed with red.
So, those fishermen could easily identify where to get their subsidised fuel, he said.
Discussions were also held to minimise the misuse of kerosene subsidies, a relief is given by the President and to take stern legal actions against those who misused such subsidies, he said.
Petroleum Resources Minister Arjuna Ranatunga also confirmed the Cabinet decision. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Can we rule out  GLYPHOSATE in CKDU

Can we rule out  GLYPHOSATE in CKDU  
	
Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, former chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, presents a logical argument for lifting the ban on glyphosate, due to the lack of evidence. He also points to the fact that the technical capability and the legal authority associated with these rests lies with the Registrar of Pesticides. He also underscores the Registrars obligation to consult appropriate bodies. Given that the matter pertains to health we assume that he would have consulted the medical profession. 
Two leading medical professionals, Dr Chula Herath, President of the Nephrology Society and Professor Saroj Jayasinghe of the Colombo Medical Faculty, have in no uncertain terms alerted everyone via the newspapers regarding the health crisis the country is faced with in relation to the epidemic known as the chronic kidney disease of unknown cause (CKDu). This crisis is not limited to kidney disease. It has several health conditions. 
As a biomedical scientist who also re-analysed the data from the MOH/WHO study, and also as someone who has studied the subject extensively for over 4 years, I wish to share my knowledge and understanding of the crisis. From the outset I wish to state that I support the stance taken by these two eminent medics. This I do, while holding the view that glyphosate or heavy metals per se are not the real reason for the emergence of this crisis in the places it is observed, why it has surfaced within the last two decades and why it is proliferating within those regions and also spreading to the South East region as in illustration 1.**** 
First, lets assess the scale of the crisis. His Excellency has stated that there are 400,000 CKDu cases based on the MOH/WHO 2013 study when the condition was mostly detected in the North Central Province (NCP). It is now being detected in the South Eastern region, in places such as Moneragala, Wellawaya, Thanamalvila and Bandagiriya in upper Hambantota as shown in the illustration. It has been known for some time that NCP newborns are of Low Birth Weight and their kidneys are undersized. Now, we have the highest number of oral cancer patients in the world according to the President of the International Society of Oral Pathologists, Professor WM Tilakeratne (Daily Mirror 3rd October 2016). The victims are from Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala; places which have high incidences of CKDu. The youngest age group is only six months. The reason for the high prevalence of oral cancer is likely to be the exposure to carcinogens. For infants to develop oral cancer would be mothers milk containing carcinogens. Its established elsewhere (in other countries) that mothers milk may have such agriculture related toxins. 

Studies by several of our medical professionals (Badurdeen and colleagues (2016); Ratnayake and colleagues (2017)) have established unusual conditions in the CKDu cases. In that they may be passing excess urine among others in early stages of CKDu. Dr Ranga Weerakkody, a consultant nephrologist has established that his kidney patients are unusually having raised ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and other similar indicators. These are signs of very serious illness other than kidney failure. 

Illustration 1. (A) CKDu locations, (B) River map of Sri Lanka showing the relationship between Hill Country paddy cultivation water and CKDu.
Suffering from malnutrition
It is known that about 15 percent of our rural children suffer Wasting (loss of weight) and Stunting (retarded growth). A 2014 UNICEF study has established that our rural children below 5 years of age suffer from Malnutrition. My analysis of the MOH/WHO data showed that over 40 % of healthy individuals in study communities pass excess creatinine in their urine. In fact their kidneys are working better than normal, that is because they are exposed to bio-incompatible agents. When this happens, they also pass excess electrolytes (salts) and micronutrients (minerals) which have deleterious effects on the health of both adults and children. Many are far from being kidney patients presently, but they most certainly will be within the next 15 years or so. The most probable reason for these effects is the exposure to bio-incompatible agents whether they caused kidney disease or any other condition. There are several of these agents in our diet, water and the environment from fertiliser, and weedicides and pesticides (glyphosate etc).

It is unknown as to which agents may cause these hitherto unknown conditions in kidney disease. For these reasons, we cannot rule out a potential role of glyphosate in this monumental health crisis. What is absolutely necessary is to protect these communities from exposure to bio-incompatible agents as soon as possible to salvage a growing and silently progressing catastrophe. Of the 400,000 CKDu cases the President refers to, about 80 percent are not kidney patients needing dialysis or a transplant now, but they likely will be in the next 10-15 years. I estimate half could be saved simply by reducing the toxic exposure. This is one of the reasons why the lifting of the glyphosate ban most probably would impact negatively on their well-being. What we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg. I estimate the number of vulnerable not to be less than a million to develop CKDu and other conditions in the next 20 years or so. 

What is most crucial to appreciate is that low-level toxic exposure diseases, such as diabetes or alcohol related conditions take a long time as much as 30 to 50 years or more depending on the exposure level
The MOH/WHO study established that there was enough cadmium and arsenic in their diet to cause kidney disease in some people. Professors Rajitha Wickremasinghe of Kelaniya Medical School and Kamani Wanigasuriya of Sri Jayawardanapura Medical School have established 89 and 69 %of their study group had lead and cadmium respectively in blood above the US reference level. Of these 89 and 16 percent were above the adverse level for lead in adults and children respectively. 
In attempting to understand the true cause of CKDu, it is necessary to establish the reason for higher levels of toxins in rice, blood and urine in the focal areas.What is crucial in the context of glyphosate ban is the restriction of CKDu to wider North Central Region, and places in the South East. There is no CKDu in Ampara District, Western Province, most of Southern Province, Hill Country or Jaffna. This is despite the use of glyphosate and fertiliser throughout the country. The difference is in the rice cultivation water. CKDu places get rice cultivation water from Hill Country, whereas all the other places use rain water directly or following storage in wewas. Mahaweli River water from Hill Country is typically stored in the NCR wewas (tanks and reservoirs) before use. 
The Hill Country water has very low levels of toxins from fertiliser, and weedicide and pesticides. This process started in the late 1950s when Sri Lanka started using chemical fertiliser. These toxins wewas, paddy fields and the environment in NCR has been increasing ever since, and now have reached critical levels to make rice toxic. 
In a 2015 study by University of Peradeniya scientists in the upper catchment area, they have established the presence of cadmium, lead and arsenic among other elements. The levels are very small, in parts per billion (ppb) range and if this water is consumed it would likely not result in kidney disease from these known toxic agents, because the dosage is insufficient. 


Rice cultivationand water
Although this water could be drunk without any harm, the use of it in rice cultivation results in a rather different impact on rice toxicity. That is because it takes about 5000 liters of water to produce a kilogram of rice. Rice cultivation water from the Hill Country provides and extra source of toxins to rice grown in the NCP. Toxin contribution from cultivation water could be several times greater than from direct application of fertiliser. Whole of any toxin is not taken up by the rice. At the end of a crop cycle, some will be removed from the field in the sheaf, husk and the grain, leaving behind what is in the roots, remaining part of the plant and what was unused in the soil. What is left behind at the end of a crop cycle becomes available to the rice plant at the commencement of the following crop cycle. These processes are repeated at each crop cycle resulting in accumulation of toxins in the soil and presenting rising levels of toxins to the rice plant with each crop cycle. Now, NCR soil has 10,000 to 50,000 times of any heavy metal as would be in the rice grain. For this reason, organic farming is not possible in these fields. 

In attempting to understand the true cause of CKDu, it is necessary to establish the reason for higher levels of toxins in rice, blood and urine in the focal areas
To illustrate the impact of Hill Country irrigation water, and the cumulative soil cadmium, the Total cadmium availability to the rice plant is considered under two conditions - Hill Country irrigation water or rain water in a fresh field. The amount of fertiliser applied is the same in both cases, 50kg per hectare. If the cadmium level is 10 milligrams per kilogram (ppm) that would correspond to 100 micrograms of cadmium available to the rice plants that would produce one kilogram of paddy considering a yield of 5000kg of paddy per hectare. This is a figure published by vv (retired) who is a soil and water specialist. The average value of canal water cadmium in the MOH/WHO study is taken to represent Hill Country irrigation water cadmium which is 0.25 micrograms per liter. Rain water is considered to have no cadmium. Uptake of cadmium by the rice plant is taken at one percent of the Total cadmium. At the end of the crop cycle 50 percent of what was taken up by the plant is considered to be removed from the paddy field, adding what is left behind to the cumulative soil level. Respective values over a period of 4 crop cycles are given in Table 1, and in illustration 2 their variations are graphically presented. 
The rice plant uptake is negligible, but it has an impact on the rice (not shown here).
What is removed from soil too is negligible; it hardly makes a difference to cumulative soil toxicity. It is more so in the Hill Country irrigation water setting. The cumulative and Total cadmium levels increase at each crop cycle almost completely determined by the contribution from cultivation water. This is applicable only to Hill Country irrigation water setting. In the rain water setting it is determined only by the fertiliser level, but with a significant contribution from whats left behind at the end of a crop cycle. 
Cumulative soil toxic level has a disastrous impact on the Total cadmium available to the rice plant. Even in the rain water setting, at the commencement of the third crop cycle, the contribution from cumulative soil exceeds the contribution from fertiliser. To illustrate the significance of Hill Country irrigation water, if we consider the Total cadmium in the field for example at the 4th crop cycle, the levels are 231 (Rain water) and 5161 (Hill Country irrigation water), with a difference of 20 times as much. As a consequent, rice grown in locations receiving Hill Country water progressively produce more toxic rice than rice grown with rain water. This is why CKDu is in places where Hill Country water is used for rice cultivation. 

Illustration 2. Change in cadmium levels of Total available to the rice plant, removal from soil and accumulation in soil under rain water-fed and Hill Country Irrigation Water-fed rice cultivation over 4 crop cycles. Note that the scales are times different in the two cases.


Impact on children
This phenomenon has a devastating impact on children. Their diet is more toxic than what their parents consumed when they were children. 
The question is asked, in Colombo too, rice from focal areas are eaten, how come theres no CKDu in Colombo That is because rice farmers eat their own rice, and in Colombo rice from many places are consumed. Also, the diets and pattern of consumptions are different. This is akin to alcohol consumption, those who drink heavily fall ill first, others may follow dependent on the amount and pattern of consumption. 
How does this relate to glyphosate ban It is almost common sense to contemplate, could what is happening with fertiliser use in Hill Country, do the same with glyphosate in NCR and theSouth East 
Soil or rice grain levels of weedicides and pesticides are not available. The human impact of weedicides and pesticides are only considered in terms of drinking water. It is well established that cultivation water cadmium contributes to rice (grain) cadmium levels. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect it would be similar with weedicides and pesticides. It is also reasonable to assume that cultivation water contribution of say glyphosate might even be greater because its concentration in reservoir water is several times higherthan cadmium. 
Most unfortunately, Sri Lanka has not done any dietary assessments. This is a terrible indictment on our authorities for not to have done this when MOH/WHO study recommended so following their findings that forty percent of the CKDu cases could be accounted for by cadmium alone. In our rice and vegetables there are other kidney disease causing agents such as lead, mercury and arsenic which would make their own unique contributions to cause kidney disease and many other conditions.


Since rainwater is almost free of toxins, the rice cultivation conditions are very different in the two settings. Hill Country water derived rice cultivation has three sources of toxins whereas those with rainwater-fed has only two that, the soil toxicity is several times lower with the rainwater-fed scenario. Consequently, Hill Country water-fed rice is more toxic than rainwater-fed rice. This is the reason for CKDu to be in places where Hill Country water is used for rice cultivation. The underlying reason is the ultra-low toxins in the Hill Country water. Despite the very low levels, because rice needs a large quantity of water, typically rice-water footprint being about 5000 liters per kilogram, rice plant gets extra doses of toxins both from water and what is accumulated in the soil.Neither clean fertiliser nor clean Hill Country water will make rice less toxic. Both must happen. 
However, it must be made clear that there are places such as Padaviya North East of Anuradhapura or Mallavi in the Northern Province that has CKDu despite not getting Hill Country water directly. This is because these places are in rainwater and flood paths. For example, Anuradhapura is about 100 meters above sea level whereas Padaviya and Mallavi are less than 50 meters above. In heavy rains and floods surface run-off from paddy fields, pastures, overflowing tanks get accumulated in the low-lying areas and local tanks making them low-toxic. This is how locations that do not get Hill Country water directly, get low-toxic cultivation water which in turn makes rice toxic enough to cause CKDu. About 80 percent of paddy fields in NCR get Hill Country water in Maha season, while only 40 percent would get in Yala. Twenty percent do not get Hill Country water. This explains the clusters of both CKDu and CKDu-free communities in these areas. Thus, rice cultivation conditions are different in locations where Hill Country water or Rainwater is used for rice cultivation within focal locations, and throughout the country. 
In this background, I wonder whose medical opinion the Registrar of Pesticides sought to disregard the opinions of these two medical specialists. Dr Herath being the President of the Nephrology Society, his views must be considered with greater credence if that were necessary. 
What is most crucial to appreciate is that low-level toxic exposure diseases, such as diabetes or alcohol related conditions take a long time as much as 30 to 50 years or more depending on the exposure level. CKDu was first detected in Rajarata in the 1990s. That was over 30 years after introducing fertiliser in Sri Lanka. CKDu began to appear in large numbers about 10 years back. That would be 50 years after the introduction of fertiliser related toxins. Glyphosate was introduced about 30 years ago, we possibly are beginning to see its impact now. If glyphosate has any adverse effects on our health, it will show its vigor in the next ten years or so. It is a fact that we dont have the proven evidence as of now in Sri Lanka or elsewhere. Just like cadmium, if glyphosate were to have an impact, which I am certain it will, it will happen only because of the magnifying effect of Hill Country irrigation water in the very people who are currently subjected to different toxins to the point of annihilation via Hill Country irrigation water. 
If Sri Lanka had established the cause of these conditions known as CKDu, and had eliminated the role of Hill Country irrigation water, one could agree with Dr Pethiyagoda. In the absence of those, one cannot. I equally believe if Dr Pethiyagoda knew the true extend of the crisis, how we have failed to identify the cause(s), what really is the cause, why CKDu is limited to certain parts of the country, why we need precautionary measures, he most certainly would be horrified, and possibly campaign for measures to protect these vulnerable communities, and the country from a catastrophe like no other. I believe, he as an ecologist and environmentalist, would reflect on his views on glyphosate and decide to recommend its ban at least until we have identified the cause(s) of this crisis that is estimated to affect about a million people in the next two to three decades or so.

## Title: Choose a right  school bag for your child

Choose a right  school bag for your child
	

Various models of school bags are available in the market entice students to use different types without worrying about muscular and physical problems they may cause. Backpacks, front packs, double packs, front backpacks, low back packs, shoulder bags, hand bags and wheeled bags are some of their types. Daily carrying of these bags cause heavy impact on spinal cords of young students and is the main reason for their disorders. Several studies in different countries on bags, revealed that the users body posture change while carrying them and neglecting ergonomic principles in their design and their effect on childrens health. Some of these studies have concluded that improper carrying of bags, their weight, their bad form and size and the duration of carrying them are the main reasons for lower back pain.
Backpacks are of special popularity among different groups of individuals, especially students of young ages. Across the country, millions of schoolchildren are racing out to the school buses/vans carrying their text and exercise books in overstuffed backpacks hanging on their shoulders. While carrying a backpack to school each morning might seem harmless enough, it can cause some painful back and neck problems for the children.
While many factors contribute to back pain, poor posture, prolonged inactivity, stress from sports and other activities, heavy backpacks contribute to worsen posture, muscle soreness, shoulder pain and numbness and tingling. A study carried out on 10-18 year old children, the daily physical stress associated with carrying backpacks cause significant forward lean of the head and trunk. It is assumed that daily continuous postural adaptations could result in pain and disability in school children. Non-standard body posture in schoolchildren due to carrying heavy bags have raised concerns in parents, teachers and health authorities. Loads imposed by these bags may have essential roles in skeletal-muscular disorders in students.
Two main disorders thought to be induced by carrying bad backpacks are kyphosis and scoliosis. Researchers have found that carrying backpacks weighing over 10% of the body weight ends in kyphosis and lower pulmonary capacity in individuals. Studies have revealed that heart beat rate, blood pressure and energy used increased in 10 year-old schoolchildren carrying bags of weights over 10 and 20% of their body weight. Moreover, carrying backpacks weighing over 10% of body weight induces negative changes to the childrens shoulders and necks. Skeletal disorders related to carrying bags are concurrent effects of factors like extra weight, size, form and length of bags by students.

Conventional backpacks used as schoolbags adversely affect the health, safety and productivity of developing schoolchildren, in clear opposition to the goals of ergonomics
What is an Ergonomic Backpack 
The incidence of backpack-related pain and injury continue to rise and has reached epidemic proportions. Additionally, what we see is probably just the tip of this iceberg, as kids under report pain and many parents discount the pain reports they do get, because they are young and they see no alternative.
Conventional backpacks used as schoolbags adversely affect the health, safety and productivity of developing schoolchildren, in clear opposition to the goals of ergonomics. They are off-axis, posterior-loading systems, causing the body to compensate with postural distortion. It is postural distortion which is chiefly responsible for chronic musculo-skeletal pain. Any load applied off-axis is unhealthy for this reason. The postural distortion will continue unless the load is aligned with the bodys axis, in obedience to the laws of physics and physiology.
As backpack-use for school has become widespread, numerous articles and programmes have offered instruction and guidelines in backpack safety and many manufacturers claim to offer ergonomic backpacks. These guidelines, and even legislation, focus on limiting the weight put in a conventional backpack.
The term orthopaedic literally means a straight child. It is only during the growth period that one can affect alignment of bones with mechanical means other than surgery, and it is only during the growth period that bones can naturally build density, a lifetime investment.
Therefore, unloading the body is not necessarily a healthy alternative for developing bones. Bones require daily muscle/bone resistance during the growth period in order to build density. Our young people are getting less and less activity and no posture training. Carrying books may be their only opportunity for adequate exercise to increase bone density and prevent osteoporosis, the leading cause of fractures in adults, and increasingly seen in children.
Switching to a backpack with castors is a short-term remedy for discomfort, not a posture-training or bone density solution. A backpack with castors is actually heavier and more awkward when carrying is required (buses, stairs, irregular surfaces etc).
HEALTH, SAFETY CONCERNS BY USING CONVENTIONAL BACKPACK
1. POSTURE DISTORTION: Commonly seen forward head, kyphosis (rounded spine), rounded shoulders, anterior tilted pelvis, and hyper-extended knees. Poor foot alignment.
2. PAIN AND INJURY: To back, neck, shoulders due to poor posture, poor body mechanics: twisting and forward bending. Need for frequent removal, or must sit with poor posture and load on spine.
3. INJURY TO OTHERS: User is unaware of posterior bulk of backpack; can easily knock others down when turning quickly. Trip hazard when left on floor.
4. POOR SECURITY: Accessible to those behind you - not to you. Must remove to access items or to sit down; difficulty in running.
5. CYCLING, INSTABILITY, POOR POSTURE, AWKWARD OR NO ACCESS: Top-heavy, must remove for access; encourages kyphosis, cervical hyper-extension causes neck pain.
6. INCREASED WEIGHT OF LOAD INCREASES POSTURAL DISTORTION: Associated pain.
Things to consider
1. Bag Weight: The recommended weight of any bag should not exceed 10% of the childs body weight
2. Bag Style: The best style of bag is undoubtedly a back pack. This will ensure that the load is carried evenly and distributed evenly. When fitted properly a back pack should contour tightly to your childs back. Features of a bag that are beneficial include:
Adjustable straps  Ensure you can keep the load as close to the back as possible
Hip straps - Assists in the distribution of weight
Padding - Adds comfort to the bag
Compartments  This helps with being able to distribute the weight in the bag as evenly as possible
you should also AVOID any shoulder bags as these cause imbalances and strains on the body. 
3. Lockers - Nowadays most schools have lockers. Encourage your child to use them, rather than carrying all their books with them. This helps reduce the load in the bag.
Backpack fitted to the torso length - The backpack should rest between the C7 vertebrae which is the first and most prominent bone on the spine when you bend your neck forward, and the top of the hip bone (iliac crest). Rest your hands on your hip with the thumbs on the back. The place where the thumbs rest is where you want the bag to rest. If the bag is longer than the torso, there would not be an ergonomic fit. The torso length determines whether you need a small, medium or large backpack.
Wide, padded straps - Thin straps can cut into the shoulders, making the bag uncomfortable to carry.
Sternum belt - The sternum belt will hold the shoulder straps in place.
Compartments instead of a single top loading opening - Compartments help to organize the contents and hold the items snugly against the torso.
Pockets and magnetic flaps - It makes access to bottles and pencil cases much easier. No need to worry about closing the bag.
Waist belt - It distributes the load across the hips if the load is heavy and adds extra stability, reducing the stress on the shoulders and neck.
Padded and ventilated backrest - This would make carrying the bag more comfortable.
Waterproofing - This is to prevent rain or sweaty backs from ruining the items.
Compression straps - Use the compression straps to keep the load snug and compact against the back. Weight of the school bags the children should never carry more than 10 to 15% of their weight in a backpack. Girls complain more than boys of back pain, which may be due to their lighter body weights and typically heavier backpacks.
Schools and teachers can help lessen the load by providing textbook storage, e-books whenever possible and a second set of books for home use, or offering photocopies in lieu of heavy texts. In practice, that would generally mean no more than 3.5kg to 5kg for a child in the first few years of school. Heavy backpacks representing 30% of the body weight and above may modify posture and gait. A child may develop poor posture or a slouching habit as he/she at back to basics. We believe in preventative measures, if you feel your child is experiencing any postural abnormalities, consult your physician as well as a qualified physiotherapist.

Colombo Court Recommits to the Planet on World Environment Day
	
Sanith de Silva Wijeyeratne, CEO, The Carbon Consulting Company handing over the CarbonNeutral Certification to Arun Thapar, Managing Director, Colombo Court Hotel & Spa
Colombo Court Hotel & Spa, Asias first CarbonNeutral hotel, renewed its commitment on the fight against Climate Change for a fifth consecutive year on World Environment Day  a UN global initiative to raise awareness and instill action for the protection of the environment.
A trailblazer in eco-design and sustainability in South Asia, Colombo Court was designed from inception with sustainability at the forefront using recycled and up-cycled material, from the tile floors to a spectacular bike handle sculpture that decorates the entrance of this eco-friendly hotel. Year after year, Colombo Court has implemented emissions-mitigating strategies to lower its impact on the environment, including switching to solar power and using glass bottles to eliminate the plastic use within the Hotel.
Colombo Court announced their green certification renewal on World Environment Day to align their goals with the internationally designated days 2018 theme of Beating Plastic Pollution, reminding everyone the importance of eliminating single-use plastics and proper recycling procedures.
Commenting on their latest achievement, Arun Thapar, Managing Director of Colombo Court Hotel & Spa, said, If you walk down to the coastline or to our rivers, you can see the damage that is being done by the plastic used and dumped into our canals and oceans. This World Environment Day, our team and I are proud of the strides we have taken to reduce our plastic waste and to improve the quality of stay for our guests. We are extremely happy of our continuing long-term partnership with the Carbon Consulting Company, and hope to develop new strategies together that will further reduce our impact on the planet. The message we would like to convey to everyone this year is: If you cant reuse it, refuse it.
Sanith de Silva Wijeyeratne, CEO, The Carbon Consulting Company and Arun Thapar, Managing Director, Colombo Court Hotel & Spa
According to EFL, only 40% of the plastic collected is recycled, whilst over 150,000 tonnes of plastic raw material for production is still being imported into the country, quotes Sanith de Silva Wijeyeratne, CEO of The Carbon Consulting Company. It is inspiring to see clients like Colombo Court take a stand on big issues like plastic waste and empower others in the hospitality industry to do the same. We congratulate them on their achievements and hope to see more in the hospitality and tourism industries follow their lead on helping protect our environment.
