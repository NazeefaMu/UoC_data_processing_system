BEIJING AFP Feb6, 2018 -
China on Tuesday urged Pakistan to rapidly bring perpetrators to justice after unidentified gunmen shot at two Chinese nationals in the southern city of Karachi, killing one of them.   


The two Chinese were in their car in an upmarket area on Monday when the attackers in another car opened fire on their vehicle, according to police, describing it as an apparent “targeted attack”. 

 
One of the Chinese suffered two bullet wounds to his head and later succumbed to his injuries, the head of the government hospital said.   


 “The consulate general of China has sent officials to the hospital and urged the police to solve the case as soon as possible and bring the criminals to justice,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing.   


The two Chinese were working for a shipping company.   


Thousands of Chinese engineers and technicians are working in Pakistan.
