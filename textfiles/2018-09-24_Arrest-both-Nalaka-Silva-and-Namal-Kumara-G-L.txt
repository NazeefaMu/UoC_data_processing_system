The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today urged the government to arrest the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID) DIG Nalaka Silva and Anti-Corruption Force member Namal Kumara in connection with the plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris told a news conference that they believed that there was an attempt to sweep this matter under the carpet.

“Initially, Nalaka Silva was transferred to the Police IT Division instead of arresting him and later sent on compulsory leave under mounting pressure. If it was someone else the authorities would have without doubt have him questioned, arrested and produced in court,” he said.

Prof. Peiris said Namal Kumara who spilled the beans should also be arrested as he had allegedly collaborated in this plot.

He said if something happened to his life, the whole matter would be buried and insisted that IGP Pujith Jayasundara should step down until investigations were over as otherwise there would be a conflict of interest.

Prof. Peiris also called for the strengthening Mr. Rajapaksa's security. (Kelum Bandara)
