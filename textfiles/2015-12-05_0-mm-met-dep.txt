The Meteorology Department said today heavy rains exceeding 100 mm were expected at some places as the atmospheric disturbance was still persisting in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.
The Department said Showers or thundershowers would occur in most parts of the island particularly in the afternoon.
It said sea areas extending from Trincomalee to Colombo via Kankasanthurei and Mannar would be fairly rough at times as the winds could be strengthened up to 50-60 kmph.
