The Elections Commission has summoned a special meeting with the secretaries and representatives of political parties on March 29, to discuss the pending elections to local government bodies and the provincial councils, officials said yesterday.

Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said he intended discussing the steps to be taken regarding these elections and the amendments to the present election laws, in a bid to sort out technical matters.

“We need to introduce advance voting for various sectors such as the media and health. These have to be discussed,” he said.

On a previous occasion the Elections Chief said the Government had no reason to postpone elections to the North-Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils whose tenure ends in September this year.

The elections to the local authorities have been repeatedly postponed on the basis that the delimitation report had not been finalised. (Kelum Bandara)
