Prez should apologize, says LGBTQ+ community


	

President Maithripala Sirisena should apologize to the LGBTQI+ community over his remark made at Government’s rally on Monday in Colombo where he said he was promoting homophobia and public incitement of homophobic hatred.

Members of the Sri Lankan LGBTQI+ community categorically condemned President Maithripala Sirisena’s statement made at Government’s rally in Colombo saying he was promoting homophobia and public incitement of homophobic hatred.

Addressing a news briefing yesterday, LGBTQI+ activist and a lecturer at the Colombo University of Colombo Thiyagaraja Waradas said the President should be held responsible for any injustice that would happen to any LGBTQ+ community following this remark.

“It is the minority LGBTQI+ community in rural areas, who have to undergo the repercussions because of this statement,” Waradas said.

“It is not a matter that can be taken lightly. The President used this term called “butterfly life” with a deliberate purpose to insult the LGBTQI+ community. Although it is a laughing matter for President Sirisena and the audience gathered, it is a huge blow to the entire LGBTQI+ community in Sri Lanka.”

He said this was not the first occasion where he disregarded the community.

When a Cabinet Paper was brought to the Cabinet regarding the LGBTQI+ community rights, President Sirisena showed his agitation and prevented it from being approved in the Cabinet.

“It is unfathomable as to why the President wanted to compare the LGBTQ+ community with the previous Cabinet and Ranil Wickremesinghe,” Waradas added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
