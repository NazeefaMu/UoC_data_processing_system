Relief would be given by the government for the import of electric cars as soon as the problems related to foreign exchange is solved.

While addressing a programme to introduce solar power systems at the Foundation Institute today, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said the government would consider providing electric car batteries for a concessionary rate after solving the foreign exchange problems.

“We are looking forward to grant this relief probably in our next budget and we are having discussions at the moment,” he said.

He said the government had to strengthen the economy first to enable citizens to purchase even two thousand vehicles per day. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
