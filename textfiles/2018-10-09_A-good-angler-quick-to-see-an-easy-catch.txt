A good angler quick to see an easy catch!


	

The political sibling who is the livewire of Pohottuwa has set his eye on a Green stalwart, who is said to be nursing a grouse against the party leadership.

 


This local politico registered an easy win at the last local polls and he is said to be unhappy that the party leadership had failed to recognize his showing at the polls in some form.


The unhappy politico had kept away from the occasion of electing the main chair for the council notwithstanding the keen contest expected evidently making way for Pohottuwa to take the council. The political sibling had been sending feelers to him ever since that event, they say.
