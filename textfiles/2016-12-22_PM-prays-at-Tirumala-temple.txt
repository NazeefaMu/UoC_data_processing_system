Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today prayed at the Lord Venkateshwara temple in Tirumala, the Indian Express reported.

Accompanied by his wife Maithree Wickremesinghe, he paid obeisance to the revered Lord at the hill shrine in the morning.

The couple was accorded a warm reception on arrival by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) Trust Board Chairman Ch. Krishnamurthy, Executive Officer D. Sambasiva Rao and other officials.

The priests presented the Sri Lankan premier the silk 'vastram' of the deity while the authorities gave him 'laddu prasadam' and a memento.

Wickremesinghe described his visit as personal.

"The relationship between India and Sri Lanka is getting stronger day by day and I prayed to the Lord for the welfare of the people," the statement quoted him as saying.

The Wickremesinghes arrived in the temple town on Wednesday evening and had a night halt at the Sri Krishna rest house.

Sri Lanka's Minister for Prison Reforms and Hindu Religious Affairs D.M. Swaminathan and Minister for Infrastructure and Community Development Palany Thigambaram also accompanied the premier.
