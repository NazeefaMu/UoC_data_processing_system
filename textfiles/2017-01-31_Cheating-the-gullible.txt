An electorate organizer of a main political party in the Kandy district is reportedly fleecing the ambitious and affluent political power seekers in the area by promising them party nomination to contest the upcoming local polls. 

 


This organizer hailing from a well-known political family district is said to be hoodwinking the would-be-victims by bragging that his party leader would never turn down a request he makes to him.
Expenses of all public functions organized by this party organizer to promote his own image are borne by the persons whom he has assured party nomination to contest the coming local polls, they say.
