A certain government purohita had to give a small portion of a land belonging to him for a development project linked to a river flowing into the sea at a point close to the city.
The development project was being implemented by a Ministry presided over by another purohita.  By the way, the purohita who owned the land in question was amply compensated for the piece he had to part with. 
One day, a team of officials had with a gang of workmen visited the portion of the land acquired for the project to get on with the groundwork. Just as they got on with the work, the purohita had rushed to the scene as one possessed and started berating the officials. The irate purohita had threatened the officials with dire consequences if they remained on the land a minute longer. 
The officials fearing the worst, left the proposed work site immediately and lodged a complaint at the nearest police station.
The OIC of the Police station realizing the gravity of the complaint summoned all parties concerned for an inquiry the following day. 
The purohita who threatened the officials also attended the inquiry. 
The OIC quizzed the purohita about the serious allegation made against him by the officials.
“What nonsense. OIC Mahattaya,” said the purohita. “We are religious-minded people who don’t mean harm even to an ant. It’s an utter falsehood to say that I held out such a threat to anyone”
The OIC turned to the officials present. “You all heard what the amatituma said. People like him wouldn’t lie. Therefore, consider that the matter is settled and the case closed.” he told them. 
The officials left the Police station without further ado. However, they maintain that the threat made by the purohita is recorded in their mobiles.
