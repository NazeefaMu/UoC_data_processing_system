Sea Marshal Officers' Association today urged the Defence Ministry to take over the sea marshals’ service from Avant Garde Maritime Service (Pvt) Limited (AGMSL) and allow the sea marshals to carry out their duties independently and professionally.
Sea Marshal Officers' Association Convener B.I. Abdeen said with the AGMSL handling the country’s sea marshals’ service, nearly $1700 had been cut from each sea marshal’s salary.
“When we were serving under the supervision of the Defence Ministry we used to earn $2800 monthly from international shipping lines for our risky and responsible job. Nevertheless, after our service was taken by Avant Garde our monthly salary has reduced to $900. The AGMSL did not even ensure our safety,” Mr. Abdeen said.
He told the media that they had sent several letters to President Maithripala Sirisena, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene and Defence Secreatary Karunasena Hettiarachchi on this matter but it had been in vain.
Mr. Abdeen said AGMSL Chairman Nissanka Senadhipath had warned them not to reveal any details about their salary issue to anyone and in case they had done so they would be sacked from the service. (Piyumi Fonseka)Video by Buddhi
