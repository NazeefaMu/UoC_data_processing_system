Police had arrested a coordinating secretary of a yahapalanaya purohita – a party high-up to boot, following a complaint that he had caused extensive damage to a parked vehicle under the influence of liquor.

 


This secretary had gone into a rage on seeing a vehicle parked on the drive leading to his residence and had battered it.  


Later the purohita had intervened to get the secretary released from Police custody. 


Police had taken this secretary into custody on a number of previous occasions for his involvement in similar incidents and the purohita had intervened on all such occasions to obtain his release.
