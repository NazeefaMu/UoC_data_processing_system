A land sale move that stinks of skullduggery


	



 

A story has gone viral in political and TU circles about an underhand move being made by some bigwigs of a Ministry handling the country’s public transport to sell off some tracts of prime land belonging to a department coming under its purview skipping the proper procedure. 

 


A political authority had initiated this underhand move despite the policy upheld over the years to transform these tracts of land into viable revenue sources in order to place the loss-making department on a sound financial footing, they say.


A comely lady who held secretarial status in a Ministry held by the political authority earlier has been assigned the task of finalizing the preliminaries in connection with the sale of the extensive tracts of land belonging to the loss-making department. 


Meanwhile, certain highly concerned organized sections in the department are poised to swing into action and are closely monitoring the situation, they say.
