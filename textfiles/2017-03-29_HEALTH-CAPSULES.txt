What’s healthier, Bananas or Apples?

A banana has 4 times the protein of an apple, twice the carbs, 3 times the phosphorus, 5 times vitamin A, 5 times iron and various other vitamins and minerals. Bananas are also known to be a good source of potassium.  

 

 

What health conditions are bananas good for?

Bananas may be helpful in treating constipation, skin problems, disorders of the nervous system, PMS, anaemia, kidney disorders, stomach ulcers, indigestion, poor blood circulation, hangovers, pain, high-blood pressure, morning sickness and muscle damage.  



Are skin tags dangerous?

Skin tags are benign tumours that don’t usually pose a threat to health unless they are found in areas like the underarms, caused by friction from rubbing. Tags often have a “stalk”, meaning they are thinner than the body of the tag. The pigment may be similar to the surrounding skin, or slightly darker. They are usually no bigger than an apple seed.
