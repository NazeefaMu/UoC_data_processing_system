Avant Garde case: Senadhipathi seeks permission to travel abroad


	

Avant Garde Chairman, Nissanka Senadhipathi, today sought court permission to travel to Singapore for medical treatment.

The motion, filed by Counsel Ajith Pathirana PC representing Senadipathi, is to be taken up on October 20.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya also noticed the Bribery Commission for its stance and requested it be presented to court when the motion is taken up once again.  

The court imposed a travel ban on the suspect after the Bribery Commission filed two cases against him earlier this year.

Senadhipathi is a suspect in the Bribery Commission's inquiry of Avant Guard Maritime Services being permitted to operate a floating armory while earning a profit of Rs. 11.4 billion, a financial loss to the government.

Nissanka Senadipathi is also a suspect of offering and accepting a bribe of Rs. 35.5 million. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
