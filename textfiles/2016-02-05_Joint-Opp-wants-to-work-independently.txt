Joint. Opp. wants to work independently


	

Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya has been requested by Joint Opposition parliamentarians to allow them to work independently in Parliament, MP Kumara Welgama said today.


“Personally, I have not yet decided whether to join a new party. But, I will be continuing my work with the Joint Opposition. However, we have requested the Speaker to allow us to continue our parliamentary affairs in an independent manner,” MP Welgama told reporters while leaving the Welikada Prisons after visiting former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second son Yoshitha Rajapaksa who has been remanded.


He said he would be contemplating on joining a new party which is reported to be formed by opposition MPs, in the event of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa joins or leads the mentioned new party.


As he was the first who quit the UNP-SLFP coalition government, he would be making a decision in the future if the party is actually formed as many people have requested the need of a new political party in the country, he said.  (Piyumi Fonseka)
