A shift from brains to brawn
	
November 16 that witnessed the Speakers chair being carried away and desecrated has already gone into history as a day of infamy and horror of the countrys august assembly.

In the free-for-all that ensued, some Pohottuwa members had not only kicked and punched their opponents who rushed to the rescue of the Speaker, but also sent some of careering across the floor by yanking their clothes and legs, they say.
Soon after the ugly scenes, a young Diyawanna member from Wayamba who had suffered manhandling by Pohottuwa members had sent an SMS inviting another young Pohottuwa member from the South to a real duel at Borella intersection.
The Pohottuwa member accepting the challenge had shown up at Borella at the appointed time along with a group of his colleagues, but the Wayamba member had failed to keep his word, they say.

A Sri Lanka accessible to all
	
The United Nations yesterday marked the International Day of Persons with disabilities (IDPD) with this years theme being Empowering disabled or differently-abled persons and ensuring inclusiveness and equality. According to the UN, this theme focuses on empowering people with disabilities for the inclusive, equitable and sustainable development envisaged in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The 2030 Agenda, pledging to leave no one behind, is an ambitious plan of action of the international community towards a peaceful and prosperous world, where dignity of an individual people and equality among all are applied as the fundamental principle, cutting across the three pillars of the UNs work: development, human rights, peace and security. The UN says, it is critical to ensure, in this regard, the full and equal participation of disabled people in all spheres of society and create enabling environments by, for and with people with disabilities.
More than half of the worlds population now live in urban areas. By 2050, that figure will rise to 6.5 billion people. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces. The 2030 Agenda places great importance on issues related to sustainable urbanization, particularly in Goal 11: make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held at Quito in Ecuador in 2016, recognized the importance of adopting a smart-city approach that makes use of opportunities from digitalization, clean energy and technologies, as well as innovative transport technologies and enabling cities to improve their service delivery. Importantly, the New Urban Agenda acknowledged that future cities, towns and basic urban infrastructures and services need to be more environmentally accessible, user-friendly and inclusive of all peoples needs, the UN says.
Yesterday the UN launched the first Flagship report Report on Disability and Development on the Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities. The UN says it reviewed the progress achieved, explored ways to further empower people with disabilities and provide an overview of the international framework of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
According to Ajith C. S. Perera, himself disabled and a crusader for the rights of disabled people is qualified academically and professionally and has gained national recognition. He has won international admiration in both Cricket and Chemistry. Personal adversity turned him into a voluntary Accessibility Rights activist. He is a Chartered Chemist by profession, a scholar, a former senior manager in industry, a qualified training instructor, also a former test-match-panel cricket umpire.
Today in a Daily Mirror article, the outspoken activist says for disabled people life is all about accessing with equal opportunity and safety to what they need and what they desire day-to-day. Hence, accessibility with SAFETY to all parts of Buildings and Services including transport) the public needs to access and use in daily life, are not only an inherent right but an essential prerequisite. In 2009, he went to the Supreme Court in a wheelchair and successfully pursued a fundamental rights application seeking equal rights and accessibility for disabled people.
He and 23 other diabled professionals have not only identified the root causes for continual failures and significant lapses but formulated a technically sound set of 10 remedial measures - with each proposed action focusing to arrest and solve a specific major problem.
With continual close observations over the last 7 years (2012  2018), on the enforcement of the Accessibility Laws and a Court Order dated April 27, 2011, a set of 23 professionals of us possessing the widest practical knowledge on this subject, have not only identified the root causes for continual failures and significant lapses but formulated a technically sound set of 10 remedial measures - with each proposed action focusing to arrest and solve a specific major problem.
On this International Day, it must be encouraging news for the 4 million Sri Lankans with limited mobility - the largest minority of people of Sri Lanka  that he and others have already asked the Supreme Court to re-activate invocation to seek redress the rights of disabled people.
The activist says he is positive that the Supreme Court, in the larger national interest, shall soon incorporate all these measures in full to the anticipated comprehensive judgment and thereby enable the disabled to start implementing their long felt dream of a Sri Lanka accessible for all.

An Appeal for National Stability  from Religious leaders
	
The President and Leaders of political parties,

This statement is being issued by a multi-religious group of Sri Lankan citizens, including several religious leaders, with no vested interests.
	We have been compelled to come together to speak with one voice as we are extremely concerned and are in fear of what our country is facing today.
	The people have also patiently watched how the moral fabric of our society is being torn apart, and the economy and security of peoples livelihoods threaten to reach unrecoverable depths

Since October 26, 2018, the citizens of this country have been plunged into a state of confusion, chaos, fear and deep anxiety. As the days evolved, one political event succeeded another, and each of them left us more confused and saddened, and with a growing sense of despair and frustration.
Those responsible for this crisis are none other than you, the leaders in whom the people of our country have placed their trust. The people of our country are completely aware that the root cause of this serious breach of trust that has let us down in more ways than one, is your own narrow political agendas and desire for power. The vast majority of our people have watched these adverse developments over the past weeks, patiently and silently.
They have noted how those of you occupying the highest seats of political power have usurped your responsibilities of good governance with scant regard for the legitimate rights and welfare of the people. The people have also patiently watched how the moral fabric of our society is being torn apart, and the economy and security of peoples livelihoods threaten to reach unrecoverable depths.
Since you are the cause of this crisis it is your responsibility to resolve it. No amount of blaming others will resolve our predicament.
Enough is enough. The people are exhausted and are fast losing patience. Accept your mistakes, sit together and put the country and the needs of the people first. Abide by the constitution, respect our democratic traditions and restore political stability, and law & order, by establishing stable governance. Those of you who will provide leadership and make sacrifices to bring about this change will be remembered by the people, especially at election time.
One thing is certain, you have no right to hold twenty one million people to ransom or subject them to prolonged confusion any longer. You must deliver now, or step aside and allow those who can, to serve us. These are the honourable options before you.
Venerable Galkande Dhammananda Thero, Venerable Prof Wijethapure Wimalaratne Maha Thero, Bishop Duleep de Chickera, Venerable Dr Uduhawara Ananda, The Rt Rev. Norbert Andradi, The Rev.

Aussie cricketer Khawaja's brother arrested over 'terror hit list'
	
The brother of Australian international cricketer Usman Khawaja has been arrested as part of an investigation into a terror plot.
Meanwhile, New South Wales Police are preparing to charge Arsalan Khawaja over what they allege was a 'planned and calculated' attempt to frame a Sri Lankan student as a terrorist.
The 39-year-old will be charged with perverting the course of justice under Commonwealth legislation, as well as forgery under NSW law, after he was arrested in Parramatta this morning.
His arrest follows an investigation into an allegedly fake list of terror targets found in a notebook that was used as evidence to charge Sri Lankan-born PhD student Mohamed Kamer Nizamdeen with a terror offence. 
Mr Nizamdeen was charged with a terror offence in August and spent four weeks behind bars before charges were dropped against him due to a lack of evidence connecting him to the notebook.
Assistant Commissioner Mick Willing said police will be alleging "he [Mohamed Kamer Nizamdeen] was set up in planned and calculated manner, motivated by a personal grievance."
The 25-year-old is now seeking costs and compensation after he spent four weeks behind bars.
Assistant Commissioner Willing said police regret and felt "very sorry" about the time Mr Nizamdeen spent in custody, but stopped short of apologising to him.
"We regret the circumstances which led to him being charged and the time he subsequently spent in custody. We feel very sorry for him and what has happened to him."
He said acting early to prevent a potential terrorist threat was critical.
"We regret what happened to Mr Nizamdeen. But, really, the person who is responsible for what occurred to him is the person we're alleging manufactured this document," he said.
Sri Lankan publication, Daily News, reported that Arsalan Khawaja was one of Kamer's supervisors at the University of NSW.
The seized notebook allegedly contained a list of potential terror targets including the Sydney Opera House, police and railway stations.
Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, ex-foreign minister Julie Bishop and their Liberal Party colleague Bronwyn Bishop were also listed as potential targets.(Source SBS News)

Australian dissolution is not similar to Sri lanka
	
Comments on the Comparison of the Present Constitutional Question with the Dismissal of the Whitlam Government in Australia

There seems to be a serious misunderstanding about Sri Lankas Constitution with respect to the Presidents power to dissolve the Parliament.
It is claimed that under the parliamentary system, the President may dissolve the Parliament at his or her discretion at any time during its term. This is the central question before the Supreme Court in the proceeding challenging the Presidents proclamation purporting to dissolve the current Parliament. I have expressed my opinion on this question elsewhere.
The purpose of this note is to clear up another confusion. Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, among others, had cited as a precedent the dismissal of the Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and the dissolution of both Houses of Parliament by the Governor-General in 1975.
This involves serious misunderstandings of the facts concerning the dismissal and the relevant provisions of the Australian Constitution.
The political events surrounding the dismissal of Whitlam were both acrimonious and controversial.
They are too complex to document here. The immediate cause of the dismissal and dissolution was the Senates denial of supply to the government by deferring decisions on two Appropriation Bills which had already received Lower House approval.
The protracted deadlock breaking process set out in s 57 (that can involve a double-dissolution and a General Election) could not be used as supply would have run out by then.
G-G John Kerr tried but failed to persuade Mr Whitlam to advise dissolution on the principle that a government that cannot secure supply through Parliament should either resign or advise a new election.
The G-G then sought the following guarantees from the Leader of the Opposition Mr Malcolm Fraser, namely, that if appointed Caretaker PM, he would:
1. Ensure that the Appropriation Bills will be passed by the Senate to secure supply,
2. Advise the G-G to dissolve both House and hold a general election, and
3. Maintain the status quo on policy, appointments etc. during the caretaker period.
The G-G, armed with these assurances, dismissed Whitlam, appointed Fraser as Caretaker PM and dissolved both Houses.
The two Houses can only be simultaneously dissolved under s 57 to break deadlocks.
There were several other bills of the Whitlam government that were deadlocked and served as triggers for a double dissolution.
It is important to note a few salient constitutional rules and principles and points of difference between the Whitlam saga and the present impasse in Sri Lanka.
1. The claim that in the classic Westminster parliamentary democracy, the monarch has untrammelled power to dissolve the Parliament is fallacious.
Since the early 19th Century at least, the monarch was constrained by convention to follow the PMs advice and the PM was likewise restrained by convention. Whatever discretion the monarch had in the UK was removed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (c. 14). The Act, which fixes the term of the House of Commons as 5 years, allows earlier dissolution only if:
(a) A vote of no confidence in the government is carried in the House of Commons, or
(b) The House of Commons requests a dissolution by a vote of two thirds of the House.
The Nineteenth Amendment incorporated these two conditions in limiting the Presidents power to dissolve Parliament.
2. According to s 64 of the Australian Constitution, the Ministers, including the Prime Minister, serve at the pleasure of the Governor-General. The President of Sri Lanka has no such power. He or she must choose as PM a member likely to command the confidence of the House who can then be dismissed only by Parliament.
3. Unlike the Whitlam Government, PM Wickremasinghe and the Cabinet have obtained supply and have shown the ability to secure future funding for the governments recurring expenditure.
4. Sri Lanka is not a classic parliamentary system in the Westminster model.
The Presidents has no prerogative powers. His powers are limited by the express words of the Constitution which he has undertaken by affirmation to observe.

Book Launch Review of the Southern Border of Sinharaja
	

Sinharaja is Sri Lankas flagship for conservation of rainforests and it is the only National Wilderness Heritage area that receives the highest level of legal protection under Sri Lankan conservation laws. Despite its significance, Sinharaja forest is increasingly threatened by potential developments and calamities that occur naturally, triggered by anthropogenic activities. 

It is in this regard that Environmental Foundation Ltd. (EFL) is publishing a book on the Review of the Southern Border of Sinharaja; Contemporary needs against conservation. The book will be launched on 7 December 2018 at the British Council Library from 6.30pm onwards. This book elaborates a study conducted to assess the present status of Sinharaja, the gaps in conservation and current practices with emphasis on utilising Sustainable Forest Management as a means of addressing the underlying threats posed to the southern border of Sinharaja.
EFL is a pioneer public interest litigation organisation dedicated to environmental conservation in Sri Lanka. Established in 1981, EFL has legally supported environmental protection for over 35 years, with more than 250 court cases with significant victories such as halting Sampur coal power plant, the privatisation of Galle Face Green and Eppawala phosphate mine. With a mission to conserve and protect Sri Lankas natural environment, EFL has become an organisation reputed for key breakthroughs in safeguarding Sri Lankas natural environments, influencing policy and legislature and fostering a sense of environmental stewardship among the citizens of Sri Lanka. Throughout EFLs illustrious history, EFL has published several leading Environmental Law publications such asthe Judges & Environmental Law: A handbook for the Sri Lankan judiciary, Your Environmental Rights and Responsibilities: A handbook for Sri Lanka and many others.

With a mission to conserve and protect Sri Lankas natural environment, EFL has become an organisation reputed for key breakthroughs in safeguarding Sri Lankas natural environments, influencing policy and legislature and fostering a sense of environmental stewardship among the citizens of Sri Lanka
The publication on the southern border of Sinharaja forest aims at rekindling the intrinsic conservation values of the readers and stimulate discussions on conservation. As the passion for conservation emanates from an understating of the core benefits embraced by pristine rainforests such as Sinharaja, this publication seeks to create awareness which would trigger effective conservation. 
The event will be graced by Mr. Anura Sathurusinghe, the Conservator General of Forest while the guest speaker for the evening will be Prof. Savithri Gunatilleke, a renowned Sinharaja conservationist. 
The event is open to the public and entrance will be free of charge. The public is requested to RSVP by 5 December 2018 to mail@efl.lk

Climate change a matter of life or death: Guterres
	

DPA, 03rd DECEMBER, 2018 - UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the world is in deep trouble with climate change at the official opening of a UN climate conference in Poland on Monday.
For many people, regions and even countries, this is already a matter of life or death, Guterres told the representatives from just under 200 states who are taking part in the annual gathering, this year taking place in the southern Polish city of Katowice. We are still not doing enough, not moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption, Guterres said.
For two weeks, the delegates will be in Poland to focus on fleshing out the rules for financing and implementing the 2015 Paris agreement.
The Paris pact provides an outline for countries working together to limit the Earths warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said it was vital the Paris accord goals be met. Most efforts to prevent the planet heating up relate to stopping the release of greenhouse gases as soon as possible.
However, the measures promised so far worldwide to reduce harmful greenhouse gases are far from sufficient to meet this goal.
During his opening speech, Guterres underlined the importance of a collective commitment and more action and more ambition to prevent global climate chaos from ensuing.

## Title: Constitutional crisis heading to a solution:But on whose terms 
## Section: Opinion

Constitutional crisis heading to a solution:But on whose terms 
	

The constitutional crisis that had plagued the country for over six weeks appeared to be heading to a closure. That prospect however is subject to the next earthy temptation in an unruly mind of the executive president, and chaos he sowed by his arbitrary sacking of the government of Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, as of the weekend, it appeared, President Sirisena has finally decided to call it a day.
Last week, at a meeting with a delegation of Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarians, he acknowledged that his purported Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa does not command the majority in Parliament. He asked the TNA and the political Opposition to resubmit a fresh No Confidence Motion, and follow electronic voting to count votes in contrast to the voice vote with which the previous resolutions were passed.
If submitted, this would be the fourth No Confidence Motion, President Sirisena has ignored the verdict of three consecutive NCMs passed by Parliament so far.
Earlier last week, 14 MPs of TNA informed the President that TNA will support the restoration of a Government headed by the UNF (United National Front) and asked the President to revert to the government that existed before October 26th.
With the support of the 14 TNA MPs, the UNP (with 103 MPs of its own) is in a position to muster 117 MPs, four more than the simple majority of Parliament. In addition, there are six JVP MPs who have opposed the MR government, but have chosen to remain neutral vis-a-vis the UNP.
However, the Presidents change of heart is not so much about Parliamentary arithmetic, which he has ignored all along. The explanation may lie in two forthcoming rulings by the Supreme Court and Appeal Court. The first is a series of Fundamental rights Petitions challenging the constitutional basis of the dissolution of Parliament by President Sirisena. The Supreme Court earlier issued a staying order against dissolution. Now a seven member bench is expected to hear the case this week, and the ruling is scheduled to be announced as early as December 7th. The second is the Quo Warranto Writ petition filed by 122 MPs questioning the legitimacy of PM Rajapaksa and his government. The Court of Appeal yesterday issued notice on Respondents and directed them to show by what authority they hold office.
The two forthcoming court rulings have tested the Presidents resolve. He previously admitted that he did not consult the opinion of the Supreme Court before making his controversial decisions on arbitrarily sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe, appointment of MR in his place, and finally his desperate dissolution of Parliament.
President Sirisena, had so far treated the majority will of Parliament with partisan contempt. However, two potentially unfavourable rulings by the Supreme Court, which also functions as the Constitutional Court and the Court of Appeal could probably provide the context for his impeachment on the grounds of violating the constitution.
This eventuality has also prompted the President to consider rescinding the previous gazette notification on dissolution of Parliament. Appointing a new PM who reflects the will of the House of Parliament would be the first step.
Interestingly, the TNA held an olive branch to the President when it assured that it would not support the impeachment of the President. Similarly, the political grouping of Mano Ganeshan has also extended a similar undertaking to the President. Muslim political parties may follow suit. That coupled with UNPs inability to garner the required two-thirds majority and the extreme polarization in Sri Lankan politics may throw a lifeline to President Sirisena. However, there are other challenges to the President as he tries to pull himself up from current political impasse.
There, it is not meek Ranil Wickremesinghe, who lacks ingenuity to run rings around his political opponents that the President should be worried. It is canny MR who may play the devil. Sirisena unleashed the gene when he appointed, (or even coaxed in to the office) MR. Now he wants to sack the same man. But the latter is not going to take that lying down.

President Sirisena, had so far treated the majority will of Parliament with partisan contempt. However, two potentially unfavourable rulings by the Supreme Court, which also functions as the Constitutional Court and the CoA could probably provide the context for his impeachment on the grounds of violating the constitution
President Sirisenas dignified exit and restoration of the status quo of Parliament prior to October 26 is a slap on MRs face. He has made it clear that he has no intention to leave the office. He has challenged the President to sack him. Sirisena feels he lost the bargain. If he could oust Ranil, it would be a bonus, but the operative word now is to control the damage of his folly, and salvage whatever possible of his legacy.
Whereas MR tends to believe that the full scale of power grab, the duo hatched, would materialize sooner or later. Staying the course is the key, irrespective of international condemnation and the crumbling economy. All of which are subordinate to his personal ambitions.
In the process, MR and his goons have made an ass of their purported government. Last week, they boycotted parliament for a whole week, in order to avoid further humiliation. Parliament which previously passed three No Confidence Motions, last week passed a motion, cutting off funds to the new government.
There are regular instances where aggrieved opposition parties have boycotted Parliament. (That had been a common sight in Bangladesh, where the two feuding ladies, Sheik Hasina and Begum Kalida Zia took it as a national past time, until the latter chose to boycott the election itself, and landed in wilderness, and later in jail)
But, MR and his acolytes have brought this to a new level of chicanery That is a first in the world, where a sitting government had boycotted Parliament. Whether the joke is on MR or President Sirisena is yet to be seen. The widening gulf between the two individuals is palpable.
The President seems to be trying to pull himself up from the hole he dug himself into. MR keeps digging. He is neither a liberal democrat, nor a believer of constitutionalism. Those like MR are propelled by the grassroots ignorance of our societies and prey on their ugliness, racism and retrograde populism. MR is exploiting the current political crisis to exploit the ethnic polarization, while Sirisena wants a break from the crisis. Whatever the immediate outcome, the President may regret for creatingthis mess.

Reviewing the Book Optimum Nutrition for Beating Diabetes by Dr. Renuka Jayatissa (MBBS, MSc, MD, FPGIM)

The morbid disease named Diabetes is a Global problem with devastating human, social and economic impacts. Having secured 30 years of service as a Medical officer, Public Health Specialist and Nutrition Specialist attached to the Ministry of Health, Dr. Renuka Jayatissa comes forward with a wholesome and informative book tackling all aspects of the disease. Having worked with UNICEF Colombo to serve the displaced population, this work is but another step in the direction of community care by the writer.
Optimum Nutrition for Beating Diabetes presents a 10-chapter analysis of Diabetes in its variations, its understanding, its symptoms, relevant courses of action and personalised precautions. It simplifies complex and advanced medical information which enables a wide spectrum of readers to absorb its benefits.
It discusses in-depth conditions like hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, gestational diabetes and other subject matter one may not typically be aware of. Following a clear differentiation of the 4 types of Diabetes and each of their relevant causes, the book moves on to self-identification, interpretation of symptoms and finally to defence mechanisms against the disease. Instructions to evaluate blood glucose levels, BMI, daily energy intakes etc are provided.
A step-by-step method of classification allows the reader to analyse oneself and follow relevant meal plans which include arrays of pragmatic options. Tabulated data reveals menus based on ideal quantities, necessary nutrition and recommended carbohydrate intake. Readers will discover daily meal options which even consider ones occupation, weight, activeness, BMI and ultimately find what best suits them.
In addition to dietary suggestions, the book explores a chapter on how exercise is extremely important in managing blood sugar levels in diabetic people because of its effect on blood glucose and fatty free acids. It includes practical and doable suggestions to attain a moderate level of burnt calories.
Prof. Sarath Lekamwasam writes that this book written by Renuka fills a major void in the diabetic care in this country.
Blending the factual with the practical, Dr. Renuka has compiled an intrinsically organized, easy-to-understand guidebook which tackles the foreboding disease and ultimately presents it as positively preventable. The authoress encourages her readers to follow simple but effective lifestyle alterations against the disease. The reader-friendly book takes into consideration all aspects one must be aware of in order to beat Diabetes and in this manner becomes a useful guidebook for its readers. It includes tips, tables, charts and pictorial food guides that enlighten not only pre-diabetics and diabetic patients, but also any individual seeking information regarding this extremely relevant health crisis.
Dr. Renuka Jayatissa is currently the head of the Department of Nutrition at the Medical Research Institute and extends this publication with the hope of uplifting the diet and diabetic knowledge possessed by medical professionals and the public.

Elmo Jayewardene,  Kakiyan: The Story of a Crow
	
Most people, asked to consider crows and their usefulness, if any, in our public life, would call them scavengers. I suppose that I might have done the same today, if I had not been invited by Elmo Jayewardene to edit his new novel for publication. Having completed that task and handed his manuscript back to its author, I can honestly say that I shall never again be able to see a crow or hear its kaw! without feelings of affection and deep respect.
Kakiyan must be one of the most endearing birds that ever entered the field of literature. He is certainly not the most beautiful. The crown of physical beauty has long been in the possession of the Peacock and the Ceylon Grackle, the second of whom scholars of Sinhala know as the Selalihini, the bird that Totagamuwe Sri Rahula, a scholar monk of the 15th century, chose to carry his poetic message, the Selalihini Sandesaya. Dont fly too high, the poet warned his messenger in a famous passage, or one of those sky-goddesses who frequent the clouds might see your sleek black feathers and golden wattles, and, mistaking you for a jewel or a flower, pluck you out of the sky and place you in her hair as an ornament. 
No such praise can ever come Kakiyans way. His plain black coat prevents that, and he knows it. Nor does he have the sweetest voice in the avian world: that prize has long been shared by two birds associated with English literature, Shelleys Skylark and Keatss Nightingale. The admirable thing about Jayewardenes Sri Lankan hero  among his many other virtues, which include loyalty and a compassionate heart<U+0336> is that he is totally lacking in envy and has no desire to borrow other birds feathers to enhance his own reputation. Dont mistake me for any high-flying Seagull, please! he tells his reader. My name is not Jonathan Livingston, it is Kakiyan the Crow, son of Stanley and Alice Crow, and brother of Rodney and Lucille. A glance at an encyclopaedia will inform the reader that Sri Lankas Kakiyan is a scion of the ancient corvidae family, with an ancestry that goes back to the Raven that flew from Noahs Ark in the time of the Great Flood, and has spread internationally  indeed, as far as the United States, where another raven inspired one of the best-known poems of Edgar Allan Poe. But you will never hear this from the author himself, for Kakiyan is a modest bird who plumes himself on nothing but his rare ability to tell an enthralling story and, at the same time, celebrate the wisdom of his community.
In reading the autobiography of this remarkable author, the reader gains a birds eye view of the human condition, for Kakiyans adventures have led him into law courts, football fields and many other places where people foregather, usually oblivious of the fact that a beady eye is trained upon their activities. His insights are valuable, his judgements reliable: he is not just a crow, he is a just crow. We have a lot to learn about our own world from Kakiyan, from his mother, the matriarch Alice Crow, from old Roy Crow, the optimist who unfailingly finds the silver linings in every cloud, from his philosophical brother-in-law, the meditative Cameron (Cato) Crow, and from all the other characters who fly in and out of his pages. 

The crown of physical beauty has long been in the possession of the Peacock and the Ceylon Grackle, the second of whom scholars of Sinhala know as the Selalihini
Towards the end of this remarkable tour de force, this Kaputu Kathawa of a twenty-first century crow, Kakiyan speculates about the after life: where will his last flight take him As his admiring and grateful editor, I would say that he need have no worries about that. Cool, calm and confident, Jayewardenes hero undeterred, will join the shining ranks of Heavens literary birds.

Who can legally accept the Speakers ruling (Photo AFP)

The Chief Justice reached this place of eminence with his judicial experience in the minor judiciary-is an ornament for career judges who-take to long to reach high office

See. ...see..do you see.. a glint of light with a silver lining amidst the dark clouds that overhang the public domain  I do. Peer degrees penetratively to see the glimmer of hope during these hopeless days; when hope itself has flown away. 
While those wretched parliamentarians talk of sovereignty, picked in the chambers of dodgy lawyers they consulted to find a comfort zone to laze in the sun for just a few more days, ( legal giants of the past- H.L de Silva, E.D Wickremanayake S.L.Gunasekera would think of the black-coated minions of today) Fortunately the Presidents orders were struck down by an interim judicial pronouncement that made judges heroes of the last resort (possessing a judicial outfit that we can be proud of after carrying whims of the executive for too long) restored a semblance of confidence. Knowing those worthy robed judges from a distance, the final order, maybe with an enlarged bench - will first extend the stay order until the court gives its final order. Sure will bring sunshine, in these days of gloom and doom, overcoming the present impasse. Is the judiciary the last saviors to guide us on to a proper path 
Look to the judiciary with Colombos legal fraternity sadly being mere nodding dodos- not advisors - but listeners/followers of their political masters. Chief Justice being newly appointed makes his task more onerous, alongside Priyantha and Prassana Jayewardane restored a fighting spirit that spilled over limits of tolerance in the near past made the three member judicial team rooted firmly in my book of heroes. The Chief Justice reached this place of eminence with his judicial experience in the minor judiciary-is an ornament for career judges who-take to long to reach high office while the formers CJs husband avoided incarceration by a whisker. 
Rather doubt if she was sitting as the prime judge in court. Any such reduced punishment for the heinous wrongdoing while where do you hear of those great men of the Bar Association who danced a jig and dropped her like a hot potato when she returned home.She got too big for her boots-now deservingly a forgotten character. 
Searching for a light at the end of a long tunnel that appears to be never ending. Justice should not be rushed nor hurried instead be parried to its rightful place. Let me take you to that light we yearn which is within seeing distance. 
Parliamentarians showed their true self at a session where Speaker lost his bearings. 
His credibility, being deemed partisan. Crazy to state, when an ominous decision is awaited, amidst the pandemonium, that he relies on the sound effects rather than on a count made electronically or physically.Who can legally accept the Speakers ruling Recount is called for, if so. Why does a honest man make such a diabolical ruling in favour of the party that elected him He is partisan, full stop. A night of many mistakes in surroundings where no heroes emerged where most were dubbed as pulp.
Genuine parliamentary way of life
If you truly believe in a genuine parliamentary way of life, rise up and be a man, and vote wisely which is the prime function, to cleanse out the existing crap of parliamentarians-that dance to any tune that suits them at our expense. Who is Wasantha Senanayake hop step and jump specialist-a disgrace to the Senanayake clan - such are the lads today. 
Parliamentary democracy, sick with the sad performance of the men in parliament, it is time to usher a new set of parliamentarians for the better or for worse ridding off the unruly present mob. The assignment is in your hands alone. Would you do it in 2020 or rather live with the motley crowd as at present to represent you If we look at the past, Sri Lankan voters are often taken for a ride with many promises that materialize little as we have short memories of the past. Most UNP/SLFP supporters vote for the official party nominee and cry what can we do, as we are committed to the party of out forefathers. Suffer in silence if you are stupid for another 5 years from 2020 by failing to cast your vote sensibly 
Now is the time to oust both MR and RW because those two champions watched the carnage in parliament without ordering their disorderly members to behave with decorum.Why dont you vote to usher in a newer set of parliamentarians of any party of your choice with fresh thinking  Have you the guts to mark the ballot paper or will you forget the events of last week in parliament when you can vote in 2020 to rid of the rubbish that you have continuously been voted for by you-elected and derided most vocally thereon The ball is in the court of the voter. Legitimately, unless; parliamentarians give a 2/3 majority - voting sensibly is the need awaiting till 2020 belatedly when the people exercise their right to vote. Please do not be too harsh on Jayampathy as he did as well as he could with his mint size brain; what H.W Jayawardane and Mark Fernando did with ability and ease. What more can you expect from the likes of Jayampathy, a protege of Sarah Siva. Naturally confusion is round the corner. Let me labour no more on a worthless issue.

Parliamentary democracy, sick with the sad performance of the men in parliament, it is time to usher a new set of parliamentarians for the better or for worse ridding off the unruly present mob

Need to ask MR just a single question, and await an answer. Why did you scuttle the aspirations of the people by not voting against the 19th and talk big now against the 19th Amendment or tell your blind and sick-minions to vote in haste in favour of such legislation after you knew CJ Siravan failed to provide an answer to counsel Gomin Dayasri and to the issues raised by him in the case of Gomin Dayasri vs Attorney General - the consolidated case on the19th amendment. 
Did you in the opposition seek legal advise before you voted on 19A or can you please tell the public at least what your legal pundits suggested you to do  
A counter to MR
Appearing for myself - Here are the synopsis of the written submissions I propose to make orally if required offer any elucidation. I shall express my opinion as a legal watchdog on the constitution and find a practical solution to end the current crisis tell which I shall place before you before court. 
As a counter to MR holding elections at the most favourable time for himself; the good governance kids made it impossible to hold elections at any time; but only after 4 1/2 years time unless 2/3 of the members voted in favour of a resolution to hold elections earlier. Would these worldly parliamentarians that behaved to discredit themselves give away their privileges which are beyond the means of the ordinary people 
(B ) President Sirisena, a resident from Pollonnaruwa, did well to beat Rajapaksa the resident from Hambantota, but that is history. Things have changed incredibly fast, whereas Sirisena acts according to his fancy in nominating PMs contrary to the Constitution. In most democratic societies impeachment against a President would have been under way for flagrant violation of the constitution, but here he continues to indulge in more mischief making swinging between the UNP and its rivals for his benefit. Both are men with not high as learned and with no inclination to read and learn. Both men react instinctively without any respect for the prime law set out in the constitution. Are we also a nation with a short memory 
In this sad episode who behaved worstThat is easy! Its Sirisena acting without any respect for the constitution; he did it in his own stupid way to cross bridges for his political wellbeing. Each day he does a thing that attracts material for his impeachment.Yet, the biggest loser is Mahinda as he was the comfortable winner on a popular vote from the electorates. Why did he not bide time and await a comfortable win on a popular vote from any combine of parties Did Sirisena fix him for all times....No his trusted legal advisor should be pasted, 
People are fed up as they need the economy improved and they well realise that the persons that suffocate Parliament are the losers. Dont ever be too harsh on a man who wiped out terrorism, but take to the cleaners his advisors and lawyers who make a fool of him, by allowing him to do what he is presently doing! 
Ranil is so unpopular he cannot expect to return as PM and Sirisena realises this fact and takes advantage of it. If Ranil resigns UNP can be revitalized and give a lead to an SLFP and its companion parties to reject Mahinda. That will open the field to a new leader.

It is in the the interest of Ranil and Mahinda to retire gracefully and become senior statesmen so as to come out and guide the nation from their armchairs. They can give their valued opinions without any political coloration.We still need both in different offices for their experiences in security concerns and handling foreigners reinvestments. Let it be the President or Prime Minister or Chief Justice they are all beneath the law including the Constitution. Once the Constitution is deemed passed by the parliament it becomes the supreme law of the land. None in the opposition voted against it.

Implementing Accessibility laws  is imperative: Why For Whom 
	
International Day of Persons with dis-Abilities
	Nearly three years has passed but nothing yet has resulted
	Nearly 4 mn people have restricted access to new buildings

The International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD), since 1992, has been annually observed around the world on December 3.
The theme for this years IDPD focuses on the Empowering of Persons with dis-Abilities for inclusiveness, equal opportunity and equality in daily life. Life is all about accessing with equal opportunity and safety to what you need and what you desire day-to-day. Hence, accessibility with SAFETY to all parts of Buildings and Services (includes Transport), the public needs to access and use in daily life, is not only an inherent right but an essential prerequisite.
The right to enjoy meaningful participation in the economic and social life as FULLY FLEDGED CITIZENS involves easy and safe access to key Parts of Buildings (Steps and Railings, Toilets, Entrances, Floors, etc.) used for Commercial (Hotels, Restaurants, Banks & ATMs, etc.), Educational, Health (Hospitals), Recreational (Shopping Complexes, Sports Stadia, etc.), Social (Places of religious worship, etc.) and Travel (Railways, Buses) purposes.
Therefore the degree to which you could meaningfully enjoy the RIGHT TO ACCESS with Safety shall determine the quality of ones life. It is thus the single most indispensable right on which meaningful enjoyment of several of these other rights depend heavily. It is also the right to empower the widest range of people to unlock their varying abilities and enjoy the optimum use of gainful opportunities afforded by development programs and thereby live life to its fullest.
It shall also benefit wider sectors including pregnant mothers, persons carrying small children or heavy luggage and those convalescing after surgery or illnesses. Consequences of denial of meaningful enjoyment of this indispensable right include: marginalisation, unwanted dependency, push towards poverty, loss of productive opportunities and thereby potentially CRIPPLING precious human life, economically, socially and mentally.

In day-to-day life in Sri Lanka, still, several people with restricted abilities often remain largely marginalised in the man-made environment
REAL Worldyou live
An estimated 20% of Sri Lanka population  or 4 million people  for different reasons, experience restrictions and limitations to physical mobility, stability and dexterity, even to eye sight.
This includes our fastest ageing population (over 65 years are almost a SIXTH of our population), a wide range of people inclusive of those convalescing, living with numerous debilitating medical conditions (that often go unnoticed), using wheelchairs and sticks and even the pregnant. With a blink of an eye, ABILITY could change to varying degrees. Every one of us, for different reasons, is certain to spend some of our time living with limitations in ability - physical, sensory and intellectual.
In day-to-day life in Sri Lanka, still, tens of thousands of people with restricted abilities often remain largely marginalised in the man-made environment. They are forced to fight an uphill battle, even at NEW public buildings. Have you yet not realised that the chances are now very high that, at any stage or any moment in life, for a short time or for a long time, for different reasons, YOU or your loved ones, could experience physical and/or sensory limitations
With continual infringement of your inherent right to Access you will soon be amongst a Most Vulnerable and fast increasing, VOICELESS, UNDERPRIVILEGED and Marginalised Group of nearly 4 million people who are unable properly to access even NEW Buildings. You will then realise that the world around once you knew to be cheerful and kind, is NO MORE so; and most of your essential needs that were easy doing, are now a burden and you are unwantedly depending on others.
The world around would marginalise you and discriminate against you beyond expectations, perhaps for a lifetime.
Poor IMPLEMENTATION of Access Laws
Sri Lanka enacted the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No: 28 of 1996. Clause 23(2) of this Act stipulates:
No person on the ground of Disability, be subjected to any Liability or Restriction with regard to access to or use of ANY BUILDING or Place which any other Member of the Public has Access to or is entitled to use.
Under Clause 23(2) of this ACT, by Gazette No: 1,4657/15 dated October 17, 2006, the Ministry of Social Services promulgated a very comprehensive detailed set of Regulations clearly stipulating: Design and Space Requirements and Safety Measures to be adopted in NEW Constructions. These Regulations were then approved unanimously by our Parliament on March 20, 2007.
Despite three extensions of the deadline by the Social Services Ministry and valiant renewed endeavours, compliance with these Regulations remains poor, except for bits and pieces, here and there, even after 12 years. Worst offenders include many 5 and 4 star Hotels and upper-class Restaurants, numerous places of Higher Education Institutes and Universities, Private Sector Hospitals, high-end Shopping Complexes, Supermarkets and all forms of Transport.
The Parts affected most are Toilets, Steps and Railings, Signage and Ramps at Entrances. Even the design of Tables and Desks at Receptions and in Restaurants continue to pose inaccessibility.
The regulatory authorities have continuously failed to ensure compliance BEFORE issuing Certificate-of Conformity. Construction companies obtain Certificates-of Conformity in the absence of due compliance well. Compliance with design specifications that take into consideration human safety is a low cost and feasible indispensable investment bringing rich dividends to everyone in society.
The colossal waste and the threat to safety of human life caused by the failure to comply with the Laws, is huge compared to the money needed.
The long term mega-development projects are inextricably entwined with the future of the next several generations of Sri Lankans. With this on-going adverse trend there is imminent national disaster, as the next generation of persons suffering from inevitable mobility impediments - numbers of whom will be much larger than at present  will also be prevented from freely accessing and using the facilities therein at a wide range of numerous NEW buildings and enjoying this next phase of development of Sri Lanka.
Back-Peddling of the UN Convention (CRPD)
Based on a proposal made by the Social Services Minster, on February 8, 2016, the Government of Sri Lanka RATIFIED the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
Nearly three years has passed but nothing yet has resulted - even to make a start to implement such a legally binding agreement! Article 9 together with Articles 6 and 7 concerns Accessibility and easy measures to start implementing the CRPD.
The International Community, the UN in particular, who are much concerned about several other rights in this part of the world, in their actions, regretfully, appears to have overlooked the worlds largest minority  the People with dis-Abilities - and allow Countries such as Sri Lanka to remain STUCK at CRPDs birth itself for so..long - as nearly three years - without even starting to crawl in the right direction.

An estimated 20% of population  or 4 million people  for different reasons, experience restrictions and limitations to physical mobility, stability and dexterity, even to eye sight
Root Causes and Remedial Action
Although comprehensive sets of Regulations are there since 2006, continual absence of a rightly identified and clearly stated set of steps enabling effective implementation, remains the stumbling block. As the first step to arrest this trend, in 2009, I appeared in person on a wheelchair at the Supreme Courts and successfully pursued a public interest litigation fundamental rights application under SCFR 221/2009.
With continual close observations over the last 7 years (2012  2018), on the enforcement of the Accessibility Laws and a Court Order dated April 27, 2011, a set of 23 professionals of us possessing the widest practical knowledge on this subject, have not only identified the root causes for continual failures and significant lapses but formulated a technically sound set of 10 remedial measures - with each proposed action focusing to arrest and solve a specific major problem.
On this International Day it must be encouraging news for the 4 million Sri Lankans with limited mobility - the largest minority of people of Sri Lanka  that I have already moved the Court to re-activate invocation under SCFR 273/2018 to seek redress in this regard.
We are positive that the APEX Court, in the larger national interest, shall soon incorporate all these measures in full to the anticipated comprehensive judgement and thereby enable us to start implementing more focused measures WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY, towards achieving realistically our long felt dream, Accessible Sri Lanka for All.

Indias  agri-distress
	


India is an agrarian economy with 60% of the population depending on agriculture.
	In ten years ending in 2016, more than 142,000 farmers had committed suicide.

Indian agriculture is in dire straits. The terms of trade with the other sectors of the economy have been worsening over the years. State investment in agriculture has also been declining compared to investment in industry and other sectors.
Formal credit has been yielding place to the more expensive private sector credit.
All this has led to a widespread and unsustainable indebtedness and an alarming increase in farmer suicide.
In November, agitated farmers took out massive marches in New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.

The suicide rates were the highest in agriculturally prosperous States like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh
Lakhs of them converged on these centres of power to demand higher Minimum Support Prices (MSP), loan waivers, and a special 21 day Parliament session exclusively devoted to their problems.
India is an agrarian economy with around 60% of its population depending directly or indirectly on agriculture.
The Indian agricultural sector accounts for 18% of Indias GDP. And yet, farmer suicides account for 11.2% of all suicides in India.
The India Spend website reported that in the ten year period ending in 2016, more than 142,000 farmers had committed suicide. The highest number of farmer suicides was recorded in 2004 when 18,241 of them took their lives.
According to a paper published by the London School of Economics in 2009, 50% of Indias farmers were in deep debt.
And between 1995 and 2004, 150,000 farmers had committed suicide
The farmers suicide rate in India has ranged between 1.4 and 1.8 per 100,000 total population over a 10-year period, which is very high indeed.
According to IndiaSpend India grew more food grains in 2017 than ever before, and the governments agriculture budget has risen 111% over four years to 2017-18. And yet, prices crashed, unpaid agricultural loans grew by 20%. 600 million farmer families were unable to make ends meet.
Oddly enough, the suicide rates were the highest in agriculturally prosperous States like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh.
In Madhya Pradesh, 46% of farm households are in deep debt. In 2016, 1,321 farmers had committed suicide in that state.

India does not lack scholarship and research. But governments stuck to the beaten track
With farming becoming unprofitable, the farmer population came down by over 8.6 million in 10 years up to 2011. With farmers either leaving for the cities or becoming farm labourers, the number of farm labourers increased by more than 37 million.
The number of small farmers with 2 acres or less, and marginal farmers, with less than 5 acres, rose by 27 million over 15 years up to 2015-16 to reach 126 million, as per the latest agriculture census. Some 70% of Indias 90 million agricultural households spend more than they earn on an average each month, pushing them into debt, which is the primary reason for more than 50% of farmer suicides, studies reveal.
Agricultural growth and agricultural distress seem to go hand in hand. In Madhya Pradesh, despite a 9.4% growth in the states agricultural GDP over 15 years to 2014-15 ( far better than the national average of 3.3% between 2000-01 and 2012-13), the average monthly income of an agricultural household is Rs 6,210, which is less than the national average of Rs 6,426, says the New Delhi based financial daily Mint.
This is because farmers are forced by the system to sell their products at throwaway prices. There are Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) but these have not been of much use to farmers.
Under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme Bhavantar Yojna in Madhya Pradesh, farmers get an MSP only for a part of the produce.
The Bhavantar Yojana takes into account the average produce per hectare, which is decided by the Revenue Department. If a farmer grows 12 quintals in a hectare, and the Revenue Departments average yield estimate is 7 quintal per hectare, the farmer will be eligible only for benefits in line with the governments average yield estimate.
And the Bhavantar Yojana is applicable for only two months during the crop marketing season. Because of this, most of the seasons produce lands up in the market during the two-month window causing a glut in the market and a crash in the prices.

There are too many intermediaries in the agriculture-market chain. Over the years, the intermediaries have grown adding little value to the produce but significantly raising the costs
And then there the middleman. Traders, transporters and officials collude to keep prices down.
Insurance Scheme
Madhya Pradesh has the third largest number of farmers insured under the Prime Ministers crop insurance scheme and also the Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) covering 3.5 million farmers. But only 46% of insured farmers in Madhya Pradesh had received their claims. This is so in other states too.
There are too many intermediaries in the agriculture-market chain. Over the years, the intermediaries have grown adding little value to the produce but significantly raising the costs.
There is also considerable crop loss at all stages and a consequent cost escalation. Fruits and vegetable suffer the most with a loss of 25% to 30% of the production.
Disregarding Mahatma Gandhi and C. Rajagopalacharis ideas, Indias first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru went in for industrialization, neglecting agriculture and the village economy.
Later, with liberalization, economic development was given over to private entrepreneurs, driven by the profit motive. Given the political clout, these elements came to enjoy, all concessions and financial help were directed to them and farmers were neglected.
Farmers had to pay more for inputs manufactured by the privatized industrial sector. But the prices at which the farmers were selling their produce kept coming down partly because governments were keen on keeping food prices low to contain civil unrest.

The Minimum Support Prices offered by successive governments have never been enough to help farmers get a decent income from which they can save and invest.
Since formal credit from banks became difficult because of privatization and the clout of the corporate sharks, farmers had to go to expensive private financiers. Falling into debt became the new normal.
And because of the introduction of High Yielding Varieties during the Green Revolution years in the 1960s, farmers were encouraged to use a lot of water and fertilizers which raised the cost of production. In the absence of surface irrigation in many areas, groundwater was exploited creating a water scarcity over time.
When Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1984, he launched a program to encourage food preservation and export. But this required cold storage and preservation facilities on a large scale, which government did not provide. Nor were farmers organized to create such facilities through cooperatives.
Successive governments have only been tinkering with farmers problem, scratching the surface with schemes brought in as firefighting measures when farmers agitated violently.
India does not lack good scholarship and agricultural research. But governments have stuck to the beaten track and not taken a bold new path.
Meanwhile, the problem is mounting as India becomes a capitalistic economy where the big industrial corporates have the final say in all matters.

Instability will end in a week: President
	
While saying that he would honour and accept whatever ruling passed by the two apex courts in the country, President Maithripala Sirisena today said the political and constitutional impasse gripping the country would come to an end in the next seven days.
However, he pointed out that people in the country hold different views on the recent orders given by the court and added some say it was a good one and some others say it was like the chief incumbent of a temple making a preaching that should have been delivered by the Mahanayaka of the Nikaya.
President Sirisena, who is also the leader of the SLFP delivering the keynote address of the 67th annual convention of the party at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium last afternoon dedicated a major part of the his speech to explain the circumstances that led to the current political and constitutional crisis and severely criticized former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe branding him as the chief architect to it.
I quit the SLFP on November 19, 2014, to fight against corruption, selling of State assets, waste and collapse of the rule of law etc. I took a decision on October 26, 2018, on the same reasons to fire Ranil Wickremesinghe from the premiership and appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa to replace him, President Sirisena stressed.
He said the SLFP holds its annual convention at an extremely critical juncture of Sri Lankas political history. Some say this was a huge political crisis. There is no political crisis in the country right now but a political clash or political differences. If there is a conflict all must be dedicated to resolve it as conflict resolution is a science.
I salute to 6.2 million voters (most of them were UNPers) who voted me to power on January 8, 2015. The two critical decisions that I took to quit the SLFP and fire Ranil from the premiership in November 2014 and October 2018 respectively were correct, prudent and timely decisions taken after much thought to save the country and nation. Both of them were taken considering the national requirements. They were analytical judgements taken based on a political ideology and against corruption, theft, crimes. The objectives of those judgements were to restore decency, rule of law and spiritual cleanliness in the society, President Sirisena emphasized.
He said he appointed Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister soon after he was sworn in as the Executive President following the election victory on January 8, 2015.
From the very beginning, Ranil started to destroy all the hopes kept by 6.2 million voters who elected me to power and trampled all the pledges and undertakings during the poll campaign. I took all these wicked, cruel and dictatorial actions of Ranil in my strides with extreme patience and restraint for three and half years thought it was not an easy exercise. I remained in the SLFP for four years with undergoing same painful experience before I decamped from the party and I did the same for three and half years before taking the decision to sack Ranil from the premiership on October 26. The removal of Ranil and appointing Mahinda as the PM is not a hasty decision. I felt enough is enough by that time and sacked Ranil accordingly as Ranil destroyed the country and the economy. He also ruined the grant old party, the UNP established, built and made one of the biggest political forces in the country by great politicians like, D.S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, JR Jayewardene and R Premadasa. Though there are ideological and policy disparities between the UNP and SLFP, both parties are greatly respected political parties in the country. It was this party that is destroyed under Ranil. He not only destroyed the UNP but he also destroyed me politically to some extent. Ranil made the concept of Yahapalanaya meaningless. The only solution to this disaster was to expel him from his post, President Sirisena added.
We are required to choose a political path that would be suitable for us. I explained to him the calamity brought about by the Central Bank bond scam. He did not listen. He withdrew powers given to local government bodies. He was fully dedicated to neo liberal policies that do not suit our country. He did not realize that those alien economic policies ruin our country. He deceived people in the North. We would have given many a benefit to the people in the North without obliging to create a federal system. He deliberately ignored to provide facilities to the Northern People.
I took five important decisions and issued five gazettes on them as the Executive President for the good of the country. I did all of them to protect democracy and in bona-fide intentions. I expelled Ranil and appointed Mahinda as Prime Minister. I prorogued Parliament and later dissolved Parliament. I did all these things to save the country. The country has not experienced something like this since we gained independence in 1948. This impasse is completely a new experience to all of us. However, this kind of crisis is not something new to other countries where Parliamentary democracy exists. In Germany, Italy or Australia, Parliaments remain dissolved for months and without proper governments to rule the country. The country has experienced a social uncertainty for two to three weeks. The petitions pertaining to Constitutional issues in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court are not criminal cases. We respect and accept whatever judgements given by these apex courts. However, I repeat what I told the UNP Parliamentary group on Monday night that I am determined not to reappoint Ranil as the Prime Minister even the entire 225 members of Parliament demanded to do so.
I dont have any personal grudge with Ranil. He is a person who is suitable to give the leadership to this country. He must not be given the opportunity to run this country as he does not have a vision or plan for the country and nation. I am aware that those UNP supporters, who voted for me in 2015, hate me. But they must realize that it was their party leader Ranil who ruined their party. The only political party that can give patriotic, people friendly solution to the problems and sufferings of our people is the SLFP as opposed to neo liberal, destructive and anti-national policies of the UNP. The curse on the country and nation created by Ranil would be eliminated in a weeks time and the country will be back to normalcy. We all resolve ourselves to save the country from this calamity, President Sirisena noted.

Iran will continue missile tests after US allegations
	

REUTERS, 03rd DECEMBER, 2018 - Iran said on Sunday it would continue missile tests to build up its defences and denied this was in breach of U.N. resolutions capable of carrying multiple warheads. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday condemned what he called Irans testing of a medium-range ballistic missile in violation of the 2015 international agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme, from which Washington has withdrawn. 
Missile tests ... are carried out for defence and the countrys deterrence, and we will continue this, Brigadier- General Abolfazl Shekarchi, spokesman for Irans armed forces, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency. 
This is outside the framework of (nuclear) negotiations and part of our national security, for which we will not ask any countrys permission, Shekarchi said. 
He did not confirm or deny Iran had tested a new missile.

Is there a difference between Ranil and Mahinda 
	

Sri Lanka has become the centre of attraction in the Asian political scene with the islands government struggling to survive sans the majority in parliament. 
The latest we hear of is the attempt planned by President Maithripala Sirisena to take a vote on Wednesday (December 5) to oust Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa because he doesnt have the support of the majority in parliament. 
If one thing is clear about the present set of Sri Lankan politicians, who are in the news, except Ranil Wickremesinghe, the majority are poor decision makers. President Sirisena initially allowing Wickremesinghe to function beyond the mandate of his premiership amounted to be his own decision making. This, Sirisena said, was due to Wickremesinghe offering his support to him to become the President, in 2015. Then Sirisena removed Wickremesinghe and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as premier, but that too backfired because the majority in parliament dont recognise him (Rajapaksa) nor support him. Now its evident that Sirisenas choices made in politics, especially as President, are failures. Given the present scenario the UNP is on a good wicket. Despite squabbles within the UNP the support within is still for Wickremesinghe to be the Prime Ministerial candidate from the party. It is also reported that the grand old party has decided to back their experienced leaders despite attempts made by the young brigade now and then to have a new leader for the party.
Need of an experienced Leader
The present environment in the UNP is similar to how things were back in the early 1990s. Country President and part leader J.R Jayewardene had retired and was forced to decide between Ranasinghe Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali as UNPs new leader. Its said that Jayewardene fancied Dissanayake or Athulathmudali to be his successor. But the turmoil in the country made him realize that whoever came to the hot seat as the party leader wouldnt last long. Thats why he handed over the party leaders post to Premadasa; his thinking being that the new UNP Leader would mentally burn out or physically perish due to the political heat that existed. He knew that survival for whoever who came to power after this challenging period would be easier. This was conveyed to this writer some years ago by veteran political writer the late Prasad Gunawardene. 

On the other hand people have now begun to question the pedigree of the lawmakers
Right now the political inferno within the island suggests in no uncertain terms that one needs an experienced leader at the helm; whether its the UNP or the Government. From a totally helpless situation Wickremesinghe sees the pendulum swinging his way due to the developments within the Parliament to remove Rajapaksa from the post of Prime Minister. These developments give strength to Wickremesinghes resolve. 
Wickremesinghe has recently affirmed that the legislature has the power to decide on a course of action to stabilise the country as its the institute which exercises the peoples sovereignty. He has said that the power vested in the parliament according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution affords for that. 
At present there are many peaceful protest campaigns being staged in the country in support of an alternative force to rule this nation. One such campaign is Rise for Justice which is taking place in Town Hall. 
Most of these efforts also highlight the fact that Wickremesinghe was removed in an unjust manner. Initially Wickremesinghe continued to call himself Prime Minister despite Rajapaksa being officially appointed for this post by Sirisena at a swearing in ceremony. But as the days rolled by, even Wickremesinghes press releases made references to him only as UNP Leader. 
Wickremesinghe has not shelved his dreams to be the Prime Minister of the country. There are reports that three heavy weights in Sri Lankan politics, Rajapaksa, Sirisena and Wickremesinghe, have agreed to do whatever is possible to restore the political crisis. But deep within Wickremesinghe lies that burning ambition to be in charge of the admin machine that accounts for the countrys governance, for a long time. As with Wickremesinghe his vision to be at the helm, regardless of whether its premiership or party leader, is till eternity. 
The criticism within the UNP towards Wickremesinghe has died down a bit. The big wigs in the party like Kabir Hashim, Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake have backed their leader to the hilt. The UNP led by Wickremesinghe sees the support of the TNA and JVP during this political impasse. UNP Chairman Hashim stated recently that Wickremesinghe is the party partys nominee for the post of Prime Minister. 
The two no-confidence motions passed in parliament suggests that there is great danger of the Year 2019 Budget not being passed. A government cant survive for long depending on a Vote on Account to release the funds for its expenses. There must be a stable government with the support of the majority which can pass any bill within parliament. 
Grabbing power
As the countdown for the festive season has begun in December, so do the days before the Supreme Court gives the final verdict regarding the case filed to lift the suspension of parliament. The Supreme Court these days is hearing arguments regarding the interim order it issued which stayed the decision taken by Sirisena to prorogue parliament. 
As the struggle for power continues in Sri Lanka it is important to note a comment made by the Prime Minister appointed by President Sirisena, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in an interview the latter gave the Daily Mirror. He has refused to accept that he is indulging in back-door politics. He has said that there is nothing called back-door politics and front-door politics and that power must be grabbed at the first instance one sees an opportunity. 

From a totally helpless situation Wickremesinghe sees the pendulum swinging his way due to the developments within the Parliament to remove Rajapaksa from the post of Prime Minister
Whichever waiting games Sirisena plays till 2020, Wickremesignhe and Rajapaksa have once again emerged as the two choices we have if there comes an election to chose a country President. 
We are living during times when we cant find totally clean and able leaders who are willing to serve the country. They all have their faults. Rajapaksa has so many cases against him while Wickremesinghe has been critisised for his neoliberal ideas which his critics say have not worked for the country. 
On the other hand people have now begun to question the pedigree of the lawmakers. Two politicians were subject to great embarrassment at the recent 40th National Youth Awards ceremony when two recipients of awards refused to shake hands and receive their awards from the duo. This is what would continue to happen in the future because the people have the right to reject our lawmakers as much as they have the ability to bring them to power.

UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha charged today that there was a move to appoint a new Prime Minister from Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), who does not command a majority in the House.
He told a news conference that there was no reason for President to refrain from appointing Mr. Wickremesinghe, who commands majority in the House, as the Prime Minister.
He said security detail given to MP Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister should be removed as he cannot function as the premier as per the interim order given by the Appeal Court yesterday.
He said IGP Pujith Jayasunda should act the same way he acted and removed security detail of UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe when he was removed from the Prime Ministers post.
Mr. Rajapaksa is no longer entitled to the security that is given to a Prime Minister now as he does not hold the post anymore, Mr. Jayamaha said. (Yohan Perera)

The status quo that existed before October 26 can be restored now following the interim order given by the Appeal Court as it is given against an individual and not against a post, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment during a public rally in Galle last evening.
The decision of the Appeal Court is given against an individual and not against the post and against a government. Therefore the status quo prior to October 26, 2018, could be restored. In such a situation our administration which existed before October 26 can function as a legitimate government, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
The illegitimate government should now resign. They should now go for God's Sake ( Hatharwaran deviyange namayen), he added.
He said the 19th Amendment to the constitution had made it possible for the Appeal Court to give this kind of a decision.
Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga wanted to appoint the late Lakshman Kadirgamar after the 2004 general election but ended up appointing Mr. Rajapaksa instead. I asked Ms. Kumaratunga as to why Mr. Kadirgamar was not appointed and she told me that he did not have a majority but Mr. Rajapaksa did. This is how the practice was when it came to appointing a Prime Minister even at that time, he also said.
He added that holding an election was not an issue but said political parties in Parliament could decide on a date an election when it would be held.
Dr Rajitha Senaratne said they would go to ministries today. We will go to the ministries which we held prior to October 26 as we are the legitimate Ministers now, he said.
MP Patali Champika Ranawaka said the President should not have any hesitation in handing over the government to the UNF now. He said drastic action would be taken if a new government is not appointed by Wednesday. (Yohan Perera)

Ray Wijewardene Memorial Lecture  Whats in an  innovative culture  
	

The rapid transitions in the world of technology have kept industry players engaged in introducing various solutions. These solutions are for customers to pace parallel with changing trends. A global leader in the digital software engineering industry is Virtusa, the brainchild of Kris Canekeratne, headquartered in the US. Providing software engineering solutions for some of the most venerable brands in the world, Virtusa is at the helm of introducing technological innovation. Speaking at the recently concluded Ray Wijewardene Memorial Lecture organised by the Ray Wijewardene Charitable Trust, Kris elaborated on what it takes to build an innovative culture.
About Virtusa
Virtusa is a global leader in digital software engineering services headquartered in the US. Today, we have over 22000 software engineers all over the world in over 50 cities, Kris said in his opening remarks.We provide digital software engineering services to over 200 of the most venerable brands in the world. We had a stellar journey since going public and since 2010 our compounded annual growth rate has been rated at 25% per year. With a focus in bringing in software innovation to the industry since its inception back in the late 1990s,Virtusa has first started out by identifying the best practices of software engineering. Since early 2000 and beyond, we have taken a lot of those best practices around software platforms including the rate and speed at which we can innovate on top of that  and we have essentially taken it to some of the largest enterprises in the world.
The technology industry has gone through many transitions and has evolved faster than any other industry. We also focus much of our time at the intersection of our clients and their consumers, he continued. So we started during the .com era that was around the late 90s and early 2000 which then gave way to the first generation of mobile. Their consumers were engaged with their service providers to mobile devices which have now gone to digital.

We provide digital software engineering services to over 200 of the most venerable brands in the world. We had a stellar journey since going public and since 2010 our compounded annual growth rate has been rated at 25% per year
Engineering arbitrage over cost arbitrage
Our focus has not been the cost arbitrage side of the equation, Kris pointed out. Our focus has been the engineering arbitrage since cost arbitrage is very easy to get. Here you have a volume of work that needs to be done which will cost you a US$100 in the US but in South Asia you can get that same volume of work done for US$40 or $50 or something significantly lower based on the cost difference of engineers.
Engineering arbitrage on the other hand is much more fundamental. Here we are looking at the growth in engineering  here we look at how do we do less, how do we reduce and eliminate complexity  how do we take away redundancies, how do we carefully reduce the footprint of the software thats been used to run these systems. And the good news is every enterprise in the world especially in US, UK, Europe and developed countries have gone through 20-40 years of technology where they bought or built multiple times over the same prophecies in technology over and over again. What the first generation of suppliers did was that they put all those redundancies to South Asia and did the work for less. What we are doing is that we take a lot of the same work and we carefully analyse what is duplicate, what is redundant and how much technical debt exists and then we rationalize and consolidate so that we can help create a single platform for a single business process. That is the reason why Virtusa is fundamentally growing twice to four times faster than many of our competitors, specifically the large IT outsourcing firms.
Kris further said that they are also starting to realize how important it is to have a streamlined back-end to support the digital requirements of the Digital 2.0 or Industry 4.0. When you have a complex back-end which is somewhat monolithic and which may require manual intervention what happens is that it is very difficult to create a simple digital experience. Even in the US over 98% of banking today is done by a consumer physically going to a branch office, filling up a piece of paper to open a bank account, someone taking that application which then goes into a setup system which includes on average 17-20% different systems before you can open an account. Just imagine if Amazon,Uber or FB had such a monolithic and such a complex back-end, you would never get instant results.
Building an innovative culture
Sharing his experience on what it takes to build an innovative culture Kris shared a few tips on how to encourage the workforce in any organization to think differently. We truly believe that an innovative organization needs to have an innovative culture. It all starts with leadership. But have most of us who are leaders felt what it truly means to be a leader In fact theres a fine line between being the chief innovation officer and the chief enablement officer. One thwarts and kills innovation while the other nurtures and fosters it. We try to harness innovation at the periphery of the organization in order to capture innovation from all of our engineers. As a result of that not only have we transcended 22 years, during which many firms that competed with us came and left but we endured. I truly believe that one of the hallmarks of this is leadership that understands that distinction.
Values of the organization are important as well, he continued. Its one thing to talk about it and another thing to ensure that every team member from the time they joined the firm or even before understands the core values of the firm.We believe that the extent to which they build and practise our core values will enable us to create and preserve an enduring innovative culture. Four simple values include compassion, innovation, respect and leadership. In terms of innovation one of the most important attributes that we uncovered is to determine the intellectual curiosity in our engineers. The questioning mind has enabled us to preserve and retain our culture of excellence within Virtusa. One worry that I never have is whether we will be able to embrace the next technology generation or the next set of working capabilities and prophecies. I know in principle that our teens have that element of curiosity which continually keeps them pushing the contours.
Kris said that trust and transparency are two key indicators of an innovative culture. Recently Google did a fairly extensive study titled Project Aristotle which was all about what it took to build an innovative culture. The number one attribute that they found was psychological safety. Its a belief that when you are in a room whether with your superiors or colleagues, that you can say anything without someone else slapping you down. How comfortable are your teams when you are at a team meeting  whether they have the freedom in their minds to speak out their thoughts.
Kris also elaborated on why amotivating context is absolutely important and how they introduced Journey to 2025 as their next motivating context, shortly after they crossed their USD 1 billion mark in revenue generation.
He also reiterated on the fact that in order to build an enduring culture around innovation, any organization has to get rid of sacred cows.Sacred cows can be in the form of people, process or capability. You have to identify those individuals in your culture that are no longer contributing to your goals and aspirations and you have to take action. This is something we have been forced to do, not something that we enjoy doing.
We also believe that rewarding failures specifically when it comes to innovation is incredibly important. In todays world most of our teams are constantly failing and we want them to constantly fail. As we identify more of those failures, we identify one or two capabilities which are critically important. Hence failures are very much a part of that innovation or engineering culture.
One also needs to leverage technology to nurture and foster innovation, Kris continued. At Virtusa we attempted to build a very strong culture around innovation. We have worked diligently practise the whole idea of defining the problem as opposed to prescribing the solution.

Sooriya at 50: Geralds story
	

Ask any person, particularly anyone young, as to what Sooriya means to him/her, and chances are he/she will reply, Sooriya Village! The immediacy of the response is not unwarranted, since Sooriya Village is THE place to be at for everything. But ask him/her about the story behind Sooriya, and how it came to be, and chances are there wont be a reply. The truth, however, is that Sooriya is much more, than the Village. It has a story, one which runs parallel with the history of pop music in this country.
It all began with a man called Gerald Wickremesooriya. From an early age, Gerald loved music. He could sing. He could write. He also loved to read. And dabble in other art forms. Born in 1920 at Ambalangoda, he came under the influence of two neighbours: C. de S. Kulathilaka, folk music researcher, and Ariyapala Gurunnanse, the definitive face of the culture of masks in that part of the country. From Kulathilaka and the Gurunnanse, not surprisingly, Gerald picked up an intense love for traditional art forms: the dances, the drums, and the thovil ceremonies.
Having been educated until Ninth Grade at Dharmasoka Vidyalaya, he was sent to Colombo where, against a backdrop of increasing urbanisation and a post-war and post-independence economic boom, new and exciting vistas of art, music, and theatre were coming up. These could not have escaped him. And they did not.
He was boarded at S. Thomas College in Mount Lavinia and, after leaving it, settled in Kollupitiya. Among his new neighbours was the redoubtable Chitrasena; another neighbour, it turned out, was Colvin R. de Silva. The Chitrasena Kalayathanaya, as popular then as it is now (though today its situated elsewhere), was a call centre for artists in vogue at the time, from Amaradeva to Sunil Shantha to Ananda Samarakoon. Gerald, always the inquisitive lover of music, made the acquaintance of Samarakoon, and ended up in his orchestra as an esraj player.
Music, however, was not all that motivated him. He had a flair for business. While pursuing his passion for music, he soon got a job at Shaw Wallace as its Director of Plantations. The plantation sector remained another passion of his; long before Shaw Wallace, he had ventured into tea, cinnamon, paddy, and rubber at Ambalangoda and the vegetable-fruit market at Kollupitiya. These, he would sell at the Jathika Pola, held at the time at what is now the Thurstan College grounds.
While at Shaw Wallace, however, as is natural in any persons life, tragedy struck: the company underwent a process of restructuring and he had to leave. This was 1956, a tumultuous year for the country if ever there was one.
Without a job, and searching for new prospects, Gerald had a chat with the owner of the bookstore K. V. G. de Silva & Sons, who happened to be his nephew. It was, all in all, an intriguing proposition: while bookstores were being opened every year in the country, there was no bookstore for children. The market for childrens books was fertile, and it needed someone who could take that first step and open a store. That someone, it transpired, was Gerald: heeding his nephews advice, he and his wife Dulcie started the Childrens Bookshop in 1959. Located at Queen Street, it became so popular that it began importing childrens music. This too caught on, for a reason: Sri Lanka did not really possess a popular childrens music tradition. 
Soon afterwards, Gerald was offered an enticing deal: Louis Browns, the famous record label producer, was shutting down in Sri Lanka, and it needed someone to take on its distribution. Gerald took on the task, and through the Childrens Bookshop, he began importing records of Western artists popular at the time: from Tom Jones to Jim Reeves to Herb Alpert to the King himself, Elvis Presley.

It was Elvis, ironically, who gave that much needed boost to the mans business. Somewhere in 1960 Gerald and his wife, on their way to the Store, came across a long and unusual queue at Queen Street winding up past the Central Bank. The source of the queue was not hard to trace: people had thronged at the Store to purchase a certain record. That record, it turned out, was Wooden Heart, the irrepressible variation on Mussi denn that the King had immortalised in the film G. I. Blues (which, Dayan Jayatilleka once told me, became a hit at the Liberty not too far from Queen Street and the Bookshop). As Geralds son Udena remembered for me when I recently sat down with him, it was not just a turning point, for him it was THE turning point.
Emboldened, Gerald took the next step: establishing his own label. Sooriya. It was not the first label in the country: that distinction belongs to Philips, managed by a friend, Patrick Corea. (Patrick, to his credit, had already introduced the Moonstones.) But Sooriya was the first Local label; it was Sri Lankas sole agent for Decca Records, yet a large portion of its work came from its local division.
Unlike Philips, moreover, Sooriya not only managed its portfolio of artists, but also promoted them through the Sooriya Show (presented by Vijaya Corea and typed by Gerald himself on his own typewriter, it was broadcast every Thursday from 9.45 to 10 p.m. on Radio Ceylon) and a series of live concerts held at Ramakrishna Hall and Navarangahala, among other venues, at regular intervals.
Udena remembers those shows even now. We always sold more than a thousand tickets. In addition to those 1,000-plus attendees, we had another 400 gatecrashers. At the Navarangahala show we stationed a police officer called Gafoor, who was given the task of keeping these crashers away. Gafoor was feared by everyone. You didnt cross him, and if you did, it was to your peril. But it was useless. The crashers kept on coming. Some of the other venues, like the Taprobane, did not attract such a populist crowd, since they were of a different order. Our fellows performed at the Taprobane in 1969. We had Spitfires with Dalreen and Desmond, the Dharmaratne Brothers, and M. S. Fernando. In fact that was our first live show.
When did Sooriya actually begin, though Udena gave me a date: November 28, 1968. Thats when the Moonstones signed an agreement for the labels first album with them, More Hits by the Moonstones (Catalogue Number CHB 001, on a 45 RPM Vinyl EP). The stand-out piece in that album, incidentally, was the sequel of sorts to Mango Kalu Nande (released earlier by Philips), Kalu Mame.
How did the Moonstones get to know Gerald A mutual contact: Mangala Rodrigo, a band member, who happened to be a friend of Udenas brother, Netaji. As Udena put it for me, When Netaji told Mangala that he wanted to introduce him to my father, Mangala nervously agreed on the condition that they speak in Sinhala. The story goes that when the two met, my father came up to him and greeted him in English. Mangala must have got more nervous than ever, because he very nearly ran away. Mercifully of course, that did not prevent them from reaching an agreement.

Sooriya turned into a sensation overnight: be it a record, a radio show, or a live concert, people just came and listened and watched. The names kept on coming, from the Moonstones to Indrani Perera to Dalreen Arnolda to H. R. Jothipala
From then on there was no stopping, or puncturing, the road ahead. Sooriya turned into a sensation overnight: be it a record, a radio show, or a live concert, people just came and listened and watched. The names kept on coming, from the Moonstones to Indrani Perera to Dalreen Arnolda to H. R. Jothipala. Past friendships were revived, and they helped develop the brand even more: for instance, the Dharmaratne Brothers, who knew Gerald, were pivotal in introducing many vocalists to the world of record labels: Durakathanaye, the song that transformed Jothipala from a playback singer to a mainstream artist, was reputedly Melroy Dharmaratnes melody.
But the definitive hit for Sooriya in those formative years was Dilhani. Indrani Perera, then right after school, had been discovered by Annesley Malawana, and the song, which went on to sell more than 5,000 copies (the average for a Sooriya record, Udena told me, was 500), launched Indrani to instant fame. People just loved that song. There was no real reason for it. Perhaps it was because we didnt have nalawili gee apart from Doi Doi Doi. Or because it was based on an actual experience: the song was about Sangabo Coreas daughter. In any case, it paved the way for a string of hits about children, many of them sung by children. Sooriya pioneered the latter kind of pop songs when, somewhere in the late sixties, it picked up Baby Shiromi. She influenced a whole bunch of Babies, and her songs, from the poignantly funny Sakalabujan to the hilariously acerbic Konda Namagena, found their way to practically every concert, radio show, and household.
The Sooriya story does not end there. There were other avenues crossed, opportunities picked up and made use of, landmarks achieved, personalities transformed into icons, and genres explored. Those stories, I will soon proceed with. Soon.

SriLankan paid Rs.430 mn as baggage compensation: PCoI
	
SriLankan airlines has paid passengers Rs.430 million as compensation for badly-handled baggage between 2008 and 2018, this was yesterday revealed at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into irregularities at SriLankan airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka.
SriLankan Security Division Senior Manager Titus Kannangara gave the following breakdown of the compensation paid -- Rs.33.8 million in 2008 to 2009; Rs.17.4 million in 2009 to 2010; Rs.49.4 million in 2010 to 2011; Rs.20 million 2011-2012; Rs.42.5 million in 2012 to 2013; Rs.41 million in 2013 to 2014; Rs.44 million in 2014 to 2015; Rs.56 million in 2015 to 2016; Rs.50.8 million in 2016 to 2017 and Rs.75.5 million in 2017 to 2018.
In a response to Senior Counsel Fazly Raziks question as how baggage could be mishandled Mr. Kannangara said baggage mishandling fell into four categories such as damaged baggage, lost baggage, pilferage of baggage and baggage delays.
He said most of the passengers were known to make false complaints to obtain insurance.
When Senior Counsel Razik asked about the responsibility of the Security Division in making sure of the safety of the baggage, Mr. Kannagara said security officers could not be present at all times when bags were mishandled and pointed out that most of the damage was minor.
However, during the proceedings it was also revealed that several incidents of pilfered baggage took place but the Security Division had not taken action against those responsible for the pilferage.
Senior Counsel Razik proved through audio evidence that security division had failed to take action in cases of pilferage.
The audio evidence which was played during the proceedings confirmed that on two occasions the witness had advised his officials not to check his colleague who was attached to the Security Division regarding the pilferage of baggage. However, the particular employee was on top in the watch list for pilfering baggage at SriLankan.
Senior Counsel also informed the PCoI that the witness had misled the Commission by providing false evidence and that the employees at the baggage counter deliberately complicated the process to discourage customers from making complaints about the pilferage of baggage. (Yoshitha Perera)

'Suspects incarcerated for ten months', an exceptional circumstance for bail- Counsel
	
In a bail application filed on behalf of suspect Kasun Palisena regarding the magisterial inquiry into the bond scam, Senior Counsel Jeewantha Jayathilake said today that both suspects being incarcerated for ten months is on its own sufficient to be considered an exceptional circumstance to grant them bail.
Citing a precedent he said when considering someone's bail application, granting bail should be the rule and refusing it the exception.
Counsel said the Court should not reject a person's bail application so as to punish him, as it would amount to a violation of the constitutionally protected right of 'presumption of innocence' of that person.
He said though both suspects could not be deemed to be guilty at this stage, they have been denied their rights by being incarcerated for ten months.
Observing that the Attorney General and the CID had ample time to inquire into the facts in this case, the counsel said his clients had nothing to do with the first suspect Arjuna Mahendran absconding court had no relevancy with regard to suspects Aloysius and Palisena.
He said during the revision bail application at the Court of Appeal, one of the reasons set out by the Court in rejecting the application was that the 'current stage is premature to decide or consider on the inclusion of the Public Property Act as the suspects were not yet charged in any court specifically as per Prevailing law'.
However, he brought two exceptional grounds on behalf of his client (Kasun Palisena) as the law requires for suspects who were remanded under the Public Property Act.
He said firstly, being incarcerated for ten months can be regarded as exceptional ground on the basis of objective observation as the suspects were remanded for a long time and secondly, he sought bail pointing to a situation that suspect Kasun Palisena was undergoing at the moment on humanitarian grounds.
The counsel said suspect Palisena's second child, who is nine months of age, is currently suffering from a special disability due to premature birth and as a result the child is in need of a great degree of interaction and support from parents while under treatment.
He said child's mother was also suffering from various health problems, which resulted in her being incapable of taking care of the child alone and that the situation was quite exceptional as the mother was jobless while her husbands bank accounts have been frozen due to the inquiry.
The counsel moved to consider the exceptional bail application on humanitarian basis as everyone in remand custody did not have children with a special need with similar conditions.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne subsequently, directed the prosecution to file their written objections with regard to the bail applications filed on behalf of both suspects on or before December 18.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were also ordered to be re-remanded till December 18 by the Magistrate in the magisterial inquiry in which they are accused of conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds to the value of Rs.688 million at the bond auction held on February 27, 2015.
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd de facto owner Arjun Aloysius, its CEO Kasun Palisena were also re-remanded by the Chief Magistrate till December 18 over the parallel magisterial inquiry into the Bond scam on deleting phone call data from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Bond Commission.

UNF ever ready for elections under legitimate Govt.: Ranil
	
 UNF Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said today they were agreeable to a legal election if a legitimate government was appointed in line with the Constitution.
UNF has no reason to oppose an election if other parties agree to hold a snap poll. Therefore parties can decide on a date of an election. This can be done by a motion which is approved by a two-thirds majority. We have conveyed this to the SLPP and had told them that parties should meet and decide on what needs to be done, he said.
Mr. Wickrmesinghe said the government should be constitutional. What we have in Sri Lanka is a Parliament-based government. No one should act like Hitler. It is only me and the UNF which could command a majority. Therefore we ask those concerned to work in accordance with the Constitution. (Yohan Perera)

UNF is ready  for a Presidential Election Ruwan Wijewardene
	
Sri Lankan politics has made headlines locally and across the globe since October 26. With the struggle to prove a majority in Parliament, it turned into a battle ground followed by continuous boycotting by members of the purported Government. While this continues, civil societies and activists have taken to the streets demanding their democratic rights. In such a backdrop, the Opposition is demanding for a Presidential Election in order to sort out the chaos.
In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, United National Party Member of Parliament from Gampaha District Ruwan Wijewardene shed light on the broader alliance being formed and the need for young leadership.

Q: What are your thoughts on the entire series of events that happened since October 26
What has happened politically is very unfortunate. The whole country has been at a standstill for more than a month. Nothing is moving forward, the economy is at a downward spiral and theres no direction. All this is due to what President Maithripala Sirisena has done. He has gone against the Constitution of the country. He ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on a personal vendetta, threw the United National Front (UNF) Government out and took Mahinda Rajapaksa from the back door. The people have not recognised the illegitimate Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa and the effect it has had on the country is profound. Hopefully it will come in to some sort of a settlement where a legitimate Government would be formed. We are hoping for a Presidential Election.
Q:Who will be the candidate
We are still in discussion regarding that. It could be Ranil Wickremesinghe or any other leader from the Party. It will be decided once the Party leaders of the UNF discuss on that. But we have reached an agreement with everyone including the parties that we need to go in for a Presidential Election soon.
Q:There is a broader alliance being formed. What are its objectives
With President Sirisenas move, most of the parties have come together to safeguard democracy in this country. Because of that all parties are now in agreement that a broader alliance is needed. So we will have many political parties which will join us and we are even ready to face a General Election. But what we prefer is to go in for a Presidential Election. Thats where the core problem is. Even if we do form a Government now with President Sirisena and if he is adamant that Ranil Wickremesinghe is not going to be the PM, then even if we appoint someone else in another two or three months he would say that he doesnt like that person too. So what is needed right now is a Presidential Election to bring more stability to the country. Soon after that we can go for a General Election. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that we could have the two elections on the same day. I think that would be ideal because it would save much money and bring about stability.
Q:When the coalition Government was formed, it was also like a broader alliance. But not much was done during the past three years. What are your views
One thing about this coalition, which began in 2015, is that there were two main camps; the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the UNP. These two parties were at each others throats since the inception. The ideologies and the thought processes were different. So when those two parties merged, definitely there was going to be much friction. That was what we faced during the past three years. Because of that it was difficult to move things along. The SLFP faction tried and blocked what we would propose and it was becoming difficult to take it forward. But with the forming of the broader alliance it will be different. Most parties have been having discussions at the same level. I think their thoughts are on par with each other. We may even find some members, probably from the SLFP group, joining us if they are in agreement with our process. Theres a high possibility of that happening as well.

Ranil Wickremesinghe is a person with vast knowledge and experience in the government. So I dont think he could be dismissed just like that
Q:Why does the UNP need a broader alliance Isnt it as strong as it was like during its inception
Basically if you look at the political environment in the country I dont think a single party enjoy the majority in Parliament. The SLFP cant do it and nor the SLPP no matter how much they shout that they are the largest party. So whichever party that comes forward should go in for an alliance to win the majority in Parliament. The UNP is strong and we still maintain our membership. As a single party we have had the strongest membership. The broader alliance is formed not for us to come in to power, but mainly to safeguard the countrys democracy.
Q:Is the Peoples Liberation Front (JVP) also in this alliance
The JVP right now is fighting to safeguard democracy and on that fight they are with us. But as a broader alliance going in for an election I think they still have to make that decision.
Q:So who has themajority now
The majority is with us. It is clear because we moved two No-Confidence motions. During the last vote we had on the Selection Committee we showed that we had 131 members who voted with us. Thats a clear indication although the President, MR and their team keep denying it. They do not have the majority, which is why they dont turn up in Parliament. Its the first time in the history of politics that a so-called Government boycotted Parliament. Usually its the opposition who does that. I remember that there were times when we walked out of Parliament. But as a government you should not do that because you own a majority in Parliament. Clearly the reason for them not to turn up in Parliament is because they dont have the majority. They relate their absence to the Speaker saying that he is aligned with the UNF and is not making the right decisions. But if thats the case they can bring a No-Confidence motion against the Speaker. If the so-called Government says that they have a majority, they can prove it.
Q:Over the past few days there was a massive waste of public money in terms of Parliament not being convened. Eventhe behaviour of MPswas appalling. How doyou see this
It is not only the wastage of money, but also the huge damage they have done to the country. Internationally we have become a laughing stock due to the manner in which way they behaved in Parliament. When MR was in the opposition they were criticizing this Government for the devaluation of the rupee, but even under them the rupee is not stable. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the USA have stopped funds coming into Sri Lanka.
The light railway project, which was on the cards, has been stopped. So there is much indication that the country is being brought down to its knees. All this is just because President Sirisena has an issue with Ranil Wickremesinghe. If he had an issue all he had to do was to get the party leaders of the UNF Government together. He could have said that he has an issue and he could have found a solution. But instead he spoke to Sajith Premadasa and Karu Jayasuriya separately and offered the premiership to them. However without the backing of the Party or the UNF leaders they would not take that position. That way, the whole scenario could have been avoided.
Q:Dont you think that the UNF needs a new face at this point
I think the whole country is looking for newer faces. I think everyone is disgusted and fed up with politicians. They are fed up with the rhetoric of the politicians. So they are looking for younger leadership. Ranil Wickremesinghe is a person with vast knowledge and experience in the government. So I dont think he could be dismissed just like that. If we are to run a country we need people with experience and at the same time we need younger leaders to come forward. If we look at Canada, France and several other countries there is a trend where the younger leaders have come forward and taken over the leadership roles of their countries. But when it comes to the next elections the UNP would sit and decide which route we should take to win.
Q:In an earlier interview, Minister Welgama had said that the President has a hidden agenda behind appointing MR as PM. Do you think the same
Personally I wonder whether the President took this decision to politically destroy Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa. And I think he has achieved it to a certain extent. I think Rajapaksa was a person who had a very strong following and is someone who earned much respect not only from his followers, but also from the opposition as well. But now his standing has dropped a lot. Now people see him as just another politician who wants to grab on to power in whatever the way he can. That respect that the people had for him has dropped. President Sirisenas popularity is also at a record low. More than harming Wickremesinghe or Rajapaksa it has pretty much backfired on himself. He even sees his own Party members leaving and joining Rajapaksa.
Q:As the former State Minister of Defence what are your thoughts on the President himself being the Minister of Defence
As the State Minister there were times when I found that my hands were tied. There was not much I could do probably because I was from the UNP. He (Sirisena) said that one reason for him to appoint Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was to safeguard national security, but we found that when the No-Confidence motion was being discussed, both the President and Rajapaksa were speaking to MPs from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to keep quiet and in turn they would release the 100 odd LTTE prisoners. Some of them are those who have assassinated people like Lakshman Kadirgamar and some who have placed bombs all around Colombo. So what sort of national security are they talking about If we tried doing that during our time we would have been called traitors and that we are going to divide the country etc. But when it comes to them its all about national security. The amount of politicisation happening within the military has been worrying. I believe that the military should be independent and they should be given their tasks to safeguard national security.

As a government you should not do that because you own a majority in Parliament. Clearly the reason for them not to turn up in Parliament is because they dont have the majority
Q:What will happen to the Budget
There will be no Budget unless a legitimate Government is installed. I believe that once we get a legitimate Government in place we can present our Budget which we were planning on.
Q:Will the On Account Budget be tabled
I doubt it very much. Its all about bravado and they are trying to show that they are in control, but they are not. They dont have the finances and the treasury is in a mess. So everything is at a standstill so much so that bills in ministries are not being paid. Until a proper legitimate Government is installed nothing will move forward.
Q:Where does the peoples voice stand today
With what we saw in social media independently there were people who took to the streets, holding placards and doing vigils to safeguard the countrys democracy. They are looking for a change and want stability. They want proper development and a Government without corruption. Corruption has been a huge issue in our political history. In 2015 they were expecting that change. There was much hope that things would change during the past three years, but unfortunately those three years were spent by these groups quarreling. I think a new generation of politicians would come forward from all parties and their view on how the country should run would be different. In turn there will be a better future. Its actually up to the people. I hope they go and choose their representatives wisely without casting their vote for those who would jump from one side to the other for money and prestige. We need more educated people in politics. If we do return as a legitimate Government we are going to bring another amendment to the Constitution and make sure that there are no crossovers in the future. I say this because corruption is present.

Unofficial fines fund the evening party!
	
There is a khaki boss at Alawpura who has hit upon a convenient means of raising adequate funding for their regular evening party at which they would empty several bottles of high-quality liquor.
He would post one or two faithful subordinates at the railway level crossing from morning hours who would collect a sizable amount of money from errant motorbike and vehicle drivers by the time they go off duty in the afternoon. Drivers who are unable to produce some vital document or other for inspection happily offer a santhosham rather than paying a fine, they say.

Xi-Trump talks raise hopes resolution of tariff war
	

BUENOS AIRES - The trade talks that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping launched this weekend have raised hopes for a peaceful resolution of the trans-Pacific tariff war - but the economic relationship between the U.S. and China has beenpermanently altered.
 
Over dinner following the Group of 20 summit Saturday, Trump agreed to cancel a planned Jan. 1 tariff increase in return for increased Chinese purchases of American farm andindustrial goods. 
The two sides also will commence talks about structural changes in Chinese practices, including forced technology transfer, trade secrets theft, and non-tariff barriers. The goal is to secure an agreement in 90 days. 
Over the past quarter century, American manufacturers grew dependent upon low-wage Chinese workers to produce iPhones, clothing and industrial parts, often at the expense of factory employees in the industrial heartland. 
China, in turn, invested more than $140 billion in the United States since 2000, according to the Rhodium Group, further knitting together two economies that account for roughly 40 percent of global output. 
But altmost a year of heated U.S. rhetoric, escalating tariffs, and tighter investment and export controls have shaken Chinese government officials and global business executives. 
As repeated tariff salvos prompt companies to rethink their reliance upon Chinese factories, Beijing is stepping up efforts to wean itself from what it sees as an unpredictable American partner, according to trade analysts, business executives and former government officials.
