The 24-hour trade union action scheduled to be launched by the Locomotive Engineering Operators from midnight today has been called off, the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry announced a short while ago.

The token strike was organised seeking several demands including salary anomalies and it has been abandoned due to the moves made by the Ministry to resolve the matters of locomotive operators, Locomotive Engineering Operators Union (LEOU) said.

It was reported that the strike was organized as the authorities failed to meet the demands made by the Union in early January.

However, in a meeting held between the subject Ministry officials and the union representatives, it had been revealed that Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva has made the proposals to the Cabinet and the permission has been granted to resolve the issues.

The Cabinet has ordered the Salary and Cadre Commission to produce its observations after consulting the trade union representatives. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
