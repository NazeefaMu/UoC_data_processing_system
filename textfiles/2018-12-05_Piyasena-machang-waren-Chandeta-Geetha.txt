Former MP Geetha Kumarasinghe yesterday accused MP Piyasena Gamage, who has sworn in to fill the vacant position left by her in Parliament, of not allowing her to work at least a month in her constituency.

Addressing a meeting in Elpitiya today she said that she was elected to Parliament as a member after polling the highest number of votes.

“These Kaalakanni did not give any chance for me to serve my people at least a month in a free state of mind. He filed a case against me and claimed that I have a dual citizenship. Most of my political life, I was in courts. As a woman, I have never been to any court of law before.

“Finally, I had to go to court to protect my Parliament seat so I can serve the people in Benthara and Elpitiya. I must proudly say, this time I took the decision to let go of my Switzerland citizenship because of my people.

“Now what you will say? Now, I would like to ask Machang Piyasena are you feeling better now? Piyasena, come and face the election you thief (Piyasena, machang umbata dan saneepada? Piyasena machang, waren chandeta).

“Now you cannot say that I have a dual citizenship. Think you can sleep well now. I removed my Switzerland citizenship and I have done my work,” she said.
