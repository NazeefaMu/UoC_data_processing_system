They have become a nuisance


	



 

Hordes of politicos descending on a certain leading local government institution these days have become a veritable impediment to its smooth functioning, they say.

 


With the local polls round the corner, the politicos are arriving in droves to discuss development projects to be launched post-haste. 


There are 16 separate departments in this institution and the white collar ones working in them are constantly disturbed by the former purohitas, Diyawanna members hailing from the district and various other interested parties seeking details about the ongoing development projects and those about to be launched. 


Most of these unwelcome political visitors belong to a main political party, the employees say.
