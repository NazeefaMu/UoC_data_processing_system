What he did, not cricket!


	


A wealthy city businessman recently threw a gala dinner party to promote a friend eyeing the highest chair of the body controlling the gentlemen’s game. The businessman who hosted the party himself had at one time occupied this coveted chair. 
A number of officials from the countrywide clubs of the game had attended this party. The chair-hopeful hailing from a family with close ties to the game too had functioned for a long time as a key official of the controlling body, but was summarily removed some time ago.
They all hit the bottle and their spirits were soaring. Even the host was seen being quite liberal with the bottle. The aspirant to the chair of the national game thought it was apt time for him to take the floor. 
Addressing the well-wishers present he waxed eloquent about his merits for the big job he was eyeing. And no sooner had he sat down, up on his feet was the businessman who was playing the host. It was obvious this worthy had taken a gulp too many. 
Despite being unsteady on his feet, the host-businessman spoke in a steady tone: “I must say that certain things my friend said are utter falsehoods.”   The one aspiring to head the national body for the gentlemen’s game looked as if he were struck by a thunder clap.    
         
Another person in the party who got up made a bid to hold a brief for the ambitious candidate who received an unexpected beating from the host.  However, the host businessman shouted him down. A commotion ensued and the party came to an abrupt end.
Meanwhile, reports say that a powerful government group is making behind–the–scene moves to install the son-in-law of a politician from the Gampaha area as the head of the body controlling the gentlemen’s game. An ex-banker, this son-in-law, they say, is a total stranger to the game.
