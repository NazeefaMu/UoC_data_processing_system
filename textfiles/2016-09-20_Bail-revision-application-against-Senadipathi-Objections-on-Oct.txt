Bail revision application against Senadipathi: Objections on Oct.17


	

After considering the bail revision application filed by the Bribery Commission against Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya’s order granting bail to Nissanka Senadipathi and Palitha Fernando in the Rs.3.5 million bribery allegation, the Colombo High Court today fixed October 17 for the respondents to file objections.

High Court Judge M.C.B.S. Morais also ordered the registrar to hand over the notices to the counsel who appeared today on behalf of the respondents.

The Bribery Commission earlier filed a revision application in the Colombo High Court seeking an order to set aside the bail order given by the Chief Magistrate.

In the application, the Bribery Commission had cited Avant Garde Maritime Security Limited chairman, Nissanka Senadhipathi, and its director general, Major General Palitha Fernando as the respondents. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
