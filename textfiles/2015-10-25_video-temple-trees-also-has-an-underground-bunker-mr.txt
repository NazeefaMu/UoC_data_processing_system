Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that his government had to build a safety bunker under President’s House in Fort to shield VIPs from potential LTTE air strikes.
He said the Defence Council met at President’s House during the previous regime when the war was going on and the bunker was built as a security measure to protect the defence officials from unexpected terrorist attacks.
Mr. Rajapaksa said even the LTTE leader built and lived inside a massive bunker complex during the war to protect him from the military offensives.
Therefore we also did the same thing to protect ourselves from terrorist attacks. This is not a new thing; Temple Trees also has an underground bunker for security reasons, he said.
