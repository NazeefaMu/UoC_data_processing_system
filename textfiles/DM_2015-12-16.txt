Govt. earned Rs.84.1 billion from liquor in 2015: Ravi
	
	A total of 183 million litres of liquor, marketed under different brands, had been sold in Sri Lanka upto November 1 this year, Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake informed Parliament today.
	Responding to an oral question raised by MP Dullas Alahapperuma in the House, the minister revealed the fact that 65.2 million litres of Arrack, 5.1 million litres of imported liquor, 100.4 million litres of alcoholic beverages made using different grains as well as 3.8 million litres of toddy were sold during the given period.
	He said government revenue from liquor licenses had risen to Rs 84.1 billion in 2015 compared to Rs 69 million earned the previous year.
	Responding to a supplementary question raised by Mr Alahapperuma as to why the revenue received from liquor licenses had increased, Minister Karunanayake said the increase in revenues from liquor was a direct result of the government's decision to levy a fee of Rs 15 million when liquor shops were converted into supermarkets.

	This will be renewed each year after the Ministry has inspected the premises and the health of the elephant, the Minister said.
	Even though permits would be granted for elephants, the ownership of the elephants would remain with the government.
	Several elephants were also being raised in captivity at the moment and can be used for peraharas and other functions for a nominal fee.
	They are being raised in a place similar to Pinnawala and there are about ten elephants under this programme so far, he said.(Text and Video Darshana Sanjeewa)

BBS complains to HRC on amendments
	
	Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) today complained to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) regarding Government moves to amend the Criminal Justice Procedure Code and the Penal Code.
	We have named the Justice Ministry Secretary, Parliament Secretary and the Presidential Secretary as respondents, BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said. 
	The government is attempting to amend these Codes while the people and government officials were focusing attention on the budget proposals. If amended the Acts will restrict the freedom of speech which had been granted through the 10th amendment to the Constitution, he said. We are urging the leaders of the Yahapalana Government to check the brains of the people involved in amending Act. It is a myth to think that by amending the Act, the peoples problems will be resolved.
	The Thera said the amendments would only benefit elements who spread communal and religious hatred. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Dilan to Namal: SLFP is not your fathers property
	
	State Minister for Highways, Dilan Perera said today that MP Namal Rajapaksa should remember that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was no longer his father Mahinda Rajapaksas property and not to make statements about the party as he wished.
	The state minister made these remarks in response to a question by a journalist during a press conference in Colombo about Mr. Rajapaksas statement published in a newspaper where he had said those who really loved the SLFP remained in the party while others joined the coalition government.
	Namal Rajapaksa has forgotten that the SLFP does not belong to his father Mahinda Rajapaksa. He must not say or do as he did when his father was president. It was the SLFP Central Committee which permitted SLFP members to join the coalition government. We feel sorry about his statement because of his age. Mr. Rajapaksa has a bright political future because he has a good family background. However, he should remember that he will not have a political future within the SLFP if he tries to exceed the authority of the SLFP Central Committee, the state minister said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

PM proposes PSC to probe allegations against Ravi K.
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday suggested the appointment of a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to probe the allegations made by the Opposition against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake instead of the no confidence motion against him.
	Mr Wickremesinghe said the PSC should be given one month to investigate and submit its recommendations.
	He made this suggestion when the opposition asked for a date to take up the no-confidence motion against the Finance Minister.
	The Prime Minister said there was no tradition of bringing a no-confidence motion against the Finance Minister with regard to matters pertaining to the budget. He said both the Finance Minister, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet has to resign if the Budget was defeated. He said the no-confidence motion was based on the budget.
	Chief opposition whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said one cannot associate the no confidence motion and the budget. He said budget is more or less a Bill and a no confidence motion is on the conduct of a Minister.
	MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the Speaker had assured that a date would be provided to take up the no-confidence motion. This matter should be decided at the next party leaders meeting in January and a date fixed.
	Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the matter would be discussed at the next party leaders meeting. (Yohan Perera)

Returning SL refugee baggage increased to 60 kg
	
	In a move that would benefit Sri Lankan refugees living in camps across the State who intend to return to the island-nation voluntarily, the UNHCR has assisted the Sri Lankan government in increasing the flight baggage allowance for repatriating refugees by 20 kg. Now, the total entitlement is 60 kg per person.
	Following the UNHCRs discussion with the Government of Sri Lanka on the need for increase in baggage allowance, the government has raised the limit for baggage for Sri Lankan refugees who are voluntary repatriating from India, UNHCR spokesperson Shucita Mehta told The Hindu .
	Presently, refugees who voluntarily return to the island-nation are sent back on board two airliners - SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka.
	After the ferry services were stopped, the refugees had been demanding an increase in the limit for luggage and this step would help them in better integration and give more confidence to them to return home, she said.
	We were initially told to pack our flight baggage not exceeding 40 kg and we had to choose what we have to take back. On Monday, they called to say it has been increased to 60 kg and we were able to take more, said Rosaline Vaz from Adiyanuthu camp in Dindigul, who returned from Tiruchi. A total of 23 refugees returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday.
	Ms. Vaz had come to Rameswaram in July 1990 by boat as a pregnant woman and gave birth to her fourth child within few days. Even she is 25 years old now and once we return to Mannar, we will find a job so that she can get married and all these vessels which we are taking can help us save some money, she said.
	Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation (OfERR)  an NGO working for the safe, informed and voluntary return of Sri Lankan refugees to the island-nation, welcomed the move to increase the baggage allowance.
	We welcome the decision to increase the baggage allowance, as it would help returnees to take some more of their personal belongings. If the ferry services are resumed, it would help them take more things, OfeRR treasurer S.C. Chandrahasan said.
	Repatriation should not be a deprivation to them, as they can take only limited things with them while returning, he said, calling upon the Indian and Sri Lankan governments to come together to announce a package for the returnees, which would include ferry services, enabling them to take more of their personal belongings.
	Ferry would help them take back their fridges, mixies, motor bikes, which they had bought with their life-time savings. If they are able to take them across, they need to spend money to buy them again once they return and intend to start a new life, he added.
	Over a lakh Sri Lankan refugees are living in camps across the State.

	While an unusually great number of US envoys visited Sri Lanka during the past couple of months, it appears that they tend to spend more time in Sri Lanka instead of the US Congress or the State Department, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today.
	He stated that six US envoys had visited Sri Lanka during the past four months and it was questionable if their intentions were pure.
	Addressing a new conference at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella, he stated that Sri Lanka has to contemplate if the visits made by US envoys were out of goodwill. The US had unusually made so many representations to our country, he mentioned.
	US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, United States Secretary of State John Kerry, US Under Secretary Thomas Shannon and US Assistant Secretary for Democracy and Human Rights and Labour Tom Malinowski were among those arrived in Sri Lanka this year.
	Mr. Alahapperuma pointed out that Sri Lanka had today adopted a pro-western foreign policy and it was a principle of the UNP.
	However, the foreign policy of the SLFP, the Presidents party was not pro-western. Therefore, there will be complications in our foreign policy in future, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
