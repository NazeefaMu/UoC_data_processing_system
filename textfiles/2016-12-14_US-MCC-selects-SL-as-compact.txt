US MCC selects SL as ‘compact’


	

Sri Lanka has been selected as a ‘compact’ by the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) based on the country’s improved score-card performance, the MCC said.

In a tweet, the MCC said today “Sri Lanka has been selected by our Board for a compact following improved score-card performance. Final board update to come,”

The MCC administers the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and sets up a MCA for the countries which were awarded with a compact.

In December 2015, the MCC Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka as eligible to develop a threshold programme.

The score-card of Sri Lanka, which was published on the website of the MCC, says the country has made improvements in controlling corruption and ensuring democratic rights.

The MCC is an innovative and independent US foreign aid agency which is helping lead the fight against global poverty.

Created by the US Congress in January 2004 with strong bi-partisan support, MCC is changing the conversation on how best to deliver smart US foreign assistance by focusing on good policies, country ownership and results.
