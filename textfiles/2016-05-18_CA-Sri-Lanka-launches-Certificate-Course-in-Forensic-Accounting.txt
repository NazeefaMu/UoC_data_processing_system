In a fresh effort aimed at combating increasing fraud in the country, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) launched the Certificate Course in Forensic Accounting, to inculcate chartered accountants with important knowledge and skills in this specialised field. 
The 15-week course covers pertinent areas associated with modern forensic and investigative accounting, which will help accountants gain a thorough understanding on the principles and practices used by public accountants, internal auditors and others on how to examine financial and other related information.
The course covers key topics including fraud auditing, litigation support, valuation and cybercrime, among other key areas and will be conducted by a panel of experienced resource personnel who command vast experience on the subjects. The panel includes KPMG Sri Lanka Partner Jagath Perera, Attorney at Law and Insurance Ombudsman of Sri Lanka Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, Ernst & Young Sri Lanka Partner Averil Ludowyke, KPMG Mumbai India Associate Director Prashant Bhat, BDO Partners Partner Risk, Forensics and IT Ashane Jayasekara, Sudath Perera Associates Attorney-at-Law Laknath Jayawickrama and B. R. De Silva & Co Manager Audit and Assurance C.S.W. Anthony.
In the face of growing fraudulent activities and with the consistently increasing demand for forensic accountants both in Sri Lanka and across the world, the course by CA Sri Lanka, in its capacity as the national body of accountants is a timely initiative. 
CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that amidst increasing fraud and corruption, the institute has taken steps to ensure that public expectations are met with the launch of this specialised course. 
“In our capacity as leading a professional institute in the country, remaining relevant is among the highest on our agenda and we need to complement this by offering relevant programmes for the benefit of our membership. There is no doubt that the business community and the public have always looked up to chartered accountants for guidance and through this course, I believe we meet an important objective in ensuring public expectations are met,” he said. 
Wickremasinghe noted that the success of the profession depend on the respect that chartered accountants continue to have from the business community, the government as well as society. 
“Therefore, as an important stakeholder and members who are known as ‘gatekeepers’ – we have an important role to play in assisting the government, the public and the business community to prevent fraud and corruption,” he said. 
Wickremasinghe also encouraged more chartered accountants to follow the certificate course, as it will educate them in an important and relevant area, which will not only enhance their professional standing but will also bring them greater professional success, as they will be in continuous demand across both the public and private sectors, locally and overseas.
CA Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Aruna Alwis noted that the role of the accountant is no longer restricted to number crunching positions but has evolved drastically from its traditional role. 
“Today, accountants are also considered investigators and therefore, this course is very relevant and timely and will serve for the enhanced success of chartered accountants, as they embark on a specialised role, in the current context,” he added.
