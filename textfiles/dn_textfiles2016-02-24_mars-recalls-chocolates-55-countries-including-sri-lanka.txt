Mars recalls chocolates in 55 countries including Sri Lanka

US Confectioner Mars on Tuesday ordered a massive recall of products including Mars and Snickers bars from 55 countries after a piece of plastic found in one bar was traced back to its Dutch factory.
"As far as we know there are 55 countries involved," Eline Bijveld, Mars corporate affairs coordinator for the Netherlands told AFP.
She added that the recall "only involves the products that are made in the Netherlands" at the Mars factory in the southern town of Veghel.
Mars said the recall affected all Mars and Snickers products, as well as Milky Way Minis, Miniatures and Celebrations confectionery boxes with best-before dates ranging from June 19, 2016 to January 8, 2017.
The chocolate giant did not indicate the total volume of the affected products, or what the financial impact of the recall would be.
