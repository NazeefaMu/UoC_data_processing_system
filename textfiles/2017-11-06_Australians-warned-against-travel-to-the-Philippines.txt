Australia, (Daily Mail), 4 November 2017 - Australians are being warned to reconsider travelling to the Philippines amid fears of a ‘high threat’ of terrorist attacks.  


The government has issued a warning for Australians to be ‘alert to possible threats around locations that have a low level of protective security and places to be possible 
terrorist targets’.  


Some of the areas most under threat include eastern Mindanao, the island’s central and western regions, and the capital of Manila.Also under high threat is Marawi, where ISIS allies are hiding in the city’s ruins.  


There are also warnings of possible lone wolf attacks carried out against travellers.
