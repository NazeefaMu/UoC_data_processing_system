The nine young footballers who were selected to represent Asia at the Allianz Junior Football camp in Munich along with the CEO and the Head of Market Manager of Allianz Ayudhya and the coaches.

Talented young footballers from across Asia came together for the regional Allianz Junior Football Camp - providing a chance to develop their games and learn new skills under the tutelage of FC Bayern. 

Fifty-seven talented teenagers in the region trained together in Bangkok – with nine young footballers selected to represent Asia at the Allianz Junior Football Camp in Munich. The chosen few will also get to meet some of the team’s best football players and watch them live in action at Allianz Arena – FC Bayern’s home stadium.

The young players, aged between 14-16 years old, came together for the regional camp after finishing top at their home country events in China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and Sri Lanka.  

Risinu Kudagama of Mahinda College - Galle and Senuth Jayasundara of St. Anne’s College – Kurunegala represented Sri Lanka at the Asia camp and Senuth Jayasundara was one of the nine footballers who were selected to represent Asia at the Munich Camp in August.

Allianz’s annual camp in Asia is the first to be held in the Thailand capital and included fitness workshops, footwork techniques, technical and tactical skills – ending with a tournament on the final day.  The training was led by FC Bayern’s youth coach Carsten Lakies with the aim to take talented teenagers to the next level and set them up for future success.

“While we are happy that both Risinu and Senuth participated in the Allianz Junior Football Camp – Asia, we are also proud that Senuth secured a spot in the Asian team for Munich. Allianz has organised this programme for the 10th consecutive year and we are sure that these children will carry the lessons they learnt on and off the field at the Allianz Junior Football Camp Asia throughout their lives. We are proud to have a hand in helping shape their future,” said Surekha Alles, Managing Director - Allianz Lanka. She further said that, “Allianz is a responsible corporate citizen that is deeply committed to the community in which we operate. The Allianz Junior Football Camp Asia is one facet of that commitment. It represents our ongoing efforts to uplift the level of sports in the country and create greater opportunities for everyone.”

Carsten Lakies, Former Player and Coach, International Program, FC Bayern, said, “We all have something in common -  a love for football – and I’m delighted to have seen this enthusiasm throughout the four day camp and wish all the best to everyone who took part.”

The camp included presentations on the final day for high achievers who showed outstanding performance across the four days.

The Allianz Junior Football Camp is part of the global financial services company’s long-term partnership with FC Bayern.
