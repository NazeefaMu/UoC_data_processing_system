The Senate of the Peradeniya University had decided to re-open the Medical, Dental and Agriculture Faculties, which had been closed for over fifteen days, sources said yesterday.

The Faculties will open on Monday, August 13, for academic activities.

A senior spokesman said that the re-opening days would be declared by the Deans of other faculties in due course and Arts and Management Faculties were scheduled to be re-opened on Monday, August 20.

The Senate closed the University since July 27 until further notice due to a clash between students and the management.

The undergraduates of the Engineering Faculty should show an attendance of 80% as part of the degree programme. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
