Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday observed that the issuance of a special Court order on Central Bank's former governor Arjuna Lakshman Mahendran was not required because he has till March 8 to report to the CID.

She said such move would be considered if he fails to report to the CID at least by that date.

Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara prosecuting, informed Court that the order issued on Mr. Mahendran was not carried out because the Singapore courier service was unable to locate him at his current address in that country.

He said however, the courier service had thereafter dialled Mr. Mahendran's mobile phone number and the person answering the phone identified himself as Lakshman said he was returning to Singapore on March 30.

The DSG sought a court order to permitting the CID to record more statements from Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena because they had reported sick on the previous occasion.

He also requested Court to direct Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) to send a company representative to Court as it was liable for the offences committed under the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and that under Section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code the company should be represented during the inquiry.

President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa who appeared for the defense undertook to have a company representative in Court at the next hearing.

Meanwhile Counsel Jeewantha Jayathilake appearing for Mr. Aloysius informed Court that his client was suffering from a bad skin condition and a urine infection and as such request Court to direct the prison authorities to produce Mr. Aloysius before a prison doctor or a suitable medical officer.

He said because of media pressure the prison authorities appear reluctant to allow his client medical attention.

However, the Magistrate said under a Judicial Services Commission circular, the Court could not issue such orders with reference to a suspect's medical condition and directed the prison authorities to consider Mr. Aloysius' request and produce him before a suitable medical officer.

She also permitted the CID to record further statements from the suspects who were in remand custody and re-remanded them till March 15. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
