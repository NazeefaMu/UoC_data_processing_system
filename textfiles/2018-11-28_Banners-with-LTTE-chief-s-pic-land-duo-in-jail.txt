Two members of a fringe Tamil nationalist party were arrested on Tuesday for putting up banners with slain LTTE chief V Prabhakaran's photos at Mehul Circle at Mulund's New Junction. Mathiyajagan Sundaram (33) and Palanivel Ravindra (24) have been booked for defacing public property.

Sources said the members of Naam Tamilar Katchi, led by film director-turned-politician Seeman, erected the banners for Prabhakaran's 64th birth anniversary, on Monday. Prabhakaran was the leader of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a militant organization, that sought to create an independent Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka. He was killed by Lankan forces in 2009.


After locals alerted Mulund police about the banners, they removed them and registered a case against unknown persons. "We booked them under the Maharashtra Prevention of Defacement of Property Act. On Tuesday, we identified two men involved in putting up the banners and arrested them. Both will be produced in court on Wednesday," said Sripad Kale, senior inspector, Mulund police.
