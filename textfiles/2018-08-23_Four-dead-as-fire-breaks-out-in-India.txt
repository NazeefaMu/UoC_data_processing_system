Hindustan Times, New Delhi, AUGUST 22,
 2018-  Four people were killed in a major fire at the Crystal Tower residential apartments near Hindmata Cinema in Mumbai’s Parel area on Wednesday, an official at the KEM hospital said.  


Confirming the deaths, Avinash Supe Dean KEM hospital said, “Total 20 victims were brought to the hospital. Four are dead, one of them a woman. Other 16 patients, six of them women, are stable.”  


The fire that started from the 12th floor at 8.55 am was doused by 10.15 am. The fire brigade personnel are now checking every flat for trapped people. They are breaking latches and doors to enter the flats.  Deputy chief fire officer R Chaudhari said, “Height and congestion proved a major challenge in fire fighting. And the building’s fire fighting system was not working, so that is a major problem in dealing with high-rise fires.”  


Earlier cranes were used to rescue some of those trapped on top floors people. No injuries were reported but people were taken to hospital for check ups. Two of those trapped were found unconscious.  Chief fire officer P Rahangdale said, “There was a lot of smoke on the 12th floor where the fire started, and the floors above. Smoke was logged in the staircase and all exits. ”
