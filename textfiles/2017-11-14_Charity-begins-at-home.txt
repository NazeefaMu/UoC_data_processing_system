Charity begins at home


	

This is a well-known case of nepotism in the public sector. Tenders worth billions for construction projects are often called. Many apply. But every tender is awarded at the end of the day to a relative of a very high political authority!




The relative has his own heavy vehicles, machinery and building materials to complete the jobs he undertakes in double quick time. But his constructions woefully lacking in quality and standards are not normally long lasting. They crack up or collapse. Complaints are being made to the authorities concerned. But no high-up would dare investigate for fear of reprisals!   


The relative rolling on money happily carries on!
