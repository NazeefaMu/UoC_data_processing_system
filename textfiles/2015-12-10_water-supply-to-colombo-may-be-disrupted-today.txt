	The Engineering Diplomates' Association and Technical Officers' Union of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said yesterday that there might be some disruption of the water supply to Colombo District as a result of a work-to-rule campaign conducted by them in Colombo today.
	Engineering Diplomates' Association president Ashoka de Alwis said all the Engineering Assistants of the NWSDB would participate in the campaign and refrain from carrying out overtime services, night time break down services and weekend/off day services from today -- and that that might result in a disruption of the water supply.
	Mr. Alwis said they had requested the authorities to resolve their issues, including recruitments and various salary anomalies of the engineering assistants, but that they had ignored them.
	He said they would extend their trade union action to the rest of the country if their issues were not resolved and that there might be delay in attending to breakdown services. They said the general manager of the Water Board should take the responsibility for that.(Ajith Siriwardane)
