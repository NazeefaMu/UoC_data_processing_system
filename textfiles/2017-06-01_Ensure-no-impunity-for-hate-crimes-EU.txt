Ensure no impunity for hate crimes: EU


	

The European Union (EU) today emphasized the importance of the Sri Lankan Government and the Police to ensure that there is no impunity for hate crimes in the country.

EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tung-Laï Margue said it was important that religious communities are at the forefront of efforts to promote understanding and oppose the spreading of hate.

"Sri Lankans know all too well the consequences of religious and ethnic hatred. These reprehensible actions are intended to sow discord at a time when national reconciliation and tolerance is moving forward,” he said.

He expressed these views after visiting Dewatagaha Mosque in Colombo to meet leaders of the Muslim community.

Apart from the EU Ambassador, the Heads of Missions of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa and Switzerland together with other diplomatic representatives today visited the mosque.

Issuing a statement, the EU Delegation said the visit followed in the wake of attacks on mosques and businesses owned by people in the community.

The ambassadors expressed their solidarity and welcomed the clear condemnation for these hate crimes from President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

They emphasised the importance of the rule of law and called for prompt action to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes were swiftly brought to justice. (By Thilanka Kanakarathna)
