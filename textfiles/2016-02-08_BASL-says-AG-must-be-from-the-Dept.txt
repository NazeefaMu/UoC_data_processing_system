BASL says AG must be from the Dept.


	

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) said today it had consistently taken up the position that the Attorney-General (AG) should ordinarily be selected from the officers of the AG’s department and that such appointment should preferably be in the order of seniority unless there were good reasons for not doing so.


In a statement on several media reports pertaining to the appointment of the AG, the BASL said it had not expressed any view on any particular individual or the holder of any particular office or position being appointed to the post of Attorney-General.
