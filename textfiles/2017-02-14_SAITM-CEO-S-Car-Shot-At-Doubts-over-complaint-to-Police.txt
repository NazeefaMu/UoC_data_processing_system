Police personnel, investigating the incident in which SAITM Chief Executive Officer Dr. Sameera Senaratne’s car was shot at, said today his complaint appeared contradictory.

A senior police officer said they were awaiting the Government Analyst’s report before making any further comments on the shooting and added that the Police were investigating the incident using the video footage from CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the shooting.

Meanwhile, the Government Analyst’s Department said the report would be handed over within three weeks.

The SAITM CEO escaped unhurt after two men riding a motorcycle wearing full-face helmets opened fire at his car near the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Campus in Malabe on February 6.

The shooting took place when the CEO was leaving the SAITM campus and had gone about 850 metres towards Chandrika Kumaranatunga Mawatha. The assailants who had been in front of the vehicle had damaged the windscreen.

His car and clothes were sent to the Analyst's Department for analysis. Police protection was also provided to Dr. Senaratne after the incident.

The SAITM CEO is said to have gone abroad amid the investigations. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
