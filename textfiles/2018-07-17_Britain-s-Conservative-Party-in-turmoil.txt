Britain’s Conservative Party in turmoil


	

UK, (Daily Mail), 15 July 2018 - The Labour Party today hinted that they could back a second EU referendum - as the Conservative party Brexit civil war threatened to tear the party apart.  


Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said that a second vote cannot be taken ‘off the table completely’.  
The hints come as the Tory Brexit civil war continues to rage as with mutinous Brexiteers warning the PM she must ditch her Chequers plan to risk being ousted as leader.   


London Mayor Sadiq Khan -Labour’s most senior elected politician- told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘If our Parliament rejects the deal the Prime Minister makes with the European Union this autumn, there are two options.   


‘One is a General Election. The second option is a referendum for people to have a say on what the government has done in relation to deal with the European Union.   
‘I’m not sure what other options the Government have.’
