	Democratic Party leader, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, said he would sue Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe for defamation and claim Rs. five billion as compensation.
	He said so at one of a series of awareness programmes conducted by his party, on Saturday, at the Oasis Hotel in Minuwangoda.
	"Field Marshal is a title given to a person of standing. It is only second to that of president. Persons rejected by the people as drug racketeers and extortioners have been made MPs. They are also part of the government," he said.
	Our party supporters were disappointed by the results of the last general election. The reason for our lack of success was that we contested alone -- without making alliances. In this series of meetings, we will make the people aware of our reasons for not entering into alliances, he said.
	He said Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was seeking Rs. 500 million from him because he said the government was protecting robbers. "I only get a pension of Rs.50,000. How can I pay him Rs.500 million?" he asked.
	"Education is not a necessary qualification for politics. But all who enter politics should be honest and able to understand the peoples’ aspirations," he said.
	The seminar was organised by the chief party organisers, Upul Nilantha of Minuwangoda, Sumeda Jayawardena of Katana and Nihal Silva of Divulapitiya.
	Provincial council members Indika Bandara and Anuruddha Lekamge were also present at the meeting.(Pushpakumara Mallawaarachchi)
