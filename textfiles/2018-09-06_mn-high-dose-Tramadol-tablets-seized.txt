A stock of more than 15 million high-dose Tramadol pills was nabbed yesterday at the Sri Lanka harbour by the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) Officers, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said.

He said the contraband was found in a container following a tip-off to the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) officers.

The raid was conducted with the support of the customs officers, he said.

“Each pill contains 225 milligrams dosage of Tramadol which is higher than the dosage recommended by physicians,” SP Gunasekera said.

He said during the raid, PNB officers found 150,50170 pills packed in 585 boxes.

The container was raided on transhipment to Libya from its manufactured country India, via the Colombo Harbour.

The PNB is conducting further investigations, but no suspects had been arrested yet, he said.
Meanwhile, a Customs official said the container had been taken under PNB custody during the transhipment and it was suspicious to say that the Tramadol pills must have been imported to the country as an alternative to heroin. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
