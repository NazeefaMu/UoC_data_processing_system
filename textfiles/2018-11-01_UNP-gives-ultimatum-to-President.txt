Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNF MPs acknowledge supporters at the rally

 

Basking in the warmth of cheers coming from thousands of UNP supporters wearing green caps outside Temple Tress on Tuesday (October 30), deposed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reiterated that his party would continue with the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty of Parliament and democracy. 

The protesters found many different ways to reject President Maithiripala Sirisena’s decisions – the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe and the hurried appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Premier-without consulting Parliament.

“I am not here for Ranil, I am here for democracy and good governance,”

“Respect the mandate, reconvene the Parliament,” “Dear MPs, country’s future in on your hands,”

“Dear MPs, think before you jump.”

With a pithy mix of humour, Tuesday’s protest was joined by thousands of people from Colombo and rural areas. Among the above mentioned slogans, “I am not here for Ranil, I am here for democracy and good governance,” was the signage that went viral long after the crowds dispersed. It gained a wide circulation on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Even Wickremesinghe replied to the signage posted on Twitter saying “And that’s okay. That is what democracy is about!”

One of the protesters told the Daily Mirror, “I’m not a UNPer, neither am I an SLFPer. I am not a follower of any political party in Sri Lanka. I just took leave from work today and came here because I want to see a democratic Government during my lifetime. I think there are many people who feel the same way. I mean they’re just not standing out here because they want some political party to come into power and it’s not worth the time. We are here for democracy and good governance”.

The general public still remains stunned due to the dramatic turn of political events unfolding in the country at the moment including the sudden ousting of Wickremesinghe and the surprising return of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. Adding to the drama were the hurried appointments of politicians and selected individuals to several Government institutions; which gave rise to alarming incidents of violations of law and order.

There were several familiar faces within the UNP, who had lost their ministerial portfolios, setting foot on a truck that served as a makeshift mobile stage. 

The Leader of the UNP Wickremesinghe, who arrived at the demonstration along with her wife Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe, vowed to continue with administrating the present Government as soon as the Constitutional crisis is solved. He said that everyone should join in the fight against arbitrary decisions taken by the President who had disregarded the people’s mandate and betrayed those who had worked hard for his victory at the elections.

 

Going against the mandate 

“This crowd is not all UNPers. There are many citizens who took time to attend this demonstration and do what is right as Sri Lankans regardless of their political opinion, race, religion or class,” Wickremesinghe told the crowd.
He said that the UNP supported Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 for the Presidenby and that the unity Government was given a mandate in 2015 and that included establishing democracy.

He said they did not expect President Sirisena to go against the mandate given to him.

He underscored that although the President is attempting to retain his executive powers the UNP will oppose it. Sajith Premadasa, Deputy Leader of the UNP, addressing the crowd said that the mandate of the people has been plundered by the country’s President. 

Premadasa said that he would never think twice if he has to risk his life to protect the people’s mandate and the trust of the UNP voters akin to his father Former President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

Meanwhile, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, speaking in a high pitched tone said that if he could once fight against a ‘notorious’ leader like Mahinda Rajapaksa, taking on Maithripala Sirisena is peanuts.

Expressing his gratitude towards the UNPers who attended the demonstration despite the short notice given, Fonseka said they would never let President Sirisena go back on the promises he had made to the people and commence a new political journey following a personal agenda.

 

Army deserter 

He also touched on the assassination plot associated with the President and Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. “They have found a random army deserter to fabricate a story about an assassination plot. It seems like this army deserter is now working as the Head of Intelligence Service of Maithripala Sirisena,” said Fonseka.

Wickramabahu Karunarathne was a prominent politician who took to the UNP stage, demanding justice.

“The entire civil society supports us and demands democracy,” he said issuing a warning and took the opportunity to convey to the President that they would be compelled to seize the President’s House unless Parliament is reconvened without further delay.

Ven. Dambara Amila Thera who supported the good governance campaign, said that the country is trapped internationally due to mounting pressure coming from the international community. The Thera warned that the country would have to face economic sanctions if law and order continues to be violated.

 



 

Ravi Karunanayake spoke about the injustices he has faced within his grand old party. However he said that he had decided to put the issues aside and support the party during this difficult time.

“Now is the time to unite. Now is the time to show our support to the party,” Karunanayake said.

Former Minister Rajitha Senaratne said, “The international community has warned that Sri Lanka would become a ‘pariah state’, if this fake Government continues. During a meeting between Prime Minister and the diplomatic community, a warning had been given to the President that economic sanctions and the cancellation of GSP facilities might have to be expected if the turmoil in the country remains unsolved.”

Meanwhile, politician Harin Fernando for the second time apologised to UNP supporters for making Maithripala Sirisena the President. 

He told the gathering, “It was we who brought you into power, and it will be we who will also send you home”.

In a shocking revelation, actor turned politician MP Ranjan Ramanayake said that several UNP MPs had sold themselves in favour of millions of rupees infamously given by China to strengthen the hands of Mahinda Rajapaksa.

UNP Parliamentarian Ajith. P. Perera, who made the final speech at the rally, said that the President would be given an ultimatum till Friday (November 2) to convene Parliament; if not the UNP would resort to further actions.
