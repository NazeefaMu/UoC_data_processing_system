Hydro massage bathing systems have been installed in bathrooms allotted to top brass attached to a military base in the North, they say.

 


These luxury bathrooms had been placed at the disposal of bigwigs in the military who functioned from AC rooms during the hostilities. 


A leading politician who was on an official visit to the North recently had the occasion to see these amenities. A swimming pool used by the military top brass too had been shown to him during his visit to the army base.
