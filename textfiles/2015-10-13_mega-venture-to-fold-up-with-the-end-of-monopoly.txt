Mega venture to fold up with the end of monopoly


	


This better half of a former big-mouthed Ministerial one has been carrying on a mega business with virtual left-overs of an important material – to be more explicit -- cut-pieces of fabrics from garment factories. 
She had secured the monopoly on the procurement of cut-pieces practically from all garment factories located in the free trade zones in the country. 
However, her roaring business is about to grind to a halt following an order issued by a yahapalanaya Ministerial one to end her monopoly on the trade, they say. 
The yahapalanaya Ministerial one is reported to have said that it is unfair to allow one person to enjoy a monopoly on a trade for a long period!
