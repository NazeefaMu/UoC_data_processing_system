The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today it would temporarily stay away from all discussions with the government until a national policy regarding international trade was formulated; the government reached a firm stance without making contradictory statements on the ECTA and back away from its hostile attitude towards the GMOA.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the decision was taken following the approval of its executive committee.

“The executive committee decided that the GMOA should stay away from discussions with the government as the government is insulting the GMOA while discussions are in progress,” he said.

Dr. Herath said the GMOA had several rounds of discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama on the proposed Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) and added that they pointed out the negative impact on the employment sector due to the agreement.

“We propose the government that a national policy on international trade was formulated before signing international trade agreements for which the government agreed during the discussions but they do not seem to have taken any move towards that,” Dr. Herath said.

GMOA media spokesman Dr. Naveen de Soyza said the government that came to power promising to ensure opinion of opposition factions had not allowed even the opinion of the professionals.

“The government does not like to uphold the opinion of the professionals as the uprising of the professionals is the destruction of the uneducated,” he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)
