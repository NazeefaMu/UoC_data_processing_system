A child was seen carrying ballot boxes from the polling centre situated at Pulathisipura National College of Education to another polling centre in Polonnaruwa today.

The distribution of ballot boxes commenced this morning and 295 polling centres have been installed with 3,500 officials being assigned for election duty in the Polonnaruwa District.

When contacted Polonnaruwa Government Agent Ranjith Ariyaratne said he was unaware about using children to transport ballot boxes due to his busy schedules.

However, a legal officer at the National Child Protection Authority said it was illegal to deploy underage children for such activities. (W.A. Piyathilaka)
