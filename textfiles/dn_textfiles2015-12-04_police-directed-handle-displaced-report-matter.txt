Police directed to handle 'displaced' report matter

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that he would direct the matter pertaining to the 'displaced' report on the arms smuggling inquiry, by a Commission headed by Supreme Court Justice Shirani Thilakawardena, to the Police.
The Commission report was allegedly displaced at the President's Secretariat during the previous regime.
He made this observation in Parliament while National Policy and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera was responding to a question by Opposition member Vasudeva Nanayakkara for oral answers.
State Minister Perera said the report was to be handed over to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on January 28, 2008. However it had been displaced. He added that the Secretary and Additional Secretary of the President's Secretariat informed in writing on June 22, to Justice Shirani Thilakawardena to send a copy of the same report again. He added so far the letter had not been responded to. At this stage when Nanayakkara inquired if the matter had been directed to the FCID, the Prime Minister said the matter would be directed to Police.
He added that these documents and vehicles have been misplaced and did not know as to what else have been displaced.
