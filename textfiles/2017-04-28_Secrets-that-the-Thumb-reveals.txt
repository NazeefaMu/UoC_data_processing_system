The Thumb as in the case of fingers is divided into three main parts. These three parts described as phalanges like those of the fingers represent three worlds, embodying three supreme qualities, says renowned palmistry expert Psycho. They are: Willpower and Determination as shown by the first or the nail phalanx, Reason and Logic by the second and Love and Sympathy by the third or the Mount of Venus.


According to Psycho, the special attributes of the first phalanx are will power, decision- making and the ability to command others and those of the second are perception, judgment, and reasoning faculties. The attributes of the third phalanx are love, sympathy and passion.


Indian experts in Palmistry describe the first phalanx of the Thumb as ‘Sat’, the second as -Raj’ and the third as -Tam’. They say that the first phalanx is indicative of science and willpower, the middle or the second part shows logic and thinking capacity and the third love, attraction and affection. Despite there being a difference in the use of phraseology in describing the attributes of the three phalanges of the thumb, both Psycho of the West and experts in India say the same thing substantially.


The first phalanx: A person whose first phalanx is longer than the second phalanx is endowed with willpower and the ability to take independent decisions. Such persons do not like to work as subordinates. They usually possess a majestic personality. They lead a more contented and happier life in old age than when they are young.


The second phalanx: This phalanx of the Thumb represents the power of reasoning, or logic. If the second phalanx of a person is stronger and bigger than the first, he would command such reasoning power seldom one would dare challenge him. Very often they are not reasonable people. They are not prepared to give way, even if they are proved wrong. They are more bent on winning a debating point than seeking the truth. They are not respected in any society.


When this phalanx is thin, the owner would be a garrulous, loose-tongued person who  would blurt out whatever that comes to his mind. Therefore, what this type of persons say is not taken seriously. The pastime of this type of persons very often is finding fault with their superiors behind their back.
If the first and second phalanges of a person are equal in length, width, and thickness, he would be a cool-headed person who remains unruffled under all circumstances. He is very sober and would face both praise and abuse with equanimity. These persons are endowed with self-confidence. They are not gullible and cannot be misled or cheated.


Persons whose second phalanx is thinner and weaker in comparison to the first phalanx are those incapable of doing any work without guidance and supervision. They do not have definite ideas and are unreliable.


The third phalanx: This phalanx is not a phalanx like others. It is really the Mount of Venus. Persons having a comparatively prominent and elegant Mount of Venus are cultured persons with refined manners. Such persons are popular and are respected in the society.


People with an unusually prominent Mount of Venus are promiscuous and very passionate. They would not be faithful to the spouse.


When the Mount of Venus is depressed and hardly noticeable, and there are too many lines on the area, the owner would be a frustrated lover. He is not respected in society. He has to face many problems in married life.
