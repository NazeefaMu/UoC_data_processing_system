Buying silence


	



 

The story about forcing the school principal to kneel down spread fast across the country and the angry reactions from the people from all walks of life unnerved those involved in the incident.

 


They consulted pundits as to how they could put a stop to the protests coming up in various parts of the country practically every day.  “Give the media people a grand treat and top it up with a gift for each of them!” was the advice they got. 


“But we can’t just give them a treat. There should be some occasion!” the beleaguered ones pointed out. “O! That’s simple. Say that you are inviting them to a New Year party!” was the reply.  So a select group of media people were hosted to a grand New Year party and showered with gifts as well!
