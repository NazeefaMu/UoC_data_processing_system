Sarath de Abrew calls it a day

Supreme Court Judge Sarath de Abrew has sent in retirement papers, informed sources told the Daily News.
The CID, three months ago, filed charges against Justice Abrew at the Mount Lavinia Magistrate's Court for sexually harassing his domestic aide.
He was later released by the Mount Lavinia Magistrate on personal bail of Rs. 500,000. Subsequent to the case, the Sri Lanka Bar Association requested the Chief Justice to prevent Abrew from sitting and carrying out functions as a Supreme Court judge.
