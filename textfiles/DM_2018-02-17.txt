Appeals court declares Trump travel ban unconstitutional
	
THE HINDU, 16th FEBRUARY, 2018- President Donald Trumps latest travel ban on travellers from six largely Muslim countries is unconstitutionally tainted with animus toward Islam, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday, delivering another blow to the policy. In a 9-4 vote, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond said it examined statements made by Mr. Trump and other administration officials, as well as the presidential proclamation imposing the ban, and concluded that it second-guesses our nations dedication to religious freedom and tolerance.
The 4th Circuit is the second federal appeals court to rule against the ban. In December, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that Mr. Trump exceeded the scope of his authority with the latest ban.
The 4th Circuit court upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Maryland who issued an injunction barring enforcement of the ban against people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen who have bona fide relationships with people in the U.S. The U.S. Supreme Court has already agreed to hear the travel ban case in April. In December, the high court said the ban could be fully enforced while appeals made their way through the courts.
In its ruling, the 4th Circuit said the ban has a much broader deleterious effect than banning certain foreign nationals.

Ethiopian PM Desalegn quits after mass anti-govt protests
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 16th FEBRUARY, 2018- Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned Thursday after long-running political turmoil, in an unprecedented move in the vast East African country.
The decision by Hailemariam, in power since 2012, comes after months of escalating anti-government protests and signs of growing splits within the ruling coalition.
Hailemariam said he had worked hard to solve Ethiopias problems, but that he believed his resignation was also part of the solution.
We know that we are in the process of achieving these reforms, he told the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation.
I myself, want to become part of the solution. The ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and government will make history again by conducting a peaceful power transition in our country, he added. Hailemariam will remain in office until parliament and the EPRDF coalition confirm his resignation. It remains unclear who will take over.

Florida gunman had extra ammo at school, fired for 3 minutes
	

The teenager accused of using a semi-automatic rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school confessed to carrying out one of the nations deadliest school shootings and carried extra ammunition in his backpack, according to a sheriffs department report released
on Thursday.
Nikolas Cruz told investigators that he shot students in the hallways and on the grounds of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, north of Miami, the report from the Broward County Sheriffs Office said.
Cruz said he brought more loaded magazines to the school and kept them in the backpack until he got on campus.
The gunman fired into five classrooms four on the first floor of the school and one on the second floor, Sheriff Scott Israel said.
The shooting lasted for three minutes. When he was done firing, the assailant went to the third floor and dropped his AR-15 rifle and the backpack containing the ammunition. He then ran out of the building and attempted to blend in with fleeing students, Mr. Israel said.
After the rampage, the suspect headed to a Wal-Mart and bought a drink at a Subway restaurant before walking to a McDonalds. He was taken into custody about 40 minutes after leaving the McDonalds, the sheriff said.
A day after the attack, a fuller portrait emerged of the shooter, a loner who had worked at a dollar store, joined the schools ROTC program and posted photos of weapons on Instagram. At least one student said classmates joked that Cruz would be the one to shoot up the school.
The 19-year-old orphan whose mother died last year was charged with murder Thursday in the assault that devastated this sleepy community on the edge of the Everglades. It was the nations deadliest school attack since a gunman targeted an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, more than five years ago.

How Mahinda Trapped Maithripala With The SLFP Party Leadership
	
The political charisma of Mahinda Rajapaksa is the sole ingredient in the SLPP recipe for success. This success is most likely to be repeated in forthcoming provincial council polls too.


Unless Maithripala Sirisena rapidly undertakes serious course correction, he is most likely to go down in history as the man who was elected to govern a country but instead preferred to lead a political party.
There was a time not so very long ago when Maithripala Sirisena earned the respect and goodwill of the nation. Now that larger than life image is diminishing into a pathetic caricature.
Maithripala Sirisenas ill-advised decision to take over the reins of the SLFP was the first success notched up by Mahinda Rajapaksa in his political counteroffensive.
The tactic of raising the demand for Rajapaksas return by non  SLFP leaders of the UPFA sustained the illusion of the SLFP being under the total control of Maithripala Sirisena.
Some MPs, Ministers and Provincial Councillors may remain with Maithripala for the time being, but will most likely switch sides again soon.


By D.B.S. Jeyaraj

Pallewatte Gamaralalage Maithripala Yapa Sirisena is currently in the throes of an acute political crisis after the Local Government poll results.
It was only some weeks ago that a pugnacious and cocky President Sirisena threatened to wield his kaduwa (sword) against members of his own Govt. and Opposition as part of his self-declared crusade against corruption.
Little did he realise while twirling his vocal sword that a Damoclean Sword in the form of the local poll verdict was hanging over him.
Instead of being able to dictate terms to his perceived targets through his political swordplay, the President himself is in the unenviable position of being at their mercy now. Maithripala Sirisena faces the bitter prospect of political Hara-kiri if he does not get help from either Ranil Wickremesinghe or Mahinda Rajapaksa or possibly both. How have the mighty fallen!
There was a time not so very long ago when Maithripala Sirisena earned the respect and goodwill of the nation. Now that larger than life image is diminishing into a pathetic caricature.
The reason or reasons for this downfall are quite clear. Maithripala Sirisena was elected President on a platform of reform. He was elected to govern a country. Instead, he preferred the parochial task of being a leader of a discredited political party.
Sirisena who was installed as President to run a Government of good governance occupied himself more with the affairs of running the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the umbrella United Peoples Freedom Alliance(UPFA). It was the SLFP/UPFA which opposed him vehemently in the 2015 Presidential Poll. But Maithripala was obsessed with the idea of bringing the SLFP under his effective control and making it stronger than the United National Party (UNP). He forgot the reason for which he was elected and lost all sense of political direction. In an ironic twist, Maithripala Sirisena turned his back on the political party and minority ethnicities which helped elect him President and began pandering to the party and the Sinhala ultra-nationalist constituency that opposed him.
Maithripala Sirisena shared a dinner of egg hoppers with Mahinda Rajapaksa at Temple Trees in November 2014 where he assured the then President that he had no intention of crossing over. Yet within days, Sirisena left the Govt. and became the Common Opposition candidate at the Presidential Election.
In what was hailed as a political revolution, the underdog Sirisena defeated top dog Rajapaksa and was sworn in as President. There were many who felt then that the writing was on the wall for Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Machiavelli Of Medamulana
The Machiavelli of Medamulana- instead of being written off as predicted - has made a spectacular political comeback and in the process reduced his erstwhile friend turned foe into insignificance. Mahinda seems to have achieved this by letting Sirisena walk into a trap shortly after he was elected President.
Maithripala Sirisena and his cohorts thought Mahinda had been dealt a double blow when the defeated ex-president lost his SLFP Party leadership also to the new President.
It now appears that donning the SLFP mantle of leadership was the fundamental blunder which undermined President Sirisena and has led to the current downfall.
As is well known now, Mahinda Rajapaksa erred grievously in calling for premature Presidential elections in 2014 and suffered bitter defeat in 2015.
Goliath Mahinda was slain through the ballot by David Maithripala. The circumstances leading to Mahinda Rajapaksas defeat have been related and analysed ad nauseam by numerous political pundits.
They need no repetition here at this juncture. What has been interesting even more than the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa was the resilient attempt by the ex-president to rise up from that defeat and transform the prevailing political equation.
With the Local Government poll verdict, Mahinda seems to have achieved that now. The political fightback of Mahinda Rajapaksa after electoral defeat provides a fascinating study for political observers as well students of politics.
Mahinda Rajapaksa was in a beleaguered state after facing defeat on the night of January 8th, 2015. Bleak prospects were in store for him in a post-defeat situation. These ranged from legal action for alleged offences in domestic tribunals to punitive censure in International fora. There was, however, silver linings in the dark cloud of defeat that was threatening to envelop him.
Firstly the victorious Maithripala Sirisena had failed to win the numerical majority of the ethnic majority. It was estimated that 55% of votes cast by members of the Sinhala community had been in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa. On the other hand, estimates said 81% of voters from the three ethnic minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims and Indian Tamils had polled for Maithripala Sirisena.
This had helped offset the disadvantage suffered by Sirisena in the Sinhala constituency and entitled him to overall victory. Though the final result had favoured Sirisena, he was unable to win over the majority of the Sinhalese.
Since the Sinhalese comprise 74 % of the total population and Rajapaksa had won over half of the Sinhala votes, Medamulana Mahinda could not be easily written off politically. Even though some sneeringly apply a racist veneer to this support, the fact remains that it is indeed a strong point in Mahindas favour and grants him considerable political clout.

Sirisena who was installed as President to run a Government of good governance occupied himself more with the affairs of running the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the umbrella United Peoples Freedom Alliance(UPFA).

Secondly, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and its premier constituent the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had been firmly opposed to the ultimate victor Maithripala Sirisena. Individuals and parties from the SLFP and UPFA may have thrown in their lot with Sirisena at the hustings but the SLFP and the SLFP led UPFA were organizationally intact and firmly behind Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It was anticipated earlier that the Vaasi Pattata Hoiya syndrome would prevail after the Sirisena victory and that Parliamentarians would desert the SLFP/UPFA in large numbers. Several MPs did cross, but the bulk of MPs did not. Even some of the crossers over were fifth columnists bent on sabotage.

Sub-Terranean Hostility
The expected large-scale desertion did not happen mainly because the election result had demonstrated that the majority of Sinhala voter support was still with Mahinda. Thus most MPs opted to stay put with Mahinda rather than hitch their wagon to the Maithripala star.
Besides, there was subterranean hostility towards Maithripala within the party rank and file. Sirisena may have been hailed as a saviour of democracy by the likes of former British Premier David Cameron and ex-US Secretary of State John Kerry but to the local SLFP stalwart, Maithripala is a hated politician, who betrayed his party by crossing over and then forming a Government dominated by the UNP.
As former US Congress speaker Tip ONeill famously observed: All politics is local.
These silver linings, therefore, provided Mahinda Rajapaksa with space to manoeuvre politically. Basic tenets of guerrilla warfare emphasise the need to trade space for a time when required.
In Mahindas case too he needed to trade off space to acquire more time. This time was essential to delay or ward off an anticipated political offensive by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe-Kumaratunga triumvirate and also to launch the counter-offensive to regain lost political ground. So Mahinda Rajapaksa began trading off the political space he had.
A chain is as strong as its weakest link. As far as the Maithri-Ranil-Chandrika trio was concerned the weakest link was perceived as President Sirisena. During the election campaign, Mahinda had stated that the fight was really between Chandrika and himself. He also identified Ranil and the UNP as arch-rivals. Maithripala, however, was a different kettle of fish. The man whom Mahinda accused of eating egg hoppers with him at night and committing political treachery in the morning was a sturdy son of the Rajarata soil with old-fashioned values.
Apart from a brief flirtation with Rohana Wijeweeras Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in his youth, Maithripala Sirisena had been a loyal SLFPer throughout. Sirisena was not an aristocrat but true blue blood ran in his veins.
In Oscar Wildes Lady Windermeres Fan, the character Cecil Graham queries What is a cynic, to which Lord Darlington replies A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
Cecil Graham then interjects And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and doesnt know the market price of any single thing.
In a Sri Lankan political scenario, Mahinda Rajapaksa is a cynical realist who knows the price of everything and Maithripala Sirisena a sentimentalist who saw an absurd value in everything.
Thus sentimental Maithripala was a virtual sitting duck when cynical Mahinda trained his guns on him.

State Of Denial
Mahinda Rajapaksa realised that Maithripala Sirisena was in a state of denial about the true state of the SLFP and himself. During the campaign, Maithripala had insisted that he was still the Secretary of the Party and would remain so.
Sirisena was also sensitively vulnerable to charges of having betrayed and broken the party, He was very keen that the SLFP should not fragment because of him.
What Sirisena failed to realise was that the SLFP had fractured as soon as he crossed over with a handful of loyalists. Much water had flown under the bridge thereafter. Yet, Maithripala continued to labour under the sentiment-driven illusion that the SLFP egg could be made whole again after cracking it and making an omelette out of the yolks.
Assessing Maithripalas mindset correctly, Mahinda made the President an offer that he could not refuse. The leadership of the SLFP and by extension the chairmanship of the UPFA was offered to him on a platter. The icing on the cake was presenting Maithripala a potential opportunity to prevent the break-up of the SLFP.
Here was a man whom the nation had elected democratically as head of the country to genuinely unify it. This was a noble responsibility. Yet, the President laid greater value at that juncture in being head of a political party and preserving its unity.
Had Mahinda not ceded that space to Maithripala there may have been a political tussle leading to a legal wrangle. While the party constitution enabled the elected President to be Leader of the Party there was also a condition that the person was elected from the party or a party led alliance. If there was an open confrontation over party leadership the SLFP would certainly have been torn apart with the greater part opting to support Rajapaksa.
Hence President Sirisena grasped the rose plant offered with all its nestles. Some of Sirisenas acolytes doubling up as political commentators while holding patronage posts described this SLFP takeover by Sirisena as a rout of Rajapaksa. This was not what had happened but Sirisena was lulled into the triumphant mode by the sycophantic Jayawewa kattiya.
Wrapped in a sentimental haze, President Sirisena failed to take note of a basic truth. Maithripala had gone against the SLFP and won with the support of other parties.
His victory was made possible by the UNP while his own party had worked against him. The elementary truth was that the SLFP as a party was inherently hostile to him. It was still under the de-facto control of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Mahinda could pull the carpet from under Maithripalas feet at any time he desired. The dice was loaded against Maithripala. Still, he chose to roll the dice thinking he could assert his authority gradually over the SLFP.

Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga
When Mahinda Rajapaksa contested and won the Presidency in November 2005, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the leader of the SLFP.
Mahinda amended the Party Constitution whereby it was stipulated that anyone elected from the party as President would automatically become party leader. By this move, Mahinda succeeded in removing Chandrika as party leader.
The unexpected however happened when Sirisena crossed over and became the Common Opposition candidate. Mahinda suspended Maithripala from the party but did not expel him.
So Maithripalas suspension was removed and this enabled Maithripala to turn the tables on Mahinda by taking over the SLFP after he was elected President.
It was in a sense poetic justice as the provision brought in by Mahinda to eliminate Chandrika as leader was now used to replace Mahinda with Maithripala.
Still, Mahinda could have challenged Maithripala Sirisena becoming SLFP leader if he wanted to. A basic common sense approach could have indicated that the President as party leader clause was only meant for candidates from the party.

None of which was taken seriously. No punitive action followed. Sirisena was perceived as a weak leader. The Mahinda movement tasted blood. A series of demonstrations followed at regular intervals in places like Kandy, Ratnapura, Matara and Kurunegala.
Maithripala had contested against the SLFP/UPFA at the Presidential Poll and defeated his mother party with the help of the much detested traditional rival the UNP.
Returning to the party after such an act would have been unacceptable. Accepting such a renegade back into party folds and crowning him as party leader would have been virtually impossible under such circumstances. Yet, like Ripleys Believe it or Not, this is exactly what happened.
Mahinda did not oppose Maithripala taking over the party. He did not resort to legal action or engineer a revolt within party rank and file. Actually, Mahinda facilitated the re-entry of Maithripala and made the offer unofficially. The Medamulana Machiavelli was setting a trap for Maithripala by making him SLFP Leader.
Will you walk into my Parlour said the spider to the fly in the poem by Mary Howitt. The fly was deceived by the cunning spiders flattery and walked in.
That was the end of the fly. Likewise, Maithripala walked into Mahindas trap of party leader.
He is now feeling the consequences of the trap he has walked or fallen into.
President Sirisena had acquired the nominal leadership of the SLFP but real power was still in the hands of Mahinda Rajapaksa who was quite content to let Maithripala lull himself into the false belief of being the undisputed SLFP leader.
Sirisenas political blunder of taking over the leadership of the party that had fought against him fiercely at the presidential polls began causing fissures within the Sirisena  Wickremesinghe Government.
Sirisena, however, was hopeful that he would be able to oust Mahinda permanently from politics and establish full control over the party. This belief was bolstered by the dead rope given to Maithripala by senior SLFP leaders who were engaged in acts of political deception for their own reasons.


Three Schools Of Thought
The SLFP itself now could be categorised broadly into three schools of thought. One category was strongly supportive of Mahinda Rajapaksa and opined that notwithstanding his flaws the ex-President was the only person capable of mobilising votes for the party.
Another category was opposed to Rajapaksa and had thrown in its lot with Sirisena. Still, many in this category were uncomfortable about aligning with the UNP.
The third category was undecided and wavering. Some in this third category were like cat-on-the-wall-prepared to jump to whichever side was more beneficial. Others were firmly loyal to the party only and were ready to support the acknowledged leader of the SLFP.
Another foible  if one may call it that - in President, Sirisena was his self  perception of being a great statesman. Being a Liberal Democrat by temperament and attitude, Sirisena felt that he could achieve many things through dialogue and discussion.
Former President Ranasinghe Premadasa used to describe his political approach as the 3Cs namely Consultation, Compromise and Consensus.
Despite paying lip service to the consultation, compromise and consensus formula, the headstrong Premadasa seldom practised this sincerely. Realpolitik decreed otherwise. But President Sirisena sincerely thought he could govern by consensus or more particularly bi-partisan consensus. Since the SLFP was the largest party in Parliament, he needed to exert greater influence over it, as a leader to achieve that elusive consensus.
The mistaken notion that he was the supreme leader of the SLFP compelled Sirisena to protect the party and preserve his leadership. It was also necessary to increase SLFP representation in the Government to counterbalance the UNP.
When the Yahapalanaya Government was formed there were only a handful of SLFPers with Maithripala. Now he thought he had the entire party under him.
He naively believed that the party would be loyal to him after he became the accredited leader. So more posts had to be given to the SLFP as rewards to guarantee support and ensure loyalty.
What Sirisena failed to recognize at that juncture was that some of those SLFPers who joined the Government had the underhand motive of sabotaging his relations with the UNP and Chandrika Kumaratunga.
As a result of accommodating more SLFP members in the Government, the initial pledge of a small sized Cabinet was flouted. What was even worse was the need to cushion party members from being penalised for alleged offences of omission and commission when in power.
If consensus was to be reached, the cooperation of the party was essential. Logically party members could not be expected to cooperate at one level when legal action was being pursued against them on another level. Besides donning the leadership mantle of the party meant Maithripala Sirisena had to watch the interests of the party.

Good Governance administrative
What many tend to ignore is the fact that Maithripala Sirisena was part and parcel of the Mahinda led Government and SLFP until he crossed over in November 2014.
It could be argued therefore that Sirisena had a vested interest in safeguarding most members of the Rajapaksa regime even in a changed equation. There was also the duty of separating the noncorrupt from the corrupt among party loyalists and winning them over to his way of thinking.
This led to a pronounced lethargy in the yahapalanaya (Good Governance) Governments avowed objective of cracking down on those who had abused or misused power.
Maithripala Sirisenas ill-advised decision to take over the reins of the SLFP was the first success notched up by Mahinda Rajapaksa in his political counteroffensive.
Ironically it was well disguised as a defeat for Rajapaksa and victory for Sirisena. The President reverting to the party he had deserted to contest as common presidential candidate irked the UNP. Sirisenas political godmother Chandrika Kumaratunga was also annoyed. The cracks began to appear. Still the Presidents hurrah boys egged him on as Maithripala Sirisena embarked upon this colossal exercise in futility.
Having neutralised President Maithripala to some extent and also driven a wedge into the ranks of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe-Government through the act of conceding SLFP leadership, Mahinda Rajapaksa began opening another front.

In an ironic twist, Maithripala Sirisena turned his back on the political party and minority ethnicities which helped elect him President and began pandering to the party and the Sinhala ultra-nationalist constituency that opposed him.

In military parlance, Mahinda withdrew from the SLFP front and re-opened the UPFA front. It was a dazzling political drama of pretension often enacted by political leaders. They pretend to be ready to forego power by declaring their intention to resign or quit office. This is followed up by orchestrated demonstrations by supporters demanding that their leader should not resign or quit. The demonstrations have the appearance of being spontaneous. Finally with feigned reluctance the great leader bows down to the wishes of the people and revises his earlier stance.
Mahinda Rajapaksa too followed this time-tested path but with his own type of spin. He had quit Presidential office even before the full result was announced. He had now given up his claim to party leadership. The image he sought to project was that of Mahinda Rajapaksa not being a power-hungry person. Mahinda now retired to his residences in Medamulana and Tangalle and began entertaining daily visitors arriving in busloads. Mahinda also went around the country paying homage at Buddhist places of worship.He interacted with the media briefly on such occasions. The image portrayed was that of a king going into a hermitage. Having given up his party leadership willingly Rajapaksa was now seeking a quiet life of retirement and religious contemplation.

Bring Back Mahinda Movement
This appearance of withdrawal from active politics was a deceptive facade. As stated before, the UPFA political front had been opened. Four trusted captains from constituent parties in the UPFA have entrusted the task of launching and promoting a Bring Back Mahinda movement.
They were Dinesh Gunawardane, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila. This famous four comprising three Parliamentarians and one Provincial Councillor were the prime movers and shakers who organized the first Bring Back Mahinda rally at Nugegoda. None of them was from the SLFP.
The tactic of raising the demand for Rajapaksas return by nonSLFP leaders of the UPFA sustained the illusion of the SLFP being under the total control of Maithripala Sirisena.
It was as if the SLFP front-liners marking attendance at pro-Mahinda rallies were doing so in their individual capacities.
The party as an entity was not supportive of such a stance. After all, was not Maithripala Sirisena the accredited leader of the SLFP The reality, however, was different. There were certain sections in the party who were hostile to Mahinda and amenable to Sirisena but the bulk of the MPs, councillors, local authority heads, and office bearers of party organizations and branches, financial backers, propagandists and above all members at the grass root level were supportive of Rajapaksa.
The Nugegoda rally succeeded in shocking and awing the nation. By a well-executed demonstration at Nugegoda, Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to prove that he was not a spent force and that he was a force to be reckoned with yet.
The Nugegoda rally was followed by a series of Bring Back Mahinda demonstrations in different parts of the country. The intention was to show that the people were clamouring for a return of Mahinda Rajapaksa to the political helm. Bringing Back Mahinda to Temple Trees was the new mantra.
The UPFA sponsored rally was held at Nugegoda in February 2015. It was a success from the point of view of the organizers. A very large crowd both contrived and voluntary had converged at the venue. More importantly, a large number of SLFP Parliamentarians, provincial councillors and local authority representatives attended the event without mounting the stage. The defiance displayed by these MPs and councillors from the SLFP was a direct affront to the new party leader Maithripala.
This was the acid test for the president. How would he react Would he sting like a bee and show who the boss was
President Sirisena did not sting like a bee! If at all he did sting, it was like a butterfly. Empty warnings and feeble threats were issued.
None of which was taken seriously. No punitive action followed. Sirisena was perceived as a weak leader. The Mahinda movement tasted blood. A series of demonstrations followed at regular intervals in places like Kandy, Ratnapura, Matara and Kurunegala.
The participation of SLFP Parliamentarians and councillors increased in numbers. Some even took to the stage. Later the iron butterfly Hirunika Premachandra was to observe that had President Sirisena cracked down hard on SLFP elements in the aftermath of the Nugegoda rally, the other rallies may not have occurred. That, however, did not happen as President Sirisena was found wanting. Instead of fizzling out the Bring Back Mahinda movement continued to dazzle.

Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna
The Bring Back Mahinda movement is breathing the sweet smell of success now. A new political party, Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP), formed with Mahinda Rajapaksa as its de-facto head has defeated the traditional UNP and SLFP at localGovernment polls.
Moreover, the UNP and SLFP are part of a coalition Government and it has been the practice in local authority elections for voters to align themselves more with the parties in power.
Yet, this norm has been disregarded in the polls. The political charisma of Mahinda Rajapaksa is the sole ingredient in the SLPP recipe for success. This success is most likely to be repeated in forthcoming provincial council polls too.
It has been demonstrated clearly that even though Maithripala Sirisena is the De-jure leader of the SLFP, the De-facto leader is Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Some MPs, Ministers and Provincial Councillors may remain with Maithripala for the time being, but will most likely switch sides again soon.
As for the SLFP rank and file, they have been and will be with Mahinda.
Maithripala Sirisena will continue to indulge in brave rhetoric and engage in unpredictable unorthodox acts for the rest of his term. The facade of being Executive President will continue to be maintained and Maithripala Sirisena will go through the motions of exercising Executive
Presidential power.
The reality, however, is that he is politically de-valued and has been turned into a lame duck President. The Machiavelli of Medamulana has entrapped the Rajarata Reformer with the temptation of party leadership and has in the processenfeebled him.
Unless Maithripala Sirisena rapidly undertakes serious course correction, he is most likely to go down in history as the man who was elected to govern a country but instead preferred to lead a political party.

Ranjan to work towards a truce between Prez and PM
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday he had met President Maithripala Sirisena to bring about a truce with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and iron out any differences between them.
He said he met the President as a peace maker. I am a symbol of peace (Sama Kurulla) and therefore I decided to undertake this mission, he said.
The President had told him that he was under pressure from certain groups who did not want to work with the UNP.
I will continue with my effort in bringing the two leaders together and ensure that the President comes forward as the common candidate. I am a friend of both the President and the Prime Minister, and also of the 6.2 million people who voted for a change in January 2015, the deputy minister said.
He was our candidate and I want to maintain that status, he said and added that it should be understood.
Also he said that everyone should understand that a government cannot be changed through a local government election. (Yohan Perera)

South Africas Ramaphosa set to outline priorities in key speech
	

REUTERS, 16th FEBRUARY, 2018- South Africas new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is expected to give more details about how he plans to tackle corruption and boost economic growth on Friday, when he delivers his first state of the nation address. Ramaphosa was sworn in as head of state on Thursday after his scandal-plagued predecessor, Jacob Zuma, reluctantly resigned on orders of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
His election as president, which was unopposed in the parliament, has prompted a wave of optimism among South Africans hungry for change after nine years of economic stagnation and corruption scandals under Zuma. Zuma denies all wrongdoing.
Its all systems go. We are expecting our political program to be delivered by the new president, parliamentary speaker Baleka Mbete told state broadcaster SABC from Cape Town, where the state of the nation address will be made from around 1700 GMT.
Ramaphosa, who will see out the remainder of Zumas presidential term until elections next year, faces an uphill battle to win public and investor support. Africas most developed economy needs faster economic growth if it is to reduce high unemployment - currently at 27 percent - and alleviate widespread poverty that has persisted since the end of white minority rule in 1994.

The lady with the Midas Touch
	
Deshamanya Mrs. Sivagamie Verina Obeyesekere or Siva Obeyesekere as she is popularly known was born to Amybelle Charlotte Valerie Corea and Louis Robert Clifton Dassenaike on the 7th of May 1929.
Educated at CMS Ladies College up to the Senior School Certificate, Siva was a hostel prefect, games captain, and captain of the netball and tennis teams from 1943 to 1948. She married Senator Deshamanya James Peter Obeyesekere, the only child of Maha Mudliyar, Sir J.P. Obeyesekere and Lady A.E. Obeyesekere in 1948. James Obeyesekere, having schooled at Royal College finished his education at the University of Cambridge and piloted his own airplane back to Ceylon in 1946. When S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike broke away from the UNP to form the SLFP in 1951, James and Siva were among the first to join him. James, was the Member of Parliament for Attanagalle, a Deputy Minister of Health, a Deputy Minister of Finance and a Senator. He was conferred the national honour of Deshamanya by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Obeyesekeres have two children, Peter and Chantal. Chantal, who has donned her parents mantle and continues to work towards the development of indigenous arts and crafts and promoting local talent. Married to Dijen de Saram they have two children, Dhevan and Chiara.
Siva Obeyesekere, can be most appropriately referred to as the Lady with the Midas Touch. Her sincerity of purpose and her boundless capacity for hard work and producing results brought her into the limelight, being a woman of matchless vision. Behind every successful man there is a woman and needless to say Siva was a force to reckon with supporting James to the hilt!
During the period 1960 to 1965, when James was Member of Parliament for Attanagalle, Siva organized Community Health Programmes in 127 villages located in the Attanagalle electorate and actively began to develop handicraft and handloom centres as well. Appointed the Chairperson of the Small Industries Board in 1961, she organized sewing centres and traditional crafts centres, reviving the District Cooperative Unions in handloom textiles.
In 1963, she was appointed the Chairperson of the Accommodation Committee and a Member of the Tourist Development Council and was responsible for the drafting of the Tourist Development Act. In 1964, Siva inaugurated Laksala the first Government Cottage Industries Emporium and was the Chairman of its Advisory Board. She established the Craftsmans Association of Sri Lanka and promoted the Master Craftsmans Apprenticeship Scheme. Elected President  National Artisans & Craftsmans Association in 1973, she inaugurated Lakpahana a private sector organization for the promotion of local handicrafts.

A founder member of the SLFP she worked tirelessly for the party from the age of 22. A devout Christian, Siva Obeyesekere broke tradition by challenging the UNP at the Parliamentary election in 1965 by contesting the Mirigama seat, which is a UNP stronghold dominated by a Buddhist population. Although her opponent underestimated the chances of this 36 year old Christian from winning she beat the more experienced Wijayabahu Wijesinghe by an overwhelming majority. In 1970, her opponent was Prof. W.S. Karunaratne, Professor of Buddhism and a Sinhalese who was an eloquent speaker. The crowds, in large number also came to see and hear Siva who was able to reach out to the people with her brand of oratorical skills. Elegantly attired in her signature dress, made of homespun Sri Lankan handlooms and batik sarees, people came from near and far to see and hear Siva mesmerizing her listeners. She won the seat and almost immediately got down to nursing her electorate with a determination to alleviate poverty.
She was appointed Deputy Minister of Health and later Minister of Health. She introduced the National Family Health Programme which was adopted by the United Nations as an international model and for this effort she was given a special award of appreciation by Senator
Edward Kennedy.

In 2009, she was appointed to the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation by
President Rajapaksa.

Tillerson meets Turkeys Erdogan for open talks AFTER WEEKS OF STRAIN
	

REUTERS, 16th FEBRUARY, 2018- Top U.S. diplomat Rex Tillerson and Turkeys Tayyip Erdogan had a productive and open talk on Thursday about improving ties strained recently over their policies on Syria, in a meeting following weeks of escalating anti-American rhetoric from Ankara.
Tillerson arrived in Turkey on Thursday for two days of what officials have said would likely be uncomfortable discussions between the allies, whose relations have frayed over a number of issues, particularly U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, seen as terrorists by Turkey.
Turkey launched an air and ground assault last month in Syrias northwest Afrin region to drive the YPG from the area south of its border. Ankara considers the YPG to be an arm of the PKK, a banned group that has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

UNP must undergo drastic changes soon: Sujeewa
	
While rejecting reports that he would quit the UNP, State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe yesterday said he would resign from the post of party electoral organiser if party did not undergo drastic and immediate changes.
He said UNP MPs including Ministers Ajith P. Perera, Harsha De Silva, Ruwan Wijewardene, Ranjith Maddumabandara, UNP General Secretary Minister Kabir Hashim and himself held similar views on this matter.
Meanwhile, he said they were invited by President Maithripala Sirisena to a meeting.
We, the UNP MPs, are still in the process of discussing the changes among ourselves, but the MPs couldnt meet prior to the meeting with the President. Therefore, I personally visited the President and informed him that we were unable to attend the meeting. I only went to convey the message about which I also briefed General Secretary Hashim later on. There is no truth in the reports that I have decided to join other parties, he told Daily Mirror.
The state minister said after a meeting with the UNP MPs, they had informed party Leader and Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe about the need for changes in the party.
On many previous occasions we have been promised changes, which have never been made. The Prime Minister agreed to this and assured that effective changes will be made. We do not need the appointment of committees or leadership committees. What we need are drastic changes which will have a positive impact on the party immediately. The next leadership of the party must be decided soon , he said.
Meanwhile, the State minister said he would resign from the post of party electoral organiser in the event these changes were not carried out.
I wont leave the party to join another but if the necessary changes are not made in the future, I may resign from my post. I will serve the people for the next three years because I have been given the second place in Colombo at the previous general election, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

We need urgent political reforms: JHU
	
While highlighting the need to introduce political reforms, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secreatry and Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday the government should be humble enough to accept the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as the main opposition in Parliament.
He said in a statement that it was clear from the votes obtained by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the United National Front (UNF) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), a majority of the people were against the current system of governance.
The government did not adopt a proper method of administration. The government should respond to the people while carrying out its policies. The Opposition has been able to create insecurity among people of all the communities, said.
The minister said the State action had led to anarchy by acting in a lenient manner foregoing stability for the sake of Good Governance and added that this situation was worsening in the wake of the Local Government elections.
It is time to introduce major political reforms which are meaningful to the people without restricting them to fertilizer subsidiary, Samurdhi payments, constructing bridges or culverts and changing ministerial portfolios," he said.
The minister said even though some claim that the SLPP was a new party, it was the same old SLFP and added that the result showed that they had obtained the same number of votes obtained by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2015 presidential election and the general election.
He said the only new political force was the alliance contesting the election under the betel leaf and the hand symbol under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The minister said the Rajapaksa faction was conspiring to fish in troubled waters by attempting to cause a power struggle between Mr. Sirisena's backers and the UNP but the Presidents faction and the Prime Minister were wise enough not to fall prey to such conspiracies.
Now what we need is a national unity with the UNP and Mr. Sirisenas new force by understanding the peoples reaction. The JHU will not shatter the hopes of the people who voted for us, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
