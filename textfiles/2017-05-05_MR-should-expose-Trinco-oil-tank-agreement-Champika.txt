Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should immediately expose the agreed facts on the Trincomalee China Bay Oil Tank Farm by sending the then Treasury Secretary P. B. Jayasundara to India on 2013, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.

He said the present government has not discussed any new facts other than the 2002 agreed operation of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to move in to a joint venture with the CPSTL the distribution company of the Indian Oil Company (IOC).

Issuing a press release, Minister Ranawaka claimed though the former President Rajapaksa steering the Joint Opposition to save the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm, it was him who had sent the former Treasury Secretary P. B. Jayasundara to India in May 2013 and made special agreements with the Indian government.

“Special decisions have been made by the then Treasury Secretary without a Cabinet approval or Linear Ministry approval. However, on May 25, 2013 ‘The Hindu’ newspaper and their website revealed Mr. Jayasundara had proposed to establish a company jointly with IOC and CPC,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
