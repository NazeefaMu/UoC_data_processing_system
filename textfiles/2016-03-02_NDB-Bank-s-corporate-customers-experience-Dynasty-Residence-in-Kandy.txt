NDB Bank joined hands with GVR Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd to promote Dynasty Residence, the luxury apartment project in Kandy, among its premier customers in the Central Province.


GVR Lanka and NDB Bank recently hosted an exclusive event for key NDB customers at the Earls Regent, Kandy, which saw the participation of many distinguished personalities. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, senior staff members along with regional and branch managers of NDB Bank were present to grace this occasion.


During the event, NDB Bank announced special housing loan financing packages with very attractive terms formulated to offer its premier customers the opportunity to invest in Dynasty Residence. 
Dynasty Residence is an exclusive development on the banks of the Mahaweli River in the hill capital, offering panoramic views and situated just minutes away from the proposed Colombo-Kandy highway. The 19-floor superstructure is now complete and the NDB customers had the opportunity of viewing the majestic show apartment during the event. 




The eminent project team and developers of the project have ensured that the project meets the highest environmental standards and is poised to obtain the US Green Building LEEDS rating ‘Gold’Certification. The unique design is taken into consideration framing the views of Hantana, Hunnasgiriya knuckles range and the Mahaweli River. 


It also takes the intelligent use of space into account in order to offer a Sri Lankan and Kandyan living experience. The level of attention to detail has been extraordinary and the building is therefore a natural fit for those with eclectic tastes and stringent expectations of the highest quality. This is also the first luxury apartment project to construct a cross ventilation of continuous clean inflow of unobstructed fresh air that permeates through the internal spaces at all times. 


While the standard apartments in Colombo provide very congested rooms and amenities, this unique apartment complex has been designed with varied options so customers could select apartments, which better suits their needs. 


It comprises of 17 different model options such as eight types of three bedroom designs, four penthouses exclusively designed with a personal ‘Sky Garden’, golf putting course and a tailor-made entertainment facility along with five unique Sky Villas designed with double the height for living, dining and balcony facilities along with a view of the river and the magnificent knuckles range that can be enjoyed at all parts of the interior.


With about 42 percent of the space being built for common amenities which inhabit the first five levels, the apartment complex promotes sustainable luxury community living with ample community spaces to interact with other occupants. It has many amenities including a doctor’s examination room, larger parking spaces and ramps along with a 170 meter-long roof top jogging track with viewing decks.

 NDB’s premium customers, who were welcomed by GVR Lanka Founder and Chairman Mahasen Samaravijaya, were enthralled by the multiple exciting aspects offered by the apartment complex, including its view, elegant design and luxurious features. He stated that one of his intensions was to have something luxurious, spacious and affordable to offer expatriates, who have been used to such living standards and attract Sri Lankans who have left the country back to the place they once called home. 


Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, who graced the event, described Dynasty Residence as a much-needed development for Kandy and was pleased with the quality and class that Dynasty Residence brings to the real estate sector of the city. Retired Senior Deputy Inspector General Nimal Mediwake upon viewing the furnished three-bedroom model apartment and taking a full tour at the site likened Dynasty Residence to ‘living in a paradise’ and was excited to behold such an elegant construction right beside the Mahaweli River. 


The bouquets included Honorary Consul for France in Kandy and Sinhaputhra Finance PLC Managing Director Ravana Wijeyeratne expressing his belief that the project promised to deliver a product on par or above most apartments in Colombo. He lauded GVR Lanka for taking on an ambitious project which offers those who wish to make Kandy their home, a living space that reflects Kandy’s future promise. He stressed it was only a matter of time before the modern infrastructure of the proposed highway and faster trains, will make Kandy the headquarters of choice for many companies that wish to have a practical outreach to all provinces.


He drew the attention of the crowd to what really dictates cost, which is the quality of the building material and the quality of the architects, engineers and contractors and not the land value, which is thinly distributed. He emphasized that the value of the cost today can only be cheaper than tomorrow. NDB Bank Chief Executive Officer Rajendra Theagarajah speaking at the event said, “NDB is truly delighted to be part of this project in Kandy. We have always strived to give the word ‘development’ a new meaning and our aim is to provide total banking solutions that strengthen one’s capacity to do better, which in turn makes your community do better; if this aggregation is fulfilled, the whole country will subsequently prosper. Dynasty Residence fits well into our definition of development, as it encompasses a vision to offer superior living accommodation in Kandy. It has therefore proven to be worthy of our support and association.”
