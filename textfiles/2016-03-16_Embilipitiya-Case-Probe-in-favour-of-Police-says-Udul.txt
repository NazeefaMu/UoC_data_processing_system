The prosecution had conducted investigations and the inquiry in a manner favourable to the Police in the Embilipitiya death case, said Attorney-at-law Udul Premaratne today.

“As the aggrieved party, we wish to draw the Court's attention to the fact that, since the case concerning the death of Sumith Prasanna Jayawardena (who died during an altercation with the police at a party in Embilipitiya) was against the police, the prosecution had conducted the investigation and the inquiry in a manner that favoured the police,” he said.

“By doing that the police were trying to release the police suspects,” he said.

“The Judicial Medical Officer’s report confirmed that injuries and severe internal bleeding combined with shock caused of death -- following a clash with a police team.

“Two months have gone by and only one suspect has been arrested so far. The police officers, who were involved in the case, are still on active service and threatening the witnesses.

“We will hand over a report to the Embilipitiya Magistrate’s Court, through the Attorney General’s Department, on the way the investigation had been conducted and the wrongdoings of the police,” he said.

Sumith Prasanna's body was exhumed on Tuesday (15) morning for a second autopsy before Embilipitiya Additional Magistrate Prasanna Fernando. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
