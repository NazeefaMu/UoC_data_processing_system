A trio on the fence!


	



 

Three persons from the 23 member-Blue party group have gone into a sulk and they are in a mute mode within the group these days because of their feeling of disgust, they say.

 

One of this trio is said to be from Rajarata, another one from Gampaha and the third one from a part in Uva known to be a habitat of elephants. 


The Rajarata worthy is an individual who once held a high office in the Blue party.  The Gampaha one is a politico looked on as a close associate of the former Madam.  The Uva one is a onetime Green now turned Blue. 


The trio may soon either do a somersault or quit politics, they say.
