Costly gift raises eyebrows


	

Preparations are underway to present a Rs.1 million worth gold jewellery item as a memento to a female head of a state establishment due to go on retirement early next month, they say.

 


A buddy of the fair high-up has taken the initiative to raise money for the proposed gift through subscriptions from employees and donations from private companies having business ties with the establishment.


Although the female head is going to receive a costly gift, her service at this establishment counts less than one year. However, her predecessor who served a long period at the establishment was presented with a bronze figure of an elephant worth only Rs.15,000 on his retirement, they say.
