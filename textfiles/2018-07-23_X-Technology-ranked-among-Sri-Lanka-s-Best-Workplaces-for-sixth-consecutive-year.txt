As organisations evolve dramatically to create and accommodate the ‘millennial workplace’, it has been established that a great corporate culture is the cornerstone to succeeding in this endeavour. Understanding this early on, software product engineering company 99X Technology has strived to put as much effort into creating an open work culture as they have into technology development and innovation. 

Once again, this saw 99X Technology being ranked among Sri Lanka’s 25 best workplaces for the sixth consecutive year by the Great Place To Work® Institute Sri Lanka. Additionally, it received honours at a regional level when it was listed among Asia’s Best Workplaces for 2018, the only Sri Lankan company among the 25 enterprises in the Small and Medium Enterprises category. 

The company, along with 24 others, were felicitated earlier this month at an awards ceremony hosted at the Hilton, Colombo. Here, 99X Technology received further commendations, as it swept up the Excellence Award in Inspiring Employees and the Gold Award in the Small Enterprise Category.
“It’s one thing to say you want a great culture and quite another to be able to shape your people’s beliefs around the vision the company has. Our culture is driven and enhanced by our people themselves thanks to the empowerment that they receive, and this is something that is recognized time and time again by the Great Place To Work Institute. As in previous years, it is truly an honour to be ranked among these companies who are leading the way in creating great workplaces,” stated 99X Technology Co-Founder and CEO Mano Sekaram.

Over 115 companies in Sri Lanka from over 20 key sectors participated in this year’s survey, representing nearly 62,000 employees in the country. Data accumulated over the six years of conducting the Great Place To Work® study in Sri Lanka displays an overall improvement within the top 25, with all dimensions scoring in the 80th percentile in 2018. These dimensions consist of credibility, respect, fairness, pride and camaraderie. When considering overall dimension scoring, the 25 best workplaces have maintained a positive trend in each dimension with an overall lead of 17 points over the rest of the workplaces in the country.
