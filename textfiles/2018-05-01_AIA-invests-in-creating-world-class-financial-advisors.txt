AIA Insurance inducted the AIA Premier Agency Circle (PAC), inaugurated by Regional Chief Executive Bill Lisle, CEO Pankaj Banerjee and Deputy CEO/Chief Agency Officer Upul Wijesinghe. Located in a plush office premise in the centre of Colombo’s business hub, the PAC office will be home to AIA’s new high performing sales personnel. 

AIA’s PAC office was opened with the objective of developing a fulltime Agency sales force with a focus on achieving Million Dollar Roundtable Table (MDRT) membership. This is intended at motivating higher performance with improved category achievement as well as the development of a professional full-time Agency force to cater Sri Lanka’s mass affluent clientele.  

AIA’s Chief Agency Officer/Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe noted that “newly recruited sales personnel will be trained at a fully digitized, wireless and paperless distribution office which is a dedicated training centre for PAC agents. AIA’s PAC is a pioneer and as of now the only of its kind, ‘full time Agency’ concept in Sri Lanka.” 



Head Premier Agency Circle for AIA Sri Lanka, Shermal Fernando added, “MDRT is internationally recognised as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. Its members are required to generate a higher level of production and demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and outstanding client service. Notably, AIA Sri Lanka had the highest number of MDRT members from Sri Lanka for two consecutive years.  But we want to do more to ensure the best quality of sales personnel to serve our customers better. This is our endeavour to create a newer, better calibre of Agency, as we accelerate our efforts be more customer centric.”
