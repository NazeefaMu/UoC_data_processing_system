Legal action will be taken against people, including Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, who spread false rumours regarding the sudden death of Lahiru Janith at MP Wimal Weerawansa's residence, Attorney Premanath Dolawatta said today on behalf of Ms. Weerawansa.

He told a news briefing that according to the postmortem examination report the cause of death was stated as 'dilated cardiomyopathy'.

“But some so-called parliamentarians and other individuals are causing embarrassment to Shashi Weerawansa and her daughter. We will be filing legal action against them soon,” he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
