An unwavering Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday that he had not done anything wrong and therefore, he would not apologise to the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary.

The Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare expressed these views in response to the protest carried out by the Gampaha District Administrative Services Association (GDASA) yesterday against him for allegedly using strong words in public against the Divisional Secretary.

The protestors demanded the deputy minister to withdraw the alleged statement and to apologise to the official.

When contacted, the deputy minister alleged the divisional secretary of being corrupt and aiding illegal sand miners for money.

“This officer has been functioning in her post for seven years though a state employee should not exceed four years in their posts. There are many allegations against her. I intend to complain to the Bribery Commission against such employees,” he told the Daily Mirror.

The deputy minister said illegal sand mining was continuing for a long time in Akaragama causing hindrance to the residents.

“They are innocent people who needed immediate measures to prevent illegal sand mining. Though many complaints have been made, the secretary had not taken any action. This is why I had to confront her,” he said.

Meanwhile, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara had volunteered to apologise to the employee to which Deputy Minister Ramanayake had opposed.

“I told the minister there is no need to apologise since I haven’t done anything wrong. I will not back down until the Akaragama issue is solved,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
