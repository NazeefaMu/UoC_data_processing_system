Chief Minister Uva Province Chamara Dasanayake told the media yesterday afternoon at his office that it was absolutely a false allegation that he threatened and forced a principal of a Tamil girls’ school in Badulla to kneel down before him.

He said that he received complaints that the principal concerned being a Hindu had discriminated the students of other faiths and that he called her to his official residence to inquire into the complaint in the presence of the Secretary to the Provincial Ministry of Education, Director of Education and the parents who made the complaint.

“I only requested the principal to be cautious of acts that could disturb communal harmony and after a friendly discussion we could settle the dispute amicably. After the meeting the principal and the parent saluted me in the oriental fashion and left. However, the JVP Provincial Councillor Samantha Vidyarathana has resorted to a false propaganda from the political platform to tarnish my image. I will take legal action against him,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Principal R. Bhavani who refused the allegation levelled against the Chief Minister, confirmed his version of the story.

She said that she met the Chief Minister at his residence to inquire into a complaint made by two parents and that the issue was resolved in a friendly atmosphere. She further said politicians were attempting to gain cheap political mileage through false propaganda. (Prasad Rukmal and Prasanna Pathmasiri)
