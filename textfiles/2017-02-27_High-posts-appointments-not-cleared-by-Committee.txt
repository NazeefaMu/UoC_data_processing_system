High posts appointments not cleared by Committee


	

Appointments made to 25 Government institutions as Chairmen had not yet been cleared by the High Post Committee of Parliament, officials said yesterday.

The UPFA Executive Committee discussed the matter at its meeting last Friday.

Former MP Somaweera Chandrasiri, who attended the meeting representing Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) took it up with the President.

President Maitripala Sirisena instructed Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera to look into the complaint and report to him.

Mr. Chandrasiri said most Chairmen and Director Boards of State bodies were acting regardless of instructions by the Auditor General in his reports.

He said it had become a reason for the accumulation of losses.

“I, on behalf of the MEP, urged the President to look into it. Most appointments have not been cleared by the High Post Committee of Parliament. The Government, in its 100-Day Programme, promised to evaluate such appointments under a special committee,” Mr. Chandrasiri told the Daily Mirror.

He said the President instructed Mr. Amaraweera as the UPFA Secretary to look into it.

He also said he voiced against the proposed privatisation of State institutions. (Kelum Bandara)
