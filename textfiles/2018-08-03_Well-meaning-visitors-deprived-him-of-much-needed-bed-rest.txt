There is a general opinion that most private aides of high political authorities are imperious or ferocious than their masters.

 


  However, it is said that there is a private secretary of a certain high political authority who tirelessly works to help hundreds of constituents of his master calling at his political office in his home tuff. 


Suddenly taken ill while at work in the political office, the private secretary had been admitted to hospital where the doctors had recommended him a complete bed rest. 


On hearing that the good-hearted private secretary had been hospitalized, the people 
from the politico’s constituency had begun visiting him in a stream to convey their well wishes. 


The well- meaning visitors had become a such nuisance to the patient, the doctors had later discharged him advising him to take a bed rest at home, they say.
