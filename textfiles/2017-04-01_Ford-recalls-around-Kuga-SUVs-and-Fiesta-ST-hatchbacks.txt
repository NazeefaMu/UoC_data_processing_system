Ford recalls around 5,000 Kuga SUVs and Fiesta ST hatchbacks


	



 

Almost 5,000 Ford cars are being recalled after seven vehicles erupted into flames across Australia.   
Owners of a 4450 Ford Kuga SUV or a 400 Fiesta ST hatchback are being urged to hand their vehicles over to a dealership to be repaired after issues with their shared turbo engine.   


There have been reports of fires in seven Ford Kuga vehicles since December 2015, according to Perth Now. The cars have ignited after ‘localised overheating of the engine cylinder head, due to a lack of coolant circulation’, according to a statement from Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited.   
The overheating causes the cylinder head to crack, causing an oil leak.   
Ford is asking owners of the Kuga to bring their cars to their nearest dealership between April and June for initial recall work.   


The work will be completed during a necessary second visit between October and December. A time period for repairs to the Fiesta hatchback has yet to be set.   


‘Parts are not immediately available to carry out repairs on affected vehicles. Ford is working with suppliers to obtain parts as soon as possible. Ford will write to owners of all affected vehicles as soon as parts are available,’ Ford said in the statement.   


Owners can still drive the vehicles in the meantime but need to maintain the proper engine coolant and be aware of any smoke or overheating.
