New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), Dec 9 2017 -  Amid all the speculation about actor Anushka Sharma and cricketer Virat Kohli’s upcoming wedding in Milan, Italy, the buzz is that the destination wedding will actually be a rather small affair.  


It has already been reported that only family members of the couple, with some really close friends of Virat like his childhood coach, Rajkumar Sharma, will be part of the function.  


However, according to a report in Times Now, there is a celebrity guest list, although a very slim one. Among Anushka’s friends from the industry, only her first co-star Shah Rukh Khan, her PK co-star Aamir Khan, YRF’s Aditya Chopra and director of Anushka’s first film Maneesh Sharma have been invited.   


From Virat’s end, only his biggest pals — Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh and coach Rajkumar Sharma — have been included. Not many people have been invited, as it is a really small function.
