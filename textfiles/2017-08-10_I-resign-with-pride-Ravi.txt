I resign with pride: Ravi


	

The decision to resign from his position of Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka was made with pride and not with sadness or under pressure, Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament a short while ago.

Making a special statement, Karnanayake explained that he had no need to purchase properties illegally and said the various allegations leveled against him were baseless.

“Everyone knows of my wealth. People from my party and others have visited me in my house. They knew that I do not use my wealth for politics,” he said.

Drawing parallels to the former government, the parliamentarian said the Attorney General was allowed to investigate ministers now, unlike before. “We want the authorities to continue their investigations,” he said.  

“I have sacrificed my position for democracy and good governance. I am proud of the decision that I have made,” Karunanayake concluded.
