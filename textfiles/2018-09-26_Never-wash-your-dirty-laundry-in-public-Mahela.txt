Commenting on recent series of developments in Sri Lankan cricket, former captain Mahela Jayawardane said that the emotional decisions are not always correct.

“What happened in the last few days @OfficialSLC and to respond is tough. One thing is you should never wash ur dirty laundry in public. Emotional decisions are not all ways correct. Best is to think what is best for SL cricket and make none emotional decisions,” the former star batsman tweeted.
