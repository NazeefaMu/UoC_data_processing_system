Flydubai, the only international airline operated at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), has ceased its operations at the airport citing ‘uneconomical’ outcomes.

CAA Chairman Ananda Wimalasena told Daily Mirror that the airline had made the request two weeks ago.

“They said their operations at MRIA are uneconomical and also complained about one or two bird strikes,” he said.
