Several complaints have been received from liquor producers about the financial difficulties they may have to face due to the increase of the licence fee .
After considering their plea the government is to take the decision to withdraw the increase, sources said.
Meanwhile economists have warned the government about the possibility of a collapse in many liquor production companies if the fee up to Rs.150 million was implemented.
At present there are 24 liquor producing companies in the country. (Ajanthakumara Agalakada, Mahinda Nissanka)
