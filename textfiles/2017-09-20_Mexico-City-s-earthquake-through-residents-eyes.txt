Mexico City's earthquake, through residents' eyes


	



At least 139 people have been confirmed dead after 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico, causing gas line explosions, toppling buildings and forcing thousands to be evacuated into the street. The tremor hit just hours after emergency drills around the nation on the anniversary of another devastating quake that killed thousands in Mexico City in 1985. Today's quake hit near the Puebla state town of Raboso, about 76 miles southeast of Mexico City, at a depth of 32 miles, the US Geological Survey said. Horrifying images coming out of the country's capital show rubble strewn across roads and enormous chunks of collapsed buildings, while volunteers search through rubble for survivors. It comes just days after another powerful quake - measuring 8.1 - hit Mexico, killing at least 98 people. (Daily Mail)
