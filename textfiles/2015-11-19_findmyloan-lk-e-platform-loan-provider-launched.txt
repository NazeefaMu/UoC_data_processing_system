Meeting the ever growing demand for small to large loans, Findmyloan (Pvt.) Ltd, the first-of-its-kind in Sri Lanka, recently launched an online marketplace through affiliate marketing that is unique as both customer centric and web based for maximum efficiency and rapid response. 
Via affiliate marketing, this technological masterpiece carefully selects from their database, based on a registered customer’s requirements, several options of financial service providers to select the most feasible financier. Acting as a bridge-way between the two parties and eliminating the requirement to be physically present at a corporate office, this platform provides maximum efficiency, speed, accuracy and rapid response to a loan, lease or hire purchase facility.
Findmyloan (Pvt.) Ltd COO Thilan Kulathilake expressed the true motive behind this venture. “Findmyloan.lk is in the business of making dreams come true. We truly understand the needs of finance seekers whether it be for a personal loan, a home loan or even a business loan. Moreover, we care for our customers; this is why we have introduced this innovative professional advisory company for them.”
“This change is about innovation and is a unique opportunity to capture the ever growing post-millennium tech-savvy Y-Gen, who aspires for more, personally, academically and career wise,” concluded Kulathilake. 
Findmyloan.lk working with leading banks and finance institutions aims to provide its growing database of customers with a timely, cost-effective and localised professional financial solution using state-of-the-art technology to fuel and sustain aspirations in a challenging and dynamic world, fraught with opportunities.
Whether it be to expand the business, to build a dream home, to make educational goals a reality, to buy that car or even for those ‘little’ personal matters, Findmyloan.lk is entirely focused on making dreams come true.
Through selecting the right service partner, credibility and efficiency increases among web users that are referred to strong affiliate financiers who are better equipped to convert requests into loans and advances. 
This online marketplace platform has since entering the market, established itself amongst its registered customers and financial institutions as the most trusted, caring and innovative financial marketplace platform in Sri Lanka and endeavours to make its mark globally.
