He told the weekly cabinet briefing that the President had told the GMOA that no statement would be issued following the meeting.

“The President did not meet the GMOA officially. He had agreed to meet them unofficially and told them, ‘This is a hora meeting Ok.' President Sirisena has also told them there will be no statements issued or photos taken. President met the GMOA on its insistance. The GMOA did not meet Mr. Abeykone or the additional secretary at the presidential secretariat,” he said.
