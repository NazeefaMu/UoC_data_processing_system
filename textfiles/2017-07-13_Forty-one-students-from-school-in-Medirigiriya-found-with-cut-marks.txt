A group of 41 students from Grade 10 and 11 including seven girls of a school in the Medirigiriya Educational Zone were found to have caused grievous injury to themselves after supposedly consuming drugs last morning, Medirigiriya Police said.

The Vice Principal of the school, having noticed a change in the behaviour of the students, had summoned them and found cuts on their hands and did not hesitate to call in the police.

The female students were handed over to their parents by the police who issued stern warnings to all of them.

While the students were being taken to the police station a student had attempted to get rid of a bottle, but the police who were alert managed to confiscate it. The police were still trying to ascertain from where or whom the students had got the drugs from.

Polonnaruwa SSP Laksiri Wijerathna, Hingurakgoda ASP Tissa Lal de Silva, Medirigiriya OIC IP N. G. S. Jayalath were heading the investigation. (Chapa Madhubashini)
