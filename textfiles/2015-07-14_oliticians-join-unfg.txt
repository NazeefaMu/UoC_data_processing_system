	The newly formed United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) is made up of several politicians who were displaced in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena deciding to nominate Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
	JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said those who opposed the United National Party (UNP) led government had withdrawn their objections before signing the Memorandum of Understanding for political benefits.
	He said some of them had put aside their party identities and their party symbol and the leadership because they would not have otherwise been in a position to contest the general election on their own steam.
	“They are not politically stable because people are aware how they ruined the country during the much hyped 100-day programme. Apart from strengthening the their political standing, nothing worthwhile had taken place in the country during past six months. At the end of the day people have been made to realise that the JVP is the only party which can rule a country where the rights and needs of ordinary people will be prioritized,” Mr. Silva said.
	He said the SLFP and UNP nomination lists did not reflect PAFFREL’s March 12 guidelines and the criteria agreed to by all political parties when selecting candidates.
	“The JVP will not hesitate to refuse nominations to anyone if he or she if facing credible allegations of wrongdoing. We have done so in the past as well. The SLFP has nominated politicians who were even imprisoned on charges of various criminal activities. They have done nothing to clean up their act. The national lists of both parties consist of politicians who are unable to contest because they have been rejected by the people,” Mr. Silva said.
	He said the JVP launched its election campaign yesterday from Maharagama under the theme “Conscience of the Nation” and that 100 public rallies and one thousand provincial meetings will be carried out countrywide. (Piyumi Fonseka)
