[Sri Lanka U-19 against Pakistan U-19]
Richmond’s Charith accumulates most runs in Pakistan U19 tour
Charith Asalanka of Richmond College, Galle who captained Sri Lanka U19 in a remarkable way leading his side to be unbeaten in the two series against visiting Pakistan U19 topped the tour batting list with an amazing average of 101 whilst becoming the highest wicket-taker on average in the One-day series with 6 wickets.
Charith scored 334 runs in the two youth Tests at an average of 167 with a double-century to his credit to be the highest run-accumulator in the series with two centuries. Anandian Shammu Ashan’s excellence with the bat in both Test and one-day series scoring 343 runs at an average of over 68 including a century in the one-day series played a major role in Sri Lankans achieving a clean-sweep in the One-day series.
Among the other Sri Lankans who did well against Pakistan were Avishka Fernando of St.Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa (123 runs in Tests), Kavin Bandara of DS Senanayaka (107 runs in one-dayers), Right-arm seamer, Geethal Malinga of St.Benedict (4 wickets in Tests), left-arm spinner Thilan Nimesh of Prince of Wales (4 wickets in Tests), left-arm seamer, Jehan Daniel of St.Josephs (5 wickets in one-dayers) and right-arm seamer Udith Madushan of Debarawewa NS (3 wickets in one-dayers) to occupy the first five batting or bowling positions either in Test or one-day series. Pakistan U19 could not make a much of an impression with the bat to win a single match in the two series, but their bowlers spearheaded by Shadab Khan who finished with a tally of 10 wickets along with team mates Hayatullah and Saif Ali claiming 5 wickets apiece in the Youth Test series did well with the ball to occupy first three spots in the bowling list though their approach in no way helped Pakistan’s cause.

Under 13 Round Up
Rain mars most matches in U13 D1 Tournament
In a roundup of U13 D1 matches played over the week-end, most matches were badly hampered by rain without producing any positive results.
The only match that produced a positive result was between Basilica Ragama and Christ King Ja Ela in which Basilica recorded a 9-wicket win after Thushara Madushan claimed a match-bag of 12 wickets conceding just 31 runs for the winners. Among the matches that produced results on the first innings, Devapathiraja, Rathgama, after Pawan Sandesh’s superb 120 beat Sri Devananda, Ambalangoda to claim first innings points. Devapathiraja bowler, right-arm seamer, Anushka Shehan claiming 7 wickets for just 14 runs reduced Devananda to 55 all out in their first innings and in reply Devapathiraja went on to score a huge 247. Carey College, Colombo recorded a first innings win over St Anthony's College Wattala after they made 201 in their first innings with Viranga Yeshan and Abdul Shakoor making fifties and dismissed St.Anthonys, Wattala for a paltry 92. Carey bowler, Sandil Mendis’ amazing figures of four wickets for no runs was the highlight of this match. The two matches, Nalanda – St Johns, Panadura and St. Josephs – Ananda ended in no result. Venuka Nanayakkara of Nalanda scored an unbeaten 103 against St.Johns

[School News]
St.Joseph’s, Isipathana and Thurstan in a run-fest
All three schools complete three-innings victories after bowlers flattened the oppositions
Malshan Rodrigo scoring an unbeaten half century and following up with a dramatic match-haul of seven wickets surged St.Josephs to an innings and 57-run victory over Maris Stella in their U19 D1 encounter concluded at St.Josephs ground this afternoon. Jehan Daniel, another emerging all-rounder in the schools circle today also contributed for Joes victory with a good all-round effort. St.Josephs batting first scored an imposing 282 for nine before they declared their innings after 61 overs and Malshan, Kavindu and Jehan bowled out Maris Stella twice for 107 and 118 without allowing them to make St.Josephs bat again.
Thushal Madusanka’s 12 wickets played a major role in Thurstan’s innings and 13-run victory over Mahanama at Kadirana ground. Thurstan bowlers well defending their first innings score of 188 that was hardly enough to earn a three-innings win specially against a team like Mahanama somehow managed to restrict Mahanama’s both innings to a total of 175 and finish the match without going into the fourth innings saving an innings and 13 runs to their credit.
The production of three centurions in a single innings was the highlighting factor of the match between Isipathana and Holy Cross when Pramod Maduwantha (118),Sanjula Abeywickrama (105*) and Ayana Siriwardana (100*) scored centuries for Isipathana to make a hell-raising 385 for five in their first innings. It was not only in batting Pramod Maduwantha excelled in this match but also in bowling. Pramod’s 11 wickets in the match was the cornerstone of Isipathana’s success with the ball as Holy Cross managed only 170 in their first innings and after following only 73 to loss the match by an innings and 142 runs.
Isipathana beat Holy Cross by an innings and 142 runs
Isipathana College: 385-5 d in 72.1 overs (Pramod Maduwantha 118, Sanjula Abeywickrama 105*, Ayana Siriwardana 100*, Malinda Jayod 3/97)
Holy Cross College: 170 on 51.5 overs (Umayanga Suwaris 42, Kalana Harendra 39, Pramod Maduwantha 5/30, Heshan Fernando 3/17) & F/O 73 on 28.3 overs (Chaminda Ravinath 20, Pasindu Perera 20, Pramod Maduwantha 6/13, Lahiru Dilshan 3/30)

Thomians down Joseph Vaz after bowlers excellence
U19 D1 first-round match roundup
St. Joseph Vaz College VS S. Thomas College, Mt.Lavinia
S. Thomas College, Mt.Lavinia who are yet to play a tournament-match this season beat St.Joseph Vaz by 9 wickets in yet another traditional game concluded today at their home ground after their bowlers approached differently in the two innings of the opposition to earn them this big-win. When Joseph Vaz batted first on invitation, Thomian bowlers, Rasmika Opatha, Shenal De Silva and Kanishka Perera captured six wickets at two apiece conceding just 14 runs restricted them to a score of 50 in the first innings before S. Thomas' in reply declared their innings after they had scored 128 for six with Yohan Mendis top scoring with a patient 40 and Thulanjana Fernando completing a six-for for Joseph Vaz. After Joseph Vaz batted for the second time around needing a minimum of 78 to make Thomians bat again somehow managed to do so, but the overall-lead of mere four runs they gained was not at all sufficient to avert their defeat. Thomians star-bowler Sachitha Jayathilake was the destroyer of Joseph’s second innings as he single-handedly completed a six-wicket haul which Thomians needed the help of three bowlers to do in the first innings.
St. Joseph Vaz College: 50 in 33.4 overs (Rasmika Opatha 2/03, Shenal De Silva 2/04, Kanishka Perera 2/07) & 82 in 51 overs (Sachitha Jayathilake 6/17)
S. Thomas' College, Mt.Lavinia: 128-6 in 38 overs (Yohan Mendis 40, Ravindu Thilakarathne 20, Dulanjana Fernando 6/43) & 5-1 in 3.3 overs

Dharmasoka College VS Nalanda College
In another traditional match ended this afternoon at Nalanda Ground, Dharmasoka, Ambalangoda forced a draw after Nalanda gained first innings advantage faring better than their opposition. The highlight of the match was Kavindu Bandara’s match-haul of 9 wickets for hosts that made the difference in the end. After Ambalangoda school was put in, Dinuka Dilshan making an unbeaten 69 helped them reach 181.
Nalanda gained a first innings lead of 69 after they made 250 for six in reply before declaration with Malinga Amarasinghe and Kasun Sandaruwan making fifties. Dharmasoka’s second innings was less impressive compared to their first innings as they managed only 158 for nine before bad light brought the game to a tame draw in the end.
Dharmasoka College: 181 in 61.2 overs (Dinuka Dilshan 69*, Kavish Kumara 28, Kavindu Bandara 4/52, Nimnaka Rathnayake 2/24) & 158-9 in 39.5 overs (Nimesh Mendis 36, Kasun Maduranga 28, Kavindu Bandara 5/53, Dilan Samaraweera 2/17)
