The former strongman made sensational news the other day when he opened a new bridge in a constituency considered a pocket-borough of the Horagolla clan.

 


The former Madam was livid when she heard that the former strongman had been invited to open the new bridge and she sent for the local politicos who had organized the event and gave them a tongue lashing, they say.


Meanwhile, the former strongman who graced the bridge opening ceremony had rubbed it in by recalling the long standing political ties between Horagolla and Medamulana.


The former Madam pulled up the Blue party organizer of the area too over the incident and warned him not to repeat the ‘mistake’ in future, they say.
