Hatton National Bank (HNB) celebrated the 27th milestone year of its flagship microfinance scheme, ‘Gami Pubuduwa’ (Village Awakening), at the annual Field Officers’ Conference, which included a series of educational and personal development events and concluded on a high note with an awards ceremony to honour its field force for their contribution in the years 2014 and 2015. 
A host of invitees from the senior management of HNB, including MD/CEO Jonathan Alles, were present at the occasion. 
Begun in 1989 with a vision to extend financial services to self-employment projects and other micro enterprises in rural areas, ‘Gami Pubuduwa’ has become one of the most successful microfinance programmes implemented by a commercial bank in Sri Lanka. Over the years, the scheme has evolved to establish a plethora of banking products including micro-lending, micro-savings and micro-insurance in addition to the non-financial services such as financial education and entrepreneur development programmes. 
Commenting on the key contribution that field officers make to the scheme, Alles said, “‘Gami Pubuduwa’ field officers play a central role in implementing the various tools of this scheme by directly engaging with the rural community to obtain insights into the lifestyle and financial and economic requirements of the community. Their efforts to assist small and medium entrepreneurs as well as the bank are commendable.”  
The ‘Gami Pubuduwa’ scheme is renowned for its unique modus operandi, which involves field officers who closely associate with the rural community, identify their strengths and opportunities and make suitable financial proposals to promote successful micro entrepreneurs.
The awards ceremony for the years 2014 and 2015, which honoured field officers who have performed exceptionally well during the respective years took place under the patronage of Alles. 
In commemoration of former HNB Chairman the late J. Chrisantha R. Cooray, a scholarship was offered to the Best Performing Microfinance Officer of the year. Romesh Vandort of HNB Uddappuwa customer centre and Nalin Paranawithana of HNB Homagama customer centre received the awards for the years 2014 and 2015, respectively.
The line up of informative and appealing lectures at the conference, which preceded the award ceremony, included a session on the Central Bank’s vision for the future’ from Central Bank Senior Assistant Director Chathura Ariyadasa, a session on microfinance trends and future developments from Berendina Microfinance Institute Chairman Anura Atapattu and a session with Dr. Neomal Balasuriya on team work and personality development.
