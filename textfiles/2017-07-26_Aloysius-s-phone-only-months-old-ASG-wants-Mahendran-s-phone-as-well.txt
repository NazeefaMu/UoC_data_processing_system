Submitting a special application Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today requested the commission to direct Arjun Mahendran, former Governor of CBSL, to hand over all communication devices he used since January 1, 2015 to date for the investigation.

The ASG made the application under section 6 of the Presidential Commission on Bonds Issue (PCoI) Act based on available material obtained during the investigation which was sufficient to make such a request. The Commission said it will consider the request.

Drawing the attention of the commission to the witness losing his mobile device on a previous occasion, the ASG also said the devices handed over recently by Arjun Aloysius was only six months old.

On a previous occasion, it was revealed that Aloysius had allegedly destroyed the mobile phone he was using at the time in Singapore while interdicted EPF dealer Saman Kumara’s mobile device had broken for no apparent reason. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
