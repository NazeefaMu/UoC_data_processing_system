Some describe the so called ‘joint opposition’ in Diyawanna as the faithful following of the former strongman. 
Several leading lights of the joint opposition were chit-chatting the other day when one of them wondered about their numerical strength in Diyawanna. “Given the fickle nature of our politicians, we should make it a point to check our real strength” another diehard loyalist of the former strongman said. “A head count says we have got 49” a senior member of the group assured in reply.  
“We have to deduct at least three from that head count,” another senior member pointed out. And then he proceeded to confide in his colleagues the reason why they had to count three out.
