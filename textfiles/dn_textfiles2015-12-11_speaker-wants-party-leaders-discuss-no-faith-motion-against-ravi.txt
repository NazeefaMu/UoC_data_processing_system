Speaker wants party leaders to discuss No Faith Motion against Ravi

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya suggested that the date to move the No Faith Motion against Finance
Minister Ravi Karunanayake be discussed at the Party Leaders' Meeting.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday during a dispute between the Opposition and the government.
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the actual passage of the No Faith motion against the Finance Minister should be to defeat the budget proposals.
"The Second Reading of the budget proposal has been passed with a two third majority",Kiriella said. "So there is no point of moving a No Confidence motion".
The Leader of the House said so when Opposition member Bandula Gunawardena raising a Point of Order said that the No Confidence motion against the Finance Minister has been included in the Order Book as an undated motion.
He added that a date should be fixed for this motion.
The Speaker Karu Jayasuriya stated the date should be decided at the Party Leaders' Meeting and then the motion can be moved in the House.
