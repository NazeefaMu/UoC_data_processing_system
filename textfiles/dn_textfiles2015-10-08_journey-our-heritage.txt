A journey to our Heritage

The Heladiwa Heritage Circle is one of the most implemented concepts of Neurologist Dr. Dhaham Ratwatte. It has come forward by several steps by now. Sri Lanka is the main centre to the Heladiwa Heritage Circle. Under the programmes of Heladiwa Heritage Circle, the knowledge of our ancestors who utilized pure Sinhalese inherited systems will be presented to the world community for their comfort.
The main achievement of HHC is to introduce the hereditary values of Sri Lanka. Another target is eradicating every myth which has been established for a long time in society concerning Sri Lankan heritage. Next is to provide good service as a charitable program.
Participating in an interview, with Daily News T’nC, Heladiwa Heritage Circle Information Technology and Media Director Ravishanka Senanayake elaborated on the heritage and international relationships which existed between Sri Lanka with other countries.

“Much has been written on Sri Lanka. It has had many human settlements predating the dawn of human history. About 34,000 years ago evidence of the Balangoda human had appeared as Mesolithic hunters. Their settlements could be seen in some caves in the area. And there is evidence that agriculture has existed in Sri Lanka since 15,000 BC in Sri Lanka”, he said.

“According to the records oats and barley were grown on this land. Human remains have been found at the Varana RajamahaVihara and according to many historical legends and folklores Ravana was a great king who ruled the country about 5,000 years ago. He was a brilliant person who had a good knowledge of technology, specifically flight. He is reputed to have had a machine called Dandumonara that could fly and today there are many folk stories about the Dandumonara. It is said that, some names of villages like Wariyapola, Sitha Eliya and Ravana Ella were created according to reputations of Ravana.”
Dr. Dhaham Ratwatta is trying to retrace this civilization and create a vast intellectual discussion about the pre historic period of Sinhalese. Another one is to present our cultural heritage with our traditional values to the world community. It is our vision.
The program by HHC is not limited to Sri Lanka as it has already stretched out to other countries in the world. United Kingdom is one of the main centers of the programme. Likewise, Canada, Japan, USA, German and Australia have centers to spread Sri Lankan culture to the world.
HHC has now chosen several centers in the country to provide knowledge to the people. Dr. Ratwatte has organized these centers in villages such as Chilaw, Battaramulla, Batticallow and Balangoda –Diyavinna. The village headmen, indigenous medicine doctors and traditional dancers will participate in this project. Sri Lankan food and handicrafts can be sold in these centers. Other than that, eco-tourism would be promoted covering these villages. A very good job market will be developed.
One of the main topics of the HHC is providing services to the people through astrology. Astrology is not a new practice in Sri Lanka. The people of Sri Lanka knew the methods of utilizing secret subjects concerning astrology, oriental medicine, ritual practices, traditional offerings, palm reading, agriculture, Yaga Homa, Pilliyevima and Anjanam. Martial arts such as Angampora and Ilangampora also have to be included to the above list.
Anuhas Astrology is a company which has been registered in the UK devoted to the field of astrology and it wants to save the craft from people who only have commercial interests at mind. For this Neurologist Dr. Ratwatte has come forward.
According to Dr. Ratwatte, Astrology has been limited to its present state due to wrong political predictions. Therefore people in the country think that the subject is a failure. But the Anuhas Astrology is ready to provide its services free of charge from UK. Up to now, thousands of people have been treated in many ways through Anuhas Astrology.

People can contact Dr. Ratwatte and Anuhas through the Facebook where thre are articles and people who are unaware of this subject, could develop their knowledge easily.
The timely change of planets and influences of planets as well as the daily lives of people can be discussed by astrology. But astrologists should be very competent and honest providing a good service.
As another programme, HHC already has started to teach Angampora under the theme of Sri Lanka Traditional Indigenous Martial Arts. They have built up 10 training centers to practice Angampora. The Head Center is in Athurugiriya. Moratuwa–Indibedda, Moratumulla, Bandaragama, Thalawathugoda, Polgahawela-Bandawa, Boralesgamuwa, Opanayake, Malinboda and Diwlapitiya- Maradagahamula are the other centers. The Kandy and Kalutara centers will be opened soon.

Other than that, trainings, competitions and shows would also be organized in many areas in the country by the Angampora STIMA under HHC.
The Heladiva Heritage Circle signed a MOU with the Kothalawala Defense University last July for training cadet officers in three areas. “We are teaching martial arts to the Kothalawala Defense University cadets. Our Angampora martial artists are Guru Premasiri Malimbadaarachchi, Guru Sunimal Fernando, Guru Athula Nandana, Guru P Edirisinghe, Guru Sandun Frenando, Guru Sumudu Fernando, Guru H. Wijesinghe and International Trainer Oliver Herrmann”, Ravishanka said.
During seven days of the week articles will be done on web sites making people aware of the programmes and cultural affair. Monday will be for indigenous Medicine and Ayurveda, Tuesday for Astrology, Wednesday for Traditional Dance, Thursday for Angampora Martial Arts & Folk songs, Friday for traditional Handicrafts, Saturday for Agriculture and Sunday for Cuisine.
There is a great demand from foreign countries to learn our Angampora and astrology, Ravishanka concluded.
