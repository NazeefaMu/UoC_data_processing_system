Amazed by the Words

Yes, it sounds anything but paradoxical. The million-rupee question you naturally raise upon sighting the title of his first book, ‘The Amazing Racist’, is how could a racist be amazing? But Chhimi Tenduf-La is not yet another foreigner looking down on Sri Lanka showering heaps of negative and derogatory remarks on the country’s culture. Tenduf-La, on quite the contrary, has been living in this country despite his Tibetan name and western origin.
Half English, half Tibetan, Chhimi Tenduf-La grew up in Hong Kong, London, Delhi and finally Colombo, where he now lives with his wife, Samantha, and daughter, Tara. The Amazing Racist, his first novel, was released in January 2015 by Hachette India. His second novel, Panther, was released by HarperCollins India early this year.
Litchat deals with the lighter side of this amazing author.
Q: Why do you write?
A: I find I express myself best on paper and it is great fun making up stories that I can control myself. Unlike in life, I can change the ending if I want to. I also write because I can’t sing, dance or draw so it is my only creative outlet.
I would love for it to be a career, because it would mean my writing schedule could fit around my kids, but I am a long way away from that. For now, I write because each time I spend a few hours doing so, I learn, I improve, I move closer to being good enough.

Q: What is your muse?
A: My wife. I have to say that, but really it’s true. I started writing seriously when I got engaged to her, because she made me feel like a better writer than I am. Plus, I got to see life through a different person’s eyes. In a broader sense, the people I have met in Sri Lanka are my muse because they are so full of character – there is so much to write about and they are the people I know best.
Q: What kind of books do you like to read most?
A: At the moment I love foreign language thrillers, translated of course. They are cool, surprising, original and to the point. I am talking about Japanese, French, Swedish, and Icelandic mysteries. I would love to try others. I wish someone would write a series based around a Sri Lankan detective.
Q: What are your favourite books?
A: Off the top of my head, Chinaman, Running in the Family, Catch 22, Of Mice and Men, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, The Things We Carried.
Q: What have you got to tell the worst critic of yours?
A: I’m sorry if reading my books was a waste of your time. I’m trying my best, but I can’t please everyone. Thanks for taking a chance on me, and thanks for reading my book. If I caused any offense, it was not intended. Every story has conflict, and so readers can take either side. I hope my next book ticks more boxes for you.
Q: Looking back, do you wish if you could edit your first book?
A: Absolutely. However, The Amazing Racist was very successful because it was a light-hearted read. If I had changed it, as I probably would want to now, making it more literary, I might have lost a large number of readers. I also wish I had made the female heroine Sri Lankan, rather than English. I don’t think I will ever write a book without wanting to edit it after it is published. Hence, I hate reading any of my books after they are in print; even when I do readings at events, I cringe thinking, how did I write that rubbish?
Q: What is your opinion about literary awards?
A: If I win any, they are brilliant. If I don’t, they are pointless. Honestly, either way they are subjective. If I do win one in my lifetime, I am not going to think I am a great writer; I will realise it is just that a few judges like what I wrote. Such awards do help sales numbers; the more I sell then the better job I will think I have done.
Q: Out of the award-winning books and popular books, which category appeals to you most?
A: If I am entirely honest, and this answer would lose me respect among the literary community (but luckily they don’t know who I am), I prefer mainstream popular books. The kind of books you simply can’t put down. I don’t mean full on trash like 50 Shades, but books with suspense such as Gone Girl and Defending Jacob. I love some award-winning books, but others I just don’t get the point. Maybe I am not intelligent enough, but some just seem pretentious to me. I do re-read the award-winning books that I like, because they teach me how I should be writing. Yet, if I could, I think I’d rather write a killer thriller that everyone reads, rather than an award-winning book that is not accessible to most. I think that is a far greater skill.
Q: Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating?
A: If I am in the middle of a good book, I read anywhere; I read in traffic, eating, while playing hide and seek with my daughter, at cricket matches, in the bath. Anywhere. That is the beauty of books; when you just have to read the next page. On a day-to-day basis, I read on my kindle every night, for a couple of hours, at about two in the morning because I always wake up then. I think everyone should have a book on them at all times; whether it is in physical form, or on your phone, it is a great way to pass time waiting for a bus, at the doctors and so on. The more someone reads, the better they write, be it creatively or for work, and this is a skill everyone needs.
