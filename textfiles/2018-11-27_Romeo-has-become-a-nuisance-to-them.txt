Romeo has become a nuisance to them!


	

A fresher-Diyawanna member has become a nuisance to the young fair staffers attached to the committee offices of the august assembly, they say.

 


This member has made it a habit to visit committee offices to while away time, chatting to the fair ones on duty and the latter have been forced to tolerate his presence out of sheer courtesy.


This worthy is said to be coming to the august assembly even on days the sittings are not held just for the pleasure of the company of the female staffers.


There had been an elderly purohita in the previous council who had been a similar nuisance to these female employees. 


So, they are now referring to their current source of annoyance as ‘Aswer Two’, they say.
