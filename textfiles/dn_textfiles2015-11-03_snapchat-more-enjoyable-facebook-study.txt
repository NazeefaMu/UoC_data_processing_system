Snapchat more enjoyable than Facebook - Study

US: Snapchat interactions are associated with more enjoyment and positive emotions than Facebook and other social media, according to a new study.
Snapchat is a mobile application known as a form of "ephemeral social media," which are platforms displaying shared content for a limited period of time (eg, 10 seconds).
"On the surface, many people view Snapchat as the 'sexting app,'" said Joseph Bayer, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Michigan and the study's lead author.
"But instead, we found that Snapchat is typically being used to communicate spontaneously with close friends in a new and often more enjoyable way," he said.
"At the same time, Snapchat interactions were perceived as having less social support than other social media. These findings open up important questions about the benefits and costs of different social media," he said.
Mr Bayer and colleagues recruited 154 college students who used smartphones. The study used "experience sampling" - which measures how people think, feel and behave moment-to-moment in their daily lives - to assess the participants' well-being by texting them at random times six times a day for two weeks.
Researchers found that Snapchat interactions are associated with more positive emotions than Facebook and other social technologies.Simultaneously, Snapchat interactions are viewed as less "supportive" than other types of interaction, including Twitter, texting, email, calling and face-to-face.
