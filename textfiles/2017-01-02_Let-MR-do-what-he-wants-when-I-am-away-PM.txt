Responding to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's threat to topple the government this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would be visiting Switzerland on January 17 and that the former president could do whatever he wanted when he was away.

“Mr. Rajapaksa can do whatever he wants when I go to Switzerland,” the Prime Minister said in lighter vein when talking to guests at the traditional New Year breakfast at Temple Trees today.
