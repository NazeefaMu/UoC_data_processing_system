The Cabinet is reported to have approved a proposal submitted by Minister Sarath Amunugama to set up a tribunal to inquire into cases of corruption. The proposal is to be referred to the Attorney General for his advise.

The tribunal will be similar to the Criminal Justice Commission set up during the tenure of former Prime Minister Sirimawo Bandaranaike.

A few weeks ago 17 ministers submitted a proposal requesting such a mechanism to hear cases of corruption.(Kelum Bandara)
