MYTH: You should avoid all fats if you’re trying to be healthy or lose weight.  

BUSTED: If you’re trying to be healthier or lose weight, you may think that eliminating all fats from your diet might be the way forward. But think again. It’s a common misconception that all fat is bad.   “In order for a human being to function properly the body requires calories. At least 30% of the calories one consumes should come from fats. There are two kinds of fat; healthy fats and unhealthy fats. Unhealthy fats are saturated fats that increase the risk of high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease. There are two kinds of healthy fats; polyunsaturated unsaturated fats and momounsaturated fats. Both these types of fats, if consumed in moderation can help the risk of heart disease as it helps lower cholesterol levels. It’s important that you include healthy fats in your diet. Healthy fats come from sources like egg yolks, avacados, nuts and salmon. The important thing that you should understand is that moderation is key. Making sure you eat a balanced diet has a major impact on being healthy,” said, Dr. Renuka Jayatissa, Consultant Medical Nutritionist at the Medical Research Institute.
