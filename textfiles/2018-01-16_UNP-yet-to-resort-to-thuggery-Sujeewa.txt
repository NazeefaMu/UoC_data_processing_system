UNP yet to resort to thuggery: Sujeewa


	

State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said a mud-slinging campaign has been launched against him and the United National Party (UNP) using the Central Bank bond scam.

He said the UNP has still not resorted to thuggery but was prepared to do so if the situation so demanded.

He told a public meeting in Kelaniya that some were trying to tarnish the UNP's image and that of his.

The state minister said it was he who sounded the alarm in connection with the bond scam and informed COPE about the loss incurred by the government.

He said some were criticising him saying he had written books about the scam. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
