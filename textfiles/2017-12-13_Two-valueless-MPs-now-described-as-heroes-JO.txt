Two valueless MPs now described as heroes: JO


	

JO MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said yesterday the two MPs who defected from the joint opposition (JO) who had no value were being described as heroes.

He said if anyone wanted to leave the JO based on principles, they should have done so three years ago.

“The cross over of an MP no longer creates a trend. It won’t affect the people’s opinion anymore. It is only a change in the head count and not the voter base. There are several MPs to come and join us too,” he said.

He said they have loosened the roots of the ‘yahapalanaya’ tree and that it was only a matter of time till it collapsed.

Meanwhile, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the two MPs leaving the JO won’t make a big impact and assured their principles won’t change.

He said there was a huge response from applicants seeking nominations to contest the election from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and therefore, it was difficult to give everyone an opportunity.

“However, the reason to leave the JO should not be termed as issues related with nominations,” he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
