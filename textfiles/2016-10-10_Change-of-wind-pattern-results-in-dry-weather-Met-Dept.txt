Change of wind pattern in the Indian Ocean had resulted in the present dry spell, Department of Meteorology said on Monday.

A spokesman from the Department told Daily Mirror that the winds are moving away from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean bringing the drought to Sri Lanka. “The situation may change by the middle of this month,” he said. 
Moisturised laden winds blows inland which brings rains. Light showers were expected at few places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces and in the Galle and Matara Districts, while fair weather was predicted elsewhere, the spokesman said.

Meanwhile the Department of Irrigation said water levels in most of the reservoirs were 25 per cent to 40 per cent of the total capacities. “We will have to manage the supply of water for the cultivation and for the drinking water purposes. There would not be an issue if the showers come down as predicted,” a spokesman from the Irrigation Department said.

As many as 519, 527 families belonging to 138, 585 families in 16 districts were affected with the drought. The affected Districts are Kalutara, Gampaha, Kandy, Matale, Moneragala, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Mullaithivu, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee.(Yohan Perera)
