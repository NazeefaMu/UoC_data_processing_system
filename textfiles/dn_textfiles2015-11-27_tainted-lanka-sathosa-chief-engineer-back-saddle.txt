Tainted Lanka Sathosa Chief Engineer back in the saddle

A top official attached to a leading state commercial establishment, who had been asked to stay out by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate serious Frauds and Corruption due to his Involvement in alleged fraudulent practices has found his way back to a top slot in a ministry. The officer in question K. Ariyawansa, former chief engineer of Lanka Sathosa, whose services were terminated over an alleged multi-million rupee scam, has been appointed to a top position in the Industry and Commerce Ministry. He was recalled to duty by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathiudeen and Ministry Secretary T.N.K.B. Tennakoon, a group of officers and Auditors from Lanka Sathosa states in a written complaint submitted to the Presidential Commission.
The contract of employment of this Lanka Sathosa official and several others was terminated after a directive by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud,Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), which probed the scam of over Rs 20,000 million in Lanka Sathosa.
A group of Sathosa employees petitioned the PRECIFAC against the recall of K.Ariyawansha. They have noted that Ariyawansha had allegedly been involved in several financial irregularities at Lanka Sathosa and was trying to intimidate officials who are to give evidence in connection with these irregularities and misled the PRECIFAC by preparing forged documents.
They have further said that a billionaire businessman named Sathasiwam Winsendra Rajan was also allegedly involved in these frauds and they were all trying to hush up these investigations with the help of a prominent Minister.
Lanka Sathosa employees urged the PRECIFAC to take immediate action in this connection. Meanwhile, when queried Industries and Commerce Ministry Secretary T.N.B.K.Tennakoon said that there is nothing further to discuss about the decision of the Ministry.
"K.Ariyawansa was removed according to the order of the PRECEFAC and we recruited him to the duties in the Industries and Commerce Ministry" he added.
Talking about the issue PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille de Silva said that the commission had taken some essential decisions which the people cannot override. "We never change our decision related with this issue and we are ready to take strict measures against people who go beyond our decisions. No person can meddle in the inquiries of the PRECIFAC and we will do our maximum if they neglect or go beyond the commission's decision" he said.
Ministry Secretary says...
Expressing his ideas about the allegation, Industries and Commerce Ministry Secretary T.N.B.K. Tennakoon said there was nothing more to discuss about the decision.
"K. Ariyawansha was removed from the CAA according to the order of PRECIFAC and we recruited him to the Industries and Commerce Ministry," Tennakoon said.
PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille de Silva said the commission had taken some important decisions which the public cannot change.
"We never change our decision related with this issue and we are ready to take strict measures against the people who go beyond our decisions. No person can meddle in PRECIFAC inquiries. We will do our maximum if they neglect or go beyond the commission decisions," he said.
