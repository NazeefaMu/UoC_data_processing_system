A change of scene for her!


	



 

The Green Party leadership has asked the young and dainty fair member in the council whether she is willing to shift her political base to Ratmalana.

 


The fair one elected to the council on the Green party ticket had been keeping a low profile for some time. And it was rumored recently that she had decided to quit politics for good. 


A stalwart from the Green party is expected to meet the fair one shortly to discuss with her the proposition coming from the party hierarchy, they say.
