Veteran actor Lal Weerasinghe today reported to PRECIFAC to record a statement on a matter connected to SriLankan airlines.
He said he was asked to report to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) to obtain a statement about an event he had participated in.
“I was only asked to give evidence about the event I participated in. I was told that the Commission was investigating an allegation against SriLankan airlines but that there was no allegation against me. I don’t know anything about this matter,” Mr. Weerasinghe said.
Actress and former MP Upeksha Swarnamalee (Paba), veteran artiste Bandula Wijeweera and actor Ruwanthi Mangala were also summoned by the Commission last Thursday in connection with this matter.
An investigation is being carried out by the Commission into a complaint that funds had been obtained from SriLankan airlines for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s presidential election campaign. (Ajith Siriwardana)Video by Rishan
