Five patients who were treated for Influenza H1N1 at the Bibila Hospital have now been discharged, Hospital Director Dr. Y.M. Sunil Senarath said yesterday.

He said one of the pregnant women who was infected the virus had successfully delivered her baby and they are both in good health.

However, another patient admitted to the hospital yesterday was awaiting a medical report from the Medical Research Institute (MRI) to confirm whether she too was infected with H1N1.

“The health condition of the in-house patients is not critical. There is no sign that the virus is spreading. We have informed the people to be vigilant and look out for any symptoms of the disease and consult a doctor in case of doubt," Dr. Senarath said adding that some 28 to 30 infected cases had been reported in the Bibila area up to Thursday.

The normal work schedule of the hospital is reported to be restricted, to minimize the risk of the virus spreading.

Residents have been informed by the divisional health officials, that the situation was under control. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
