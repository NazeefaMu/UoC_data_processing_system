NDB Achara solely dedicates itself into lending a helping hand towards the senior citizens and the pensioners of our country.


As a means of uplifting the pensioners of Sri Lanka, the NDB Achara loan facility brings in a host of benefits such as longer repayment period of up to 10 years, unsecured loan facilities, hassle free documentation, speedy service, life Insurance coverage for the borrower/co-borrower, and in case of death or total permanent disability, the loan will be settled in full by the insurer.


The senior citizens and pensioners who open a savings account with a minimal deposit amount of Rs.200 under the NDB Achara scheme will also receive higher interest rates.


Population ageing in Sri Lanka has been rapidly increasing since 1980s and is presently accelerating faster than other South Asian countries. Between 1981 and 2012, the proportion of population aged 60 years and above, has increased from 6.6 percent to 12.4 percent, according to the ‘Ageing Population in Sri Lanka: Emerging Issues, Needs, and Policy Implications’ report.


NDB remains dedicated to bringing its customers one step closer to accomplishing their life long ambitions through the range of services that are accessible through its growing branch network.
