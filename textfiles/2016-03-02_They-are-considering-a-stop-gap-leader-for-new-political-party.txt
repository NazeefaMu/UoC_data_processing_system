They are considering a stop-gap leader for new political party


	



 

The much publicized move to found a brand new political party has taken a back seat with no national election in sight.

 


There is another reason for the prime movers to put the plan on the back burner: Former strongman has yet to say ‘yes’ to the offer of the party leadership.  Meanwhile, the leaders of the minor parties in the ‘joint opposition’ have proposed to launch the new party without further delay with the Boralugoda scion as the stop-gap leader until the former strongman makes his appearance on the scene come an election.  However, the proposal is said to be still under consideration and it is a cinch that the Boralugoda worthy will not accept the leadership even for the time- being without the nod from the former strongman, they say.
