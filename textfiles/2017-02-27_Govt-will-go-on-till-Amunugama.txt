Minister Sarath Amunugama said yesterday the government would go on till 2021, when the next presidential election is scheduled to be held, though some opposition politicians say otherwise to please their supporters.

 
The minister made these remarks to the media after a ceremony in Peradeniya.


“MP Wimal Weerawansa’s attempt to become independent in Parliament is in vain, as it is not possible for a member elected from a political party to do so. He will be unsuccessful -- as the Muslim Congress was earlier, when it failed to get independent status after being elected from a major party,” he said.

He said the Joint Opposition had begun to split into different groups, and some were trying to take advantage of this rift. “Karuna Amman had said he would strengthen Mahinda Rajapaksa with the Tamil votes in the North. Whatever they say, they cannot prevent the progress of the government, he said.

He said everyone has the freedom to form parties, contest in elections and have their own policies; but they cannot stop the present government. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
