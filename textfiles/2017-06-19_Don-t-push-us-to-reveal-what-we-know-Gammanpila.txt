PHU General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila today warned JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika to stop making misleading statements on the BBS because otherwise he would be forced to reveal what he knew.

Responding to a question asked at a news conference, the former JHU member said BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera was the former deputy national organiser of the JHU and the relationship between the BBS and JHU was not a secret.

“I won’t say whether the minister was behind Gnanasara Thera. Instead, I like to tell the minister not to slam the BBS and compel us to reveal what we know. After all, there should be a limit to making the minister uncomfortable. Therefore, I won’t come into the middle of the dispute between the JHU and the BBS but I warn the minister not to spread misleading statements about the BBS and to push us to the point of publicly revealing what we know,” he said.

He said he can comment whether Gnanasara Thera was handled by others with facts but that he won’t go that far at this time.

The MP said there was a close relationship between the Thera and Minister even after the Thera joined the BBS.

“In fact, JHU was the only political party which attended one of the conventions organised by the BBS. Minister Ranawaka was the only politician who attended the BBS Sangha Convention. JHU Co-President Ven. Hadigalle Wimalasara Thera was a key member of the BBS back then. These is public knowledge and I would comment only on these facts,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
