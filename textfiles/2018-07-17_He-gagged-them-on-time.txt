The top two political authorities handling the country’s law and order have decided to hold a pow-wow with servicemen concerned about the security situation in a certain province and a star- sporting high-up has already exhorted his subordinates not to bring up any issue at the proposed confab without discussing it first with him.

 


This service high-up is said to be keen on impressing on the two top political authorities that his subordinates have no problems and everything as far as they are concerned is honky-dory.
