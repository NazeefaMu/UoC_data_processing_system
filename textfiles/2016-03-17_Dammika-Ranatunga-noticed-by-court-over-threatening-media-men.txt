Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today noticed Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Chairman Dammika Ranatunga to appear in Court on March 24 following a B Report filed by Keselwatte Police over the alleged incident of threatening a journalist on the Colombo High Court premises yesterday.

Mr. Ranatunga arrived at the premises to attend the hearing yesterday for the bail application revision for his brother Nishantha Ranatunga and had allegedly threatened the journalists present, when they captured visuals of him entering the court.

The journalists, representing several media outlets, captured Ranatunga’s threats on camera and later lodged a Police complaint at the Keselwatte Police.

Nishantha Ranatunga, former CSN Senior Executive, was remanded on charges of violating the Public Property Act. (Shehan Chamika)
