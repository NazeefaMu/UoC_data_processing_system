As tension mounts, Palestinian protesters turn up the intensity

West Bank: At one riotous demonstration this week, Palestinian university students seemed to be inviting Israeli soldiers to shoot them, moving closer rather than away from the drawn rifles and pointing at their chests as though offering target practice.
At another, an unusually large number of young women than men turned out, all but their eyes covered in the signature black-and-white checked keffiyehs. These teenagers in tight jeans and sneakers hurled rocks and firebombs, too, but resentful boys accused them of sometimes panicking when the Israelis responded with tear gas and of screaming when the rubber bullets flew.
A third protest brought unusually large numbers of prepubescent boys, many still in their striped school uniforms and hauling book-filled backpacks. "Look how small you are!" exclaimed an older man as a group that did not reach his waist galloped past and ducked behind a wall to avoid gas. Laith, all of 10 years old, grinned and boasted: "I want to liberate Palestine!"
As a series of apparently lone-wolf Palestinians have attacked Israelis, mostly with knives, over the past week, they have been accompanied by swelling protests in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and even in Jaffa and other Israeli towns with large populations of Arab citizens. Clashes between young Palestinians and Israeli settlers and soldiers are as old as the conflict itself, but the demonstrations in recent days have been more numerous, more sustained and more confrontational than those of the past few years.
"We feel that the intifada has begun," said Mohammad Zeid, 23, an activist at Birzeit University, on a hill outside Ramallah, who said the demonstrations were a way to continue momentum. "This is a letter to our political leaders: We don't want submission, which is what they think peace is."
Some protests break out spontaneously, as when hundreds gathered late Thursday night in Kufr Aqab, a crowded neighborhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem, to block Israeli forces from raiding the home of Thaer Abu Ghazala, 19, who was killed by a soldier after wounding four Israelis with a screwdriver near military headquarters in Tel Aviv.
Frequent flash points are the funerals for such so-called martyrs, and a huge crowd was expected Friday afternoon to mourn Muhanad Halabi, 19, the law student who fatally stabbed two Orthodox men on Saturday night in Jerusalem's Old City.
"Muhanad is a hero!" thousands chanted Friday morning outside the Ramallah hospital where his body awaited burial.
Other demonstrations have been planned by political factions, who bused students from the universities of Birzeit and Bethlehem to friction points with Israelis two days running.
"Cage a cat in a room and it will start scratching you - we are like the cats now," said Elias Sarras, who has worked at the Bethlehem campus for 32 years and said the atmosphere now "looks like it did" during the Palestinian intifadas, or uprisings, of decades past. "The students encourage each other to protest because of the ongoing conflict, and it doesn't take much to make them move."
The Israeli military has bolstered its presence in the West Bank and the police have flushed Jerusalem with some 2,000 additional officers to contain the outbursts they universally call riots.
