Heavy traffic has been reported in Town Hall, Colombo 7 due to a protest launched by the Student Unity of the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL).


The students marching towards the University Grant Commission demanded the University which has been closed for more than a week is reopened.


The University’s Council decided to close the University on January 22 until further notice after several students attempted to forcibly enter two lecture rooms.
