Beaten Rousey faces up to six months out

Los Angeles, Tuesday: Fallen UFC world champion Ronda Rousey has revealed it could take up to six months to fully recover from injuries sustained in her brutal knockout defeat to Holly Holm last month.
Rousey told the upcoming edition of ESPN Magazine she had suffered damage to her teeth in the stunning loss to Holm which would prevent her getting back in the octagon for several months.
“It might be three to six months before I can eat an apple, let alone take an impact,” Rousey said in brief excerpts of the interview released Monday.
Rousey’s defeat to Holm in Melbourne was one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
Both fighters have expressed optimism for a rematch once Rousey has recovered and fulfilled several longstanding commitments including filming a Hollywood remake of the 1980s movie “Road House.”
Rousey, 28, meanwhile insisted that despite the disappointment of the defeat she planned on returning to reclaim her crown while she remained in peak physical condition. “Maybe I can’t do it all before my prime, before my body is done,” Rousey said. “But... maybe I can.” AFP
