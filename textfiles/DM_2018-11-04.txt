I did not sell my portfolio for money: Wasantha
	
Responding to several social media claims, Minister of Tourism and Wildlife Wasantha Senanayake today strongly denied the allegation that he had sold his portfolio for Rs.500 million.
In a statement, he said that he was elected to the Parliament from the United National Party (UNP) votes of Polonnaruwa and will be the beloved leader of those people forever.
Minister Senanayake further said that he will never let any injustice happen to his voters.
He explained that while accepting the change needed for the country upon the President Maithripala Sirisenas request he had agreed to support the Government but he had never betrayed his portfolio for money.
He also said that the UNP leadership had failed to serve the country and its citizens therefore will serve the people under the leadership of President and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.

No-confidence motion against PM cannot be taken up in haste: GL
	
The government today disputed the No-confidence motion handed over by the United National Party (UNP) against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and said it could not be taken up for debate on November 16 when Parliament meets.
Addressing the media at the Prime Ministers Office, former Minister G. L. Peiris said the motion had to be placed on the Order Paper of Parliament first, according to the due procedure. Afterwards, he said the party leaders should assign a date for debate on the motion.
Prof. Peiris said there was confusion created by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya saying that Parliament would be re-convened on November 7 based on verbal assurances by the President.
The Speaker cannot act on verbal assurances. There has to be proclamation by the President to reconvene Parliament before the end of prorogation if he wants. It is entirely in the hands of the President to prorogue Parliament according to Article 70(1) of the Constitution, he said.
Asked as to why Mr. Rajapaksa assumed office as the Prime Minister at such a time, he said though a new government could have been formed after the Presidential Polls in ten months time for sure, the current predicament of the country compelled him to act in advance.
The former Minister said people were in dire need of economic relief, and therefore the new government announced relief measures in terms of reduction of fuel prices and tax cuts. Also, he said the UNP-led government would have sold off more and more national assets had it stayed in power for another ten months or so.
It will be irrepressible then, he said.
He cited the need to reverse the Constitution making process and the process of signing certain Free Trade Agreements adverse to the country as reason for early moves to take over governmental power. (Kelum Bandara)

Speaker's approval for proroguing Parliament: UNP to bring Constitutional amendment
	
United National Party (UNP) today said they would bring in an amendment to the Constitution to provide provisions for President to seek Speaker's approval for proroguing Parliament.
This was announced by UNP National Organizer Navin Dissanayake at a media briefing last morning.
"We intend to bring in an amendment to the Constitution to empower the Speaker to have the final say when proroguing the House. Our amendment will make provisions for the President to seek Speaker's approval when proroguing the House," Mr. Dissanayake said.
As of now he said the UNP was confident that the House would be convened next week.
MP Ajith P. Perera said that Speaker could convene Parliament as per the interpretations that have been made by former Speakers Anura Bandaranaike and Jospech Michael Perera.
"Mr. Bandaranaike clearly stated that Parliament is supreme and judiciary cannot overrule it. He said this with regard to the impeachment motion brought against then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva. Also Mr. Perera had said that convening the House is a matter with regard to administration of Parliament. Speaker had the administration power of the House," he said. (Yohan Perera)

UNP cannot give its support for dissolution of Parliament: Wajira
	
UNP cannot give its support for the dissolution of Parliament till the mistake of appointing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister is rectified by the President, UNP MP Vajira Abeywardene said today.
Mr. Abeywardene said this in response to a question raised by the journalists at a media briefing as whether UNP is ready to support a motion to dissolve the House.
Dissolution of Parliament is not a solution to the present crisis as the mistake of appointing Mr. Rajapaksa has to be rectified first. Dissolution could be looked into after rectifying the mistake, he said.
Earlier, he said the House could be dissolved if two thirds of the MPs approve such a move as per Section 70 (1) of the Constitution. Statements are made that Parliament could be dissolved but it could be done under section 70 (1) of the Constitution, the MP said.
He also said Section 14 (e) of the Interpretation Ordinance is not relevant for todays situation as a person could be removed from a high post only under Section 107(1) of the Constitution. (Yohan Perera)
