State Minister of Agriculture, Wasantha Aluwihare said today the criticism levelled at the government against ‘Good Governance’ was an act of betrayal.
At an event in Matale, the minister said the national government was formed to find solutions to major concerns of the people.
“Those who opposed the January 8 victory are criticizing the government today. It’s the UPFA that has been shattered. We condemn statements made by some ministers in a bid to undermine the people’s wishes,” he said. (Mahesh Keerthiratne)
