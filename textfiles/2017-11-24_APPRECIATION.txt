- Mrs Soma Wimalasundera
Dearest Amma,   
Three whole months have gone by   
Since you bade us good bye   
Every single of those days   
You’ve constantly been on my mind   
Life is strange   
We come, make bonds   
And then when the bonds are strong   
One departs, leaving others astray   
Life wasn’t a bed of roses,   
You went through tough times   
But you always rose   
Stronger than before   
So many events flash through my mind   
Too numerous to put to pen and paper   
But each one of those   
Gave me the strength to be who I am.   
It is time to reflect   
All the good times   
And offer thanks   
To a memorable life   
With fond memories 
- Mano-
