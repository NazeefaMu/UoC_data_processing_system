A wreath sent with a wrong condolence tag on it


	

An occupant of an important chair in the Diyawanna council had sent an expensive wreath to a funeral parlour in Borella to convey his condolences on the death of a lady who had been very close to him. 




The valet of the Diyawanna bigwig who carried the wreath to the funeral parlour had discovered that the tag put on the wreath mistakenly carried the name of the mother of a leading singer as the departed.


Finding that it was too late to undo the gaffe already made, the valet had quietly left the place.
