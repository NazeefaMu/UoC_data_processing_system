A leader of a minor political party is set to convene a national convention of his political party to showcase the party’s strength.

 


This leader had decided to demonstrate the party’s popular base thus in response to jibes aimed at him by some people saying that he is leading a three-member party. He has further requested a leading political heavyweight to help him get a venue for holding his party convention. 


However, the political heavyweight had not taken his request seriously, they say.
