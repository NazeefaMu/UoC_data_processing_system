New Commonwealth chief pledges group will get gutsy

MALTA: Critics brand the Commonwealth ineffectual, but its incoming chief believes the 53-country organisation can use its strength to achieve miracles -- such as eradicating domestic violence. Dominica-born lawyer Patricia Scotland, who was appointed the Commonwealth's first female Secretary-General on Friday, told AFP she would harness the international family's "huge convening power".
Among her top priorities: "Action to combat any form of abuse against women". "One in three women in our world suffer from domestic violence. It's the greatest cause of morbidity between women and girls," she said, adding that there was "a lot of work to do".
"Forced marriage, female genital mutilation, child abduction... these issues affect all of us," said the 60-year-old, who will take over the reins from Indian diplomat Kamalesh Sharma in April 2016. Not everyone is convinced the Commonwealth, which includes vastly different countries accounting for around a third of the world's population, is ready to tackle such issues. - AFP
