The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) embarked on a series of Investor Forums titled “kotas welenda pola: nagarayen nagarayate” throughout the country.


This was done with a view to improving financial literacy and imparting knowledge on the types of investment products and services available in the securities market.


The recently concluded forums in Negombo, Colombo, Jaffna and Kandy attracted large crowds and the fifth in the series was concluded on Saturday 30th September at the Lighthouse hotel in Galle with over 350 participants. 


The responses witnessed in the past forums reflect the renewed interest in the capital market of Sri Lanka.
