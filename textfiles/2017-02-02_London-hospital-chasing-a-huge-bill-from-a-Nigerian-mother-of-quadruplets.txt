Daily Mail- One of the largest hospitals in the country is chasing a bill of more than £500,000 from a Nigerian woman who gave birth to quadruplets.   


The 43-year-old, named only as Priscilla, went into labour three months early shortly after landing at Heathrow airport in November.   


She had intended to give birth to the babies in Chicago, in the US, where she has family – but was turned away by border officials upon arrival.  They claimed that although she had a visa, she did not have required documents from a hospital stating that she had the money to pay for the birth.  

 
Priscilla, a healthcare worker, said she was returning to Nigeria via London when she started having contractions.   


She was taken to the Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital in west London, part of Imperial College Hospital, where she delivered the four babies.
