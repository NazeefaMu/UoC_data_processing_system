June 23 National Construction Day

Former President Ranasinghe Premadasa's birthday June 23 will mark National Construction Day, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said. He was unveiling plans by the ministry for 2016 at a media conference held in Colombo.
He expressed his gratitude to the President, the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister for allocating Rs. 3,990 million towards housing and construction: “President Ranasinghe Premadasa's time was know as the golden era of construction. But 2016 will mark the highest amount of funds for Housing and Construction," he said.
He said that his ministry intended to implement a number of projects to mark National Construction Day; of these will be an initiative to provide houses to those who lose theirs due wild elephant attack or natural disasters, for the displaced persons in North, and for female-headed households.
He said these projects will be carried out in conjunction with relevant ministries.
