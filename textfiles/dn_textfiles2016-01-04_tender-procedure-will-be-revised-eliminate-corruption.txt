'Tender procedure will be revised to eliminate corruption'

The tender procedure of drugs and medical equipment will be revised this year to eliminate corruption, malpractices and irregularities, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He made this observation recently at a function at the Colombo National Hospital to distribute medical equipment worth Rs. 3.8 million for the Orthopedic Surgical Unit of the hospital.
The minister also said that immediate measures will be taken to end the medical equipment shortage. Measures will also be taken to develop physical and infrastructure facilities of hospitals.
Special attention will also be paid on the discard of unused drugs as it is also a type of business. Around 300 million drugs are being discarded annually.
The pharmaceutical companies have agreed for a price formula on drugs. The Health Ministry annually import drugs worth Rs. 4 billion.
A software has been introduced to avoid the shortage of drugs.
"Doing health tests from the private institutions have already been banned for government hospitals and a procedure to do all the health tests at government hospitals will be implemented," he said.
National Hospital Director General Anil Jasinghe, State Pharmaceutical Corporation Chairman Sayura Samarasundara and Managing Director P. Sundaralingam also participated.
