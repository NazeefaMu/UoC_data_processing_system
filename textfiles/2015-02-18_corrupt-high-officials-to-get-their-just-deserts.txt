Corrupt high officials to get their just deserts


	


	
	Many people complain these days that the wheels of justice in the country are turning so slowly that they can no longer believe that the corrupt politicos and high officials who are said to have looted public funds under the previous regime would be brought to book within the 100-day interim rule of the government in office.  

However, an informed source says that plans are now being fast-tracked to haul several top bureaucrats who held key positions under the previous regime before a high-powered anti-sleaze commission of inquiry.
One-time big guns who helmed the Central Bank, the CEB and the Highways Ministry are among the officials due to face the inquisition.
The kingpin of the power sector mafia has skipped the country.
 An owner of two mansions among other properties Down Under, the official is not likely to return here on his own in the foreseeable future, they say.  However, the authorities are determined to get him extradited with the assistance of Interpol.
Meanwhile, the Highway Ministry bigwig in hot water is said to be seeking the refuge of a young sibling of a VVIP.  The sibling was a beneficiary of a lucrative contract awarded for the supply of ‘ornamental stones’ for road construction. The present indications are that the maxim: ‘one good turn deserves another’ will work to his benefit.
