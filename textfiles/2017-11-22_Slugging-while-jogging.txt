Time: 6.15 in the morning
The scene:  The Sports Ministry jogging track

 

A purohita was jogging with a group of buddies in tandem. And another purohita is seen jogging followed by a group of his pals from the opposite direction. 

 


The purohita ‘B’ on seeing his colleague heading towards them, stops in his tracks and shouts: “Amethithuma, why are you going round calling me a thief?” 


The purohita ‘A’ too comes to a halt. He looks angry. 


“What’s wrong with calling you that…? That’s the truth…”


The purohita ‘B’: “How dare you call me that?”


“I am calling you a thief because you are thieving. I don’t mind calling you that to your face!”


Both the purohita ‘B’ and his pals look stunned. They head for their vehicles and got into them in a hurry. The purohita ‘A’ and his buddies are seen looking on until the vehicles disappear in the distance and then resume jogging.
