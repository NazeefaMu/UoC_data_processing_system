Forex Bill similar to what Solheim envisaged: JO


	

The Foreign Exchange Bill which presented in Parliament by the government is similar to what former Norwegian peace envoy Erik Solheim envisaged, the joint opposition said today.

It said the Bill would enable the Tamil Diaspora which was a repository of LTTE funds to invest in Sri Lanka without any control or monitoring by the Central Bank (CB).

“Solheim mentioned this at an interview with ‘The Hindu’ soon after the election victory of President Maithripala Sirisena. He said the government should reach out to the Tamil Diaspora and get them to invest in Sri Lanka,” MP Bandula Gunawardane told the JO’s weekly news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
