“In the near future, IT will rule the world. I believe excellence in IT education would solve the matters which we are facing today. If students have E-learning practice, they need not worry about their future. Traditional schooling methods no longer solve the issue of unemployment. 'Smart Cloud Classroom' would make you capable of almost anything,” he said.

“Autonomous car (self-driving car/robotic car) was no longer a concept. ‘Tesla’ has already built it. What would befall the future of the drivers and chauffeurs, hereafter?, he questioned.

The 'Smart Cloud Classroom' was designed to create enriching learning experiences using information technology as an exception for books and other traditional learning methods. The practice is currently being used in countries like Korea, United States and the U.K.. The programme was launched as a Private-Public Partnership (PPP) with the support of the Kojen International Private Institution and the Central Bearing Company headed by Sudath Tennakoon, under the instructions of the Education Ministry.
