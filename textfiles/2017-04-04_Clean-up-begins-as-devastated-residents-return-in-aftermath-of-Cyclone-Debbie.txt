Clean-up begins as devastated residents return in aftermath of Cyclone Debbie


	

The clean-up operation is underway in towns in northern New South Wales and Queensland that were ravaged by Cyclone Debbie and the devastating floods that followed.   


Residents who abandoned their homes in flood-hit towns like Murwillumbah and Lismore have returned to find their houses in a state of ruin. Pictures show banana trees and cars among the debris washed up in people’s front gardens, with some vehicles written off after flipping over during the tumultuous weather.   


Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the cost of recovery would ‘be in the billions’ of dollars, with roads, bridges, crops, homes and schools all needing serious repairs. Three people died in the town over the weekend as a result of the horrific conditions.
