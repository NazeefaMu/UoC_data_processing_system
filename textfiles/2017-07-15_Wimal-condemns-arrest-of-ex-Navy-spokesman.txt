National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday condemned the remanding of former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake who was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday over the alleged abduction and disappearance of several youth between 2008 and 2009.

MP Weerasansa told a news conference that Commodore Dassanayake's arrest was a sensitive incident and added that he was a talented officer who had contributed immensely to the nation.

“Commodore Dassanayake was one of the two officers who got the opportunity to get ‘Field Promotions’ twice in the Sri Lankan Navy’s history. He has been arrested over an incident where several terrorists had gone missing,” he alleged.

He also urged the government to immediately release Commodore Dassanayake and the other soldiers who were arrested over this incident.

He expressed his sympathies to the Sri Lankan Navy over this incident and added that the people should stand against the injustice faced by Commodore Dassanayake. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
