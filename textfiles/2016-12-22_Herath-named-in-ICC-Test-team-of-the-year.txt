Spin-wizard Rangana Herath was named in the ICC Test team of the year 2016 captained by Englishman Alastair Cook. He is the only Sri Lankan to be named in either Test or ODI team announced by the International Cricket Council today as no other Sri Lanka had impressed the selection panel.

Former Test stalwarts Rahul Dravid, Gary Kirsten and Kumar Sangakkara selected the sides based on players’ performances in the period from 14 September 2015 to 20 September 2016.
The Test team includes four Englishmen, three Australians, and a player each from New Zealand, India, Sri Lanka and South Africa.
Herath has picked up 61 wickets at an impressive 17.11 in his last ten test matches including a best of 8 for 63 against Zimbabwe last month.
 
 This is the third time Cook has been appointed captain of the Test side, while it the eighth time in nine years that Dale Steyn has been selected. Joe Root, David Warner and Kane Williamson have been chosen for the third successive year.
 
Meanwhile Virat Kohli has been named as captain of the ICC ODI Team of the Year, which includes three Australians, Indians, South Africans each, and one each from England and West Indies.
