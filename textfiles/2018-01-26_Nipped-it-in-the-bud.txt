Nipped it in the bud


	



 

A group of candidates from a political party yet to bloom now in the fray in a district in the South has reportedly made an appeal to the party leadership not to allow a fire-breathing dainty one – a well- known character in the district – to address their propaganda meetings. 

 


These candidates have pointed out that if this lovely one known to become abusive were allowed to address their meetings they would lose even the votes already in hand, let alone winning new ones. 
This fair one who lost her Diyawanna seat due to a court ruling is raring to cut a figure on the political stage and she enjoys addressing crowds at propaganda meetings, they say.
