The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila said they were opposed to a no-confidence motion being moved against Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

He told a news conference that some MPs were planning to move a no-confidence motion against Mr. Rajapakshe because he publicly highlighted governfment wrongdoings.

“These people are at loggerheads with Wijeyadasa for being patriotic. He does not have any power to appoint or dismiss the Attorney General. Therefore, I don’t know why some UNP ministers are accusing him of not removing the AG,” he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
