In the wake of a large number of supporters requesting former state minister and UNP Colombo district candidate Rosy Senanayake to apply for a recount, she had written to the Elections Commissioner requesting him to carry out a recount of the preference votes polled at the August 17 general election.
She told Daily Mirror that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had also approved her request for a recount. Ms. Senanayake is on top of the UNP losers’ list having received 65,320 preferential votes.
She said she was optimistic of receiving an increased number votes in case of a recount, but emphasized that whatever the result of the recount maybe, she would support government efforts at rebuilding a new Sri Lanka and continue to serve the people as before.
Meanwhile, Ms. Senanayake said she had not accepted the Prime Minister’s offer of being appointed as the Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to Britain because she was not happy about deserting the people who placed their confidence in her.
 “As a longstanding UNPer, I am happy about the UNP emerging victorious at this election and will cooperate with the party in achieving its objectives. I will do my best to improve the lot of women and children and concentrate on resolving their concerns and the problems faced by them,” Ms. Senanayake said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
