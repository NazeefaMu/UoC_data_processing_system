UNP must decide whether SF is fit to be a minister: Elle Gunawansa Thera


	

The Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, in response to a statement by Minister and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka describing the monk as a 'mad man in robes' said yesterday the United National Party (UNP) should decide whether it should have such a person as a Cabinet minister any longer.

The monk said senior UNPers such as Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali and R. Premadasa had visited his temple on several occasions.

“Mr. Fonseka is a political reject. Only the UNP accommodated him and gave him a portfolio. The UNP should now decide whether it should risk its credibility by having such a person in the Cabinet. However, the people will decide,” he said.

“In a way, slandering me has turned out to be a blessing in guise. I was able to realize the magnitude of affection people have towards me. Throngs of people from all walks of life are visiting me. All the former army commanders frequented my temple. Mr. Fonseka's claim that war crimes took place has become a reason for jubilation by pro-LTTE groups operating overseas,” the monk said.

He said Mr. Fonseka's harsh attitude towards him had forced him to appear on the political stage for the first time.

“So, far I have not stepped on anyone's political stage but I will do it for the time when the occasion arises,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
