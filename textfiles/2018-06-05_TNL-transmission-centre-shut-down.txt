A TNL transmission centre at Polgahawela was shut down today on a court order issued by the Polgahawela Magistrate’s Court, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) said.

It said its officials and CID detectives yesterday raided the TNL-owned transmission station in Polgahawela because the network had not obtained the annual transmission licence from the TRC and had failed to make payments since last year.

The TRC said it was a punishable offence to transmit without a valid TRC licence according to the consolidated Act No.25 of 1991, as amended by the Sri Lanka Telecommunications (Amendment) Act No 27 of 1996.

“False social media posts are circulating saying the said transmission station was raided even when the station has already made relevant payments to the TRC. However, there was no payment made to the TRC since 2017,” it said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
