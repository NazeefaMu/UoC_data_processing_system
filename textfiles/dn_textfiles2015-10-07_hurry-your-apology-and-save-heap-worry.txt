SAYING SORRY!
Hurry with your apology and save a heap of worry!

We all do and say silly things once or twice in a while. That would appear quite permissible, unless of course such actions hurt someone's feelings in the process. Often we are the purveyors of terse and snappy comments directed at our friends, colleagues, spouses or family members.
Without exception, at one time or another we all make the mistake of spewing out some careless remark or observation which could offend the listeners. Even some perfectly reasonable or harmless statement could well be misconstrued.
Remember that you are responsible for your actions. Think before you speak because careless words or actions may affect other people.
None of us is perfect and sometimes we are bound to make mistakes. As such, there will be several instances when we will have to apologise. A poor or half-hearted apology will only make a bad situation worse, but a good sincere apology would go a long way in defusing every recriminatory bomb.
Without a doubt, the most demanding concern for many of us is to admit that we made a mistake and apologise for it. We all are obsessed with a sense of arrogance that makes us feel that if we are apologetic for our hurtful words or actions we are displaying signs of weakness. Nothing could be further from the truth. On the contrary just the opposite would be an accurate assessment. Because it takes a person with strong, sound character to admit that he or she was wrong.
However, this is easier said than done. But the first step in this direction is to always admit to yourself that you were wrong, if you have blundered in any way. This is obviously the first and hardest step in the conciliatory process. But attempt to work on it before you move on. If you had mouthed something incorrect or that could be construed as gossip or insult think about what you should have said or left unsaid.
If you did something wrong, you must surely have been aware of it right away. There may possibly be times when you might have known straight away that you said or did something wrong. When this happens, stop your prattle, apologise immediately and change course. When you realise that you have cocked things up, address the situation promptly.
If emotions are running high, give the other person a brief cooling off period but be careful not to let too much time pass. It will seem as if you are thoughtless or don't care that you have hurt their feelings. Worse yet, ignoring it ever happened and not mentioning it again would be the most damaging way to handle the situation.
An apology is only valid when it is sincere. A half-hearted attempt with the sole intention to patronise the other person does more harm than good. An apology is only as powerful as the follow through and if it is not authentic, it will soon be obvious. Insincerity will only make the situation worse. Proper etiquette doesn't require excellence. It speaks more about the refinement of your character. An apology positively made shows good manners. However, you still might have a tough time letting the offended person know that you feel horrid about your actions or what you said.
Yet when we are hurt, we don't tend to think rationally. Anger can obscure our ability to forgive the same way that it blurred our judgement when we said or did the thing that got us into this situation. While we are aware we should apologise, we also know it's not always easy to offer one. Doing so opens us up to the possibility of being confronted with anger and resentment by the offended party.
Be tolerant of those who might not be ready to accept your apology. For some, hurt feelings die hard and patience must be exercised until that person is ready to accept your reconciliatory gesture. Some might remain so upset with your actions that they may need time to reconcile themselves to trust you again. That would be only natural because they may be justified in rejecting your move to even listen to your explanation. Even so, be prepared to accept the consequences.
Don't push or expect too much too soon. It may take some time for the other party to trust you again. This is a normal phenomenon. Give them the time they need and ask them to call you when they are ready to talk about it. You can also follow up in a letter. They may feel lesser resentment towards you after they read and digest your well thought out words.
Try to repair the damage. Don't be afraid to ask what you can do to correct your mistake or to help right the wrong that you have done. Often, there is nothing you can do, but you should still make a heartfelt offer.
Some people say the most stupid things and ask the most stupid questions. Some also mouth and raise the most incredibly spitefully stupid queries. Come to think of it, the entire number of daft and upsetting questions asked of us in a single day can be astounding. Certain catty remarks may be perceived as unforgivable. But such poisoned bitchiness comes from the mouths of the envious who consider themselves inferior to their targets.
The biggest test of your manners comes when you are in the company of others who do not observe the cultural societal norms you are accustomed to. A well-mannered person will ignore the slip-ups of others and will maintain his or her composure no matter how annoying the challenge. [email protected]
