UNP is a grand old party, but it behaves like an independent group in Colombo-North

Politics in Colombo- North afflicted by drug trafficking and underworld criminal activities 

Obviously, there is a financial crime in the bond issue

It’s important not only to recover the loss, but also to punish wrongdoers

 

Constitution making should be prioritized after LG polls

 

Minister of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan in an interview with the Dailymirror spoke about the importance of the Local Government Elections and the future of the country. Ganesan, who is also the leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), said that his party had grown and is a force tobe reckoned with.   Excerpts:


 

QAgainst the backdrop of diatribe between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), what do you feel about the future as a leader of a minority party aligned with the Government?


I am worried, but not excited. My political experience and maturity tell me that the situation isn’t as bad as it is projected at the moment through the media, roadside talks and public discussions.

   
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have made a ‘matchless match’. They would lead this country out of the economic and political crisis.

   QYour party pinned a lot of hopes on this Government to deliver on constitutional reforms among other things. In that context, how do you view the present uncertainty?


You are correct in one way. That is why I say I am worried. I am not excited. Though it is a Local Government Election, it has assumed national significance. We were having three elections per year earlier. Now, we have one election after three years. That is one thing. People are eager to turn up for voting. That is a good thing for democracy. The results of this election will be significant for the forward march of this country. Therefore, all the parties from the UNP right down to the minority parties will do their best to secure their share.

   Q How important are the elections from the viewpoint of your Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA)? 


It is very, very important. The TPA led by me has gained recognition as a political party. We have six MPs- two cabinet ministers and one state minister. This election result will matter to us very much. We are mostly representing the Tamils living outside the north and the east. We are contesting in ten districts for 35 local authorities. We are contesting on our own for 15 of them. We will emerge as a victorious force at this election.

   Q What do you think of the final outcome? 


We are contesting in alliance with the UNP in some areas. In others, we are going solo. All the votes, obtained by all those contesting alone, will be put into one basket. This basket will be much heavier than the basket of the Joint Opposition, the JVP or the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). I am not contesting alone in the entire Colombo District. We contest with the UNP in Dehiwala- Mount Lavinia, Avissawella and Kolonnawa. We are contesting with the UNP in Wattala-Mabola Urban Council area. We are contesting on our own only in the Colombo Municipal Council area.

Colombo is the largest city in the country. The largest vote bank remains in Colombo. It is the financial capital. All the important political decisions are made in Colombo. We find the diplomatic community accredited to Sri Lanka based in Colombo. The Offices of the President and the Prime Minister are in Colombo. Therefore, it is very important for us to be politically powerful in Colombo. That is one of the reasons for us to contest separately. 

 
 In Colombo, my list includes not only Tamils, but also Sinhalese and Muslims. 

 Q In Colombo, you are contesting alone. We read reports about you saying that there were drug traffickers and underworld operators serving in this Government. Who are you referring to it?


Yes of course. It is everybody’s guess. I cannot name the person. I do not mention the name of the party. In Colombo-North, we experienced underworld shootings in the recent past. Immediately after the announcement of the election, there was a shooting incident. Some were killed and others were injured. The police are yet to name the culprits. Police called it a gunfire between underworld groups. One week before the announcement of the elections, there was a shooting incident in Modara. I visited the victim’s household. It is a Sinhalese family. At the last parliamentary elections, you will recall there was gunfire in Bloemendhal Street.


This election result will matter to us very much. 
We are mostly representing the Tamils living outside the north and the east. We are contesting in ten districts for 35 local authorities. We are contesting on our own for 15 of them


   
The Colombo-North area is afflicted by underworld elements. Underworld criminal activities are always linked with drug trafficking. Both go hand in hand. 

 Q How will this criticism affect your relations with the UNP? 


I am a matured person. There is the Sinhalese adage ‘Nahayath Ekka Tharahawela Muna Kapa Ganne ( It is unwise for one to get angry with his nose and cut the face). The UNP is a grand old party. The grand old party has stooped down to the level of an independent political group in Colombo-North. It is the party that gained independence for the country and produced stalwarts like D.S.Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Ponnambalam Ramanathan, T.B. Jayah, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and D.A. Rajapaksa. Therefore, the situation is worrisome even for non-UNPers. Yet, I cannot see the UNP leadership being worried. That is my real worry.

   Q There is acrimony between the UNP and President Maithripala Sirisena. How will it affect the future of the national unity Government?


We had a recent meeting with the Prime Minister and the other stalwarts of the UNP. The participants at the meeting wanted to counter the President who said that he would form a SLFP-led Government if all his MPs stood behind him. The UNP-led alliance has more numbers. Therefore, it stands a better chance of forming its own Government.

   
We are not eager to split the Unity Government. We still want to continue with the Unity Government. The first reason is to work out a solution to the national question. That is the constitution making process.

   Q How hopeful are you of a solution to the national question?


 I am an optimist. I never give up. I only grow up. We have had discussions with the Prime Minister. I had a discussion with the President. They are determined to proceed with the task come what may after the elections are over. There is a period of lull in that regard because of the elections. It should be the first priority after the election.


We are equally sensitive. Tamils being only concerned about the national issue is now in the past. There was a time when the right to life was the only concern. Now it is different. Times are changing. The young generation is worried


   Q With regard to the Tamil people whom you represent, how sensitive are they to the frauds in bond trading of the Central Bank under the Government?


We are equally sensitive. Tamils being only concerned about the national issue is now in the past. There was a time when the right to life was the only concern. Now it is different. Times are changing. The young generation is worried. They are very much interested in knowing more and more about the bond issue.

   Q What is your position?


Obviously, there had been a financial crime in this case. The Presidential Commission, appointed by our own Government, investigated it and submitted the report. If somebody denies any financial crime in this case, he is fooling himself. Criminals need to be identified. They should be brought before the law. 


We had a recent meeting with the Prime Minister and the other stalwarts of the UNP. The participants at the meeting wanted to counter the President who said that he would form a SLFP-led Government if all his MPs stood behind him. The UNP-led alliance has more numbers. Therefore, it stands a better chance of forming its own Government


 
It is not only the recovery of the loss. The culprits should be brought to book. That is the stand of the whole Government. The UNP leader is keen that the culprits should be punished. There are culprits not directly connected to the scam. They should also be brought to book.

   
In addition to the report on the bond scam, there is another report regarding 34 cases. We are going to debate all that on February 6. During election times, it will be a political debate.
