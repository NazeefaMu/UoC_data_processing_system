Animatedly spellbound

Q: Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation spearheaded a number of animation programmes before other channels took over. Your comment?
A: In 2009, Japan introduced a special project. But we had no facilities to create quality cartoons. I requested their assistance. Accordingly we received a dubbing room. That was a two-dimension room. We received great support from Japanese Ambassador and the heads of JICA. This is the only 3D and 2D room existing in a Sri Lankan television company today. Our creations had a facelift with these studio facilities.
The 'Tomiyayi Kitiyayi' turned out to be a successful animation programme at the time. It was produced with Grade Five scholarship students in mind. It was recognized at the Raigam and Sumathi Television Awarding ceremonies too.
Then the programmes such as 'Sunil Gee' and 'Kumara Gee' moderated by Dr Ruvan Ekanayaka also became popular. 'Podi Hamuduruwo' programme was a turning point. It made use of live characters as well as 3D animation. The programme was recognized by the state as well as Sumathi Raigam Awards. It is the first children's programme to receive such recognition. Now we have initiated a programme called 'Freddy and Prem' presented by Prof Sunil Ariyaratne. It also gets a good audience feedback.
Q: Animation seems to be your passion.
A: From the very beginning, I tried to highlight our identity through modern technology. We offered folk stories like Andare and Kadawalalu plus Dhammapada verses. We have also created Panchantantra stories for children.
Q: Animation requires time as well as a large number of dubbing artistes. However, your unit does not take long to produce animations. How have you accomplished that status?
A: We have only a few animation artists. They are Anil Susan, Sanjaya Gunarathne, Charitha Ranasinghe, Ayesh Wadduwage, Ruwan Perera and Isuru Tharanga. But they are a talented team. They took only 21 days to complete 'Gamarala Divya Loke Yayi'.
We do not have first technological facilities like Walt Disney and Sony.
Nor do we have the luxury of time for animation experiments. Unlike in cinema, the television animations do not attract a fat profit. I think it is the team spirit and their talent that work wonders.
Q: What's in store for your audience?
A: For the first time in Sri Lankan television history, we will create an animation film. That is a two-hour film titled as 'Dosthara Honda Hitha Lankawata Ewith'.
Our next challenge is 'Andaragen Passe'. We revive the old radio programme moderated by the three entertainment legends, Annesley, Samuel and Berty. These three characters appear on the screen as animated characters. This could also be a new experience to the Rupavahini audience.
We have a great support from JICA and Japanese ambassador.
