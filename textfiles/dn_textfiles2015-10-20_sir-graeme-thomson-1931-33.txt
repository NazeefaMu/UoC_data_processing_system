Governor tales
Sir Graeme Thomson 1931-33

The state Council replaces the Legislative council by an order of this governor. The latter council had been steering the administration of Ceylon since its inception in mid 19th Century till it was dissolved in April 1931. .
But we are in the dark about more intimate details about him that will be furnished now.
Graeme Thomson was born in August 1785 and was Oxford educated in Classics. However he deviated to the branch of transport, culminating as Director of transport and his services were much sought after especially as it was war time.
A close associate of Lloyd George, the then PM of England he was once described by him as Greatest since Noah in the transport field. A crisis rising in shipment he was sent in charge of the war time shipping programme in the USA. All in all, Thomson made his mark as a great patriot during the First World War.
Soon he was appointed Colonial Secretary of Ceylon. There seems to be no rhyme or reason in change of stations but he was one of four governors who had earlier been appointed colonial secretaries. Each had been popular in their own way that made the
Come back too easy. During this governor's stint as colonial secretary he had acted in governor's capacity too. Then as though to reflect the spreading dimensions of the Suddha Empire he went to British Guiana as governor and later to Nigeria in the same capacity.
This time in Nigeria he exhibited his broad vision by a scheme of co-operation among all West African Govts. Now subject to British rule. However he succumbed to many a health problem and soon he was posted to Ceylon where the famous Dr. Lucian de Zilva began his ministrations.
Anyway the tides of politics began fermenting him and the order in council for dissolving the old legislative council and replacing it with the new state council was issued.
But from the initial stages of the sittings of the new council , the Sinhala ministers got boisterous and pleaded radical changes. Thomson had been receptive to demands when he was colonial secretary but now that he was holding the reins his attitude had changed.
Becoming cautious to the suggested steps to create fundamental changes in the constitution he gave in, in a small measure.
That was to examine any specific pints in the following areas ,
* Method of election of Ministers
* Reallocation of functions of the executive committees
* The public service commission ---its layout as proposed by the Donoughmore commission.
However illness overtook him again and fortunately for contemporary recorders, Dr. Lucien de Zilva maintained a diary where hilarious data as to the refusal to take a fee from the highly placed patient are given . We owe it to HAJ Hulugalle for raking up such matter.
Just as John Anderson was the first and last governor to die on our soil , Grahame Thomson was the first and last governor to die en route home and that on official duty. The secretary of state had summoned him to discuss the memorandum of the board of ministers asking for a revision of the constitution. The governor was buried on the way at Aden.
