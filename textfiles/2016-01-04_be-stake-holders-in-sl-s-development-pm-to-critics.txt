The government is endeavouring to obtain the support of its opponents to make its 2016 social and economic development programme a success, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
In a special statement during a New Year reception at Temple Trees, Mr. Wickremesinghe said some may criticize the government’s three-year social and economic development programme but that the ruling administration was keen to woo the critics to its camp.
“We don’t have to stop our social and economic development programme in the face of criticism but will woo those who criticize us to our camp,” he said.
He said this development programme would cover the entire country from Hambantota to Jaffna and from Colombo to Trincomalee. (Yohan Perera)
