I am K. Mahanama who served as a Deputy Principal of Susamayawardana College and C.W.W. Kannangara College in Borella, Colombo 08. I retired from my Teaching profession recently. I am a heart patient awaiting a by-pass surgery and presently under medication, with monthly check-ups at the Cardiology Unit of the National Hospital, Colombo.   


I have four children. My eldest son is subject to Down Syndrome. The other two sons are undergraduates and past students of D.S. Senanayake College. My youngest son - Desaja Dewmith Mahanama is studying at D.S. Senanayake College. He was examined by neuro surgeon Dr. Jayantha Liyanage who has diagnosed my son with an ailment in the blood vessels of his brain, and prescribed him a special DSA scanning.   Subsequent to the scan carried out by Radiologists Dr. Nihal Wijewardena and Dr. Lakmali Paranahewa a special surgery has been recommended at an approximate cost of Rupees three million (Rs.3,000,000/-).   
As a government pensioner, I am not in a position to afford such a huge sum and hence I humbly beg your kind assistance in this regard.   


I appreciate your generous contribution towards my son’s surgery.   


Your kind assistance/donation could be deposited/remitted to any of the following accounts opened in the name of K. Mahanama with your information if possible.
