Kandy's cricket lovers
Kandyâ€(tm)s cricket lovers are expecting a lot from the newly elected Sri Lanka Cricket chief Thilanga Sumathipala. Today club cricket in Kandy at domestic level is nil. Now the KDCA and CPCA have got up from their sleep due to the AGM of the controlling body, KDCA supported one side and CPCA supported the other. The AGM is over, what Kandy needs is good organizing of domestic tournaments. In the good old days there was a six-a-side tournament for the Dr. J.C. Blok trophy, a double wicket tournament for the Dr. C.D.L. Fernando and Z.M. Jahufer trophy, and Hemachandra trophy one-day cricket, Dr. Anthonyâ€(tm)s trophy inter-club tournament (the oldest). Where has all these tournaments gone? Everyone is expecting the club cricket standard to improve. It is said that the Kandy C.C.is now housed in Colombo and only the name is used to play matches. The club was handed over to a famous school coach, on contract, and he ran it with players from outside.
Kandy MC wins at TT
Kandy Municipal Council play grounds department, which is headed by Kelum Shanthasiri and assisted by G.D. Darmaratne, pocketed the State Services Table Tennis championship with 30 points, second was the strong Colombo Municipal Council with 26 points. The tournament was held in Jaffna. In the team championship Kandy Municipal Council won the â€˜Aâ€(tm) division title. The game of Table Tennis in the good old days was promoted at the Kandy Municipal Council through the Playgrounds due to the efforts of then commissioner and a top class cricketer late D.H, de Silva with the full backing of the Mayor late Tilak Ratnayake, where all the Community Centers were provided with Table Tennis tables and equipments. That is how they game was promoted and today Kandy is doing well in the sport.
Trinity College starts Cricket Academy
Trinity College has launched an academy called the Center of Excellence Cricket Academy for their students. The main aim is to give the best for the youngsters to do well in the game. This academy is headed by their main cricket sponsor Bilal Fasey, who is the chairman and Prefect of Games, Shane de Silva is the manager. The coaches involved are Kavinda Jayasooriya, Lahiru Seneviratne, Dilka Panagoda, Chandima Abeyakoon, Palitha Tilakasiri and Vishanga Vithanage. The classes are held on Sundays, and nearly 190 young cricketers from 8 to 14 years attend them.
Cricket Carnival at Asgiriya today
Center of Excellence Academy will be having their inaugural cricket carnival today at Asgiriya International Cricket Stadium. It will be held under the distinguished patronage of former Sri Lankan cricket captain Hashan Tillakeratne. The event will start at 8.30 a.m. where under 11 and 13 cricketers will be seen in action. They are grouped into four teams, Titans, Patriots, Warriors and Gladiators.
Clifford Cup Rugby
Will the Clifford Cup rugby knockouts like in the good old days played in Kandy this time. It was during the presidency of Y.C.Chang that the Clifford cup knockouts tournament was brought to Kandy and all matches were played over here. Later only Kandy Sports Club involved matches were played in Kandy. SLRFU gave the green light to the CPRFU to do the tournament and in one year they failed to give the best, and the tournament was shifted back to Colombo.
Sports bodies lack organization
Most of the sports bodies, over here are not in a position to organize tournaments because, people who come to high office, promising everything before the AGM but nothing happens afterwards and the organization has to incur heavy expenditure to conduct tournaments as there are no sponsors. So, people who take up office, should be able to do the needful not come into office, and have their name promoted. What they do is they invite a politician as chief guest and in the speech come out to say no sponsors, no venue, no office, please help us. How can one promote sports like this? In the good old days, people who take up office were good sportsman and promoters and they knew how to run tournaments. It is lacking today.
