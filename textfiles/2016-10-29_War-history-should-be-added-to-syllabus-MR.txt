Books written on war history such as ‘War Heroes Killed in Action’ by Retd. General Gerry De Silva and ‘Road to Nandikadal’ by Major General Kamal Gunaratne should be named as recommended books for the school syllabi, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said.

He said this while delivering a speech at the book launch of ‘War Heroes Killed in Action’ which was held at the BMICH last evening.

Mr. Rajapaksa said commitments, sufferings, travails and tribulations of Sri Lankan tri-forces during the war should be transcribed to literature in order to commemorate the war heroes at a time when they are being discriminated. (Piyumi Fonseka)
