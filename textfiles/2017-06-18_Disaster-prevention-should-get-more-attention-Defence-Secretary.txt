Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said disaster prevention should get more attention rather than focusing on post disaster work.

Addressing the discussion 'Managing and mitigating the threat of natural disasters in Sri Lanka' organized by the Institute of National Security Studies held at the ministry, Mr. Hettiarachchi highlighted the improvements in rescue and relief operations during the recent floods.

The aim of the discussion was to bring together all the relevant stake holders, in order to manage and mitigate the risk component of future disasters in the country.

One of the main key areas that were focused during the meeting was the implementation of an Early Warning System as a mechanism for disaster risk reduction. Additionally, matters related to building of illegal settlements near flood-prone areas, de-forestation and sand-mining were discussed at the meeting.

Effects of the natural disasters including the recent floods and counter implementing measures were also discussed during the meeting.

The Defence Secretary offered his expertise as an engineer, which would assist to prevent or to minimize floods and landslides in future.

Senior officials of the relevant institution, senior military officers, Director General of the INSSSL and officials of the INSSSL were also present at the occasion. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
