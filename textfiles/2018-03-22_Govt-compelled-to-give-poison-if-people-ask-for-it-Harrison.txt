We would be compelled to provide them with poisonous synthetic fertilizer as a Government if the people demand so to increase their harvests, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P Harrison said.

Addressing an event in Thalawa Divisional Secretariat the minister said the Government took a decision to reduce the usage of synthetic fertilizer as a solution to the kidney disease and to direct the farmers on organic fertilizer.

However, he said at the recently held Local Government Election the people had given a message to the Government to provide the synthetic fertilizer which causes kidney diseases instead of the organic fertilizer.

“Nearly 100,000 people affected with kidney disease due to glyphosate. Yet the people taught us a lesson that they want it and will not vote for us if not. Therefore we had decided to give synthetic fertilizer from next ‘Yala’ Season for Rs 500,” he said.

He further said that as the government it was helpless as the people oppose any action initiated for their own safety. (Dayaratne Abogama)
