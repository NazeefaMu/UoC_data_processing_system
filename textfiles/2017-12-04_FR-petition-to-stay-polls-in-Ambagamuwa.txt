FR petition to stay polls in Ambagamuwa


	

T.D. Nandarasa, a former member of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court today seeking an order to prevent elections being held to the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha (PS).

He said the Ambagamuwa PS had been divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas of Norwood, Ambagamuwa and Maskeliya and that this would lead to ethnic clashes.

Mr. Nandarasa said the new demarcation had affected the ethnic composition and in this process the rights of Sinhala Buddhists had been violated. (Ranjan Katugampola and Manopriya Gunasekara)
