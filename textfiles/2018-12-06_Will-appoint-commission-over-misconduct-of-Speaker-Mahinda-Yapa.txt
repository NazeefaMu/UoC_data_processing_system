A commission would be appointed to look into the alleged undemocratic actions taken by the Speaker, the Parliament General Secretary and the Sergeant-at-Arms when they are elected to office, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said today.

Addressing a news briefing, he alleged the Speaker, the Parliament General Secretary and the Sergeant-at-Arms had acted in violation of the Constitution, the Standing Orders and the Parliamentary tradition.

“They should be held responsible for the commotion created in Parliament. If the Speaker had acted in line with the Standing orders and the Parliamentary tradition, recent tense situations in Parliament would have not been created,” the MP said.

He said the Sergeant-at-Arms had also not acted in a responsible manner in carrying the mace into parliament on the day when the Speaker entered parliament from a side door.

“The recent Parliamentary sessions were not held in a legal manner and that’s why we thought of boycotting the sessions. It was apparent that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was very much partial to the UNP and always trying to act according to the tunes of the UNP,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
