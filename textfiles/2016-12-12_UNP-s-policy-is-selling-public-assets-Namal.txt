UNP’s policy is selling public assets: Namal


	

MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday claimed that selling public assets regardless of its consequence was a cornerstone of UNP’s policy and added that they had never built the Hambantota harbour and the Mattala airport to be privatized.

Issuing a statement, Mr. Rajapaska said the SLFP members of the government who claimed to be following Bandaranaike polices were not doing anything while state assets are being sold off.

“The SLFP ministers claimed that they are anti-UNP and trying to prove this by publicly criticising the UNP. But this is only an attempt to deceive the SLFP voters. While pretending to be opposed to the UNP, the SLFP ministers voted for the VAT Bill, the Office of Missing Persons Bill, and the UNP favoured budget,” he said.

Meanwhile, commenting on the assault on the journalist at the Hambantota harbour, he said the whole country had witnessed the manner in which a party, led by the Navy Commander dispersed harbour workers who were demanding job security and opposing privatisation of the Hambantota port.

“The protestors were unarmed and did not attack the naval personnel with sticks or stones or hurled petrol bombs. Yet warning shots were fired, and protestors were attacked with rifle butts. The Navy Commander himself was seen threatening protestors and physically attacking and abusing a journalist using obscene language,” he said.

He said the UPFA General Secretary and the UNP Deputy Leader; both Cabinet ministers representing the Hambantota district did not defend the workers.
