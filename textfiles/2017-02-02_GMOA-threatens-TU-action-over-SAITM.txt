GMOA threatens TU action over SAITM


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today threatened to resort to major trade union action next week if its demands with regard to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe were not addressed.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a media briefing that the GMOA took this decision following the unanimous approval of its Central Committee.

He said the GMOA would inform President Maithripala Sirisena and other relevant authorities to intervene in the matter in the coming days.

“The Court of Appeal on Tuesday directed the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register medical degree holders of the SAITM. It was the result of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s irresponsible behaviour and his SAITM-biased stand,” he alleged.

He said the timely need was to secure the patients' lives and added that the GMOA would stand to protect their lives at any cost. He also said nobody would prefer to get treated by a doctor whose standard was questionable.

He said the health minister should amend his attitude towards this matter; “We will give a week's time to all these authorities to provide us with a solution. On the other hand, we have complete faith on the judicial system that it would not allow to legalize an institute which has being disapproved by the SLMC,” he added.

Meanwhile, GMOA media spokesman Dr. Naveen de Soyza said discussions were ongoing among several internationally recognized institutes and the GMOA on this matter.

He said they would create a strong force to fight against this matter and added that discussions would be held with state university students, parents and several unions during this week. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
