S. Thomas' College (STC) in Mount Lavinia will not be affected by the Colombo Marine Drive extension project, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.

He said this in response to a question asked by MP S.M. Marikar in the House last morning.

“We will use new technology and save S. Thomas' grounds when constructing the marine drive,” the minister said.

The minister said the decision whether to extend the marine drive from Dehiwala to Panadura would be taken after a feasibility study by two consultation companies which had been chosen for this purpose. (Yohan Perera)
