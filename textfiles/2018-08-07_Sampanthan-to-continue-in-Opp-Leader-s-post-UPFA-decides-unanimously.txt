Party leaders of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) unanimously decided yesterday that the Opposition Leader's post in Parliament should be further held by R. Sampanthan.

According to political sources, the parliamentarians of the Joint Opposition are a group who contested for the election under United People’s Freedom Alliance. Despite the fact that the UPFA acts as government supporters, a member of UPFA should not be given the post of opposition, as decided by the UPFA.

This decision has been taken by the UPFA party leaders at a meeting held under the patronage of the President yesterday.

Meanwhile, UPFA General secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said he had sent the party's official decision to the Speaker. The Speaker's office also acknowledged receipt of the letter. (Nalaka Sanjeewa Dahanayaka)
