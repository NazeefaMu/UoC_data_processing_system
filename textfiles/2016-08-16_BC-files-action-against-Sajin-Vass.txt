The Bribery Commission (BC) today filed action against Sajin Vass Gunawardena, ex-MP and ex- CEO of budget airline Mihin Lanka, for entering into an illegal contract worth Rs.883 million with a Singaporean company to obtain ground handling equipment for the airline.

A spokesperson for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption said charges were filed at the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court under case No:58311.

Investigations had revealed that Mr. Gunawardena had entered into the three-year contract with Singaporean Company PPL Inter Private Limited in September 2015 for the supply of ground handling equipment to the airline.

Mr. Gunawardena as the then CEO was not only liable for not following correct tender procedure to seek services from the foreign company but had also disregarded responses from three other companies that showed a willingness to supply such equipment.

Mihin Lanka had placed an advertisement in the paper calling for the expression of interests for the particular services and three other companies had responded.

It was also revealed that Mr. Gunawardena had failed to state any specific reasons for granting the contract to the mentioned company. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
