She was a source of support for everybody


	

The certainty of death has taken from us our friend Karin Ramachandra. 


My first meeting with her was when I oversaw the Cathedral Institute. I invited her to teach our students counseling as they walked the journey of priesthood. My second meeting with Karin was under tremendously traumatic circumstances when I was in hospital for six months and she visited me with bottles of homemade fruit juice. This was significant and touched me a lot during a time of immense ordeal.


Karin also used to assist me and my daughter with our own personal issues. She came to our home regularly to meet with us and was a constant source of support for my daughter. 


My final meeting with Karin was when I was a member of the clergy at St. Paul’s Milagiriya. I made it a point to meet with her after service to learn more about her journey from Denmark to Sri Lanka, how she became a Christian, and how she met and married Vinoth. My late wife and I had known Vinoth for over three decades since my days as the Chaplain of the Peradeniya University Chaplaincy. Their marriage was a true testimony of Christian love.  


As a mark of respect to Karin, the monthly meeting of our Inter-Church fellowship was postponed because of her funeral. That spoke volumes about her commitment to ecumenism.


I am sorry to have missed Karin’s funeral. However, my son-in-law and daughter attended the service. Vinoth and all those near and dear to her can be certain of my continued love and concern. May Karin’s soul rest in peace and rise in glory. Amen.
