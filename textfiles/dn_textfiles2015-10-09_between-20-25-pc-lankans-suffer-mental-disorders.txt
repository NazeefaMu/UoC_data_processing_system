Between 20 to 25 pc Lankans suffer from mental disorders

Between 20 to 25 percent of the Sri Lankan population suffer from various mental disorders. The majority suffer from minor mental disorders, while others suffer from serious mental sicknesses, a Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the statistics were released following a recent survey.
Annually, around 8,000 patients are admitted to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Mulleriyawa and 1,000 of them receive in-house long term treatment.
A 24 hour emergency treatment unit is available at the NIMH for violent patients suffering from serious mental sicknesses.
Several programmes have been arranged in Sri Lanka to mark World Mental Health Day which falls today. A seminar was held for the media on October 5 at the NIMH, while a kite festival, street dramas and a walk were held in Colombo yesterday.
An educational programme organised to mark the day will be held today.
A public exhibition, a creations fair and educational programmes for schoolchildren will be held tomorrow. The creations are by in-house patients of NIMH.
The public can visit the hospital on Monday and obtain first hand experience on the day to day life at the hospital. An education programme has been organised for the health staff on October 13, he added.
Meanwhile, volunteer workers at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital during the 30 year conflict, have been confirmed on the directive of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
Dr. Senaratne said another 38 workers attached to Thelippalai Hospital were allowed to continue in their positions.
"All health workers in state hospitals during the war will be confirmed in their positions as they served the people while health staff from Colombo could not reach them," he told a recent ceremony.
