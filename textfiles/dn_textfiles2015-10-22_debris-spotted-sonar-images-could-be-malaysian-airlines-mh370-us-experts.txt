'Debris' spotted on sonar images could be from Malaysian Airlines MH370: US experts

AUSTRALIA: Australian authorities searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 may have missed the wreckage as they canvassed search sites off the coast of Western Australia, American deep-sea investigators have claimed.
US firm Williamson & Associates said sonar images captured in two previously searched sections of the Indian Ocean appear to show "probable aircraft debris fields" that should be investigated more closely using an unmanned deep sea vessel.
The $90 million official underwater search operation spearheaded by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau - the most expensive in aviation history - has found no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which went missing with 239 passengers and crew during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014.
But Williamson & Associates said the images of the southern Indian Ocean floor released by the ATSB in October bore a striking similarity to the underwater debris field Air France Flight 447 left on the Atlantic Ocean floor when it crashed in 2009, killing all 228 passengers and crew. Williamson & Associates was one of the rejected bidders for the contract to search for MH370.
The firm "believes the target [sonar images] bears the hallmarks of a classic high-impact debris trail similar to other wrecks it has located", according to a research paper released Tuesday.
"These targets have the characteristics of man-made metal parts with circular surfaces and with greater hardness than scattered rocks," it claimed.
"It's an anomaly that needs to be investigated further - to us it has all of the hallmarks of being a debris field," Williamson and Associates special projects manager Rob McCallum told SBS News.
The ATSB provided the images of the two sites as part of an update in which it also said a re-scan of the areas indicated they were not related to MH370.
The debris field was 700m by 250m, slightly larger than the 600m by 250m debris field of the Air France wreckage in the South Atlantic in June 2009, WIlliamson and Associates said. Experts involved in past deep-water searches have said the hunt could easily miss the plane because the Dutch company operating the search ship Furgo Discovery was using inappropriate technology and inexperienced personnel for the highly specialised task.
Other experts said the ATSB could have instead used an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to resurvey the sites. An AUV provides the most accurate search readings but cannot be deployed in rough winter weather.
The ATSB rubbished the claims, labelling Williamson & Associates' conduct "unprofessional" and distressing for family members of people who were aboard the plane.
An ATSB spokesman said the objects had been discounted by a series of specialists due to their similarity to geological formations in the broader search area.
"Based on analysis of all of the data, there are no indications that there is anything possessing the characteristics of an aircraft debris field," ATSB said in a statement.
