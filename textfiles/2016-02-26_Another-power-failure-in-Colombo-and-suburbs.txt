A day after the four-hour countrywide blackout, another sudden power failure was reported from several areas in Colombo and its suburbs, said officials of the CEB area engineering offices.

They said the power supply to some areas in Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Attidiya, Kawdana, Piliyandala, Ratmalana, Matugama, Panadura, Borupana and Maharagama had broken down.

The Western Province (South) Deputy General Manager speaking to Daily Mirror, said arrangements were being made to restore power supplies in some two hours.

“The cause of the power failure has still not been determined and also whether there is any connection between today’s power failure and yesterday’s countrywide power failure,” an official said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
