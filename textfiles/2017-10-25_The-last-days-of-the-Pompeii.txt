The last days of the Pompeii


	



 

Worse days are in the offing for the once high-flying Colombo-based Green politico who is now being roundly blamed for tainting the yahapalanaya, they say.

 


The man now down and out seems to draw hardly any sympathy from any quarter for he had in his hay day rubbed most high-ups from both strands of the unity rule on the wrong side. By the way, reports say that a probe into his assets has already been launched on the instructions of the highest echelons and what they had already uncovered had many an eye popped out with disbelief, they say.


A file containing incriminating evidence relating to a mega deal that the man had clinched with an accomplice from a neighboring small country is said to be now in the possession of a top authority in yahapalanaya.
