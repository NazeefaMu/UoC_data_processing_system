The Mirror For Hope asked some well-known faces about things that make them happy, or why the media should focus on positive news happening around them : 

 

 



I’m glad that the  has come forward to do this page. There has been a culture created to focus only on negative news, and this could make us a sick nation. I feel that there’s a demand among people to listen to negative news. I see that a lot of irrelevant things are being reported through the media. We have a lot of positive stories happening around us but they don’t get the necessary attention. By reporting positive news items it helps to stimulate people to do more good things.” – Kishu Gomes, Corporate Personality

 



“A few things that keep me happy include spending time close to nature, visiting beautiful places in Sri Lanka and meeting new people and exploring new destinations, walking on the beach, working out/yoga, creating new things, brands and designs. I also like changing lives of both animals and people.” – Otara Gunewardene, Nature Lover, Entrepreneur and Founder of Passion – Embark
