JO wants PSC on COPE report


	

The Joint Opposition today urged the government to appoint a special Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to monitor the progress of the action taken by the Attorney General (AG) into the COPE report on Central Bank (CB) Bond sale issue.

JO stalwart MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the AG had proved to be inefficient when it came to certain cases and therefore it was vital to ensure that action was taken against the perpetrators.  

“A PSC has the authority to summon the AG or the IGP and inquire into the progress of the investigations of COPE report. Otherwise, there is a risk of the report being put aside,” the MP told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
