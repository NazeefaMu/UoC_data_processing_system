A seat too hot for even family members


	



 

A state-run body handling public transport in a certain province got its fifth successive head since the yahapalanaya took office in 2015. 

 


The person appointed as the latest head of the authority is said to be the brother-in-law of the purohita in charge of the subject of public transport.


The first appointee to this post under yahapalanaya was the purohita’s son-in-law. He quit the job saying that the father-in-law was interfering too much. He was succeeded by a bus magnate. He too did not last long in the post. The third appointee was a former commissioner for co-operatives. He had to go to make way for a close buddy of a onetime powerful politician. The fourth one too was eventually removed for unknown reasons.


Soon after occupying the hot seat, the politico’s brother in law had reportedly confessed that he could not say for sure how long he would be able to function in this post.
