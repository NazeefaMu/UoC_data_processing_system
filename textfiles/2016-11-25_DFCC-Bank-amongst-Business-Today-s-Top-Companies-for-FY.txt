DFCC Bank was felicitated as one of the Best Performing Public Quoted Companies in Sri Lanka at the 2015/16 Business Today Top 30 Awards, at an august ceremony recently held at The Hilton Colombo. DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando received the award from Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. 
Ranked at No. 21, DFCC Bank demonstrates its resilience through its diverse commercial and development banking operations. Business Today Top 30 is an annual listing based on published information of companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) for the financial year ended December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, in collaboration with KPMG Sri Lanka. 
Commenting on the accolade, Fernando said, “We are honoured to be counted among the Top 30 Best Performing Public Quoted Companies in Sri Lanka for 2015/16 by Business Today. DFCC is a fully-fledged commercial bank offering the full gamut of consumer banking services. We are proud of how the bank has evolved from being a development bank assisting enterprises of all sizes, into a commercial bank in line with the changing needs of consumers and the country, not only maintaining but also growing the longer tenor, more risky project lending portfolio. 
Our growth story in the recent past is a result of our tenacity and the aggressive digitization drive we have embarked on to deliver technology-backed solutions to enhance customers’ lives. We are focused on delivering financial technology solutions to strengthen our consumer banking products and services. Consumer banking will be a key driver going forward and our customers can expect many more technology-backed solutions from DFCC Bank to simplify their lives. We are buoyed by the future prospects for the bank as we forge ahead and are confident about unlocking further potential of this reputed institution.”
