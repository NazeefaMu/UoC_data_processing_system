The removal of the walking path of the Vihara Maha Devi Park situated in the heart of Colombo was only a periodical renovation, the Municipality said yesterday rejecting reports that attempts were being made to remove the path altogether.

Municipality’s Commissioner V.K. Anura said there was nothing strange in renovating the walking path which is worn out.

“We repair buildings which need improvements. Other properties including roads are also being renovated on a regular basis. The renovation of the walking path at the Vihara Maha Devi Park is also such a renovation,” the Commissioner told Daily Mirror.

He said the renovation of the path, which was constructed three years ago, is being carried out from the funds belonging to the Municipality and assured no special contract had been granted to carry out the project.

The park was given a face lift with jogging tracks and walking paths installed for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) held in Colombo in 2013. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
