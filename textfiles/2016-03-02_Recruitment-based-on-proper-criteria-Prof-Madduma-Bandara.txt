Amid the controversy over Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella recommending the appointment of a lecturer, Kelaniya University Vice Chancellor Prof. Sunanda Madduma Bandara said the university authorities had often received similar letters and it was nothing new.

However, he said the university authorities had to adhere to the propper recruitment criteria despite such recommendations from politicians.

“I do not know why there is a hue and cry about this letter. As university administrators, we constantly experience this. After job interviews, interviewees turn to politicians for favours. Then, these politicians issue recommendation letters. It has happened right throughout. There are also telephone calls. Yet, appointments are made in line with the accepted criteria only,” Prof. Madduma Bandara said. (Kelum Bandara)
