Accompanied by his wife Jayanthi Pushpa Kumari and other Sri Lankan officials, Sirisena reached Tirupati from Bengaluru by road.

After an overnight stay, he and his family were expected to participate in 'Suprabhatha" recitation ritual inside the temple early today, temple sources told PTI.

He would leave soon after offering prayers to Lord Venkateswara, the sources said.

This is his third visit to the Tirumala hills as Sri Lankan president. He previously visited in February 2015 and last year in August.
