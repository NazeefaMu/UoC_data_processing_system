Move forward with January 8 victory: CBK
	
	Breaking her silence, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, today in a statement, requested the people to vote for the candidates with integrity to help take forward the mandate given on January 8.
	She said she decided to place the country before her party at this moment.
	In a lengthy statement issued to the media, she said a silent revolution took place on January 8 in the country, and it was a victory for the establishment of democracy. Identifying herself as someone who contributed towards it, she said it was her duty to explain her standpoint at this moment.
	She said, Patriotic citizens who respect freedom and democracy, rose against the cruel oppression of the Rajapaksa regime in a harmless struggle. It enabled them to unseat this oppressive regime with the use of ballots. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa participated in this election exploiting State resources and the armed forces".
	She accused Mr. Rajapaksa of spreading racism and using religion to achieve political ends.
	Asserting that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was a party founded on democratic principles, she said the party had stood for the formation of people friendly governments.
	Ms. Kumaratunga noted that she had decided, at this juncture, to pay attention to requests made to her by many political party leaders and civil society movements. A majority wanted to bring about a change under me. Yet, I did not intend to stay in politics continuously. It is a disgraceful act for anyone to try to remain in politics after serving in the highest echelons. Unfortunately, the person that was defeated was taking time to scuttle political reforms, she said.
	I am saddened to witness the decline of SLFP seniors, and them not having the need to reorganize the party. Nonetheless, I will clarify my position to all SLFPers. It was a struggle for me to decide on whether to stay with a group undermining the noble values of SLFP or to join together with a team that has a vision and a mission to lead the country forward. After deep thought into this matter, I decided that the country should be built before the party. It is all the more important to march forward with the January 8th victory. My love and affection for the SLFP will never dissipate. I am ever committed to uphold its principles and to establish an enlightened rule.

	Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said Police Chief N K Illangakoon is expected to restore the security of more than 40 former MPs who have made a special request from the Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya during the weekend.
	Based on a request made by Mr. Deshapriya the Police Chief, the security provided to more than 40 former MPs is expected to be restored with two police constables from the Ministerial Security Division being assigned to each of them.
	The MPs' security was removed at the close of nominations.
	At a meeting with Elections Commissioner the party representatives took a collective decision on the need to restore the security provided to former MPs and to the other candidates who are contesting the election.
	However, Cabinet and Non-Cabinet Ministers will continue to have their security, regardless or whether they are contesting or not. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

	No internal inquiry was being carried out regarding the Kotahena shooting, in which gunmen fired at hundreds of people led by Minister Ravi Karunanayake during an election campaign, UNP candidate Ajith P. Perera said yesterday.
	When asked by a journalist, he said the UNP had not such power to carry out an internal inquiry though their supporters were killed and injured during the shooting.
	As a political party, we are not authorised to hold such inquiries. Therefore, we have entrusted the Police to investigate, he said.
	He said it was unnecessary for the UNP to get work from any underworld gangsters for the forthcoming general elections since the UNP was obtaining an obvious victory with at least 120 Parliamentary seats. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Badulla District UNP candidate Harin Fernando told UPFA candidate Dilan Perera that he himself would have to consume poison when the UPFA was defeated at the parliamentary election on August 18.
At a news conference held in response to the one held by the UPFA on Wednesday at which Mr. Perera had urged UNP leaders including the Prime Minister to drink poison, Mr. Fernando said UPFA members including Dilan Perera, Bandula Gunawardena and Udaya Gammanpila would have to drink poison in large quantities on August 18 when they realize that the UPFA has been defeated.
Dilan organizes media briefings and displays bottles of poison. He himself had attempted to drink poison on three occasions. I have two gallons of Polidol here with me and I invite Mr. Perera to drink it on August 18, Mr. Fernando said.
He rejected the allegations levelled against the Prime Minister, Minister Ravi Karunanayake, the Central Bank Governor and him by the UPFA and pointed out that there were several charges made against Dilan Perera by the Auditor General and the Foreign Employment Bureau.(Prasanna Padmasiri and Prasad Rukmal)

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Ministers in the present government, in a letter addressed to the President, have sought permission from the Central Committee (CC) of the SLFP to resign from their respective portfolios, the DM Online learns.
We assumed duties as Ministers following a decision by the SLFP Central Committee and we do not agree with the sporadic resignations we have witnessed without the approval of the Central Committee. It does not befit a party such as ours to do so without the approval of the CC. Hence we seek the convening of the CC to take a decision on it, the two page letter said.
The letter further details the ascension of President Sirisena as the leader of the SLFP and calls for the decisions of the party to be taken with consensus. (Sanath Desmond)

RW: Needs new Constitution
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in an interview with the Daily Mirror yesterday stated that the country needed a new Constitution.
	He said that brining amendment upon amendment to the current Constitution would be confusing and therefore serious thought should be given to the drafting of a new Constitution.
	The basic issue is that the Constitution was based on a strong Executive Presidency. So, there has to be various and far-reaching amendments in some sections. I think that will require a new Constitution, he said.
	He added that if given the mandate by the people, he would turn the country around as he had done in the past.
	Speaking about the UPFA campaign, the Premier stated that it was a campaign to give saline to the defeated President Mahinda Rajapaksa and their intention was not to save the country but to save MR.
	Now, all of a sudden, the UPFA is saying they dont want the mandate the President received, they want him to follow the man who was rejected. So, there was no chance that you could expect the President to work on those conditions with Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was just a pipedream. They have made the party bankrupt, he added.

TMC plans stir for release of fishermen from Lankan jail
	
	The Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) will stage State-wide agitation if the 14 Rameswaram fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan navy on a charge of poaching on June 2 were not released at the end of their judicial remand on August 13, party president G.K. Vasan has said.
	Addressing the fishing community at Thangachimadam near here on Tuesday, Mr. Vasan, who was on a Towards the people programme, said the fishermen were languishing in a jail for more than two months but neither the State nor the Centre bothered to secure their release.
	The partys agitation was to draw the attention of the State and Central governments to the plight of the fishing community and exert pressure on them to take steps to secure the release of the fishermen, he said.
	Referring to reports that the Lankan authorities delayed the release of the fishermen in view of the Prime Ministerial elections in the island nation, he said that the Centre should categorically tell the island nation that it should not link the fishermen release to the elections.
	Mr. Vasan who listened to the problems of fishermen by holding talks with the leaders of fishermen associations and the womenfolk before addressing the meeting, expressed anguish that political parties approached the fishermen issue with an eye on electoral gains.
	The problem should be approached in a humane way, he said, and declared that the TMC would be in the forefront in the fight to find a lasting solution to the issue.
	Mr. Vasan also appealed to the Centre to introduce Pamban Express in memory of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The late leader had appealed to the railways to introduce the express with a refrigerator coach for transporting fish from the island, while addressing the centenary celebrations of the bridge in January last, he recalled.
	Later, accompanied by district president A. Ravichandra Ramavanni and former MLAs Asan Ali and Ram Prabu, the TMC leader called on Mr. Kalams elder brother A.P.J.M. Maraikayar at the House of Kalam and enquired about his health.(The Hindu)

Underworld men brought back by Govt: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that many leading underworld figures, who fled the country during the time of his rule, had returned to the country at the behest of politicians.
About 10 or 12 of those, who had fled the country during our time, have been brought back by UNP politicians and they are actively participating in election work, the former President said during an interview held at his residence in Mirihana.
None of these people dared coming into the country during our time and we completely put a halt to the activities of the underworld. Those who were in custody and were granted bail even didnt leave the prisons during our time, but now they are all freely campaigning with the UNP politicians, he said.
He said that the Bloemendhal shooting was an example of the actions of the underworld, which had returned.
When questioned by journalists as to the allegation made by Minister Ravi Karunanayake that the shooting was the actions of the former Presidents henchmen, he replied in the negative.
What nonsense is that Thats how these people like to turn things like every other allegation of theirs. Look at what Sujeewa has said. Even he admits that the underworld has got close to their politicians.
If by any chance this happened during my time or had I even just visited a procession in which such a thing happened, everyone would have slandered me and blamed me. Thats how youll worked during my time, he said. (Hafeel Farisz)Related link
