SLFP Karandeniya organizer and former minister Gunaratne Weerakoon said he had decided to resign from the post of SLFP organizer due to personnel reasons.

He said he was first appointed as Karandeniya organizer by Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1991 and that he could no longer work in the position after his defeat at the last parliamentary election.

 “I have no courage to carry out the duties of the organizer after the defeat at the last parliamentary election. I cannot perform the duties and responsibilities expected by the party. So I decided to resign as the organizer to the Karandeniya electorate. I have sent my resignation to SLFP chairman, President Maithripala Sirisena and General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake,” he said.
