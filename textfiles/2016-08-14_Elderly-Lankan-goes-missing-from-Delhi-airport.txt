An elderly Sri Lankan pilgrim has gone missing after landing at Delhi's IGI airport along with Buddhist pilgrims, police said today.

Ramanayaga Mudiyanselage Jayasekara, in his late 60s or early 70s, is a resident of Sri Lanka's Mahiyangana town. He had arrived at the T-3 Terminal of the IGI airport from Colombo at 6.45 PM on Thursday along with a group of around 80 pilgrims but was later found missing, they said.

"The information about the man was conveyed to concerned departments and agencies and efforts are on to search him," Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI) DK Gupta said. Jayasekara was last seen near gate number 18 of the airport in the CCTV footage but there was no further clue regarding his whereabouts, police said.

The pilgrims were scheduled to stay at a Sri Lankan facility in Civil Lines area. When they boarded two buses, everyone thought he was in the other vehicle. But as they reached Civil Lines, Mr Jayasekara was found missing.

Police said that the missing person was in the habit of drinking alcohol and cannot speak English or Hindi.(NDTV)
