	Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne has rejected Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe's allegations that Dr. Senaratne was found guilty of importing substandard drugs.
	Addressing a public rally at Polegoda in Bulathsinghala, he said he did not have any personal animosity against Minister Rajapakshe and that he had a cordial discussion with him at the recent cabinet meeting.
	“He remained silent at the cabinet meeting when I mentioned the Avant Garde controversy. But he gives interviews to the media. He had told the media that I was found guilty of importing substandard drugs and lost my parliamentary membership. It is absolutely false. Justice Mahanama Tilakaratne who heard the case held that it was a fabrication and exonerated and acquitted me. His judgment ran into 400 pages. Minister Rajapakshe should have read the judgment. He has accused me of procuring medical equipment. This is another false allegation. I was victimized by filing false charges against me for criticizing the government. However, It was Minister Rajapakshe who appeared for the cases of the government and earned money. Medical equipment is procured by import companies under a contract with the government. He has accused me of issuing a letter to Avant Garde company requesting for employment to some individuals. If a supporter requests a letter of recommendation for employment I comply with such a request. I am also in possession of similar letters issued by Minister Rajapakshe,” Minister Senaratne said.
