The Green party activists in an upcountry district met for a discussion in the salubrious city quite recently.

 


The party high-up representing the district chaired this meeting. Who is going to be the party candidate at the coming big poll was the question many participants raised at this meeting.


The activists expected an answer to this question from their leader himself notwithstanding a recent official party announcement that a choice is yet to be made.


The district chief hinted three names -his own and those of two others known to have been long time aspirants. He added: 


“But, there is also the possibility of the candidate being someone occupying a much higher position!”
