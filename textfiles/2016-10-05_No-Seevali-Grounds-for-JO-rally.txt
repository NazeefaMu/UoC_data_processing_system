The Ratnapura Municipal Council has informed that it is unable to release the Seevali Grounds for the joint opposition rally on Saturday, UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi said.

She said the decision was regrettable because all preparations had been made for the public rally.

“The Municipal Commissioner has not given any reason for making such a decision. All he said was that the grounds cannot be released,” the MP told Daily Mirror and added that the rally would now have to be held near the Ratnapura Clock Tower.

She said all JO MPs including Dinesh Gunawrdena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs who support former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa were expected to attend the rally.

When contacted by Daily Mirror, Municipal Commissioner M.W. Kulathilaka said a decision had been taken by the Council previously not to release the grounds for any political rallies as it would damage the grounds which had been developed for holding sports events.

“The Council has made a decision not to allow any political rally, musical show or other rallies which would damage the Seevali grounds. However, only state functions would be permitted there," he said.

Meanwhile, he said an area where lorries were parked has been provided as an alternative. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
