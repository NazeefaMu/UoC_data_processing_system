A pub that has become a nuisance hub!


	



 

There is a pub run by a sidekick of a powerful politico in a ‘Kandiya’ area in Digamadulla and the disorderly conduct of the tipplers who frequent this pub has become a nuisance to the children of two schools who must walk past this pub daily, they say.

 


Ugly scenes of drunken tipplers fighting and trading obscenities are a regular feature on the road opposite the pub and it is the school children who are mostly affected by this rowdyism.


Residents in the area say that those responsible for maintaining law and order in the area have turned a blind to this blatant public nuisance.
