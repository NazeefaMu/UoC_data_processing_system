"Christmas shopping is universally a family activity, and Arpico recognises this by pulling out all stops to ensure that we have something for everybody," said Minodh de Sylva, Head of Marketing at Richard Peiris Distributors. "Our Christmas shopping promotions are inspired by the same concept, and this year, we offer our shoppers a chance to win truly thrilling overseas visits, which the whole family can enjoy."

The promotion encompasses all Arpico Supercentres, Arpico 'Daily' Supermarkets and Showrooms in Sri Lanka, he said.
Décor at Arpico retail outlets reflect the theme of a 'thrilling Christmas' and seek to evoke the atmosphere of the theme parks to which trips can be won. A series of in-store promotions and competitions at which instant gifts can be won in December is also on the cards, the company said.
