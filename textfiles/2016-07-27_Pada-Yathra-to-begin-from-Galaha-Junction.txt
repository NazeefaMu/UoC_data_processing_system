The Joint Opposition said today that they would commence their scheduled Pada Yathra from Galaha Junction tomorrow morning while respecting the court order not to conduct the protest march within the Kandy city limits.

Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said their protest march would begin from the Galaha Junction, Peradeniya at 9.00 am tomorrow morning.

“The government obtained the court order through the police to obstruct our protest march stating that it would inconvenience the people. We decided to change the venue respecting the court order,” he said.

Mr. Aluthgamage said they had carried out religious observances at the Dalada Maligawa this evening with the participation of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. (Ajith Siriwardana)
