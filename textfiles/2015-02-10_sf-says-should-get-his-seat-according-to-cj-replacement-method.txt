SF says should get his seat according to ‘CJ replacement method’


	

Commenting on the loss of his parliamentary seat, General Sarath Fonseka today said it should be given back to him in a manner similar to the reinstatement of former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake and was even prepared to go to Court on this matter because President Maithripala Sirisena had cleared him of all ‘bogus’ allegations.
“The Government decided that the impeachment of Dr. Bandaranayake was null and void and as such should be reinstated in her post. Similarly there are no allegations against me either and my rights, privileges and decorations were restored to me. Therefore, I too must have access to my parliamentary seat. This is how we perceive this issue,” he said.
General Fonseka said MP Jayantha Ketagoda had vowed to relinquish his seat, but was backing out with various reasons though the Elections Commissioner and the Attorney General had informed Mr. Ketagoda that he could resign and make way for him to enter Parliament.
However, he said he would not beg for his parliamentary seat.
“The seat is only valid for a short time. We aren’t asking for the seat to get vehicle permits or other VIP privileges. But our party members will be pleased if we are given back this seat because we too played a role in the victory of this Government,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja
