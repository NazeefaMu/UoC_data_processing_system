The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today the controversial South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was illegal and was established in a ‘stubborn’ manner in 2009.

PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said in 2011 the then Higher Education Minister issued a gazette notification granting medical-degree-awarding status to SAITM with conditions.

“SAITM has failed to prove in writing that they have fulfilled the required conditions though the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had asked for documentary proof in March 2015. But in the absence of the required documentary proof the gazette notification has been nullified and the university has been operated illegally,” he told a news conference.
