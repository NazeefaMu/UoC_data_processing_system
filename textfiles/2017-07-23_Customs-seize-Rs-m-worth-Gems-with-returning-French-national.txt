A French national who tried to smuggle in several precious stones worth at Rs.11.5 million on his return trip to Sri Lanka from Dubai was apprehended by the Customs officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) this morning.

The 65-year-old foreigner had been intercepted when he had attempted to pass the Customs checking through the ‘Green Channel’ and found 61 cartons of Dubai made Gold Leaf cigarettes and nine bottles of whiskey in his possession.

The Customs officials who found the illicit items had further searched him to find three Yellow Sapphires in his trouser pocket and one Blue Sapphire concealed in one of his shoes.

Customs Spokesman DDC Sunil Jayaratne told the Daily Mirror the French national who was living in Sri Lanka on a resident visa had left the country for Dubai on Thursday, July 20 and had returned yesterday morning around 9.40 on Emirates flight EK 2572.
