Let us gain some practical tips to help us cultivate a life of prosperity during these present times where peace is lacking.   

Janmashtami is the birthday of Lord Krishna and is celebrated with great enthusiasm by Krisha devotees. It is believed that Lord Vishnu reincarnated in the form of Lord Krishna on the auspicious day of Janmashtami. The verses in the Bhagavad-Gita state that whenever there is predominance of evil and decline of religion Lord Krishna will reincarnate as a human and eradicate evil and preserve the good. The main significance of Janmashtami is to encourage goodwill and to discourage bad. Krishna Jayanti also celebrates togetherness. The holy occasion brings people together, thus it signifies unity and faith. Every aspect of Krishna’s life is captivating no matter whether it is of an infant Krishna, Krishna’s life in Gokul, Krishna’s romance with Radha or assassination of cruel King ‘Kans`. A person who is spiritual never asks for material things. A deity wants his devotees to be conscious of their stage of inner spirit. Devotees are expected to use their will power to cultivate divine values for a prosperous life.

Thushyanthy presents the story of Lord Krishna when he entered the arena to confront the cruel king Kans. 

Culture and tradition are not stagnant in its form and expanse. Just like pollen grains are taken around by the wind, culture, tradition and art forms have reached every corner of the world through its migrant diaspora. 

This has paved way for the creation of many traditional artists outside their origin. These artists go through stringent and rigorous training in their respective art forms irrespective of being in one place. And through this art form and training they get closer to their roots and become ambassadors of that art form and culture. This is the story of Thushyanthy and Gayathri who are management professionals continuing their passion for dance through variety of performances.   

Recital on September 2 (Sunday) at Saraswathy Hall, No.75 Lorenz Road, Colombo 4, commencing at 6 pm.
