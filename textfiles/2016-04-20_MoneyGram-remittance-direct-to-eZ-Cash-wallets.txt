eZ Cash, Sri Lanka’s first and largest mobile money and payment service announced the launch of direct to mobile inward remittance in partnership with MoneyGram this month.
The groundbreaking partnership between eZ Cash and MoneyGram provides over 14 million mobile subscribers on Dialog, Etisalat and Hutch mobile networks with the facility to receive foreign remittances direct to their mobile phone from over 200 countries and territories served by the MoneyGram network. 
The recipient of an inward foreign remittance will be notified of the remittance along with an eight digit PIN code. The recipient could then receive the funds direct to an eZ Cash mobile wallet by dialling #111# and selecting the MoneyGram service option and entering the PIN number.
The partnership between eZ Cash and MoneyGram provides recipients instant access to inward remittances at any time of day and anywhere in Sri Lanka. Money received into the eZ Cash wallet via MoneyGram, can be utilized immediately by the eZ Cash customer to transfer funds to another eZ Cash customer, pay utility bills or pay for goods and services across a 20,000 strong merchant network. The eZ Cash customer is also bestowed with the convenience of withdrawing the funds at any one of over 20,000 eZ Cash merchant outlets across Sri Lanka or via the 400 plus eZ Cash accredited Commercial Bank ATMs. 
MoneyGram, an acclaimed global money remittance service provider, is present in over 200 countries and territories, giving users world-wide a fast and convenient way to send money. Through this partnership with eZ Cash, customers now have added convenience and access to a wide range of services using their mobile wallets. 
“We are proud to partner MoneyGram in delivering cutting-edge convenience to eZ Cash customers – now enabling them to receive foreign remittance direct to their mobile phone. This innovation broadens the value addition eZ Cash – Sri Lanka’s largest Mobile Payment Network brings to Sri Lankan citizens across the country. We are most appreciative of the progressive policies and ongoing support and encouragement of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka which enabled the launch of direct to mobile foreign remittance services. We will continue to innovate in the space of financial inclusion leveraging mobile technologies and look forward to growing our partnership with MoneyGram,” stated Dialog Axiata PLC Vice President Digital Services Fariq Cader. 
“As convenience of our customers is our utmost priority, we give them a choice - of how they want to receive money from all over the world,” – said MoneyGram Senior Regional Director South Asia and GCC Countries Kaushik Roy.
“Thanks to the partnership with Dialog, our customers in Sri Lanka can now receive not only cash but they can also get money directly into their eZ Cash accounts. Our digital self-service channels are growing at more than 60 percent year-on-year, bringing our customers closer to their friends and family.”
There are no added charges for receiving money via MoneyGram. eZ Cash customers wishing to avail themselves of the inward remittance facility are required to register for a eZ Cash power wallet which provides the convenience of receiving remittance up to the value of Rs.25,000 direct to an eZ Cash wallet.
