Daily Mail/10 February 2017- The United States dispatched two B-2 bombers to destroy two ISIS camps in the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration.   


Dozens of ISIS operatives were said to have been killed in the bombing, which targeted the camps about 30 miles southwest of the coastal Libyan town of Sirte, according to CNN.   


Now those who have piloted the stealth aircraft used in the mission describe what it’s like to fly such a sortie.   


It turns out that the grueling mission entails one continuous flight that spans 32 hours and 5,700 miles for the two men inside the cockpit of a B-2, according to Popular Mechanics.   


‘Every B-2 pilot on the base wanted to go on this mission,’ an Air Force pilot identified only by the moniker ‘Scorch’ told Popular Mechanics.  

 
‘Myself included.’   
Scorch is one of the pilots based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.
