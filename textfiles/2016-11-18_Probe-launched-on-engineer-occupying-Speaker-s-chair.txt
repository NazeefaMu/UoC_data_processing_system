Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has requested Parliament Secretary General Dammika Dassanayake to conduct an investigation into the incident where his chair in the chambers was occupied by an engineer.

The parliamentarian who lodged the complaint described this as an act that had caused disrespect to the Speaker and the country.

This engineer was reported to have occupied the Speaker's chair on Wednesday evening after the day's sessions had ended issuing orders to his fellow workers. (Yohan Perera)
