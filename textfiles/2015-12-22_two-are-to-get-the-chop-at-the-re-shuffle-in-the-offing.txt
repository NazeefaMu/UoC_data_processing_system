Two are to get the chop at the re-shuffle in the offing


	


A possible Cabinet re-shuffle after January is the subject of widespread speculation in political circles these days. 
Several purohitas are to be moved out of their present portfolios in this re-shuffle, they say. Both the Big Boss and the Second in Command are said to be very unhappy about one of these purohitas. They also have received complaints about some wrong doings in a Ministry where this purohita’s son has been entrusted with some responsibilities.
Meanwhile, a government authority in the highest echelons had told a delegation from the legal profession that met him recently that he would no longer give his ear to this purohita. 
On hearing about his fall from grace, the purohita had sought forgiveness from the Big Boss, but the response he got gave him no consolation, they say. The bottom line is that his days in his portfolio are numbered!
There is another purohita who is already black-marked for his doings that had caused much embarrassment to the government top brass. He too is to be given the chop at the reshuffle in the offing, they say.
