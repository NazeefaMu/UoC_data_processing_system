India just unveiled images of what could be the world's largest solar plant.

The plant, in Kamuthi, Tamil Nadu, comes with a capacity of 648 MW and covers an area of 10 sqm/km. Prior to this, Topaz Solar Farm in California was the largest solar power plant at a single location, with a capacity of 550 MW.

The solar plant, built in an impressive eight months and funded by the Adani Group, is cleaned every day by a robotic system, charged by its own solar panels.The plant was built in 8 months and is cleaned everyday by a robotic system.

It also bears the capacity of charging its own solar panels. Furthermore, when in full swing, the plant is capable of producing electricity for 150,000 homes. The cost of this project was $$679 millions.

With this, India's total installed capacity of solar plants has nudged across the 10 GW mark. Thus, India will be the world's third-biggest solar market from next year onwards, after China and the US.

By 2022, India aims to power 60 million homes by the sun. It is part of the government's goal to produce 40 percent of its power from non-fossil fuels by 2030. The project basically aims at providing power to millions of houses in the nation, along with reducing air pollution.
