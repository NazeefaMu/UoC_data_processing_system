Facebookaholics!

We live in day and age where people spend more time on Facebook than reading the holy texts of Christianity and Buddhism. Facebook has infiltrated almost every house in the world becoming something of a god to especially the young. It is the new face of the 21st century and will continue to be a domineering presence in this world for years to come. Young people can easily access Facebook anywhere. In fact most children look forward to using Facebook more than looking forward to the second coming of Christ. Well we may not know that but what we do know is that it is a very popular form of social media. Daily News spoke to a cross section of the public to find what they think of Facebook.
It is just face value!
Rozanne Diasz Leanage, Beauty Queen, Trainer and Career Guidance Consultant and Model shared her views on Facebook with the Daily News saying that most of the posts on Facebook are contagious and addictive.
"All the advice given does not seem realistic. It is just face value. That's why it's called Facebook. It will not show what is inside of you but the outer look. Anything to do with gaining knowledge interests me. It could be about any subject. Funny stuff also amuse me also a bit of gossip which I miss out in real life and the newspapers.
There are also positive and negative features. But I do enjoy the privacy of those days too. Also there is the fact that if you don't reply people, they know you have read the message so it will look too rude if you ignore it. I use it a lot for work purpose. I do deactivate for some times and take a breather. It is influential and productive as long as you know your limits. It has a huge impact. Yes it can change the image or an idea or a perspective of some things. It has a voice! But comments and statuses should not be taken too seriously in my opinion."
No time for Facebook!
Ramani Fernando Hairstylist, says she hardly has the time to 'peep' regularly into Facebook, but enjoys seeing others happy and sees no reason to be judgmental "Posts that catch my attention are anything interesting and hearing from a long lost friend or relation. But what I despise about Facebook is character assassination. I don't think Facebook has changed my life too much since I am not addicted to it but it certainly keeps one updated. I could do without Facebook in this day and age but I certainly enjoy anything interesting whether in the newspapers, magazines, television, radio and Facebook.
Facebook is no different to any other media. There is the useful stuff and the trash. The choice is yours. But Social life to me has very little to do with Facebook. Personally I have not experienced Facebook enough to comment on whether it is changing a small part of the world we live in, but I would believe that it would have an impact on those who spend a lot of time on it and being obsessed with it."
A virtual country!
Kumar de Silva, fame of Bonsoir too commented and described Facebook as a virtual country!
"Facebook is a virtual country and it is both a very amusing and equally very dangerous place to live in. It's all about networking and that's where the catch lies - networking how and to what degree - that's where it can become narcissistic and addictive and abusive.
Since FB is a virtual country with millions of people, not everything is really authentic. A lot of "tinkering" is possible thus giving the imagination free reign with flexibility. Facebook is all about a "virtual face" and that says it all doesn't it?
FB to me is a "marketing tool". I make statements. I share posts. I upload images - all of which I think would be of interest to my FB friends. On the other hand the posts that primarily catch my attention are the more socially conscious ones. Having said that, I must say that it also enables me to keep in touch with school mates, university batch mates, and other friends and colleagues
But what I despise about Facebook are posts that are boastful. That's what sickens me. But then to each his own. In the past I managed brilliantly well without FB. It is just that it took a bit more time to reach a person. But like a pager, telephone, fax machine, mobile phone, FB is now a means of communication, and an instant one at that.
Advice given on Facebook depends from whom and where it comes. There is a lot of stalking in FB land so one needs to be very cautious. There are times when I actually de-activate my FB account and take a break from it. It's like leaving FB country and going away on holiday and being away from it. And then I have people phoning and texting me asking - 'what happened' - some genuinely and some others not."
Platform for social change
Vraie Balthazaar - TV personality & Compere felt that people paint the picture of how they want to be portrayed, on FB. Not all of it is necessarily real or true-but some of it is.
"FB is a platform for social change. There are lots of people who use FB not just to talk about what they ate, or wore, or who they hung out with-they also talk about things that are socially relevant. And it helps bring about change. Those are the posts I like to read. That being said, of course I like seeing friends I haven't seen in ten years, and re-connecting with family that don't live here in SL.
Everyone seems to be a hero on FB. Few people do much, besides putting up a post. I sometime wish people lived beyond their posts and did more. FB is an effective tool to bring about positive change. But it is also a scary place where people can spread hatred. There is a lot of racism and sexism on FB. It's frightening and the reason I was off it for over 2 years.
I was off for more than 2 and a half years, till I got back on about a month ago. I didn't really miss it to be honest. The only people who knew what was happening in my life, were those who were the closest to me. I travelled, ate amazing food, and had great times with friends and family."
Quoting Baz Luhrmann who said "be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it". Vraie feels that everyone is entitled to an opinion because many people mean well and advice is dispensed freely.
"I had a fairly negative experience on FB. And at the time, I wasn't happy to talk about it. Now, two and a half years on, I think I don't see FB in the same light as I did back then. I also learnt a few lessons on how unsafe FB can be. I realized that the system in SL, is ill equipped to deal with FB related issues and threats. There is absolutely nothing done, even when the correct steps are taken, to file a report of FB abuse. The system totally fails you. It's pretty horrific.
It is a great platform for social change. I think the purpose is to open people's minds and facilitate discussions. FB is also a great way to promote businesses too-so many entrepreneurs are now making a name for themselves."
Attention seekers!
Akhry Ameer - Freelance Multi-Skilled Professional feels that endless posting indicates that they are 'attention seeking' or 'they have nothing better to do' when they keep posting endlessly of nearly every-single activity they do.
"The posts that only catch my attention are when it is different from the day-to-day activity of socializing. I also enjoy reading shares of some news or human interest stories, but then again some of them are hoax or false posts.
For me, Facebook is my electronic diary and most of my posts are private. However, it is a very important contact tool in that, people may change telephone numbers, countries, jobs but you can reach them on Facebook. I am not that much of an ardent user, so yes I can certainly picture myself without it."
Akhry concedes that though not all posts are useful but some people do post some very interesting news, thoughts and perspectives which tends to broaden your thinking.
"So it depends, we must have the proper sense of mind to determine how useful the information can be. Today most people don't have time and have succumbed to the pressures of the modern world. I don't necessarily socialize on Facebook, but I find private messaging useful as you can carry on a conversation in bits and pieces over several days according to each others availability, especially with friends overseas."
