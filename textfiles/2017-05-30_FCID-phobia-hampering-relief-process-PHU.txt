The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is one of the main obstacles to provide relief to the victims of floods and landslides as it is slowing down the process of providing relief , the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) claimed yesterday.

It said though President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed officials to provide maximum relief to the victims without being restricted to circulars, the officials complain that they too would be summoned by the FCID for providing relief to the victims.

“In the recent past, action was taken against a presidential secretary and a number of other officials for violating circulars. One ministry secretary was remanded for 152 days. Therefore, this FCID phobia had affected the process of relief proving today as officials are afraid to take action,” PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference.

He said a government of theirs won’t take action against officials who provide relief to the people by violating circulars.

Meanwhile, expressing condolences to the victims of the floods and landslides, the MP said the prevailing calamity is more of a man-made disaster than a natural one.

“The rainfall caused havoc because the country received a large amount of rainfall within a short span of time. The Global warming is the reason for this heavy rainfall. The water gets evaporated from the sea and stored in atmosphere through condensation. Thereafter, we receive heavy rains through monsoonal winds. Our rivers and streams don’t have the capacity to hold that many rainfalls,” he said.

He said methane and carbon are the main reason for global warming. The MP said electric appliances emit carbon to the air while garbage releases methane. “When trees are cut, the source of absorbing carbon also gets terminated worsening the issue,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
