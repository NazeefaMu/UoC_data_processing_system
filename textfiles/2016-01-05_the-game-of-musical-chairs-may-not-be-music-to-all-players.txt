There is widespread speculation in political circles these days that three to four purohitas are due to be moved into new portfolios.
According to a little bird tweeting from the palace, the purohita now in charge of money supply is to take over the subject of water supply. The Green economist from Kegalle is tipped to step into the vacant money supply portfolio while the Tree party chief is to take over a lion share of the state enterprises portfolio. Meanwhile, there is talk that state banking and insurance are also to be assigned to the Green economist.
There is also a proposal to separate Buddha Sasana from Justice in which event, the incumbent might continue in the portfolio sans Justice and a new face will take over the latter subject.
