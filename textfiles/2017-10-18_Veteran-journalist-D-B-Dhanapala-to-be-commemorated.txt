Dhanapala, who entered the field of journalism as an English journalist,  helped develop journalism. His endeavouring efforts to expand the horizon of Sinhala journalism and provide accommodation for articles written in Sinhala in newspapers is remarkable.  

He joined the journalism profession as a features editor of the “Ceylon Daily News and later played a prominent role to launch the Divaina newspaper.  

He also served Kelaniya Sri Dharmaloka Vidyalaya as its principal.  

The prime role in the process of issuing the commemorative stamp has been assigned by Sri Lanka Press Council to a diploma holder in Media studies and Journalism.

This event has been organised to create an awareness in young journalists regarding the services rendered towards journalism by the  veteran journalist.  The event will also serve to create a conducive environment so there is a proper culture in journalism, in the country.

The organizers of  the event also hope that such functions will encourage young diploma holders in the field of journalism.
