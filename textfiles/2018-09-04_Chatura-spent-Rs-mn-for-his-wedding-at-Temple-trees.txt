Referring to MP Chathura Senaratne’s wedding reception held at the hall adjoining Temple Trees, Deputy Minister of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order, Nalin Bandara said the MP had paid Rs.2,180,000 (Two million one hundred eighty thousand) to reserve the hall.

He told a news briefing that there was no misappropriation of public funds because he paid for the entire cost of the wedding such as for decorations, food and beverages.

“Some MPs are claiming that public funds had been spent for the wedding. It was not so,” the deputy minister said.

“Those who make baseless allegations about this wedding, must not forget how Temple Trees was used during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.” (Sheain Fernandopulle)
