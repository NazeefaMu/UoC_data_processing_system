Analytical report on Thajudeen mobile phone

Filing an analytical report pertaining to the mobile phone which was used by former Havelocks captain and Sri Lankan ruggerite, Wasim Thajudeen, the Colombo University’s School of Computing informed Court that the concerned mobile phone was not in working order.
Submitting its report before Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris, the Colombo University’s School of Computing informed that the phone which was produced to them did not carry secondary memory card or a SIM card. The report further stated that it also observed several damages to the main system board but not relating to memory or main system chip or the circuit board.
The report further stated that the Computing Unit restored the phone to extend and facilitate the extraction of any memory only and after extracting the main memory information about SMS, images, audio, video and contacts were recovered.
Explaining about Thajudeen’s NOKIA-E72 mobile phone, the report further stated when looking to the wear and tear to the key board it was cleared that the user has utilized the keyboard extensively. This type of phone uses two different types of memory-the main phone memory and an externally pluggable memory card.
The report further stated that the bottom of the phone indicated scratch marks on both sides.
On July 27, the CID submitted to Court that the death of Sri Lankan ruggerite, Wasim Thajudeen was not an accident, but murder.
The CID had informed Court that the investigations conducted so far had revealed that Mr. Thajudeen’s teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death. The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of broken class.
The former Havelocks SC captain Wasim Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012.
Earlier the police had maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds on Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.
