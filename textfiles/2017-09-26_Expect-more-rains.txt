Hurricanes such as Maria and Irma which caused havoc in the US, the Caribbean and Turkey during the past few days have triggered high winds and heavy rains in the Bay of Bengal region including Sri Lanka, the Department of Meteorology said yesterday.

A department spokesman told Daily Mirror the sea areas in the region and around Sri Lanka will be rough. Heavy showers of up to 75mm have been forecast in the North-Eastern regions of the island.

“Hurricanes in some parts of the world are known to trigger high winds and heavy rains in other parts of the world,” Met Department sources said but ruled out any hurricanes or storms in this region.

"Fairly strong winds are expected over the country and the surrounding sea areas during the next few days particularly in the Uva and North-Western provinces and in Hambantota, Ampara, Matale, Anuradhapura and Mannar districts. Showers were also expected at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern Provinces and in the Kalutara district. The sea area from Negombo to Trincomalee via Kankasanturai and the sea area off the coast extending from Matara to Kalmunai via Hambantota and Pottuvil can be very rough at times with wind speeds of up to 60 to 70 kmph," they said.

Most areas in Sri Lanka had received a moderate rainfall of 40 mm yesterday. (Yohan Perera)
