A happy ending to a heated exchange!


	

The second in command in yahapalanaya created ripples of amusement in the House the other day when he referred to the presence of a ‘Suhada Koka’ (good-hearted stork) among them.
During the recent Budget debate, one Diyawanna member complained that another member had threatened him. This complaint triggered a racket in the House. Meanwhile, a certain senior member who had grown unusually sullen and aggressive of late joined the fray saying: “In his case, he has only been threatened. In my case, I was once beaten up.”  
“That was in the past,” said the second in command. “None would lay his hands on our ‘suhada koka’ now.”
This sally brought forth a smile from the ‘suhada koka’ himself and the argument thus ended on a happy note.
