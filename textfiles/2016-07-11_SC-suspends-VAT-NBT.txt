SC suspends VAT, NBT


	

The Supreme Court a while ago issued an interim order preventing the implementation of revisions made to the Value Added Tax (VAT) and the Nation Building Tax (NBT).

The Bench of Judges included Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Judges Buwaneka Aluvihare and Prasanna Jayawardane.

The order was issued when the Fundamental Rights petition filed by a group of Opposition MPs including Wimal Weerawansa, challenging the revisions made to VAT and NBT was taken up before the court. (S.S. Selvanayagam)
