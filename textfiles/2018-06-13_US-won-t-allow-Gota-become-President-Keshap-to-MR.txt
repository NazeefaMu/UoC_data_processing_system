United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap has reportedly shattered the political ambition of former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to become the next President of Sri Lanka.

The US envoy who is scheduled to leave Sri Lanka shortly after having completed his term of office in Sri Lanka is reported to have told Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that the US and Other western nations do not welcome the prospects of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa contesting polls and becoming president and are opposed to such a move.

The outgoing Ambassador dropped this political bombshell when he made a courtesy call to bid farewell to ex-president Rajapaksa on Sunday June 10th 2018. Courtesy- dbsjeyaraj.com
