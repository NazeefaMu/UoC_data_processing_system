At least 40 per cent of those within the Sri Lanka Army had joined after the end of the war in 2009, Kilinochchi Security Forces Commander Major General Nissanka Ranawana said.

He said this at a press briefing organized on Joint Field Exercise Cormorant Strike held at the Sri Lanka Electrical & Mechanical Engineers (SLEME) auditorium.

He said such exercises would be a platform to those who had joined the Army after the end of the war, to get an invaluable military experience.

Major General Ranawana said exercises were required to take on any future challenges against the country or its people.

“This is the largest joint military field exercise. The participants are expected to train under 20 special missions some of them similar to the missions carried out during the war. The main objective of this exercise is to share the knowledge and skills with foreign forces and experiment new techniques,” he said.

He said that the exercise would be conducted under the supervision of a Special Committee under the directives of the Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
