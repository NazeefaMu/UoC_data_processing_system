After discussing Iran and North Korea with US military leaders on Thursday, President Donald Trump posed for a photo with them before dinner and declared the moment ‘the calm before the storm’. 

 
‘You guys know what this represents?’ Trump said after journalists gathered in the White House state dining room to photograph him, first lady Melania and uniformed military leaders and their spouses.   
‘Maybe it’s the calm before the storm,’ he said.   


What storm?   
‘You’ll find out,’ Trump told questioning reporters.The White House did not immediately reply to a request to clarify Trump’s remark.   


Earlier in the evening, while seated with the top defence officials in the cabinet room, Trump talked about the threat from North Korea and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.   


‘In North Korea, our goal is denuclearization,’ he said.   


The president on Thursday also had tough words for Iran, saying the country had not lived up to the spirit of an agreement forged with world powers to curb its nuclear programme.   


A senior administration official said on Thursday that Trump was expected to announce soon he would decertify the landmark agreement.
