The Joint Opposition today lodged a complaint with the National Police Commission regarding the controversial Rajagiriya accident where a youth was injured and which involved a jeep allegedly driven by Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.

Addressing the media, opposition MP Gamini Lokuge said they made this complaint to get justice regarding this controversial accident through a proper investigative process.

“The Police have been guilty of irregularities in the investigation of this accident. The Police have recorded the arrival time of Minister’s driver to the Police station as 10pm, though the correct time of his arrival was 11 pm on 28th February. The Police also have incorrectly recorded the statements given by the eye witnesses,” said MP Lokuge.
