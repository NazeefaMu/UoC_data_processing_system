Speaker Karu Jayasuriya signed the Bill to set up the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) a short while ago, the Speaker’s Office said.

The amended draft Bill to set up the OMP was passed in Parliament on August 11 without a vote being taken.

The government assured that the findings of the OMP would not give rise to civil or criminal liability but the joint opposition said the findings could be used as evidence when the judicial mechanism is set up to hear accountability issues.
