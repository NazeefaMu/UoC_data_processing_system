UPFA parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage said today the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would be handed over to the Speaker on June 9 and that 85 parliamentarians had signed it so far.
He said about 130 MPs were expected to sign this motion before it was tabled in parliament.
Mr. Aluthgamage said this government did not have the moral right to hold office any longer and that the opposition had supported it only till the completion of the 100-day programme.
He said the government had failed to fulfil its promises even 50 days after the 100-day programme.
“This government has failed to provide any relief to the people as promised or introduce any political reforms and prove the charges of fraud and corruption as claimed before the election. It has not provided Samurdhi relief for the past two months and all the development programmes have come to a standstill,” Mr. Aluthgamage said.
He said they would launch countrywide protest campaigns to send this government home.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
