Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today imposed a travel ban on Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius, its CEO Kasun Palisena, its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado and IT Executive Sachith Devathantri after the CID filed a facts report in Court over the alleged deletion of phone call data from PTL’s voice recording system and fabricating evidence given to the Commission.

The CID had commenced an investigation upon the instructions of the Attorney General in connection with the revelation that transpired during the proceedings of the Bond Commission.

Earlier, the PTL had told the Commission that it had given all the data that it had with the voice recording system. However, after startling confessions made by PTL IT expert Sachith Devatantri and its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado before the Commission, it was revealed that there was a deletion of some voice recordings.

Subsequently, the Attorney General instructed the CID to start a criminal investigation with regard to the revelation. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
