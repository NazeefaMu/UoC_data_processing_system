Nominations for SLC elections from November 24

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said that nominations for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) elections will be accepted from November 24 till December 4.
The Sports Ministry had earlier stated that the date fixed for the SLC election is January 3 and there will be some key changes to the current Sports Law prior to the elections.
SLC is currently administered by an interim committee appointed by previous Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake on April 1 on the grounds that the government wanted to probe alleged corruption and irregularities at SLC under the previous administration headed by Jayantha Dharmadasa.
The International Cricket Council has not been in favour of a government appointed administration running cricket and had been pressing for a democratically elected governing body to be in place before the next ICC meeting scheduled for January 26.
Under pressure from international sports bodies, all the governing bodies of national sports associations and federations, including cricket, key changes had to be made to the Sports Law of Sri Lanka to conform to the constitutions of the respective world sports bodies.
"Accordingly, one of the key changes that will take place will be the controversial four-year rule which barred re-election of any official who has served four years as a major office bearer of a national sports body. The four-year rule will be removed and there will be no secret ballots, voters will have to cast their vote with a show of hands," said the Minister.
"There will be a few more amendments to the Sports Law before it is presented to Parliament in the coming weeks and by next April, all the elections of sports bodies will be conducted according to the new Sports Law which would be passed by the Parliament," the Minister said.
