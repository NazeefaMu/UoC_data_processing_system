THE HINDU, 06th MAY, 2018- Hundreds of anxious residents on the Big Island of Hawaii hunkered down on Saturday for what could be weeks or months of upheaval as the dangers from an erupting Kilauea volcano continued to grow.


Lava spurted from volcanic vents, toxic gas filled the air and strong earthquakes, including a magnitude 6.9 temblor on Friday, rocked an already jittery population. The trifecta of natural threats forced the evacuation of more than 1,700 people from communities near the lava and prompted the closure of parks, college campuses and a section of the main road through the area on the Big Island’s southern tip.


Five structures have burned and thousands of customers briefly lost power from one of the larger quakes. Tina Neal, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, warned distressed residents at a community meeting late Friday that eruptions could last longer than the ones from earlier this week, and earthquakes and aftershocks could continue for days, even weeks.
