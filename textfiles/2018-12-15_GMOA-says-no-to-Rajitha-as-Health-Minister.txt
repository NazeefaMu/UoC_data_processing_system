The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday they had requested President Maithripala Sirisena not to appoint Rajitha Senaratne as the Health Minster.

Addressing a news briefing, GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said they had requested the president for the second time in the wake of the spreading speculation that the new cabinet would be appointed on Monday (17).

Despite acquiring the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), Dr. Senaratne wasted public funds by pumping in more than Rs.250 million to the institution and pointed out that during his tenure as health minister, several wrongdoings had taken place in the tender procedure for purchasing pharmaceuticals,” Dr. Aluthge alleged.

Dr. Aluthge said the benefits he had received either directly or indirectly instead of listening to the advice proffered by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should be investigated and added that delaying to investigate actions of the former minister would allow him time to destroy or amend documents in relation to the charges.
