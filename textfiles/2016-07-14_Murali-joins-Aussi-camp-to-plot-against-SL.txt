Keen to beat Sri Lanka in its own spin game, Australia has roped in local spin great Muttiah Muralitharan to help its slow bowlers ahead of the three-test series beginning at Pallekele later this month.

The 44-year-old former off-spinner, still the highest wicket-taker in test cricket with 800 scalps, had a similar short-term consulting stint with Australia in 2014.

"Murali's got a lot of experience in Sri Lanka," Australian captain Steve Smith said. "He took a truckload of wickets.

"It's great to have someone like that helping our spinners in this series - to give us that insight. He's been really good around the group so far, and he's enjoying his time with us."
