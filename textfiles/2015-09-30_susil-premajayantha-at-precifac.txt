	Former General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Minister Susil Premajayantha arrived at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), a short while ago to record a statement over the ITN issue.
	A highly placed official of the commission said MP Premajayantha has been summoned based on a statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the PRECIFAC last week over nonpayment of outstanding bills to the ITN.
