The construction of the proposed memorial at Mullivaikkal in memory of those who were killed during the armed conflict was put off for 14 days on a court order issued by Mullaitivu Magistrate M.A. Samsudeen today.

The Magistrate issued the stay order based on a report submitted by the police. The memorial was to be erected by the Mullaitivu Catholic Voluntary Foundation.

Mullaitivu Police told court that the memorial displaying the names of 500 people who had died during the armed conflict included the names of several LTTE cardres as well.

The Police informed court that the memorial was likely to affect the law and order and the efforts to bring about reconciliation.

The Catholic Voluntary Foundation was noticed to file answers within 14 days. (Romesh Madusanka)
