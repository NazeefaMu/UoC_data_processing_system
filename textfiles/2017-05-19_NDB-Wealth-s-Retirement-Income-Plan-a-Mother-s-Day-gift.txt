We can never repay our mothers for what they have done for us, investing all of their time, effort and energy and every rupee they have, into making sure our futures are bright. And what better way to say a well-deserved ‘thank you’ to mom than with a Retirement Income Plan from NDB Wealth, which gives her the chance to spend her own retirement stress-free and in good health.
“One of the most prevalent financial fears today, shared by nine out of 10 people, is running out of money after retirement,” reveals NDB Wealth Financial Advisor Christina Wesley.
She goes on to note that a further eight out of 10 are also afraid that they will never be able to make enough to retire completely, having to continue working even into their sunset years.  So, in commemoration of Mother’s Day, help your mother set aside these common financial fears by enrolling her in a NDB Wealth Retirement Income Plan, which ensures that she not only maintains the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed but also allows her a few additional small comforts and luxuries. 
Most important of all, with the help of NDB Wealth’s expert financial advisors, setting up a Retirement Income Plan has never been simpler. All you need to do is inform NDB Wealth about how much is needed per month for your mother to live comfortably, as well as her age now and how many years of monthly payments should be planned for. 
NDB Wealth will then advise you on how much capital is needed, either as a lump sum or regular payments, to start the plan. Excitingly, income plans have the added flexibility of allowing you to withdraw your money at any time, without a penalty, while also being tax-free income for mom. Concluding, Wesley suggests, “No matter your worries and fears, the financial advisors at NDB Wealth has the exemplary expertise required to provide you with innovative and non-traditional wealth management solutions that can secure not only your long-term financial future, but that of loved ones, like your mother, as well.”
