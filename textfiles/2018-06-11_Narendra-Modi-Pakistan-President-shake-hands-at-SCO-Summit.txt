QINGDAO (CHINA), (The Hindu), 10 June 2018 - Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday shook hands with Pakistan’s President Mamnoon Hussain and had a brief chat with him at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit here.  The two leaders, attended the 18th SCO Summit, shook hands after signing of agreements between the members states of the eight nation bloc.  


Relations between India and Pakistan strained after an attack on an army camp in Uri by Pakistan-based terror organisations in 2016. The ties took a severe hit post-sentencing of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav by a military court in April last year.  


India had also boycotted the 19th SAARC Summit after the Uri attack. The summit scheduled to be held in Islamabad in 2016 was postponed.Mr. Modi held nearly half a dozen bilateral meetings with leaders of other SCO countries. However, there was no bilateral meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Hussain.
