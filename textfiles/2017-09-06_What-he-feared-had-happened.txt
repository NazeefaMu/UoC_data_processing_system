What he feared had happened


	



 

The district convention of the Blue party was held with much fanfare in the gem city recently. All party bigwigs and Diyawanna members from the district had been invited to the big event. 

 


It was the senior purohita functioning as the party’s district leader now about to take a seat in the opposition who organized the convention. 


Although the party’s big guns were invited as a matter of formality, the senior purohita wondered, the gem city being a bastion of the former strongman, whether they would get a hostile reception from the crowds at the event. So he met the party’s young secretarial one and told him: “Although I have invited you, please don’t attend our convention. Because chances are that the crowds will greet you with boos and catcalls when you rise up to address the gathering.” 


The young secretarial one heeding this advice kept away from the convention. The convention had been proceeding smoothly until another party big gun who attended the event made an acid remark about the former strongman which had drawn an instant hostile reaction from the crowds. However, he had immediately wound up his speech and quietly faded from the scene, they say.
