The former chief ‘Kapu Mahaththaya’ of the Mahasen Devalaya in Kiriwehera had given the contract to shoot the Kirivehera Chief Incumbent Ven. Damminda Thera for Rs 3 million, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.

Five suspects including the two gunmen were arrested over the weekend in connection with the shooting.

The main suspect Asela Bandara (Kapu Mahaththaya, 40) and a set of twins (24) were arrested in Pepiliyana by the Tangalle Division Crimes Investigation Unit on Saturday night while police arrested the other two suspects, 18 years old Kavishka Dilshan alias Kurulu and Hasahan Anurada alias Malli, said to be the gunmen, yesterday (17). They were hiding in a hut in a forest area near Wallimathagama along with a Galkatas and another weapon.

“Although the contract was agreed for Rs 3 million, it was yet unknown whether the contract money had been paid to the suspects,” SP Gunasekara said.

All five suspects have handed over to the Katharagama Police for further questioning.

Kiriwehera Chief Incumbent Ven. Damminda Thera and another monk were injured in a shooting that took place on Tuesday (12) and is receiving treatment at a private hospital in Colombo.

Several police teams had commenced investigations under the direction of the Tangalle Division SP Laksiri Geethal.

Following the incident, a Honda Vezel (UP CAG 8531), which had been used in the shooting, was recovered from the home of the former Kapu Mahaththaya.

Initial investigations revealed that the shooting was due to a dispute over the ownership of the Mahasen Devalaya in Kataragama.

Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera took over the management of the Mahasen Devalaya from the former Kapu Mahaththaya after the here detected funds being misappropriated from the Devalaya recently.

However, the Kapu Mahaththaya had then filed a lawsuit in court claiming ownership of the Devalaya. But the court had ruled that the Devalaya now belongs to Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera. (Darshana Sanjeewa and M. K. Nandasena)
