A 46-year-old Sri Lankan born woman with Canadian citizenship is among the identified victims killed in the Toronto incident where 10 people were killed and at least 15 were injured when a van ploughed down a crowded side-walk in Toronto, Canada on Monday.

The deceased was identified as Beatrice Renuka Amarasinghe (46), a mother of one from Horana and she had been a citizen of Canada by registration.

It was reported that the deceased had initially worked in Kuwait and later migrated to Canada and being employed in Canada for the past 17 years, she had close association with the affairs of the Toronto Buddhist Temple.

Her sister, Pushpakanthie Amarasinghe said Renuka had recently visited Sri Lanka and hoped to get dual citizenship as well. She said her sister had met with this accident when she was on her way to work after dropping her son to school.

It was also reported that arrangements are being made to have her final rites performed in Canada as she was a Canadian citizen and the Dayaka Sabah of the Toronto Buddhist Temple was awaiting the release of her remains by the Canadian authorities. (K. Buddhika Kumarasiri)
