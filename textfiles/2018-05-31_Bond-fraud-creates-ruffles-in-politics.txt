Bond fraud creates ruffles in politics


	



After it transpired that United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Dayasiri Jayaekara received one million rupees as campaign finance from Arjun Aloysius who is held responsible for the bond fraud, it stirred the hornet’s nest in politics.   

More politicos with PTL involvement? 
	All hell will break loose if such names are  revealed with veracity of allegations are proven 
Consequent to the revelation in court, news reports went viral in internet and social media saying that, in fact, as many as 118 MPs across the political divide had taken cash inducements from Perpetual Treasuries involved in frauds and irregularities in the Central Bank bond issue as a primary dealer.  

This has aroused anxiety among politically savvy people keen to ascertain who and who got money. There are names speculated. UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake made certain allegations at a press conference conducted in his house. At one point during the press conference, he took an indirect swipe at three MPs alleged to have accepted money. Instead of mentioning their names, he revealed their identities through innuendo. Actually, he referred to their facial expressions and bodily features so that people are able to make correct guesses.   

“There is one with a crimson face. The other one is a bearded, dark fellow. The third one is having a slim figure,” he said.  

No formal charges have been framed against any of them. Also, there is no allegation made against them by name in public as such. Yet, Ranjan Ramanayake’s hints may serve as grist for the mill when formal complaints are made one day.   

MP Jayasekara, who defected from the government along with 15 others MPs to sit in the opposition, is now at pain to absolve himself of any wrongdoing. He is now trying to find ways and means to put in public domain the names of others alleged to have accepted money from Perpetual Treasuries or Arjun Aloysius for that matter.   
In politics, all hell will break loose if such names are revealed with the veracity of allegations proven enough. If the allegations are true, it will be detrimental to their future politics in a big away, as most of them were elected on the plank of eradicating bribery and corruption in all their manifestations. Also, the parties that accommodate them will have to get beaten politically at the end.

Some JO members, affiliated organizations skeptical over 16-member SLFP group 
The 16-member SLFP group is trying to make overtures to the Joint Opposition. It is learnt from political sources close to the group that there is no uniform stand within it. According to sources, MPs such as Susil Premajayantha, John Amaratunga, Susantha Punchinilame and Sudarshani Fernandopulle wanted to team up with the Joint Opposition straightaway to work under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Nonetheless, the others such as S.B. Dissanayake and Dayasiri Jayasekara hold a different view. They insist on taking control of the SLFP and the SLFP- UPFA by removing Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake from their secretary posts forthwith. In fact, Minister Dissanayake tries to be the SLFP General Secretary. They continue to pledge their loyalty to President Maithripala Sirisena as the SLFP leader.  

This has incensed some members of the Joint Opposition and organizations affiliated to it. They remain skeptical about the plan of this SLFP group. It has now led to an open confrontation between the two sides.   

These members who remain with Mahinda Rajapaksa are not ready to compromise their political identity built around the lotus bud symbol of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). The SLPP, in fact, articulated in clear-cut terms that it would contest the next elections only under its lotus bud symbol.   

TNA entangled in political whirlpool 
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is caught in a political whirlpool in the north and the east mainly because of antagonism between it and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran. Ahead of the elections to the northern provincial council scheduled for later this year, the Chief Minister has vowed to form a political party as an alternative to the TNA in the north. As things stand at the moment, All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) led by Gajendra Kumar Ponnambalam is likely to throw his weight behind Mr. Wigneswaran at the next election posing a serious threat to the TNA.  



During this trying time, the TNA took steps to revive its youth wing in the north as most Tamils youths with radical ideas stood together Mr. Wigneswaran. They joined the Mullavaikkal commemoration together with Mr. Wigneswaran.  

President’s son Daham Sirisena addresses Sajith’s function 
President Sirisena’s son Daham Sirisena was on the same stage with Housing Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa recently at a function to mark the inauguration of a housing village in Polonnaruwa. He also addressed the gathering and eulogized the work of Minister Sajith Premadasa who is also the son of former President the late Ranasinghe Premadasa. 

In fact, President Sirisena sent his son to deputize him at this event because he was busy with some other engagements on the day.
