A Gastronomic appreciation of France

To leverage its reputation as Colombo's Grande Dame and transform the city's dining and entertainment scene, distinctive concepts and renowned food offerings turn the hotel's dining outlets into destinations in their own right. With strong emphasis on retaining the authenticity and heritage of the cuisine type, the main focus of dining at the Galle Face Hotel is to develop a modern style of preparing food through the hotel's culinary experts which will eventually make cuisine at Galle Face Hotel better known in the global platform.
As a tasteful ending to the 4th French Spring Festival in Sri Lanka, the Embassy of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, the Alliance Française de Kotte in Colombo, the Alliance Française network and the Galle Face Hotel, who have partnered with the Embassy throughout the year, celebrated Beaujolais Nouveau Day with a visiting sommelier and Chef from France.
The Beaujolais Nouveau 2015 wine was elegant with juicy fruit and light tannins, "tastes of the place-an incredible terroir with primordial hills-the grape, and of vibrant, tension-filled fruit." And as Beaujolais Nouveau is about being festive and enjoying the first wine of the harvest, a vibrant wine loving gathering with great food, fashion and fellowship did add to the happiest evening ever.
