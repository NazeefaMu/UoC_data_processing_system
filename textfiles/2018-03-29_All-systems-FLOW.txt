All systems FLOW!


	



This is the amazing moment nearly half a million gallons of water burst into the sky at NASA's JFK Space Center in Florida.

When NASA rockets take off, they can produce 8.4 million pounds of thrust, and with that comes 'a torrent of heat and noise'.

Scientists were testing the way water sprays when rockets are launched, at peak flow, the water reached about 100 feet in the air above the pad surface.

In order to protect the Space Launch System (SLS) - a new NASA innovation, as well as the Orion spacecraft, Mobile Launcher, and launch pad from the extreme noise and heat water will spray onto the launch pad during ignition and liftoff.

The clip shows a water test in December when 450,000 gallons of water exploded into the flame trench at the Space Center.  

The water came from a tank through piping and vales. (Daily Mail)
