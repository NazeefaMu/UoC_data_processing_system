The Welikada Prison Hospital's acting Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr. Nirmali Thenuwara was today transferred to the Colombo National Hospital on a directive issued by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.

She was in the centre of a controversy after she recommended that former presidential secretary Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita the former director general of the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority be admitted to the prison hospital soon after they were sentenced to three years RI.

The Health Minister said he had issued the directive in the wake of a request made by 19 doctors attached to the prison hospital and on a report submitted by them with regard to 26 alleged malpractices by Dr. Thenuwara.

The minister also instructed the Health Services Director General to submit the report to the CID for an investigation.

Dr. J.K. Malwattage is expected to replace Dr. Thenuwara.

The Health Minister also directed that the vacant post of Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital be filled. (Ajith Siriwardana)
