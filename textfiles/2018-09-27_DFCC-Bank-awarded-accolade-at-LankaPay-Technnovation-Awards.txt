DFCC Bank was declared the Winner of ‘The Best Common ATM Acquirer of the year - Category C’ at the LankaPay Technnovation Awards on 20th September 2018 at Shangri-la Hotel, Colombo. The award is based on the criteria of the number of ATMs deployed and the average monthly interbank transaction volumes. 

DFCC Bank’s current ATM network stands at 115 while its branch network has reached 138 cross the island. The Bank has been on an aggressive expansion drive in recent months, adding a number of new towns and cities into its ATM/branch portfolio to offer greater convenience and access to customers and to facilitate financial inclusion. DFCC Bank’s cutting-edge IT solutions are led by a vision to bring about financial inclusion by providing low-cost efficient systems and convenient financial services.

Commenting on the accolade, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said, “We have drawn up a strategic expansion plan which includes rapid ATM and branch expansion across the country. Our current network of 115 strategically located ATMs extends convenience and easy access to customers in keeping with our ethos as a customer-centric bank.  We are closely attuned to customer needs and evolving consumer trends. Furthermore, as we are connected to the LankaPay network, customers of other banks can also conveniently perform withdrawals through the DFCC ATM network and we are happy to note that there has been high usage from this segment as well.”  

The Bank is augmenting this brick and mortar expansion strategy with a dynamic digitalizing approach in keeping with evolving trends. DFCC Bank is ahead of the mobile banking trend by leveraging technology backed products and services to deliver convenience to customers such as the DFCC Virtual Wallet - Sri Lanka’s first digital wallet in the Banking Sector; Lanka Money Transfer – a web-based  remittance system; MTeller –doorstep banking service; and Premier Go – the first interactive premier banking application. More recently, the Bank launched DFCC iConnect, a cutting-edge Payments and Cash Management Solution for businesses of all sizes.
