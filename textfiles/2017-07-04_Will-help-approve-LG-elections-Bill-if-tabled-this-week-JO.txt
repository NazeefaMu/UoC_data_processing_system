The joint opposition said it would support the government to have the necessary amendments to the Local Government Elections Bill approved if they were presented in Parliament this week.

JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene gave this assurance in response to a statement made by Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiser Mustapha that it was up to Parliament to decide on the fate of the LG elections.

"I have done my part as the subject minister with regard to LG elections and now it is up to Parliament to approve the necessary amendments so that the elections could be held," the minister had said.

"Present the amendments this week so that we could support the government to get it approved. Thereafter we can hold the elections," the MP said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
