Arjuna blasts LIOC


	

In the wake of the fuel crisis, Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today that the matter would be sorted out by Thursday with the shipment of fuel arriving on Wednesday.

He told a news conference that though there was no shortage of diesel, the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) and some CEYPECTO filling stations had stopped the supply of diesel supply and that his ministry would inquire into this matter.

“We are looking into this. We will consider whether the filling stations which didn't release diesel should have a license anymore. This could not have happened like this. There was a rumour spreading asking people to fill in the fuel tanks of their vehicles. Long queues of people, at filing stations were a result of panic buying,” he said.

He said the LIOC imported a shipment of fuel on October 15, but it was rejected on October 17 after testing.

“The ship is still docked at the Trincomalee Port forcing us to buy substandard oil. LIOC was supposed to get a fresh shipment on October 31 and it was due on November 3. This shipment contained a stock of diesel as well. We were compelled to buy this stock as well but we rejected it as it was also of inferior quality. This kind of thing has never happened before,” the minister said.

The minister said there were attempts to influence him politically, but he did not succumb.

“The President and the Prime Minister asked me to do the right thing. Had I allowed this shipment in, the situation would have been worse. I didn't want to do this as the minister," he said and apologized to the people for the inconvenience caused as a result of the current petrol crisis.

 

“I will reveal those who inflicted undue influence on us to accept the shipments," the minister said.

He said the President and the Prime Minister advised him to do the right thing when he informed them about the shipments. "Only the President and the Prime Minister can order me,” the minister said.

He said there were enough stocks as of today despite the situation with regard to shipments and there was no reason to panic but rumours spread via SMS messages did the damage.

"There is no issue because we have a stock of 10,000 metric tons and 1,500 metric tons was released today," the minister said. (Yohan Perera and Lahiru Pothmulla)
