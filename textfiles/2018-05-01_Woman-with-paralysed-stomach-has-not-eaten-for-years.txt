New Zealand, (Daily Mail), 30 April 2018 - A woman who suffers from a digestive condition has revealed how the disease struck from nowhere and is so severe she has been left dependent on feeding tubes. 

 
New Zealander Ruby Hill, 22, lives with a condition known as gastroparesis - it’s a digestive disorder which affects the normal movements of the muscles in her stomach, preventing it from emptying properly.   Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Ms Hill revealed her illness - one that’s left her with a paralysed stomach - hit when she was 19-years old and training to be a pilot.   


The pilot-in-training was admitted to hospital in 2015 with suspected early-onset appendicitis and had surgery to remove her appendix and a ruptured cyst on her ovary.   However, she said after surgery, she continued to be in excruciating pain and because her condition is so rare, it took nine months of ongoing medical appointments before doctors were able to diagnose her.
