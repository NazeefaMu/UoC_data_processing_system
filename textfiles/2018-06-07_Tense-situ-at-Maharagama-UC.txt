A tense situation arose during the Maharagama Urban Council session today, when many councillors opposed Kanthi Kodikara and five other SLPP members being sworn in as members of the council, replacing the members of the independent group, which contested under the symbol of bicycle.

Following the resignation of the six members, who contested under bicycle symbol at the LG Polls, the six SLPP members were sworn in by Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa this morning.

A UNP councilor of the Maharagama UC Wasantha Mathakorala was reportedly assaulted by several SLPP supporters, following the fracas that arose during the swearing in of the SLPP members to the UC.

According to sources, a member, attached to the independent group who supported the UNP, had been held in the Chairman’s cabin.

Sources said that the opponents were still protesting within the council premises wearing black bands. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
