Governor Tales
Rage of the World War I

Manning town is today an integral part of the city, so are Manning flats and Manning Market. Was sir William Manning their architect?
No. He was far too embroiled in politics, especially steering his way through many an outcry for reforms in the colony, to have time for side occupations. Rather strangely, three years had lapsed after the 1915 riots but the bitterness seemed yet to stay on, providing also a provocation for more representation for the locals in the legislative council. It was a cry that had been raised almost since its inception.
To the bio data of William Manning now
Born on July 1863 to Henry Manning and his wedded mate and then educated at Cambridge very soon he found himself knee deep in the wars that were aimed at establishing British suzerainty in Asia and Africa.
In 1888 he joined the Indian Army and fought in the Burmese wars .and then on to British central Africa commanding many an expedition. It was the period climaxing British power in the Dark Continent while the first world war raged.
Later Manning after having proved himself very able, was appointed governor of Jamaica and held this post through out the first world war. Soon he was regarded as a fitting ruler for the colony of Ceylon where agitations for self –govt had begun simmering as aftermath to the effects of the 1915 riots. So far the demands of the Ceylon Reform league had gone unheeded . But now voices were crying out for greater understanding between the rulers and the ruled , voices as those of D.B.Jayatileka ,sir James Peiris and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam. A much higher representation for the locals in the Legislative Council was a constant cry and echoes of what happened in 1915 still resounded .Yet Manning at the beginning was slow to react and respond to outcries for many a liberal gesture. The Ceylon National Congress was forging ahead and much strengthened due to Sinhala Tamil amity.
Eventually better relations were established between the governor and those demanding further reforms. Sir P. Arunachalam was elected first President of the Ceylon National Congress.
Relations between Manning and the local big –wig politicians improved after Manning’s wedding in Colombo. He is the only governor who had got married in the island. ( only one death and one wedding in “governors Tales” in the island.)Lady Manning herself became a very popular figure in Colombo society, perhaps gladdened by the throng of gifts received at the function.
A celebrative period seems to have commenced with many “Opening” functions such as that of the Victory Column , the home for the Colombo YMCA in Fort and the Colombo Public library.
Lake House developed its activities with the purchase of the Ceylon Observer by DR Wijewardena.
A big victory was won by those clamouring for reforms when the secretary of state approved the recommendation regarding the employment of Ceylonese in the higher ranks of public service.
Manning retired in 1925 after tenure of six and half years in which he gradually built up good will with the Ceylonese. He retired to take up the call of a magistrate in his own country ie. Kent and passed away at age, 68 in 1932.
Just an afterthought, most of these governors seem to pass away this side of the 70s.
