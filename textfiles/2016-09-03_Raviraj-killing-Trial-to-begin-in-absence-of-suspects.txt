Considering the submissions by the prosecution under Section 241 of the Penal Code, Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyathilaka yesterday decided to begin the trial on the killing of former TNA MP Nataraj Raviraj and his driver, in the absence of three of the suspects.

The Attorney General had earlier indicted six suspects on four counts in the Colombo High Court on charges of killing of Mr. Ravisraj and his driver in 2006.

The Suspects Prasad Hettiarachchi, Gamini Seneviratne and Pradeep Chaminda are in the remand custody while three others Palana Sami Suresh, Sivakanth Vivekanandan and Fabian Royston Toussaint are missing.

The case was fixed for September 7. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
