Prior to the first loan being granted, the customer is required to register for the service by completing the KYC (know your customer) information form and sign the relevant Loan Agreement with LOLC Finance PLC. This is a onetime agreement, which will be valid for a period of two years. This service is accessible through any Basic Mobile Phone simply by dialing the USSD code #111# and through any Android Device by downloading the Mobitel mCash App from the Play Store.
