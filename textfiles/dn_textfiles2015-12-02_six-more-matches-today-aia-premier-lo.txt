Six more matches today in AIA Premier L/O

Badureliya SC, Bloomfield, SSC, and Colts managed to beat the bad weather and register wins while CCC and Saracens were unlucky to have their game at De Soysa Stadium washed out by rain without a ball bowled and the Tamil Union- SLPACC game ended in a no-result in the AIA Premier limited-over tournament matches concluded on Sunday.
Badureliya beat Galle CC by 53 runs, Bloomfield beat Chilaw Marians by two runs on the Duckworth.Lewis rain rule, SSC beat Moors by six wickets with nine balls to spare, and Colts trounced Ragama CC by six wickets. All the matches were curtailed by bad weather and were played under reduced number of overs.
Today there is a card of six matches: Badureliya v Chilaw Marians at Kalutara, Bloomfield v Galle CC at Reid Avenue, Moor SC v Army at Braybrooke Place, NCC v Ragama CC at Maitland Place, SLPACC v Saracens at Maitland Crescent and, Tamil Union v CCC at P Sara Oval.
