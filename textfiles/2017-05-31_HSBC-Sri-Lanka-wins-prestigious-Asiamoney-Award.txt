HSBC Sri Lanka has been awarded as the Best International Bank by Asiamoney in the first Asiamoney Country Awards held this year. 
In its first issue of awards held in April, Asiamoney awarded Banks in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in seven categories, namely best domestic bank, best corporate and investment bank, best small and medium enterprise (SME) bank, best private bank, best international bank, best digital bank and best bank for corporate social responsibility (CSR). 
As part of the Euromoney group, Asiamoney is considered among the most influential financial magazines and a leading authority on finance, banking, investment and treasury in the Asia-Pacific region and is read and trusted by the region’s leading companies, bankers, brokers, investors, regulators and policymakers. 
HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives CEO Mark Prothero said, “This is an acknowledgement of the combined efforts made by the HSBC Sri Lanka team in providing banking solutions to connect customers to opportunities through our global network and integrated product capabilities. We are happy to have received this recognition from Asiamoney in its first issue of awards which is very timely, as we celebrate our 125-year anniversary this year in July.” 
HSBC is proud to be the only bank to have consecutively partnered the Sovereign on all its bond issuances since 2007. The bank was voted ‘Best Foreign Bank’ by Finance Asia in 2015 and 2016 and International Retail Bank of the Year by Asian Banking and Finance in 2016.
