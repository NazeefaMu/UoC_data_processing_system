The devil wasn’t a faulty electric wire, but a parent’s negligence


	



The tragedies linked to human lives take place more often than not, due to the ignorance and carelessness of people. It need not be said that adults should be held responsible for the safety of children. This is because these children, once becoming adults, will be chief contributors in the drive towards developing the world. If the adults shirk their responsibility, then the society has to face tragedies which will lead to its deterioration. If parents don’t play their roles, this will slowly, but surely happen.   

This is another tragedy caused due to the carelessness of parents.  

The weeping and lamenting that emanated from a house close to Pulasthipura Police Station in Polonnaruwa were so powerful that it drew the attention of many people. Folks in the area ran towards the place where the noises were emanating in search of reasons. Among those who ran were the officers of the Pulasthipura Police Station who were on duty at that time. It didn’t take much time for many onlookers to realize why over a dozen women were weeping. They had asked for help to save the lives of a mother and a child who had been electrocuted. Although they were freed from the cable-tied to a coconut tree-the duo had died despite being admitted to the hospital.  

The two who faced tragic deaths last Wednesday (16) were identified as residents of No 17/2 Bauddharthagama in the Farmer Settlement (B.O.P 316) in Thalpotha, Polonnaruwa.  The deceased were identified as Rajapakse Gamage Gayani Damayanthi (34), a mother of two children, and her youngest son Nethsara (6).   

Gayani’s husband Rohitha Samarakone (38), who is the breadwinner of the family, is employed in a garment factory in Batticaloa. All the household chores, including sending the children to school, had been done by Gayani. Their daughter (the eldest in the family) was scheduled to face the Scholarship Examination this year. The son was studying in year one at school.

Arrangements had been made by the parents to send their daughter, who was scheduled to face the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, to a tuition class which was situated in Thalpotha area (B.O.P. 316). The tuition class is located close to the Pulasthipura Police Station. There are about 28 children studying in their daughter’s class. It was known to all that  classes relating to the exam had to be finished on Wednesday (16).  The Scholarship examination was held on Sunday (20). Therefore, the parents concerned had decided to offer lunch to all children who had studied in this tuition class.   

Accordingly, a house, close to the tuition class, had been selected for that purpose on that fateful day. Having sent her daughter to the tuition class, Gayani and her little child had come on time to the house where lunch was being prepared. Having heard a shrill scream of a child, Gayani had run towards the front of the house. She was shocked to see her child squirming in excruciating pain, and lying on the ground. While lamenting over the tragic incident, she had tried to pick up the child. As a result she had been thrown away and fallen on the ground. When one of Gayani’s friends tried to lift the child, the people present understood that the accidents had taken place due to electrocution. Later this bevy of women had cried for help from the neighbors.   

According to the doctors, despite the fact that the mother and child were taken to the hospital for medical treatment, they had breathed their last.  According to Police investigations, it was revealed that there was a leakage in electricity from a wire fixed to the iron cable which was linked to the power source.

At the post-mortem held at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital, the Judicial Medical Officer, Namal Bandara Jayalath, had reported that there were signs of electrocution when inspecting the dead bodies. The post-mortem was held at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital in the presence of the coroner into sudden deaths, S.A.Gunasena of Kaudulla Division.  

Garthipunchi Hewage Subani Sanjeewani (37) , a resident of Thalpotha, Polonnaruwa giving evidence said,” The daughter of the deceased, Gayani and my daughter were in the same scholarship class. We discussed with the parents of other children to give a lunch to the children and teachers who taught them. That day was a Wednesday (16). Gayani had sent her daughter to the tuition class and she arrived with her youngest child to the house where the lunch was prepared. The lunch was prepared at the home where another student of the tuition class Ruwini Nisansala resided. We were washing the pots and pans near the well after preparing the lunch, at about 11.00 a.m.

It was then that we heard the cries of Gayani screaming for help in order to save her child. As soon as I rushed to the scene, I saw both of them lying on the ground. I tried to lift the child and I was also on the verge of being electrocuted. We all cried for help. With the help of neighbors the child was freed with the help of a stick. I ran with the child and together with the others managed to bring both of them to the Pulasthigama Hospital. Later we came to know that both had passed away”.  

The premature deaths of Gayani Damayanthi (34) and her child, Daham Nethsara, were accidental. It’s depressing to hear such tragic stories.
