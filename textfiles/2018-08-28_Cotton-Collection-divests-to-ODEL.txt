Through a journey spanning 27 years, my team and I have built a brand that has helped shape and develop the fashion retail landscape of Sri Lanka.

Cotton Collection is a brand with a distinct identity; a carefree, casual clothing brand that has its roots <U+FB01>rmly in the Sri Lankan psyche. This decision was inspired by the desire to dedicate more time to my family and it will also allow me to grow the Leather Collection brand to be a strong contender in today’s  market.

Cotton Collection is a great brand that we have witnessed evolving over the years. It has its own loyal customer following and we feel this acquisition would form a perfect <U+FB01>t for our aspirations in elevating the fashion retail landscape of the country.

With ODEL, our string of International Branded Apparel stores and Cotton Collection we are con<U+FB01>dent that we could offer an unparalleled array of fashion choices to the discerning and fashion conscious consumer.

Fashion and the interest therein, is only growing. With increased tourism, urbanization, a growing middle income bracket and the soon to be opened upcoming malls, namely the CCC Mall which will open in September of this year, The Shangri-La Mall which is planned for opening mid 2019 and the 645,000 square foot ODEL Mall which is slated for opening in 2020, all of which will open out more retail space to the market and tremendously upgrade the retail shopping and lifestyle experience of the consumer, we feel we are well positioned as a Group to tap into the immense growth potential that retail would offer and thereby further consolidate our presence in this segment”
