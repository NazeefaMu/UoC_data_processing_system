LG polls possible before Sinhala and Hindu New Year - PM

 
The government expects to hold the Local Government election before the next Sinhala and Hindu New Year, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation in response to a question by opposition MPs including Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MP Dinesh Gunawardane who asked as to when the Local Government election will be held. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the issues pertaining to the amended legislation on the Local Government election has to be resolved first before holding the poll.
He said there are issues with regard to delimitation and establishing wards. He added the officials demand at least one month for those matters.
"It is planned to hold the election before March 30," the Prime Minister said. "But, will give another weeks time and say before Sinhala and Hindu New Year. Then there is one more week for the preparations to the election," he said. MP Gunawardane said there is no need for any discussion or delay in holding polls in the 300 Local Government institutions across the country as the amendments have already been passed.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the matter about the introduction of 25 percent womens' representation at the next Local Government polls would be decided at the discussion that was being held in Pelawatta yesterday.
