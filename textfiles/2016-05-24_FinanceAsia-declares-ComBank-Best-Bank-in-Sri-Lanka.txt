This is the sixth ‘FinanceAsia Country Banking Achievement Award’ presented to Commercial Bank in the eight years since the Bank became the first entity in Sri Lanka to receive this coveted tribute in 2009.
Additionally, as FinanceAsia celebrates 20 years covering Asia’s financial markets this year, the magazine has chosen Commercial Bank as one the recipients of a one-off Platinum Award presented to banks and corporations that have consistently excelled over the past two decades, providing utmost quality and innovation to customers.
The FinanceAsia Country Award is based on the respective banks’ financial performance and considers profits, NPL ratios, provisioning, return on equity, capital adequacy ratios, totalassets, loans, deposits, branch network, vision and long-term strategy, market position versus the nearest competitor, principal sources of profit, and feedback of stock market analysts.
“There are no subjective assessments for the FinanceAsia awards, which are based strictly on hard facts and figures,” Commercial Bank’s Managing Director/CEO Mr Jegan Durairatnam said. “They are therefore an excellent benchmark not only to reaffirm the Bank’s position in the market, but to compare its performance with other top banks in the region.” FinanceAsia’s Country Banking Achievement  Awards for2016 ranks Commercial Bank alongside many banking giants in the region including HSBC and DBS, adjudged the best in Hong Kong and Singapore respectively; as well as banks of the calibre of ICBC (China), CTBC (Taiwan), ICICI (India), Kasikornbank (Thailand), Busan Bank (Korea), Bank Central Asia (Indonesia), Techcombank (Vietnam), MCB Bank (Pakistan) and Dutch-Bangla Bank (Bangladesh).
