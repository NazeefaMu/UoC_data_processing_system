The committee appointed to look into the reorganization of the United National Party (UNP) in its report had recommended that Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should name a person who would take over the party leadership as and when he steps down from the leadership.

A member of the committee said it had come out with this suggestion as its members were of the opinion that it would be easier for the party to move forward when a suitable person who would take over the party is named. Also, it was stated that many in the party had wanted to feel secured in the future.

The committee had also recommended that Deputy Leader should be given more powers such as the authority to go around the country organizing party activities.

It was also highlighted that vital decisions on the future of the party would be made on March 22.

Meanwhile, the UNP Parliamentary group which met last evening had decided to work unanimously to defeat the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. The Prime Minister had told the parliamentary group that one should not panic about the No confidence as it had not been handed over to speaker yet. He had also told the group that such a motion would be taken up for debate as soon as possible once it is handed over to Speaker and would be defeated. (Yohan Perera)
