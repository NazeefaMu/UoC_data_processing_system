Dr. Nirmal would have expected attack: Vasu
	
	While condemning the alleged attack on Colombo University Don, Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri at the venue of the May Day rally of the Consolidated Trade Union Alliance at Kirillapona, the Democratic Left Front (DLF) yesterday said Dr. Devasiri Nirmal Ranjith should have expected such an attack to take place as he was a virulent critic of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	General Secretary of the DLF, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara, in a statement said Dr. Nirmal, a well known social activist and a professional, had offered his fullest support to President Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential poll and he had done so by publicly attacking former President Rajapaksa at every given opportunity.
	He is a well known critic of Rajapaksa and therefore he would have gone to Kirillapona knowing there was a risk of reprisal from Rajapaksa supporters and was consequently attacked by them, Mr. Nanayakkara said.
	Mr. Nanayakkara says that Dr. Nirmal had made a statement in which he claimed the current political activities of the faction led by former president Rajapaksa must not be allowed to continue and even called it a dangerous movement with fascist tendencies.
	He suggests that Dr. Dewasiri may have gone to there as a spy as another university professor had said that the JVP must come forward to arrest this situation. Their modus operandi is to disrupt the growing support for the peoples movement led by Rajapaksa. The Kirullapona incident could be a ruse to create an incident that could put the blame on the Rajapaksa group. However, having said that, we condemn this attack and request the police to apprehend the culprits who attacked Dr. Nirmal Ranjith and take legal action against them, Mr. Nanayakkara said. (SAJ)

FCID serving Western interests: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and UPFA MP Wimal Weerawansa said today the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) was set up on the request of Western countries so that those who those who oppose the West could be arrested.
On an earlier occasion, the government said at least 10 MPs were accepted to be arrested by the FCID over allegations of fraud and corruption.
Mr. Weerawansa said the man who committed the biggest financial fraud was at the helm of the Central Bank while former minister Johnston Fernando who was accused of obtaining goods on credit from Sathosa was remanded.
He said the government has violated its mandate by continuing to administer the country after 100 days.
We urge the government to dissolve parliament if it is confident of its strength, he said.
Western provincial councilor Udaya Gammanpila said the law has been politicised the first of which was to remove former prime mister D.M. Jayaratne.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader and UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena urged the government to dissolve parliament as promised so that UPFA government would be elected to office.
Even though the government keeps saying it will dissolve parliament, it has not been done so far. Even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has admitted that this is a minority government, he said.
Mr. Gunawardena said the government must allow the people who were disgusted with the UNP government to set up a new government.
He said the UPFA condemns government attempts to dissolve local governments in May despite the promise to do so only after delimitation was completed.(Ajith Siriwardana)

TN MPs want India to reclaim Katchatheevu
	
	
Rajya Sabha members from the AIADMK, DMK and the CPI want the Indian Central Government to renegotiate with the government of Sri Lanka to reclaim the island of Katchatheevu, the Hindu reported.
Buoyed by the passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill to ratify the land border agreement with Bangladesh, these MPs said the government must reconsider the exchange of Katchatheevu as it was not done through a constitutional amendment and has not served Indias interest.
A. Navaneethakrishnan of the AIADMK said the ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka without any constitutional amendment has adversely affected the livelihood of fishermen of Tamil Nadu.
The ceding of Katchatheevu is in total violation of the views given by the Supreme Court in a Presidential reference in the Berubari case, he said, adding that a case has been filed in the Supreme Court by AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa.
In 2011, the government of Tamil Nadu impleaded itself as a party in this case since it is the custodian of all land records. This case is still pending in the Supreme Court.
The ceding of Katchatheevu is illegal and unconstitutional I urge the Centre to rescind the 1974 agreement with Sri Lanka ceding Katchatheevu, Mr. Navaneethakrishnan said.
CPIs D. Raja also raised the issue and said there has to be consensus on issues of foreign policy and the view of the State was not taken into consideration during the agreement on Katchatheevu. There are already problems at the borders with Pakistan and China...the Southern border will always be tense, he said, urging the government to take up the issue with the Sri Lankan government.
DMKs Tiruchi Siva said the government should settle the Katchatheevu issue like it did the dispute with Bangladesh. He said there were no records to prove that the island was with Sri Lanka.
Union Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj said the issue is sub judice and she cannot comment on it.

Mayor, Opp. Leader exchange blows at Kotte MC
	
A campaign held to protest against corruption at the Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council turned sour when two groups led by the Mayor and the Opposition Leader exchanged blows within the council premises this afternoon.
Welikada Police had received three separate complaints since 2.00 pm from the councils Opposition Leader Sugath Appuhamy of the UNP, a ruling party UPFA Councilor Premalal Athukorala and Mayor Janaka Ranawaka, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Opposition Leader Sugath Appuhamy who was the first to lodge a complaint said he was engaged in a demonstration outside the Council premises against the corruption within the Municipal Council, and that he came under attack by the Mayor and other ruling party Members.
According to eyewitnesses the Opposition Leader had opposed to the passing of funds to construct the new Council premises taken up at the Finance Working Committee gathered at the Councils Monthly General Meeting held today.
Sugath Appuhamy had then walked out of the house and started protesting outside by climbing on to one of the gate posts at the front entrance. He had claimed to possess 17 files containing evidence of corruption at the Council.
The situation turned tense when Mayor Janaka Ranawaka accompanied by several UPFA Councillors and staff members rushed to the scene demanding the Opposition Leader to get off the gate post.
While climbing down the post Appuhamy had collapsed on the ground and had remained in that position as a mark of protest. He later alleged in his complaint that the Mayor had pulled him while climbing down forcing him to collapse on the ground.

	The objective of the demand made by some opposition parties to do away with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is something aimed at getting away from frauds, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today.
	Mr. Samaraweera made this point with regard to a demand made by the delegation led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when they met President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday.
	The Minister said half of the opposition members who made this demand were those who faced serious corruption charges.
	We will continue to carry out investigations on financial crimes irrespective of what steps that would be taken in the future, he said.
	He said, I doubt the FCID gazette will be repealed. That is an intrinsic part of the mandate given to us by the people of this country to look into all these allegations of wide-scale corruption which existed during the last regime. The very fact that they want it scrapped shows that they are guilty. Because, with due respect, half of those who accompanied former President Rajapaksa to meet President Sirisena, had very serious allegations against them. It is a race against time to somehow get these investigations stopped. We have total confidence in the President that he will live up to the mandate given to him by the people of this country.
	Meanwhile, he said the government was getting the expertise of four countries in the asset recovery operations.
	For the moment Id rather not name the countries. According to some of the people weve been working with, they feel that the assets that have been siphoned off from this country by the Rajapaksa family at large may amount to some 18 billion US dollars. In fact, we have done a little better than the Libyans and the others because we at least know where 2 billion US dollars lie, but it is not an easy task and we are getting help and support to negotiate and gain access to these funds, he said.

NASA radar detects heartbeats of buried survivors
	
	A search and rescue device developed by NASA and the US Department of Homeland Security has located four survivors of the recent Nepal earthquake buried beneath 10 feet of rubble.
	The Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response (FINDER) device used microwave-radar technology to detect the heartbeats of four men trapped beneath collapsed structures.
	The portable radar unit is based on remote sensing technology originally developed to detect alien life on distant exoplanets.
	Within a search and rescue context, FINDER is able to detect breathing and heartbeats of people beneath up to 30 feet of rubble, behind 20 feet of solid concrete, or within 100 feet in open spaces.
	The Nepal earthquake on 25 April has so far claimed the lives of around 7,500 people and efforts are still being made to locate survivors.
	Two FINDER devices arrived in Nepal on 29 April -- four days after the earthquake struck -- having been in development since 2013.
	"The true test of any technology is how well it works in a real-life operational setting," said Reginald Brothers, Department of Homeland Security under secretary.
	"Of course, no one wants disasters to occur, but tools like this are designed to help when our worst nightmares do happen."
	Demonstrations of the FINDER device are set to take place at the Virginia Task Force One Training Facility on 7 May, where an announcement regarding its commercialisation is expected to be made. (ibtimes)

	Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and three other Economic Development Ministry officials were today ordered to be further remanded till May 20 by Kaduwela Magistrate Dhammika Hemapala for allegedly misappropriating millions of Ministry funds without Treasury sanction.
	At the outset, the Counsel appearing for the suspects filed written submissions seeking seek bail for their clients. They contended that the alleged offences committed by the suspects did not come under the provisions of the Public Property Act, and as such the Magistrate was empowered to grant bail to the suspects.
	However, the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) responded to the counsel that they would first seek the Attorney Generals advice on the submissions of the counsel and sought two weeks time to reply.
	At this stage the Defence Counsel Sandya Thalduwa contended that the Attorney General did not have any status to make directions to the Magistrate on granting bail. She said it was a matter of the Magistrates discretion to grant bail to the suspects.
	Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, Former Divineguma Department Director General R.A.K Ranawaka, Former Economic Development Ministry Secretary Dr. Nihal Jayathilake and its Bank Director P.B.Thilakasiri were accordingly further remanded till May 20. (Farook Thajudeen and Irangani Edirisinghe)

The United States said that it was working with Sri Lanka to oppose intimidation or the use of force to assert territorial or maritime claims in the Indian Ocean.
US Secretary of State John Kerry had talked about U.S. leadership on maritime security in the Indian Ocean, in association with our friends and allies across the region. And the United States and Sri Lanka are working together to oppose intimidation or the use of force to assert territorial or maritime claims. And we also are working  we support, sorry, the legal uses of sea and air space, and also the rights that are granted to all states, big states and small states, Acting deputy Spokesman of the State Department Jeff Rathke told media on Tuesday.Transcript
QUESTION: Yeah, Sri Lanka. As I asked yesterday, it was the first visit by the U.S. Secretary of State in the last 10 years, I believe. And they discussed the regional  important regional issues, including maritime security. So could you clarify what the maritime security  is that the Indian Ocean Or can you explain in a little bit more detail what they discussedMR RATHKE: Well, yeah. The United States supports efforts of the Indo-Pacific region countries to provide maritime security. That includes counter-piracy and counter-trafficking operations as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. This includes fundamental international principles such as freedom of navigation, freedom of overflight, and other lawful uses of the sea and air space, as well as the peaceful resolution of territorial or maritime claims. So we support Sri Lankas efforts to contribute to maritime security and to fulfill its important role as a leading maritime nation in the Indo-Pacific region.QUESTION: Discussed particularly about Indian Ocean issue or including the South China Sea or other oceanMR RATHKE: Well, I think if you look at the Secretarys remarks, he talked about U.S. leadership on maritime security in the Indian Ocean, in association with our friends and allies across the region. And the United States and Sri Lanka are working together to oppose intimidation or the use of force to assert territorial or maritime claims.

Video: FCID akin to actions in Hitler era: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said that the mechanism of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), is akin to that of the era of Hitler.
The Prime Minister cannot take the role of the IGP and give orders. The Prime Minister is answerable to Parliament. The Cabinet Sub-Committee has taken over Police power. The Gazette has taken a different turn to what was intended, he told journalists outside the Welikada Prison.
Rajapaksa visited former Minister Johnston Fernando, who is currently in remand prison over charges under the Public Property Act.
Rajapaksa said that the actions of the FCID were spoken of during the meeting between him and President Maithripala.
This is political revenge and nothing else. These are civil cases. The CWE is a Corporation and its dealings dont fall under the Public Properties act. Besides, its a commercial entity and giving goods on credit is a usual practice. If there is an issue, it should fall under a civil action, as opposed to a criminal one, he said.
He said that even the offenses that his brother former Minister Basil Rajapaksa is charged with fall under the same category of civil offences.
Rajapaksa has visited all his allies, who were in remand custody following his defeat in the concluded Presidential election and has been defiant in rejecting allegations of financial misappropriation and fraud. (Text and Video by Sanath Desmond)
