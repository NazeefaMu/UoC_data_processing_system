Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake today told court that the CCTV footage relating to the inquiry over the murder of Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen, has been sent to the British Columbia Laboratory- Canada for expert examination and the progress of the examination would be received by the CID by the first week of August.

Counsel Anil Silva who appeared for the suspect former SDIG Anura Senanayeke, said that according to the medical examination held by the specialist Dr Chula Herath on the suspect; the former SDIG had been diagnosed with the initial stages of cancer and has to be further examined under the supervision of his specialist doctor.

However, the report submitted by the specialist doctor had not mentioned any particular cancer symptoms of the suspect, and informed the court on hypertension, diabetes and kidney ailment of the suspect.

Considering the report submitted by Dr Chula Herath on the suspect, Colombo additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris directed the Prison Authority to send the suspect before a JMO to clarify his medical condition.

The prosecution held that the suspects were charged under sections 113, conspiracy', and 32, ' Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention’, of the penal code and according to the provision in section 13 of the Bail Act, a person suspected or accused of being concerned in committing or having committed an offence punishable with death or with life imprisonment, shall not be released on bail except by a Judge of the High Court.

The Magistrate rejecting the bail application submitted by the counsel on behalf of the suspects, further remanded the suspects, former Crimes OIC Sumith Perera and Former SDIG until July 7.

The former SDIG and the former Crimes OIC were remanded on charges of causing disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, touching it to screen the offender and conspiring under clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code.

The CID filing a further report informed the court that the mobile details of the Wasim Thajudeen between March 01 and May 19, 2012, had been taken from the Dialog Company under the instructions of the former director of the Colombo Crimes Division, SSP Ranaweera, by the CCD after the incident in 2012.

The CID revealed that the court order to peruse mobile details was taken using some other case (B 6802/01/1) in Colombo Magistrates Court by the CCD.

The alleged details of the victim, Wasim Thajudeen were taken by the CCD to be sent to State Intelligence Service head, Major General, Kapila Hendrawithana to investigate on the incident happened on May 17, 2012, said CID.

The CID suspected that statement made by the police later over the incident as only a fatal accident, questions the credibility of the investigation that held on the accident of Wasim Thajudeen.

The CID also told the court that it had recorded statements from three policemen including the one who found the wallet of the victim on May 17, 2012 at a time between 6 a.m. to 6.30 a.m.

Over the inquiry conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council against Former JMO Ananda Samarasekara and two others on the allegation of missing body parts of the victim, the counsel appearing on behalf of the SLMC told the court that the suspect had filed objections to the council on June 4 over the allegations and the further inquiry would be taken up on July 23.
