A/L exam timetable in a muddle


	

Several candidates have lost the opportunity to sit for two subject papers with the alleged bungling of the GCE Advanced Level examination timetable, it is learnt.

The timetable had been published in the official website of the Education Department in two occasions on May 16 and June 25, and one of them appears to be inaccurate. Students who had followed the incorrect timetable have faced this issue and a group of them missed the paper on Buddhist Civilization on August 7 and the Sinhala Language paper on August 11.

When inquired about the matter, a senior spokesperson of the Education Department said every student had been sent a copy of the correct timetable along with the admission form, and therefore it was obligatory for them to adhere to the correct timetable.

Responding to a query, Examinations Commissioner General Sanath Pujitha said a tentative timetable was published in the department’s website to receive comments from private candidates, and upon receipt, school principals and directors of education prepared the final and official timetable and sent copies of it to each candidate.

“A private website has copied the tentative timetable from the department’s website and published it in their domain to gain publicity. However, attention is now drawn to provide some relief to candidates who missed the opportunity to sit for some papers,” he said. (Ranjan Kasthuri)
