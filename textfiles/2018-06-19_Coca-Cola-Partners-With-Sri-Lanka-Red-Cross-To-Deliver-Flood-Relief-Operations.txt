Coca-Cola and Sri Lanka Red Cross’ flood relief operations for the Biyagama community benefitted several hundred families across 5GramaNiladhari Divisions. The Company responded to the flood affected victim’s needs for drinking water, emergency medical and first aid supplies and conducted a well-cleaning initiativein order to provideclean, uncontaminated water so families could return to their normal lives without delay.

We are extremely thankful to Coca-Cola for continuing to support our within 24-hour emergency relief efforts in providing disaster relief operations annually. Their volunteering efforts is something we genuinely admire and appreciate as they dedicate their time to work alongside our teams, as they have done since 2016, with the emergency distribution of bottled water and emergency medical services and first aid items.

During the second stage, an urgent and much needed well-cleaning programme was initiated soon after identifying the contaminated wells in Biyagama. 300 wells were cleaned across 5GramaNiladhari Divisions in Biyagama during the flood relief operation bringing much needed relief to 300 families and households. This programme included well cleaning, disinfecting and certifying through the technical support of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Gampaha Branch and inspection by Public Health Inspectors.
 
Furthermore, bottled water was handed over to the GramaNiladhari of Yaburuluwa North, to be included with food aid packs to flood affected households. The recommended amount of drinking is 5 litres and hence, each family received 5 bottles of 1L Kinley water for their regular consumption. The Divisional Secretary alongside the Coca-Cola team members at the GramaNiladhariYaburuluwa North office attended this distribution.
