Parliament would reconvene on November 16 as per the Gazette issued by President Maithripala Sirisena and not on Monday, November 5, UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said today.

Earlier yesterday, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said President Sirisena would likely to reconvene Parliament on November 5 instead of November 16.

However, addressing a news briefing at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Office, MP Premajayantha said at least three working days were required to reconvene Parliament once it was prorogued.

“Therefore, Parliament cannot be reconvened on the 5th. Reports to that effect are incorrect,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
