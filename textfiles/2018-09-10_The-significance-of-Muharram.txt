"One of the sacred months according to Al-Qur’an as many events had taken place in this sacred month"

"These events have been recorded in the Holy Qur’an and Hadees (Tradition)"

 

Muharram is the first Arabic month in the Islamic calendar. The month of Muharram will fall on September 11 if moon is sighted.

It is one of the sacred months according to Al-Qur’an. Many events had taken place in this sacred month. These events have been recorded in the Holy Qur’an and Hadees (Tradition).

Once Allah the Almighty ordered Prophet Adam (Alai.) not to eat a fruit of a particular tree in the heaven. Then devil attempted to mislead him by saying several times that particular fruit is lawful for consumption. Ultimately Prophet Adam (Alai.) forgot what Allah said and ate the forbidden fruit. Due to wrath of Allah he and his wife Hawwa (Alai.) were thrown to the earth. Prophet Adam (Alai.) had repented for his fault for many years. He was forgiven by Allah in this Muharram.


 


"A panegyric in the name of Imam Hassan (Rali) and Imam Hussain (Rali) has been compiled by His Holiness Mappillai Lebbai Alim (Rah.). The name of it is Hasanain Mowlidh. This Mowlidh is recited from the first moon to tenth moon of Muharram annually. Then a feast is given in the name of them at mosques and homes."


 


When Prophet Nuh (Alai.) was preaching the doctrine of Islam, people opposed him and troubled him in various ways. Then he prayed to Allah and asked Him to punish them. Then Allah ordered to make a huge ship. After his prayer, it rained for six months continually and the area was flooded. This flood was named Thufan Flood.

By the request of Allah, he told the people to get into his ship. Those who got into his ship were saved and others drowned in the water. Finally the ship reached the Jud Mountain. This event had taken place in Muharram.  Prophet Younus (Alai.) was swallowed by a whale. He had to live in its stomach for a certain period. He had recited Lallaha Illa Antha Subhanaka Innee Kunthu Minal Lalimeen, while he was in its stomach. He came out of the fish and was rescued in the month of Muharram.

When Prophet Musa (Alai.) was chased by king Pharaoh and his followers, he dipped his Asa (Rod) in the sea and several paths had been formed in the sea. Prophet Musa (Alai.) walked along one of these paths. When the Pharaoh and his followers attempted to catch him through this path, the sea covered the paths. The Kings men drowned in the water and died. Prophet Musa (Alai.) was saved without any harm. This had taken place in Muharram.

Once Imam Hussain (Rali) took part in the Holy Battle of Karbala. He was martyred in this battle in this sacred month. Fasting on 9th and 10th moon of Muharram is optional (Sunnah). A panegyric in the name of Imam Hassan (Rali) and Imam Hussain (Rali) has been compiled by His Holiness Mappillai Lebbai Alim (Rah.). The name of it is Hasanain Mowlidh. This Mowlidh is recited from the first moon to tenth moon of Muharram annually. Then a feast is given in their names at mosques and homes. It is optional to wear new clothes in this month. Let us celebrate this sacred month and commemorate the sacred events, which had taken place in it!
