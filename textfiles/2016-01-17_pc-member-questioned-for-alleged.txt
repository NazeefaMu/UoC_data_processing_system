	One of the Central Provincial Council members who had gone on a 10 day study tour to Singapore few days ago had been taken in for questioning by the Singaporean Police for allegedly groping a woman inside a lift at the hotel they had stayed during their visit, reliable sources said.
	All other PC members except for the member concerned had returned to the country early Saturday completing their tour, according to the Council sources.
	Council Chairman L.D.Nimalasiri who had accompanied the members to Singapore confirmed the incident of groping and the police taking him to the police station. However, he said the incident was accidental and not serious and the police did not take the member into custody but just took him to the police station. He also said that the member had stayed back in Singapore for a personal need.
	Council Secretary of the Central Provincial Council T.N.S. Bandara Tennakoon said that he was neither aware of such an incident nor had he an idea whether the member in question had returned to the country or not. (Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa)
