A team of ten from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa participated at the Japan-Asia Youth Exchange Program in Science (Sakura Exchange Program in Science) recently. The programme was implemented as a collaboration between the University of Miyazaki and the University of Moratuwa. This collaboration was initiated by Prof. Hiroki Tamura form Department of Environmental Robotics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Miyazakiand the Dr. Y.W.R. Amarasinghe. A systematic proposal was submitted to Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency for this young scientist exchange programme. Following approval, a fully funded collaboration was initiated and a team of five students from Miyazaki University arrived in 2015 to the University of Moratuwa to exchange their knowledge and the programme was a success. The JST acts as the funding organization for the programme.   


The team consisted of four undergraduate students representing Mechatronics stream.The team also comprised four graduate research assistants, two from mechatronics and one each from BioRobotics and Energy streams and two researchers


In return, under the coordination and guidance of Dr. Y.W.R. Amarasinghe, a team of 10 people from Department of Mechanical Engineering visited Japan for the programme. The team was hosted by the University of Miyazaki, Japan. The team consisted of four undergraduate students representing Mechatronics stream.The team also comprised four graduate research assistants, two from mechatronics and one each from BioRobotics and Energy streams and two researchers. During the science exchange programme, they received exposure in the research outcomes of the SANWA Company LDT, Laboratory visits in the University of Miyazaki, Faculty of Engineering and got to attend a workshop in mobile robotics. Most importantly they also made many cultural visits. Additionally, two graduate students were presented with the outcome of their research in an organized session which was held on Beppu, Oita, Japan from February 1-4. 



The research involved Advanced Technology on Sensing Technology, Devices, Application in the International Conference on Artificial Life and Robotics 2018. 

Four previously accepted research work was presented by the research students. Additionally, the team visited University of Miyazaki to  present their research work in the respective research areas and to experience the University environment. Dr. R.A.M.P.Ranaweera and Mr. W.P.D. Welgama participated as the senior researchers from Department of Mechanical Engineering. The team members were given a special certification on behalf of participating in the program and successfully completing it by Prof. Hiroki Tamura.
