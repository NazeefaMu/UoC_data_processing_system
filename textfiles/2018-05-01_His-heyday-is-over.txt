His heyday is over


	



This person heading a key establishment in national education had got this high post thanks to a high political connection and he had stooped to all kinds of corrupt practices ever since taking up this appointment. The general audit has now discovered that the man had been fraudulently cashing cheques   related to a waste disposal tender, they say.

 


This worthy serving under a five-year contract is said to have been making money by resorting to corrupt practices in awarding tenders for janitorial and cleaning services at the headquarters and the two establishments coming under his purview. The workers engaged in cleaning services at these establishments though supposed to be employees of the successful tenderer are really the employees of the establishment owned by him, they say. 


Now that the man has met his Waterloo, he is reportedly running after politicos to get out of the fix.
