Two corporals who were among the guests at a wedding reception of an army corporal in Kotawehera had engaged in a heated argument which ended with the biting off of the ear of one corporal.

The biting had been so severe that the ear had got detached and when he was admitted to the hospital the doctors there had ruled out attaching it back surgically.

Investigations have been launched to arrest the suspect corporal by the Kotawehera police.(Priyani Mangalika)
