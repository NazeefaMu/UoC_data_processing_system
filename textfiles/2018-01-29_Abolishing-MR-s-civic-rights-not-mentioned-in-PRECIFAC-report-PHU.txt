The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) had not recommended abolishing the civic rights of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as claimed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.

Addressing a news conference, he challenged the Premier to point out whether it was mentioned in the PRECIFAC report that the civic rights of the former President should be stripped in connection with the allegations articulated in the report.

He further said that they were ready to render their fullest support to President Sirisena if he was keen to take instant actions against the bond scam offenders and other individuals who have been alleged to have links to the scam. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
