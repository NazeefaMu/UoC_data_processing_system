India build 142-run lead over South Africa

Mohali, Friday: India were 125-2 in their second innings at stumps on the second day of the first Test in Mohali on Friday, leading South Africa by 142 runs.
Murali Vijay (47) and Cheteshwar Pujara (63 not out) put on 86 for the second wicket after Shikhar Dhawan bagged a pair when he was caught in the slips off Vernon Philander for zero. South Africa were earlier bowled out for 184 in reply to India's 201 to hand the hosts a narrow 17-run lead on a dusty pitch at the I.S. Bindra stadium. AB de Villiers top-scored with 63 and skipper Hashim Amla made 43. India's spinners claimed all 10 wickets, with Ravichandran Ashwin taking five, Ravindra Jadeja three and Amit Mishra two. AFP
