His influence has failed this time round


	

A certain political authority with ties to sports has begun feeling unhappy and uncomfortable in yahapalanaya, they say.


By the way, the politico once said that he felt a strong inclination to function as an independent member in the council. 


Some government high ups who had made discreet inquiries as to why this sporty one had suddenly gone sulky, have stumbled upon the cause: a ladylove of our man has been making an easy buck through the lucrative printing contract and the political authority handling the public purse has now made a move to award this contract to another person. 


Fireworks are expected to break out in the august assembly shortly over this affair, informed ones say.
