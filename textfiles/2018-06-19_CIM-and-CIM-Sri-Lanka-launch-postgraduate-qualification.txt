The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM)and CIM Sri Lanka has launched a Postgraduate Diploma in Professional Marketing, a new qualification for marketersoperating internationally. The courseequipsmarketing leaders overseas withthe skills to open up and develop new markets for their products and services.

Recent CIM research,conducted in partnership with PwC,underlines the need for international marketing, with 70%of exporting British businesses expecting Brexit to boost overseas sales. The research found that the greatest growth prospects for businesses outside of Europewere marketplacessuch as China, the United Arab Emirates, India and Hong Kong. Therefore, businesses with an international presence, as well as marketers in local businesses across the globe, need to ensure that their skills are up to date to realise the opportunity that international trade provides.

Research from CIM that provided a basis for the new qualification and surveyed study centres in the regions, shows that students in international markets benefit from the knowledge and skills gained at postgraduate level. The new CIM qualification equips marketers with the capabilities to maximise the opportunities for growth in new territories.

The programme further addresses the growing need for an entrepreneurial approach to business leadership. We are excited to be a part of this game changing curriculum.”

CEO of the Chartered Institute of Marketing, Chris Daly, said, “CIM operates across 130 countries. Sri Lanka is one of our fastest growing marketing communities both in studying and professional members, which we support to deliver business advantages for their clients and employers. A commitment to the training and development of futureinternational marketing talentdelivers real returns to the bottom line. For marketers themselves, an ongoing commitment to continual professional development allows them to reap rewards both for themselves and the businesses they work for.”

The qualification, which is available for face-to-face learning at CIM’s international network of study centres and via online learning from CIM study centres, comprises three mandatory modules: Global Marketing Decisions, Corporate Digital Communications and Creating Entrepreneurial Change. These modules are also available as individual awards and have been designed with an increased emphasis on metrics and digital disruption, with input from academics and organisations across the globe.

Brian Selvanayagam, chairman of CIM Sri Lanka Region, said, “We have developed this qualification to reflect the rapidly changing international market, taking into consideration both regional and global trends. The content not only reflects the issues we know are impacting marketers in key regions, such as Sri Lanka and Africa, but also provides our members with the tools to take advantage. We hope that this new and improved qualification will equip international marketers with the skills they require to succeed, no matter where they are in the world.”
