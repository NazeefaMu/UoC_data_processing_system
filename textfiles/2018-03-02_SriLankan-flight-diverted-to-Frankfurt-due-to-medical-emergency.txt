SriLankan Airlines flight UL504 en-route from London to Colombo diverted to and landed safely in Frankfurt airport last night due to a medical emergency, SriLankan Airlines sources said.

"The most important factor was the health and safety of the passenger in concern. We have made every arrangement to meet the needs of our customers who were affected by this incident," they said.

The flight departed Frankfurt at 0534hrs (Frankfurt Time) and is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka via Kuwait at 2355 hrs. It will briefly stop in Kuwait for a crew change due to legal flight crew duty-time limitations.
