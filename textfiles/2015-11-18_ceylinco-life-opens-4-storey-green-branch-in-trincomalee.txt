Ceylinco Life has opened its new branch building in Trincomalee, custom-built to a new eco-friendly model adopted by the life insurance leader for branches being constructed on company-owned land.
The new four-storey building of approximately 11,000 square feet stands on 62.65 perches land at Kandy Road, Trincomalee. It accommodates seven branches and one customer service section and has a 24-vehicle car park for customers, the company said.
The building with a floor area of approximately 11,000 square feet is designed to use natural light on all floors, uses natural ventilation in common areas, lobbies and its lunch room, is solar powered, has a rainwater harvesting facility and is equipped with energy-efficient air-conditioning, making it one of the most eco-friendly offices of its size in the Eastern Province capital.
The building also has-elevators, a conference hall that can accommodate 100 people, and a roof-top recreational area for the use of staff.
The new office building was ceremonially declared open by Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan on 14th November, one year after he laid the foundation stone for it.
A similar branch building designed to use renewable energy and water is nearing completion at Wennappuwa, while construction of another branch at Horana will begin in late November, the company said.
In August this year, Ceylinco Life opened an eco-friendly, four-storey branch office on company owned land in Bandarawela. The company already owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia, in addition to Trincomalee.
Ceylinco Life operates the largest network of 250 branches in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every one of the island’s 25 districts.
