Customs authorities had detected 18, 480 kilogrammes ‘Linna’, a variety of fish, the date of which had expired. The stock of fish, worth more than Rs. 13 million, that was imported from Norway, was detected in a raid by the Customs in a warehouse in Orugodawatta today. The stock of fish, which was manufactured in early 2014, was imported by a well-known businessman in Mattakkuliya despite it being unsuitable for human consumption.
