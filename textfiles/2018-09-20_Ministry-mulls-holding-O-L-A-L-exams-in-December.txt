The Education Ministry said discussions are underway to hold the G.C.E. Ordinary Level and Advanced Level Examinations in December and to release their results by the end of December before the start of the new school term.

Speaking to the media at the Ministry, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said after the end of the A/L examinations, the University entrance will commence and after the O/L examinations the A/L classes will begin in January.

“Preparations for changing the examination dates would be done after discussions with the Department of Examinations. The Ministry is planning to save the children’s waiting time for the examinations and to help the children to get their degrees and post graduate degrees at the age of 25 years. Due to the late issuance of exam results, Advanced Level students are not in a position to apply for foreign university programmes,” the minister said.

Thus, he had instructed the Examination Commissioner General to issue the results on fixed dates.

Earlier the Education Ministry had issued fixed dates for the release of Grade Five Scholarship Examination, the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination and the G.C.E Advance Level examination results each year.

Accordingly, the release dates of examination results are as follows: G.C.E. A/L on December 27, G.C.E. O/L on March 28 and Grade Five Scholarship exam on October 5.  (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
