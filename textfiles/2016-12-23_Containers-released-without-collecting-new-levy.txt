Fourteen containers of white sugar had been released from the Customs clearance without the new levy (which was imposed from Tuesday night) being collected, Customs sources said yesterday.

The announcement regarding the increment on the levy on imported white sugar had been released by the Finance Ministry on Wednesday (21) to be implemented from midnight on Tuesday (20). At that time, the Customs Department computers had not been programmed for the calculation for the new tax, the sources said.

However, they said, the Customs Department had traced the owners of the released containers and taken steps to collect the additional sum from them.

The Special Commodity Levy on a kilogram of imported white sugar had been increased by Rs.6 by the Finance Ministry. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
