Govt. to amend OMP Act


	

The Government has drafted legislation to amend the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Act and a gazette notice has been issued in this regard. The draft legislation will be presented in Parliament shortly.

The Government decided to set up the Office of Missing Persons last year through an Act of Parliament but it is not operational as yet.

The move to amend the Act comes in the wake of the UN Human Rights Office calling for speedy action in ensuring transitional justice. In 2015, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution tilted, ‘Promoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka’ to provide a framework for transitional justice including the setting up of four specific mechanisms. The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) is one of them.(Kelum Bandara)
