Peeking into uncertain future


	



 

Two politically significant events said to be in the offing – moving a no confidence motion against Number Two and another reshuffle of the top team have become the subjects of much discourse in political circles these days. Meanwhile, government high-ups have begun breathing fire at their own bosses. Fast developing political instability and uncertainty about their own political future appear to have highly shaken almost all high authorities in yahapalanaya. This is a time most of them look up to divine grace and seek the help of occultists to take a peek into their uncertain political future.

 


It has come to light that at least three Green party bigwigs had approached an astrologer cum soothsayer holding a high political office in a certain province to get a reading of their horoscope relevant to the ongoing period. They had reportedly sought a specific answer to their query whether they would lose the high office they were holding now. 


The astrologer, a lady with a wide reputation, had given them a straight answer to their common question.


All three of them had appealed to her to keep as a secret her knowledge about their political future as foreseen by her. 


One of these top team members is from Uva, and the other two are from Wayamba and West respectively, they say.
