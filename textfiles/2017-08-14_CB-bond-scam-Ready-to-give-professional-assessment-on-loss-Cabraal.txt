Former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said he would like to offer a professional assessment to the Bond Commission on the total loss suffered by the government and the country as a result of the bond scam, and a scientific and studied insight into the actions and circumstances that enabled the scam to be carried out.

Issuing a statement, he said certain Members of Parliament had suggested that he be summoned before the Bond Commission. “In that regard, I wish to state that I would be very happy to give evidence before the Bond Commission and respond to any questions the Commission may wish to clarify,” he said.
