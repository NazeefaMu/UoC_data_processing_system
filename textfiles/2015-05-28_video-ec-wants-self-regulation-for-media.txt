Election Commissioner Mahinda Desapriya said yesterday he would initiate discussions with private media institutions to evolve a self regulatory system to be followed during elections .
He told a news conference that some provisions for media control during elections were included in the original draft of the 19th Amendment, but the Supreme Court struck them off as needing a referendum. He said it would be better to have a system evolved by the media community to exercise self-control and that he intended having a dialogue with the stakeholders for for this purpose
"Ours is a society relying on information flowing from the media. Traditionally our people have come to believe what the media says," Mr. Deshapriya said and underscored the fact that he had encountered problems with the private and state media during the previous election.
