Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha today said that he too had reservations on the report of the provincial delimitation commission.

He said this delimitation commission report was debated in the House.

“Do you mean to say that there are no issues with regard to the delimitation commission report” the minister asked Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake. “I also have issues with regard to the report,” he said.

The minister pointed out that the committee which was appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya would examine the report and rectify any anomalies within two months and submit recommendations to the President. He said the report could then be presented to Parliament again. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
