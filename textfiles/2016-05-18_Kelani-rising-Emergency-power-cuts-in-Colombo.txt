Emergency power cuts had been imposed in several areas in Colombo following water level rising in the Kelani river, the Ceylon Electricity Board said.

It said the power cuts were imposed in Sedawatta, Kohilawatte, Kolonnawa, Wellampitiya, Kotikawatte, Sinhapura and Orugodawatta as a precaution measure.

The power cut would be in force until the rising of the water level stabilized, it said.
