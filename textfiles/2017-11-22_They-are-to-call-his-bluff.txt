They are to call his bluff


	



 

A brag made by a purohita that the ‘JO guys’ would be treated to a good body massage if they visited the estate sector for politicking has triggered a sensation in political circles. 

 


The purohita aspiring to ascend the throne in the estate-kingdom has been talking big and throwing his weight about in the hill country ever since the decline of the ‘cockerel’ dynasty, they say. Reacting angrily to the purohita’s boast, the JO big guns have decided to call his bluff.


The JO will soon visit the purohita’s home turf itself to meet his challenge.  They have also planned to give the purohita a call to announce their visit on time for him to be ready with his ‘masseurs’, they say.
