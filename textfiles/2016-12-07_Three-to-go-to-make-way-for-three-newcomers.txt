Three to go to make way for three newcomers?


	



 

Speculation is rife in political circles these days that three politicos who made their way to Diyawanna through the Betel leaf list are about to step down to make way for three other newcomers.

 


One of the outgoing trio is reportedly a minority community leader holding State purohita status and he has been offered a gubernatorial office. 


The other two are a young politico referred to as ‘Tilake’ and a Northerner respectively.


By the way, there is a big surprise in store for all: A powerful character of the previous regime, who had a big say in defence matters is tipped to be one of the incoming lucky trio! However, he is yet to be sounded on the windfall in the offing. A youth leader hailing from Wayamba is expected to be another lucky one. A name closely linked to the Left is mentioned as the most likely third lucky one.


Meanwhile, the highly dejected Green party backbenchers are said to be getting invitations to one tamasha after another these days. This is said to be one way of consoling them.
