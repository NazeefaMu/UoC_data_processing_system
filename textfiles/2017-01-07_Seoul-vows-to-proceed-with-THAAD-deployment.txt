RT.COM/ 6 Jan, 2017 -  South Korea’s determination to deploy its US THAAD anti-missile systems is widening the rift with its powerful neighbour China, who has urged Seoul to reconsider its decision.   
The Chinese Foreign Ministry again reminded Seoul of its strategic “concerns” and “clear opposition” to Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) deployment on South Korean soil after Washington and Seoul struck a deal in July amid new threats from North Korea.
