The lawsuit filed against MP Wimal Weerawansa by JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva for the publication and distribution of a book titled "Neththa Venuwata Etta" was re-fixed for trial on March 10 and 15 by the Commercial High Court today.

Appearing before court, Weerawansa today sought permission to attend today’s parliamentary session. Thereafter, Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne re-fixed the trial.

In the law suit, plaintiff Tilvin Silva sought a restraining order to prevent the defendant from printing, publishing and distributing the book titled 'Naththa Wenuwata Aththa'.

The plaintiff also claimed Rs. 10 million as damages for violating the provisions of the Intellectual Property Act by publishing the book, in which defendant had allegedly included the political ideology of the JVP. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
