BASL urges president to withdraw extension


	

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) urged President Maithripala Sirisena to withdraw the extension of the previous government’s order to call out the armed forces in circumstances endangering public security where the police are inadequate to deal with such situations.
 
The BASL in a statement urged President Sirisena to review the situation and rescind the recent extension under the Public Security Ordinance or refrain from extending this Order when its validity period expires in three weeks’ time.  
President Maithripala Sirisena on February 2, extended for one month the operation of the previous Order made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The BASL had earlier maintained that there was no factual or lawful justification for the previous Order and that, the Order should be rescinded. (LS)
