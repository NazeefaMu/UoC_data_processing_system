The Navy will have to carry out an investigation on the foreign visits of former President's son Yoshitha Rajapaksa, State Minister for Defence Ruwan Wijewardene told Parliament today.

State Minister Wijewardene who was responding to an oral question raised by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa, said the investigations had to be carried out once Mr .Rajapaksa was available for it after the ongoing court proceedings.

Mr. Wijewardene said Mr. Rajapaksa had undertaken 27 foreign tours during his career in the Navy. He said Mr. Rajapaksa had visited Ukraine, UK and the US for training while he had travelled to Japan and Malaysia for Rugby tours and to Russia and Australia on private visits from time to time. These tours have been made from time to time from 2008 to 2015.

It was also revealed that Mr. Rajapaksa was an acting assistant lieutenant in 2008 when he was sent for a course on combat employment and action management in Russia though the Russian government had invited a lieutenant for the course.

It was revealed that the Navy did not have any details about the institutions in which Mr Rajapaksa served as a director while serving in the navy. (Yohan Perera)
