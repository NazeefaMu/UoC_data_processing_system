The body of 52-year-old retired sergeant major, who is alleged to have committed suicide in Kegalle on Friday, will be exhumed today on a court order obtained by the CID because it had failed to remove the fingerprints from the body before burial.

Sgt. Major Ilandarage Jayamanne, who resided in Kegalle is alleged to have committed suicide after writing a letter claiming responsibility for the killing of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunge.

Mr. Wickrematunge was shot in the head at Attidiyain Dehiwala on January 8, 2009 by two gunmen on a motorcycle. (Rohan Kumara)
