Fear of sickness leads to 'Angelina Jolie' syndrome

RUSSIA: Highly commercialised standards of health and beauty can lead to the 'Angelina Jolie' syndrome - taking preventive action, such as surgery on a healthy body, for a hypothetical disease, researchers have claimed.
The politicisation and commercialisation of health issues in today's Western culture have led to growing healthism - a peremptory idea of self-preserving behaviour.
This approach criticises everything that fails to fit into the glamorous standards of a beautiful, young and slim body, researchers said.
In extreme forms, healthism is close to eugenics, which selects a 'correct' heredity.
However, even simple concerns about the 'standards' of physical condition may provoke hypercorrection, such as surgery on a healthy body, said Evgenia Golman, from the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Russia.
Angelina Jolie syndrome has been frequently mentioned in the media recently, implying increased attention to the probability of dangerous diseases, researchers said.
The famous case of the Hollywood actress, who underwent a preventive mastectomy, is symptomatic of this obsession and fits into the healthism concept.
However, Jolie's story is an extreme manifestation of the 'new understanding of health'. More widespread displays of healthism include the boom in diets, fitness, plastic surgery and organic food, as well as the popularity of mobile apps for health monitoring.
Such 'body worship' is extensively supported by beauty salons, manufacturers of 'superhealthy' food, fitness and yoga centres, and even healthcare officials in many countries.
Popular healthcare policy today often shifts the responsibility for health from healthcare institutions to individuals themselves, and shifts the focus from treatment to prevention, including prevention of even purely hypothetical pathologies, Golman said. Preventive medicine undoubtedly helps prevent many diseases and can saves a lot of resources for families.
