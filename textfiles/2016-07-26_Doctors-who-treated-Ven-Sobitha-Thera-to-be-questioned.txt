Colombo Chief Magistrate allowed the special panel of Colombo National Hospital doctors who conducted an inquiry into the death of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera to question the doctors who treated the Thera in Sri Lanka.

The directive was given on July 18 by the Magistrate on a request made by CNH Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe on July 12.

Dr. Anil Jasinghe in a letter to the Magistrate’s Court said the panel which conducted the inquiry had decided to question some of the doctors who treated the Thera.

Earlier, the Court directed Dr. Jasinghe to appoint a special panel of doctors to investigate death of Ven. Sobitha Thera following a request made by the CID on a complaint received from Ven. Uduwe Dammaloka Thera.

In a complaint to the CID the monk had said an autopsy has to be carried out because the details of the treatment were missing. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
