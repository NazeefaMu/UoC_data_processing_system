Ready co-operation softened their hearts?


	



 

Ratnapura was the district that suffered most in the recent disaster. The Diyawanna members of the JO group hailing from the district too had buckled down to relief and rescue operations in dead earnest.

 


 While being in the thick of the relief work, these members had occasion to seek the help of the Blue party purohitas to obtain fresh supplies of essential goods.  However, due to the poor response received from the Blue party purohitas, they had been compelled to seek help from the Green party counterparts. 


The response they had received from the Green party purohitas had been prompt and positive. 
The Green party purohitas had not only complied with their requests promptly, they had made it a point to check whether the goods or the services asked for were duly delivered.  The JO members had been so impressed with the ready co-operation received from the Green party purohitas, they had decided they should hereafter have second thoughts before criticizing them in public, they say.
