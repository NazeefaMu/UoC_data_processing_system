An Anthonian cricket revival?

As one of the first schools to play the game, St Anthony's College Katugastota has a great cricketing heritage, producing many exceptional cricketers over the past 109 years. The Antonians history has been so rich in the cricket field, that it requires a book with many chapters to do justice to all the proud cricketers who have emerged from that institution.
Their most looked forward game is against Trinity College. The first encounter was played at the Bogambara grounds in March 1914 with the Antonians winning the game. Sad, to say in the last two or three year's Antonian cricket has not been what it was and what it should be. They are now playing in division II.
The old boys give their best support but there is something wrong down the line. According to some old boys who love cricket and support cricket, the down fall is that there is no good coordination, between the team and the officer of the school who is in charge of the sport. Now it is the right time to show him the exit door from cricket. At one time the Antonians had the best cricket lovers to be in charge of the game.
The present principal Rev. Fr. Henry Wijeratne is trying his best to bring cricket back to the position where it was together with their cricket wing. The side is formidable which includes most of last season's players. A Kaniska Ugalpaya leads the side with Mohamed Alfer as the vice captain. Old boy Prasad Ranawake is the coach. At one time they were a major force in school cricket.
This Katugastota school has not only produced several champion teams but have also produced some of the finest cricketers who have done the school, Kandy and the country proud with their achievements - the greatest of them being Muthiah Muralitharan.
Their matches for the current season are against Kalutara Vidyalaya sponsored by Group 99, v S. Thomas' College Mt. Lavinia by Group 93, v Kingswood by Zaharan and Simry, v Dharmaraja by Group 2000, v SDS Jayasinghe, v St. Benedict's by SACKOBA Qatar, v St.Peter's by Hassan, v Sri Priyaratana by Anto Aus group 92, v St. Xavier's by Group of 98, and Big Match by Group 80.

Later Municipal Commissioner late D.H. de Silva gave a big hand for tennis as a coach and promoter and he is the one who got more courts with the help of then mayor late Thilak Ratnayake.
