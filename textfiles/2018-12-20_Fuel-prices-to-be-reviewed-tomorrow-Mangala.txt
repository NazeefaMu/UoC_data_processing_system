Fuel prices are to be reviewed tomorrow by comparing prices in the world market, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.

“We would compare the fuel price with the global market prices and will do a fresh review tomorrow,” he said.

While speaking to the media he said that the fuel prices had come down in the world market, so prices should be reduced in Sri Lanka as well.

“The pricing formula will be active from now on, and any fluctuation in the global market should have an effect here,” he said.

Earlier, the fuel prices were reviewed based on the pricing formula on the 10th of every month based on global prices.

Former Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa used to reduce fuel prices based on the world price. 

“Former Minister gave fuel price concessions with the use of our fuel pricing formula,” he said.
“We do not give false reliefs to people as what was done by the former Finance Minister. Those reliefs were worthless,” Minister Samaraweera said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
