A retiring headmistress claims that young girls need to choose between a career and a family in early life
Sorry girls, you can't have it all

Vivienne, who was awarded Tatler's Best Headteacher of a Public School last year, said she supports women who choose not to ‘combine’ motherhood and a career.

In the interview with Absolutely Education magazine she also said: ‘I'm sorry, I'm not a feminist. I believe there is a glass ceiling – if we tell them there isn’t one, we are telling them a lie.’
She said: ‘Young girls have massive options these days and some of them will make a decision that they don't want to combine everything and that is as valid as making the decision that you do want to combine everything.’
The headteacher of the £13,000-a-year school, which counts Cara Delevingne, Jackie Collins and Jemima Khan among its star-studded alumni, added that she believes that such a decision should be made as soon as possible for young women.
She continued: ‘We all have a biological calendar and you have to make decisions about your entire working life, which probably goes up to about 77 now, but you have to make decisions about 40 per cent of your life early on.’
Vivienne added that the right career can be, for some women, as satisfying as starting a family.She revealed that she believes that a job can be as fulfilling as starting a family

‘If you're lucky enough to find yourself in a job that you love, it could be very emotionally fulfilling. I am not saying it is as emotionally fulfilling as having children but [that love for a career] sometimes that means that the decision ends up being right.’
Her comments, which are bound to upset women who believe that they can be mothers and career women at the same time, come after one of Britain’s top NHS fertility specialists wrote to education secretary Nicky Morgan demanding that girls of school age are taught about the dangers of delaying motherhood.
In the letter, seen by The Mail on Sunday, consultant gynaecologist Professor Geeta Nargund wrote: ‘I have witnessed all too often the shock and agony on the faces of women who realise they have left it too late to start a family.
‘For so many, this news comes as a genuine surprise and the sense of devastation and regret can be overwhelming.
Fertility issue
‘And so often the cry will be “Why did no one warn me about this?”’

Fertility issues placed a ‘costly and largely unnecessary burden on the NHS’, she said, warning that the IVF bill ‘looks set only to increase’.
Hundreds of millions is already spent on IVF, with each treatment ‘cycle’ costing around £5,000.
Arguing passionately for fertility lessons, she urged Mrs Morgan: ‘Information is power and the best way to empower people to take control of their fertility is through education.’
Prof Nargund said: ‘Ideally, if a woman is ready for a child, she should start trying by the time she is 30. She should consider having a child early because as a woman gets older, her fertility declines sharply.’
At the time a Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Sex and relationship education is compulsory in all maintained secondary schools.
‘We also expect academies and free schools to deliver relationship education.
‘We trust schools to ensure the education they provide meets the needs of particular students. As such, they are free to talk about fertility or any other relevant issues.’
