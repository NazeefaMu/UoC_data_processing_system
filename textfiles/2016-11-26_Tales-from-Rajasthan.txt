Tales from Rajasthan, an art exhibition organized by the ‘Treasures of Asia Gallery’ and curated by Lilani Perera, was inaugurated on Nov. 24 with the participation of Indian Cultural Centre Director Rajashree Behera as the chief guest. The exhibition will be held until November 27 at 168/1, Inner flower Road, Colombo 7. An eye-catching collection of miniature paintings by award-winning artists were on display.

The paintings were done mostly using natural colours organically acquired from vegetables to minerals on silk materials to canvases and handmade paper. The paintings showcased fine detailing and the themes included Indian gods and folklore and many other historical contexts such as incidents from the life of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Indian miniature painting tradition evolved and flourished in the royal courts of Rajputhana in India.
