Kapuralas at the Maha Devale in Ruhuna are going through an unusually busy time these days, they say.

 


With the news taking wings that yet another reshuffle of the pack is in the offing, a host of politicos had taken advantage of the New Year vacation to rush to the Ruhuna Devale to offer poojas to the powerful deity.


Most politicos who had made generous cash offerings to the Kapuralas conducting the poojas had conveyed to them their wish to get a good place in the new top team about to be formed.


By the way, the kapuralas who had made supplications on behalf of two politicos from Gampaha and Colombo had assured them of the deity’s sure-fire intervention, they say.
