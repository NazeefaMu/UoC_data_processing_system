Going easy on some and hard on others!


	



 

An edict issued by a khakied top brass to his subordinates in a key division had left them flabbergasted, they say.

 


According to this unprecedented edict, the sleuths attached to this division are required when it comes to enforcing the law against some select people, to treat even some minor civil offences alleged to have been committed by them as serious criminal offences. 
The subordinates fear to explain to this high up the possible repercussions they could face in the future for twisting the law because he would not tolerate any negative response from them. 
The subordinates would discuss in hushed tones among themselves the injustice they are compelled to suffer, but would dare not openly complain, for fear of reprisals, they say.
