Hardcore 7 waiting for opportune moment


	



 

The sensational news in the recent past that a 20-member rebel group in the Green party was poised for a do-or-die battle to bring about a radical change in the party hierarchy kept even the party members and sympathizers at the grassroots level on their toes. In fact, it was welcome news for them for they were eagerly looking forward to a revival of the party with the old set giving way to new young blood.

 

However, the party leader soft-pedalled the main demand after making some patchwork changes and embarked as usual on a policy of appeasement and procrastination. 


Meanwhile, the rebels began moving away from the group one by one grabbing whatever carrot held out to them by the leadership. And it has come to light now that the original 20 has now come down to 7.  However, this hardcore 7 are getting the backing of a powerful section of seniors from behind the scene and they are set to raise their war cry come the announcement of the next big poll, they say.
