Bus fares for private busses are expected to be increased by a minimum of 10 percent with effect from next week, the Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said today.

Addressing a press conference he said the decision was made in line with the recent increase in fuel prices by the government.

Wijeratne said Association had informed the National Transport Commission (NTC) yesterday of the change in fares.

The NTC is yet to approve the decision. Accordingly, the minimum fare of Rs. 10 will increase to Rs. 11. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
