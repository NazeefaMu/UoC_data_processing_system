President to visit Thailand

President Maithripala Sirisena will undertake an official visit to the Kingdom of Thailand from November 1 to 4 at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayuth Chan-o-Cha.
The visit also coincides with the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Thailand. During the visit, President Sirisena will be received in audience by Crown Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, and bilateral discussions will be held between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Chan-o-Cha. The discussions will focus on areas of mutual interest to enhance closer links and cooperation between the two countries.
President Sirisena will also address the business forum organised by the Thai Joint Standing Committee on Commerce, Industry and Banking.
Associated with this occasion would be Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Affairs Minister Somkid Jatusripitak. President Sirisena will also launch the exposition of the Sacred Relics from the Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya in Puttamonthon.
The exposition will continue until November 16.
A statue of the Gauthama Buddha will also be gifted to the people of Thailand as a symbol of the close friendship maintained between Sri Lanka and Thailand, based on Buddhist links that pre-dates the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries. Sixty priests from temples across Sri Lanka will also travel to Thailand to be part of the religious events which are scheduled for this occasion.
