The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members of the Unity Government would continue to remain in it, backing SLFP Chairman and President Maithripala Sirisena, Minister S.B. Dissanayake today said.

However, he said they would continue to push for drastic changes in the government including changes in portfolios.

“Our objective of appointing one of our SLFP members as the Prime Minister remains the same. These changes should neither be delayed nor hurried,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
