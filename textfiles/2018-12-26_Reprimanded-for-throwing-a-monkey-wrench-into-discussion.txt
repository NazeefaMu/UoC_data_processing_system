Reprimanded for throwing a monkey wrench into discussion!


	



 

A group of Green seniors had met at Temple Trees the other day to discuss a proposal to form a broad Greens-led political alliance to face the upcoming national polls.

 


While the deliberations were underway, a group of Diyawanna backbenchers too joined the talks. 


They discussed the political parties and groupings which had expressed their willingness to enter the proposed alliance. And some of them pointed out that unprecedented number of organizations too had pledged their support to the alliance.  Most of them also commented on the name already proposed for the alliance. 


Presently the attention of the participants was directed to choosing a suitable symbol for the alliance.  Most party seniors expressed the view that the symbol to be picked should be one of a kind that the people would easily get familiar with so that it could soon become a household word.
At this stage, a young Diyawanna member raised his voice.  “If you will listen to me,” he said. “I can suggest the most ideal symbol for our alliance!”


“What is it?” a party senior asked.


“Appe! Hopper!” said the young member.


The member may have expected the audience to greet his sally with a burst of laughter. But the instant reaction was just the opposite. For a moment there was a pin-drop silence. And then the member became the target of angry stares and scowls of all participants.


Later several party seniors berated the young member for trying to make fun out of a serious discussion, they say.
