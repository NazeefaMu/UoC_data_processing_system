Judiciary dignity misunderstood

Issue No 1 SW makes us believe that we are possessed of an impeccable infallible and ideal judiciary with a long history committed to the hallowed values of independence and integrity.
All manmade institutions in there incipient stages were equipped mainly by men of great of integrity; however this purity could only be maintained only if the conditions on which the institutions were founded were not adversely affected. Judges and the Judiciary are like other organs comprise of men and women of human failings. It is the atmosphere and the conditions which prevail in the protection of the judiciary that guarantee its independence. Whatever the provisions are constitutionally and legislatively created if in fact legislature becomes the mere adjunct of the executive and judiciary is directly opened to the influence of the executive the mechanism provided the independence is bound to be tampered with.
With the emergence of the superpower Executive under Jayewardene regime where by a constitutional sleight of hand, eight Supreme Court judges were sacked by the executive president at his whim and fancy. This left the judiciary in most vulnerable position and a lastingly servile quality was the infused into the judiciary. It culminated in the attempted impeachment of the then CJ. The resulting position was an intimidated and emasculated judiciary. Such a situation inevitably begets a diabolically corrupt an evil product in the form of a phenomenon represented by Sarath N Silva CJ who’s nearly decade of stewardess as CJ is a regarded darkest chapter in the history of judiciary in this country.
Misappropriation of public funds
Victor Ivan’s book the unfinished struggle about the Sarath N Silva era is the most telling indictment on a Chief Justice and the judicial system under him, ever written in the legal history of our legal annals. The fact that no attempt has been made up to date to controvert the allegations in his work is ample testimony of the accuracy of the facts there in.
Sarath N Silva’s post retrial conduct is not second to his incumbency. For he brought to judiciary to its very nadir by his confession of his corrupt judgment to exculpate former president from incarceration for a massive fraud and criminal misappropriation of public funds.
Mahinda Rajapaksa shamelessly dismantles the last vestiges’ of the mechanism of the independence of the judiciary and the Attorney Generals Department. Thus judges who not prepared to do his biding incurred his wrath culminating in famous impeachment Dr. Shirani Bandaranayke. It was nationally and internationally the most dastardly and corrupt incident in the judiciary which stinks to high heaven.
Although a constitutional machinery was provided it itself was essentially flawed in the most arbitrary salvage and barbaric manner in which it was executed by and MR’s lackeys leaves nothing to be desired.
It was obvious that all powerful Executive who had the entire legislature under his thumb and prepared to do his bidding fulfilled his whims by punishing the CJ and got his goons’ underworld elements to humiliate the CJ and oust her in the manner that shocked the conscious in the entire civilized world. It appears that SW has completely glossed over this history that cannot be erased from the democratic world. It is that same loss of memory that prompts him praise Mohan Peris as an exemplary CJ who was MR’s emissary sent to justify the disappearance of journalist Eknaligoda at the HR committee in Europe there in a despicable attempt to save face of his lord and master openly and unashamedly prevaricated by stating that the disappeared journalist was living in a foreign country. As a sequel to this incident in a local court he was constrained to admit that he lied abroad about the very journalist.
His conduct as Chief Justice was hilariously shameful when he is accompanied by his Lord and Master to the Vatican and joins in the private New Year celebrations in his private residence.
MR regime
The crowning moment of his carrier was when MR was breathing his politically last breath at temple trees where he rushed to give him life saving dose of political elixir so that he could extend his political life despite the emphatic verdict of the people at the midnight of 8th January 2015.
It is sufficient testimony to his judicial integrity and is a pity that the plot has not being unearthed. It should have definitely led to a bloody civil strife master minded by MR military siblings Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Thereafter Mohan Peiris started bargaining for a diplomatic post to give up his position as CJ and sought to obtain Presidential blessings to continue as the CJ with an unreserved promise to give judgements as per the wish of the Executive. If he continued as CJ he would have blended backwards to do the bidding of the present leaders in the same servile manner.
SW also raises the other issue that the BASL headed by Upul Jayasuriya was politically motivated which according to SW militated against avowed the objectives of the BASL and contributed to this regime change. That the BASL should have been alive to the political conditions of the MR regime is truly the function of the BASL. In that his treatment of the Judiciary and his human rights record were matters that directly concerned the legal fraternity and the community which it was bound to serve. SW should also remember that the BASL was not the only professional organization that joined in Unison to establish the law and order of the country which was ruled by the law of the jungle. In this endeavour Upul had every thing to loose including his life as Rajapaksa’s sent killer squads from the state intelligence services gunning for him. Upul was unshaken and faced such threats with fortitude. He led the bar fearlessly with the support of entire Bar with the exception of those who have had the benefit of diplomatic postings and other crumbs of the then regime.
However the BASL in keeping with its traditions of impartiality and fair play to acquaint itself about the two main policies of the two main Presidential Candidates and invited them for a public discussion monitored by a highly enlightened panel. But MR has nothing to do with it whilst the other candidate responded. BASL did not desire an ex parte discussion. Therefore our membership was denied the opportunity.
Thereupon the BASL being aware the machinery of corruption, bribery and violence that was to be set in motion at the Presidential Election carried on a highly effective campaign to ensure a clean and in corruptible election.
BASL is proud being instrumental to bringing about a clean election where the people were free to articulate there choice of the leader amidst obstacles. It is indeed in the best traditions of other bar associations like Pakistan and Malaysia etc.
It is in this context that SW raises the question that about the High Commission of Human Rights recommending a hybrid tribunal probe into excess due to a civil war in the North.
It might be reminded to SW that the very idea of an international tribunal stemmed from on solemn undertaking given by MR immediately after ending of the war which he contemptuously abandon with his usual obstinate approach.
International community
However as it now stands there are consensus that the local tribunal with international assistance from foreign judges’ etc., should be the structure the tribunal that should be set up. The participation of international element is the direct result of the loss of confidence not only in the domestic community but also in the international community on our judiciary as it is presently constituted.
This has led to foreign participation in order to give this probe a meaningful content and element of credibility in the communities affected by war as well as in the international community. The view of the Tamil community seeking an international inquiry is voiced by the CM of the NPC.
Whatever the nature of the inquiry, its objective is reconciliation, accountability, harmony between communities within the territorially integrated country. Unless and until various communities of this country are prepared to accept there culpability and accountability in the past reconciliation among the various communities will be a futile dream.
As far as Sir Lanka is cornered foreign tribunals are not alien to it. We remember the Commission of inquiry appointed by the former President D. B. Wijetunga to inquire the death of Hector Kobbakaduwa and nine other officials. It was headed by a judge from New Zealand and two others from Ghana and Nigeria which more fully completed the inquiry and submitted a report.
Therefore it is the duty of the well meaning citizens of this country to accept this tribunal which has to function according to the Sri Lankan Laws – so that final aim of integration and reconciliation will become a reality. Otherwise we will continue to become a barbaric nation having internecine warfare at there regular agenda with no hope to building a united nation committed to territorial integrity and fully reconcile healthy nation.
The other issue raised by SW is regarding the BASL been funded by an organization called USAID. I have been the member of the Bar Council from his inception and aware that it has received funds from various agencies like LAWASIA. However under the last regime and the present regime of the BASL there was a remarkable rise in the improvement of the working conditions of the lawyers like bringing the Colombo Law Library to a position that it stands on par which in any law library in any developed country. The continued legal education program without any break and holding of round table discussions with, out station bars and the improvement of the local Bars by updating their libraries are some of the projects funded by the USAID. Sophisticated and modernized BASL Auditorium named in memory of the 1st President of the BASL Dr HW Jayawardena QC at a cost of Rs 12 Million is a testimony to the role played by the USAID project.
Countries that grant aid to uplift our legal system and legal fraternity have also a self interest in giving aid in that it is to their interest that our legal system upholds the rule of law and independence of the judiciary for the reason that any genuine and bona fide investors, businessman and other groups from countries like UK. US, Europe would like only to invest commercial and have commercial relations with a country where the rule of law, equality before law and independence of the judiciary prevail. It is those countries that which do not value such tenets that would like to deal with countries where the law of the jungle prevails like in the previous regime where unsolicited transactions, Commissions, bribery, corruption sleazed became the order of the day and judicial discipline thrown to the winds.
Bar Association
This same project that was agreed with the then Ministry of Justice was withdrawn by the USAID due to the appalling conditions of the Rule of Law was saved by Upul who was the then President of the BASL, was a feather on his cap as he knew very well that the Rajapaksas had cut all the support it used to get from its traditional sources and state corporations.
In this context we are all aware how MR regime accepted funds by way of loans from foreign countries and almost mortgaged the country and placed the country in grave jeopardy where territorial integrity and our sovereignty were seriously compromised and the country is today facing serious impasse as a consequence.
We must thus appreciate USAID in this spirit which is in the mutual interest of the Donor and the Donee that Democracy, Freedom, Fair play and Rule of Law prevails resulting in peace, prosperity and harmony among countries. However it is important that this aid is not concentrated at the top but should trickle down to the grass roots. However our freedom as a robust fearless Bar Association and our independence should in no way be compromised and sacrificed at the altar of any aid local or international. I am confident that the present and past Presidents and its Committee are and were, respectively, fully mindful of such pitfalls when they accept such funds with no strings attached and utilize them with total accountability, integrity and transparency which will silence such critics like SW.
(Sarath Bandara PC completed his golden Jubilee at the Bar. He is one of the most respected lawyers a mentor and an inspiration for the junior and senior members of the Bar.)
