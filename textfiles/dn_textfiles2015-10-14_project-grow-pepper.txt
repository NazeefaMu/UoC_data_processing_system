Project to grow pepper

The Export Agriculture Department has implemented a project to grow pepper in tea lands in the Patadumbara, Panwila and Medamahanuwara Agrarian Services divisions.
It will be an additional source of income for up country tea estate owners.
Under this project, the department will supply free saplings and seeds to cultivators.
