Agriculture development programme to enhance farmers income

The government's intention is to implement the agriculture development programme to enable the farmers to enhance their income, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said. Dissanayaka said, Simultaneously the farmers are being encouraged to ensure and prioritize the qualitative character of their farming, storing and marketing practices.
The minister said so participating at the state sponsored World Food Day national ceremony at the Institute Post Harvest Technology, Anuradhapura on October 16, aiming to eradicate malnutrition and hunger in the world.
The programme was organised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme in collaboration with the Agriculture Ministry.
The minister said the farmer community has been focusing more attention on gaining profits as much as possible from cultivation.
It has been a tradition on the part of officials too responsible for upgrading agriculture to educate the farmers in achieving an unprecedented harvest from whatever they cultivate, such as paddy, maize, soya, undhu, etc. But in the past our agriculture depended on its qualitative nature.
Dissanayaka indicated that at present the Agriculture Minister has been encouraging the farmers to take to grow traditional native paddy which are consisting herbal value, sans artificial fertilizer and poisonous agro chemicals thus showcasing and reflecting qualitative agriculture.
President Maithripala Sirisena has a far sighted national agriculture policy to ensure lucrative income to the farmer and qualitative aspect of the national agriculture development exercise. On this basis under the guidance of the President a three year food production national programme was initiated recently.
The main objective of this project is to gain self-sufficiency in every food crop that could be locally cultivated successfully. Following this precedent we have been implementing an 83,000 hectares large maize cultivation project in Anuradhapura district in the 015/2016 maha cultivation season aiming to stop importing of 1,500 mt of maize annually, the minister said. He said that the country was self-sufficient in paddy. Also in the efforts to become self sufficient in maize, a micro interest loan facility was being offered to maize farmers at Rs. 1,500 per acre, he revealed.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Sri Lanka Residential Representative, Beth Crawford said that Sri Lanka has received the membership of the FAO around 60 years back. Where as the FAO commemorating the 70th anniversary in 2015.
It is a fact that 75 percent of the world population suffer from poverty. They shall be educated regarding social security. The poverty level in Sri Lanka which stood at 10 percent in 2002 has dropped up to 6.7 percent which is a good omen, she said.
