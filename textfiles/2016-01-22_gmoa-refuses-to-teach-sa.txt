	The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today vowed to abstain from teaching medical students of unapproved medical colleges such as the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) who come to State hospitals for clinical training.

Pledging their support for the ongoing Sathyagraha by undergraduates of the Ragama and Karapitiya Medical Faculties demanding the abolition of SAITM, the GMOA said it would in no way help medical students who have not been approved by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
GMOA media spokesman Dr. Naveen de Soyza said the government must resolve the concerns of the medical students who have taken to the streets for the second time since the 1988-1989 insurrection.
“We warn the government. This could turn violent just like 88-89 uprising where thousands of students fought against the then government. These students are best result holders countrywide. We should not allow them to waste their valuable time on such issues which should be addressed by the authorities,” Dr. de Soysa said.
The Ragama Medical Faculty students begun a Sathyagraha opposite the Colombo North Teaching Hospital and Karapitiya undergraduates are protesting opposite their faculty in Galle.
Sathyagrahas campaigns will be held opposite the Colombo Medical Faculty and at the Galaha Junction in Peradeniya from Jan. 25.
Speaking on the alleged kidney transplant racket where six Sri Lankan doctors are said to be involved in, the GMOA Dr. de Soysa they would investigate whether the six doctors were members of the GMOA and would take take disciplinary action against them if they were found to be members of the GMOA.
