The joint opposition (JO) said yesterday said the President has torn his packet of gravy and it has spilled all over by seeking a Supreme Court determination on the expiry of his term of office.

According to the president’s office, President Maithripala Sirisena has sought a Supreme Court determination to ascertain when his term of office ends in the wake of the 19th Amendment to Constitution reducing the President's tenure from the earlier six years to five.

MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena told a news conference that by seeking a determination from the SC, the President has torn the gravy packet and spilled it all over Kole Iragena, ange halagena,”

He said the seeking of a clarification on the President's tenure would not impact on the local government elections.

The MP said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was a hoax.

“Where is the independent police commission and the independent elections commission? Had there been an independent elections commission, the LG election would have been held already,” he said and added that the Rajagiriya flyover had been vested with the public after reducing it’s length.

“The flyover should have been longer. The government has deviated from the original plan,” he said adding that others were attempting to score points using development projects initiated by the previous government.

“This is similar to someone wearing borrowed clothes and flaunting them saying it belongs to them,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
