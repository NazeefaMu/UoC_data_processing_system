A festival of authentic Thai & Chinese cuisine

The sweetness of basil that blends perfectly with the sharpness of chili, tossed together in a Pad Thai dish...or the balanced aroma of a stir fried prawns with cashew nuts and bamboo shoots...authentic Chinese and Thai dishes are hailed as all time favourites among food connoisseurs and others alike.
A festival of authentic Thai and Chinese cuisine unfolds with a fine sense of hospitality unique to The Kingsbury at their signature Chinese Restaurant Yue Chuan till September 30, bringing together a fusion of much loved Thai and Chinese dishes.
The Thai cuisine is perfectly complimented by the authentic Chinese gastronomical fare that assures Yue Chuan's own unique place in Colombo's culinary circles. Yue Chuan has come to epitomize fine Szechuan Chinese cuisine and also presents an array of Sri Lankan Chinese Fusion dishes to compliment Sri Lankan taste buds.
All time Thai favourites such as Raw Papaya Salad, Pad Thai, Green & Red Curry and Chicken with Sweet Chili Sauce, among many others, are presented with authentic flavours unique to Thai cuisine. Executive Chef Kithsiri De Silva has personally curated the dishes on offer, along with The Kingsbury's team of Thai and Chinese chefs and the Thai Chef specially flown in for the festival.
The presence of a Thai hostess who will guide the patrons on Thai dishes and also share insights on Thai traditions and customs that add a different dimension to their much renowned cuisine, will heighten the experience.
For those pursuing authentic Chinese dishes such as Roast Peking Duck in Plum Sauce, Szechuan Chili Pepper Squid and Wonton Soup that infuse the rich flavours of Szechuan cuisine, the specially curated festival will strike a fine balance among a plethora of tastes.
"Authentic Thai and authentic Chinese dishes present endless possibilities for connoisseurs pursuing fine cuisine. It is also a great opportunity for families to dine together and mix and match an impeccable combination of tastes and choices in one sitting", Corporate Communications & PR Manager Dinithi Somaratne stated.
The Kingsbury's team of chefs specializing Chinese and Thai cuisine have created signature dishes that represent a gourmet's delight for everyone with prices that are reasonable said the F&B Manager Iyantha Abeysinghe.
The tastefully decorated setting at The Kingsbury's Yue Chuan is the perfect place to savour a meal of fine food, atmosphere and conversation, bringing back the concept of good times, good food and good company.
