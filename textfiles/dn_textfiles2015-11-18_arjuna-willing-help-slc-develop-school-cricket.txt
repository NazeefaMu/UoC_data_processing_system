Arjuna willing to help SLC develop school cricket

Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga said that he was willing to lend a helping hand to Sri Lanka Cricket to develop school cricket in the country.
“School cricket standards have declined in the last few years, not only in Trincomalee but also in the entire country,” said Minister Ranatunga speaking at a function held at the jetty of Trincomalee Harbour yesterday.
“The reason is that some senior national players got involved in politics and dictated terms to the hierarchy of Sri Lanka Cricket. The duty of the cricketers is to play the game and not to get involved in administration.
“The national team has several talented youngsters and I'm happy that skipper Angelo Mathews is showing maturity as a captain. He is able to take decisions on his own on the field,” he said.
Speaking further Minister Ranatunga said that Sri Lanka has to prepare for the World Twenty20 next year and the Cricket World Cup.
“Sri Lanka needs administrators with a vision to help the country to produce a World Cup winning team. I'm willing to help Sri Lanka cricket with my knowledge in developing school cricket which could help to produce talented cricketers who will go onto represent the country,” Ranatunga said.
