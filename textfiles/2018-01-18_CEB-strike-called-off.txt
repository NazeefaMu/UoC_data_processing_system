CEB strike called off


	

The Ceylon Electricity Board Joint Trade Union Alliance suspended its strike after handing over letter to Prime Minister’s secretary Saman Ekanayeke.

Convener Ranjan Jayalal said they had requested the Secretary inquire into the CEB’s alleged misappropriation of some Rs.2,000 million which had been paid as a salary increments to the CEB administrative officials on November 21, 2014.

Mr. Jayalal told Daily Mirror all CEB employees would march to Colombo on February 7 and would resort to an indefinite strike if the government failed to respond positively to their reasonable demand. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
