SL helped US avoid divisions within UNHRC - CP

The Communist Party yesterday, said that Sri Lanka had helped the United States in its subtle move to avoid divisions within the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) over allegations of human rights violations in Sri Lanka.
"Sri Lanka by becoming a co-sponsor, has helped the US in its subtle move to avoid a division within the Council over this issue," said General Secretary DEW Gunasekera, in a statement recently. He said
that none of the developing countries had decided to join the core group that sponsored the resolution.
The statement further said that the statement issued by Russia and China in this regard, had clearly demonstrated their principled stand that they were totally opposed to a country's specific resolution and that Sri Lanka should be allowed to solve their domestic problems without foreign interference or intervention.
"In this connection, the Communist Party of Sri Lanka wishes to reiterate its original position that the government should have expeditiously and effectively implemented the LLRC Report in pursuance of the programme for the post conflict development - rehabilitation and reconciliation," he said.
The party reiterated its position to demand a domestic inquiry into the allegations and an exclusive domestic mechanism for the purpose, without compromising the country's sovereignty in any manner.
The statement added that the commissions appointed by the previous government in particular, its failure to implement the recommendations of the LLRC Report created conditions for external forces to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
"A striking feature of the US sponsored resolution was Sri Lanka's decision to become a co-sponsor to the resolution supported by a core group of European countries. Sri Lanka being the concerned party, had taken upon itself accountability for the alleged war crimes and violations of human rights. It has also undertaken the responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations in the resolutions sponsored by the US.
The Communist Party insists that the UNHRC Report for 2015, was fundamentally not different from the reports in respect of the previous years.
"It was based on an exclusive and external investigation into the alleged war crimes and violations of human rights," he said.
