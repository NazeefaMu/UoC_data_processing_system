Act of gallantry was cause of their amusement


	



 

A deputy hailing from the Colombo district was walking along the council lobby the other day talking to a comely fair purohita when he suddenly noticed several strands of thread sticking out from the companion’s ‘sari-pota’. 

 


Showing great concern over the ‘blemish’ on the sari-fold, he immediately stopped her and started trying to remove the jutting strands. 


Meanwhile, a group of members from both sides of the divide came on the scene and they were highly amused to find the bespectacled deputy dressed in coat and tie awkwardly bending over holding the fair one’s sari-pota.


An opposition stalwart from the group directed a barb at the deputy who kept concentrating on the delicate job of removing the strands of thread unmindful of the colleagues passing by: “You have noticed a minor defect on her sari-pota. But would you have noticed even a knife if it was placed against our neck?”


The group proceeded on their way laughing, but the deputy continued regardless, they say.
