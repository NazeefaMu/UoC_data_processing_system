A re-shuffle to move out poor performers!


	


A re-shuffle in the highest decision making body is on the horizon, they say.
Authorities from both sides in the highest echelons have agreed to carry out the changes come January. 
A few purohitas who failed to perform up to expectations are to get new subjects.  In fact, the top brass are not happy in particular with the showing by certain purohitas handling subjects carrying a direct bearing on the country’s economy, they say.
Incidentally, the Compassionate One is said to be keen on raising one or two loyalists of his to purohita status.
Meanwhile, the head of a powerful white collar figure occupying the main chair of a key state establishment is due to roll shortly, they say.
