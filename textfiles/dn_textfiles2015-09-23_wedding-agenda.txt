Robert Pattinson's family 'Relieved'
Wedding off the Agenda

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs are taking their dear time planning their wedding, with reports circulating that it's being held for the foreseeable future, but Rob's family is glad he no longer has nuptials on the brain because they're hoping they call it off for good!
A source told OKMagazine.com exclusively that "news that things aren't going well has been met with relief," by his family, who live in London.
"Rob's family are very polite to Twigs' face but they're horrified by her raunchy on-stage persona and her piercings and tattoos," the source said. They'd prefer to see him with some conservative posh British woman.
And while they had a pleasant meeting last December during the holidays, Twigs is smart enough "to see through" their British manners.
The source added that because "Twigs doesn't want to cause a family rift," their wedding is "off the agenda" for now.
"She feels it's best to just bow out of the situation gracefully," the insider added.
According to Life & Style, the pair are also having disagreements about their big day, which, of course, also has been caused by Rob's family. "Rob's family wants a lavish church ceremony, while FKA wants a small wedding in an English pub," the source said. OK! Magazine
