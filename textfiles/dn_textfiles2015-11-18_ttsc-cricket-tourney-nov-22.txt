TTSC cricket tourney from Nov. 22

The weather will play a huge role when the Travel Trade Sports Club conducts its most popular event in their Sports Events Calendar - the 38th men's and women's Softball Cricket "Sixes" 2015, on Sunday, November 22 at the Shalika and DS Senanayake College Grounds., commencing 8.00 am. The TTSC had postponed this event from October 4, due to inclement weather.
Altogether 48 men's teams and 06 women's teams have given their consent to participate up to date.
The weather will not be the only drawback for the TTSC; they are also concerned on the head on clash of their tournament with the John Keells Inter Company Softball Cricket "Sixes" on the same day at the Colts & BRC Grounds. John Keells Group have entered 13 teams and now they are in quandary to participate or not, as their loyalty first should go to their Company. Even the defending TTSC mens champion, Chaaya Tranz, Hikkaduwa is from John Keells.
The 2013 men's runner-up was Tangerine Beach, Kalutara. And the last women's champion was Amaya Lake, Dambulla and their sister hotel Amaya Hills, Kandy was the runner-up.
The TTSC failed to hold the tournament in 2014.
