The ubiquitous guest gets the cold shoulder!


	



 

There is a soft-spoken hardliner in the Group 16 who is a member of the black-coated gentry.

 


Now an ordinary backbencher, no longer burdened with a portfolio, the politico opened an office to get back to his old job. A good number of invitees attended the event and among them was a businessman-sibling of a very high political authority.


This sibling with a moniker that reminds one of a highly respected onetime leader of the country, despite his well-known family ties, is said to be a character rubbing shoulders with political heavyweights of all hues.


However, most members from the Group 16 present on the occasion had disliked his presence at the event and given him the cold shoulder.  Some of them had, in fact, made their resentment known in hushed tones to those who organized it. They had later conveyed their sentiments to the former strongman as well, they say.
