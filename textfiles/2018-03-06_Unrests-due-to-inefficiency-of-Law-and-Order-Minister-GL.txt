Referring to the recent incidents in Digana, Ampara and Thambuttegama, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Prof. G.L. Peiris said today such incidents took place as there was no effective Minister for Law and Order portfolio.

Addressing a news conference, he said it was sad to say that President Maithripala Sirisena had been unable to appoint a Law and Order Minister, who would bear and accomplish responsibilities for the well-being of society.

“President’s ineffectiveness of being unable to appoint a proper Law and Order Minister clearly denotes the inefficiency of the Government that leads to spark off violent incidents,” he said.

He said, it was the utmost responsibility of the President to appoint eligible Cabinet of Ministers who would be tasked with responsibilities,” Prof. G.L. Peiris said.

Meanwhile, he said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was entirely responsible to the downfall of the economy that had negatively affected the sustainable growth of the country.

He added that the official visit of Premier Wickremesinghe to Singapore was a joke and of no use, because the investors were not willing to invest in Sri Lanka on account of the failure of the economy.   (Sheain Fernandopulle)
