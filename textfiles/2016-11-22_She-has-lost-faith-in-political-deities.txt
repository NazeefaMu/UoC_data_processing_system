She has lost faith in political ‘deities’


	

It is a commonplace practice among the ordinary people in this country to seek the grace of a popular guardian deity whenever they find themselves in some difficulty. But the politicians and their family members would usually find a way out of any jam through the influence of a higher political authority. However, an exceptional case where the better half of a purohita had sought the grace of a popular guardian deity to secure the release of her husband remanded in connection with a fatal road accident has become the topic of an animated discourse in the public domain these days, they say.

 


When her purohita-husband was remanded, the good lady had made a vow to a popular deity with a prayer asking that her husband be released from remand custody without any delay. When her prayer was answered, the couple had visited the devalaya dedicated to this deity located in the Vanni area along with a large group of well- wishers with the usual offerings to pay the vow.
