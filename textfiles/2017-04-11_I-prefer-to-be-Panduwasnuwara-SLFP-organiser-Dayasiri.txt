Sports Minister, Dayasiri Jayasekera said he would prefer to be the SLFP organizer of Panduwasnuwara if the post was offered to him.

He said he refused to accept when offered the post of Bingiriya.

If the post of organizer for Panduwasnuwara, which is his native village, was given to him the minister said he would be able to bring back those who left the party.

He said the organizers of Nikaweratiya and Panduwasnuwara had already agreed to give him this post. (Ranjan Kasthuri)
