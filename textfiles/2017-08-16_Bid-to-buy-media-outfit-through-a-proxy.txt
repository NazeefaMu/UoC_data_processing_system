Bid to buy media outfit through a proxy?


	



 

A story coming down the grapevine says that a Malaysian investor set to buy a leading media institution in the country is here now to negotiate the deal.

 


However, a very high political authority who smelled a rat about the mega dollar deal in the offing has deployed intelligence sleuths to find out whether there is more to it than meets the eye, they say.


By the way, a story that went viral a few months ago said the media institution in question was about to change hands, but that did not come to pass. There is a business network linked to this media institution and one of its entities is being run at a loss, they say. Those at the highest echelons in yahapalanaya are reportedly keen on ascertaining whether the Malaysian investor is a genuine one or a proxy of a certain local firm at the centre of a raging controversy here. They are also interested in making way for a friendly local investor to acquire it. 


All present indications are that this media institution will become a bone of contention between the Blues and the Greens at the end of the day, informed sources say.
