He said the woman was arrested on Monday night from a house at Nawagamuwa.

The CID recovered 350 grams of gold worth Rs. 2.6 million and Rs. 50,000 in cash from the suspect’s possession.

The Spokesman said the CID officials also recovered 72 passports, 50 bank passbooks and 50 ATM cards from the woman’s possession.

“ About 52 complaints had been received by the Police alleging the woman had been defrauding money by promising Canadian jobs,” SP Gunasekera said.

She had asked job seekers to open a saving account at a bank under their name and deposit money in it. Thereafter she would take the ATM card from them and withdraw the money, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
