Sri Lanka and India is reported to hold official level talks on the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) today in Colombo.

A four-member Indian delegation is expected to arrive in the country for the talks. This is the first official level talks between the two sides on ETCA though the Government on an earlier occasion had said the agreement would be signed by the end of this year.

However, there is widespread criticism of ETCA with some political parties and professional organizations taking to the streets in opposition of this agreement. (Kelum Bandara)
