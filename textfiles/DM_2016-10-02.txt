Existing laws inadequate for child safety: Akila
	
The Existing laws and regulations in Sri Lanka are inadequate for the protection of childrens rights and to ensure their safety in the society, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said .
He was delivering a speech at an awareness programme for children and school staff on World Childrens Day held at Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) parallel to a series of programmes started by the Education Ministry and Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Ms. Dilrukshi Dias Wickremesinghe also attended the event.
I believe that existing legal framework is not efficient enough to prevent violation of the rights of our children. New laws should be introduced, he said.
Meanwhile, Minister Kariyawasam said the adults have a vital responsibility to guide children to work against corruption and bribery.
To fulfill that responsibility, we have joined hands with the Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption by launching a series of awareness programmes for our children. National Institute of Education is currently working on our proposal to include lessons on prevention of bribery and corruption into the syllabus in schools, he said.
He reiterated that corruption and bribery are the main obstacles in allocating government funds for the social and development work adding that such cancerous activities must be wiped out from the entire country.
The series of programmes is organized under Sathpiyawara awareness programme spearheaded by the Commission parallel to the International Anti-Corruption Day which falls on December 09.
This October month was named as the Month of Preventing Bribery and Corruption by Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
During October, a number of workshops and events including debates and poster competitions would be held at all government schools in collaboration with the Commission and Education Ministry. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Sexual abuse of teacher: Ex-principal ordered to pay Rs.100,000
	
Supreme Court ordered a former Principal of Mahanama College, Colombo and a male teacher accused of continuous sexual abuse of a graduate music teacher, who complained against them for harassment, to personally pay her Rs 100,000 each.
Court rebuffed the contention of the State that the Petitioner teacher, by giving an interview to the media, made a mistake by acting contrary to the Establishment Code and took cognizance that the freedom of speech was essential for the proper functioning of the democratic process and that public opinion plays a crucial role in modern democracy and was of great importance.
Justice Anil Gooneratne concurred with Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Justice Upaly Abeyrathne
The aggrieved teacher, whose name was withheld on ethical grounds, cited the Education Ministry Secretary, Members of the Public Service Commission, the former Principal of Mahanama College Premalal Kumarasiri and another teacher T.T.Malegoda as well as the Attorney General as Respondents.
J.C.Weliamuna appeared for the petitioner. Chula Bandara appeared for the said Principal. The respondent teacher was absent and unrepresented.
The Court was of the view that sexual harassment or work place stress and strain occasioned by oppressive and burdensome conduct under the guise of executive office was an infringement of the fundamental rights of the music teacher.
The Court held that the regime of affirmative rights cannot be restricted or limited by the Provisions of Establishment Code. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

SL should attend SAARC when new dates announced: GL
	
While criticizing the decision made by the government to boycott the 19th SAARC Summit, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs G. L. Peiris said that Sri Lanka should certainly attend the SAARC summit in Islamabad, Pakistan when the new dates were announced.
He said the governments decision throws serious doubt on the countrys commitment to SAARC, and had the potential to weaken the organization.
Issuing a statement, Peiris said he deeply regretted the governments decision to boycott the Summit which was scheduled to be held on October 9 and 10.
Sri Lanka is a founder member of SAARC. We have no doubt that SAARC, over the years, has made a significant contribution to strengthening the identity of our region. It has provided a useful forum for personal contact among countries of South Asia at the highest level. The deliberations of SAARC have enabled timely focus on issues relating to the political, economic and cultural development of South Asia, he said.
He emphasized that the organization which had a crucial role to play at the moment has to be protected and strengthened in every way.
We also attach the greatest value to friendship with countries which stood by Sri Lanka consistently during our struggle against terrorism and subsequently when our nation faced grave challenges at the international level when Sri Lanka was pursued relentlessly and sought to be penalized unjustly, he said in the statement.
