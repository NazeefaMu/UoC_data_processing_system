One too many for the ride


	



 

Number One recently decided to helicopter it to Wellawaya to attend a public function there. He had not invited any purohita to accompany him on this ride.

 


However, to Number One’s surprise, Long J from Wattala who had got wise to the arranged flight had arrived at the helipad where he was waiting for the helicopter.  


Meanwhile, another purohita, a Green-turned Blue from Raigam Korale had arrived at the scene. “Sir, may I too hop in so that we can proceed to Pelmadulla to attend the funeral there soon after the Wellawaya function?”


Number One making no immediate reply was mulling over the Raigam purohita’s request, when a PSD high-up addressed him: “Sir, there is room in the helicopter only for two special passengers.”
Number One had remained quiet.


In the meantime, the helicopter for Number One arrived and was ready to take in passengers. Number One first boarded the craft. Long J followed suit saying he too wanted to attend the funeral in Pelmadulla. The doors of the helicopter were closed and the helicopter took off leaving behind the purohita from Raigam Korale. 


The purohita had been so sure that he would be able to make it to Wellawaya along with Number One, he had already dispatched his official vehicle to the place where the craft was due to land.
So the disappointed one had been compelled to get down another official vehicle to get back home, they say.
