A story about a stink


	



 

This is a very unusual story about a head of a statutory body. Employees in his main office hate to go near him. And it’s a nightmarish experience for the directors to sit with him at board meetings. It is not because this bigwig is fierce or menacing, bad-tempered and given to tantrums either. It is because the odor exuding from his body is so awful and nauseating!

 


Some inquisitive ones who had made discreet inquiries had found the reason for the boss’ body odor; he does not take a bath for weeks and what is worse is that he wears the same dress for days. 
Given the sensitivity of the matter, the directors would not dare tell their boss about their problem of dealing with official matters seated close to him. However, some of them had tried to convey the message to him in subtle ways with no success so far, they say. 


The directors have seriously considered bringing their problem to the notice of the top team member responsible for overseeing the statutory body. But they have come across a discouraging snag; the bigwig and the top team member are reportedly thick pals!


The biggest irony, they say, is that the statutory body that this smelling bigwig is heading is responsible for supplying something he hardly uses - precious water!
