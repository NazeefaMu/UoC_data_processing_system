Trump supports Putin 'bombing the hell out of ISIS'

US: Moscow is "bombing the hell out of ISIS" because President Putin wants to prevent terrorism spilling into Russia, said US Presidential candidate Donald Trump, criticizing failed US Middle Eastern policies that have already turned Iraq and Libya into a total mess.
"Iraq is a disaster... Libya is not even a country," he explained. "You can make the case, if you look at Libya, look at what we did there - it's a mess. If you look at Saddam Hussein with Iraq, look what we did there - it's a mess."
Trump said that Washington is "destroying our country" by wasting too much money on Middle Eastern policies that do not seem to work: "We have spent $2 trillion in Iraq, probably a trillion in Afghanistan..."
"[Syria] is going to be the same thing," Trump said, criticizing US support of so-called moderate Syrian rebels.
At one point the interviewer mentioned that Russian airstrikes could be "hitting people we've trained," but Trump interrupted him by stating: "We are talking about people we don't even know!"
"The rebel group we have no idea ... I was talking to a general two days ago, he said: 'We have no idea who these people are.' We are training people, we don't know who they are. We are giving them billions of dollars to fight Assad," Trump said.
