Tissa’s request to travel abroad rejected


	

Colombo High Court Judge Sarojini Kusala Weearawardane today refused the request made by former health minister Tissa Aattanayake to travel to Australia between December 25 and January 13 for the purpose of visiting his daughter.

He was earlier arrested, remanded and then released on bail in a case where he was charged with displaying a fraudulent document with the forged signatures of the then common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena and the then Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe during last year’s presidential election campaign.

The Attorney General objected to the request made by Mr. Attanayake through a motion filed in the High Court on the basis that the case in which he is an accused had been fixed for March 20 to be heard on consecutive days.  (Shehan Chamika Silva)
