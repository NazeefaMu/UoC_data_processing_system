The Wild Life Department today said they had requested IGP N.K. Illangakoon to immediately issue orders to arrest the suspects involved with cruel killing of an eagle in Galle.

Wildlife Director General Chandrasiri Bandara said several Wildlife Department officials had also been sent to the area to look in the matter.

A photograph in which some men are seen attempting to kill an eagle in an inhumane manner after peeling off its feathers and cutting off its claws has gone viral on social media and news websites.

Commenting on the matter, two wildlife organizations, Freedom Sri Lanka Foundation and the Let Them Live said they would take measures to charge the culprits with inhumane animal slaughter under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (No.22) of 2009.

The organisation said several men in the picture had been identified as residents of Wanchawala in Galle.

They said the eagle is an endangered and protected species and could not be killed or sold.
Mr. Bandara said they suspected that the eagle as sea eagle.

He said several suspects in the photograph had been identified and Police had also been informed. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
