Ranil’s statement bad by law


	

The Leader of the Opposition has said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's statement regarding the Supreme Court judgment in the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was a severe blow on the independence of the judiciary, rule of law and good governance.
In a press release issued today he pointed out the Prime Minister’s statement was baseless and bad by law.
“The United National Party and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have demonstrated their attempt to uphold their principles and policies influenced by foreign elements. His statement regarding the Supreme Court judgment was a violation of the county’s sovereignty.
“In the past the Privy Council in England had the power to revise or quash the judgments of the Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court, but it was abolished by the Republican Constitution. Today the Supreme Court is the highest body of the judiciary and its judgments are final. 
“I would like to point out to the people that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement that Sri Lanka will have to depend to the decisions of the Commonwealth Judges is an attempt to undermine the Sri Lankan Courts and an undue challenge against the Supreme Court.  I stress that Prime Minister as a responsible personality should withdraw his statement and refrain from making such ridiculous statements. He should set an example to the people and respect the judiciary.
“The Prime Minister and the Government should uphold good governance and the Rule of Law and also revoke the gazette notification relating to  the Financial Crime Investigation Unit, which was aimed at victimising political opponents,” the press release said.
