Happy-go for him though no-go for his projects!


	



 

It has now come to light that a certain politico while occupying a position of authority had collected a huge amount of money as kickbacks from contractors to whom tenders for numerous development projects at the periphery were awarded. 

 


However, the work on these development projects have now ground to a halt due to the failure on the part of government authorities to release funding for them. 


The development projects thus virtually abandoned have become eye sores while the politico who had made a fortune out of them is enjoying a good rest in the lap of luxury, they say.
