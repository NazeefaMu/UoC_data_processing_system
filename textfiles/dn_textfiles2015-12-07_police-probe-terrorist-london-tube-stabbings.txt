Police probe 'terrorist' London Tube stabbings

UK: A man was being held in custody Sunday after three people were stabbed at a London Underground train station in an attack police were treating as a "terrorist incident".
One eyewitness shouted "You're no Muslim" at the suspect as he was pinned down by police officers at the suburban Leytonstone station, amateur video footage showed, while a pool of blood was seen in the ticket hall.
Sky News reported that eyewitnesses had said the lone suspect spoke of Syria and had "apparently shouted 'this is for Syria'," though no witnesses were quoted.
Police could not confirm this when contacted by AFP and it is not evident from video footage circulating online.
The attack Saturday came at the end of a week in which the British parliament voted to extend air strikes on the Islamic State jihadist group (IS) from Iraq into Syria.
The stabbings also come less than a month after the November 13 jihadist rampage in Paris, claimed by IS, which killed 130 people. London police said one man sustained serious knife injuries in the east London attack, but they were not thought to be life-threatening, while two others sustained minor injuries.
Britain's Counter-Terrorism Command is investigating.
"We are treating this as a terrorist incident," CTC leader Commander Richard Walton said in a statement.
Amateur video showed a pool of blood and bloody footprints at the Tube station ticket gates. Shouts are heard as the suspect is seen remonstrating with people before swinging at one of them.
Some Tube-users continued on their way while others hurried from the scene.
Footage shows officers shouting "Drop the knife!" and firing Taser electric stun guns, one of which connects. "Who is this idiot?" one onlooker said of the suspect, adding: "Yes! Stupid idiot," after the man is Tasered.
Officers shout "Put the knife down!" and "Drop it now!" at the stunned man, who did drop the short-bladed knife as he quivered on the ground.
On his front, the man was handcuffed behind his back while another officer pinned him down with his knee and passers-by were told to get back.
One man at the scene then shouted at the suspect: "You ain't no Muslim, bruv! You're no Muslim, bruv! You ain't no Muslim!"
Eyewitness Khayam told the BBC that when the suspect was taken to a police van, "I saw pedestrians shouting at him... one pedestrian tried to throw a bottle."
He said one victim was taken out on a vertical stretcher. - AFP
