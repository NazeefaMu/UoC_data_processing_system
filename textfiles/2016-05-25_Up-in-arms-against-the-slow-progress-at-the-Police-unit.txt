Up in arms against the slow progress at the Police unit


	



 

Several purohitas had fired salvoes at the top-two of the special Police unit investigating the financial crimes committed by the big shots of the previous regime when they met at the top table last week.

 


Irate purohitas had called for the ouster of the top-two for it was obvious they were utterly inefficient or were not pulling their weight. 


They also had insisted that a progress report on the ongoing investigations be placed at the top table. However, the response to this request from the highest echelons was hardly encouraging, they say.


The disillusioned purohitas have begun openly expressing their disappointment at the poor showing by the Police unit and lamenting that they were not in a position to face their voters at any future election.
