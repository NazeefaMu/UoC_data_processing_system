The Statement made by the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein at a media briefing held in the last day of his four-day Sri Lanka visit, on the judicial process into alleged war crimes committed by Sri Lankan tri-forces was malicious and unfair, Joint Opposition’s expert spokesman G.L. Peiris said today.

He said that the “motive of the UN High Commissioner was not to prevail justice and equity for the victims, whose human rights have been violated, but to fulfil certain political agendas,” he said.

“In his statement wrapping up his four-day visit, the UNHR Chief has insulted Sri Lankan tri-forces, judicial system and the sovereignty of the country,” Peiris said.

He questioned as to what kind of proof caused the UNHR Chief to come to a conclusion that an investigation was a must into the alleged war crimes.

“According to sources, the report of the UNHR Chief was based on the evidence gathered from anonymous witnesses and therefore, the reliability of the evidence against a reputation of a country seems to be unclear,” Peiris said.

He said that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should have a clear stance on the UN resolution and the implementation of its proposal in the country without making contradictory statements with regard to the issue.

“When other countries, including the United States of America (USA) are openly violating Human Rights by carrying out military exercises in war torn countries, where thousands of innocent civilians are killed, UNHRC’s strange concern on the alleged Human Rights violations in Sri Lanka is a point to be noted,” he said.

Meanwhile, Prof. Tissa Vitharana charged that Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera prevented representatives of the Joint Opposition meeting UNHRC Chief Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein. (Piyumi Fonseka)
