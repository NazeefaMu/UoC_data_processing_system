Commenting on the charge of providing MP Tissa Attanayake a ministerial post as a bribe, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Sunday said that there was no point of holding presidency if he cannot appoint a Minister.
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views addressing the crowd at the Raja Maha Viharaya in Hambegamuwa.
“The National security has been challenged today. I received a New Year gift recently asking me to report to the Bribery Commission regarding a bribe. Accordingly, the bribe and my offence are providing a ministerial portfolio to Mr. Tissa Attanayake.  If I am the President, and if I cannot appoint a Minister, I don’t need such a post,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.
While charging the development projects had been halted today, he said the fate of the funds allocated to development projects was uncertain. “However, I believe the people won’t forget the development projects we have carried out,” he said.
He said some of the Ministers in his government chose to sit on the floor though they were given chairs said some of them were caught by the Police for various offences.
The former President said there was no freedom to organize a ‘Bodhi Pooja’ without being charged as plotting to come into power.
He also said that Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was not a mere office or a symbol and said the real SLFP is where there is the five forces gathered (Pancha Maha Balaya) at. “I hope the hatred in the peoples’ hearts will be vanished with the power of these Bodhi Poojas,” he said.
