So far we have discussed ten favourable Yogas formed on the hand. We propose to familiarize our readers with a few more favourable Yogas today. You may notice that these Yogas too come in Astrology giving identical results.

Ubhayachara Yoga: A mark of a square on the Mount of Sun (Apollo) and the tip of Mercury finger reaching the last phalanx of the Apollo finger indicate the presence of this Yoga.

Result: A person blessed with this yoga is far sighted and is capable of coming to grips with any situation. He is just, upright, and firm and reliable. He is strong and healthy. It has to be noted that the smaller the square the more auspicious are the results.

Shubha Yoga: A well-developed Mount of Saturn and a clear line of Fate on the right hand produce this Yoga. In most cases, the line of Fate similar to the one that occurs in the right hand is found in the left hand as well. However, it is the formation on the right hand that is taken into account.

Result: The subject is a pleasing personality and a great orator who can hold the audience spell-bound. Very often popular politicians are endowed with this Yoga. Those who possess this Yoga make their mark at a place away from the native place.

Sunapha Yoga: Unbroken lines of Mercury, Sun and Saturn (fate) on the well-developed respective mounts confer this Yoga.

Result: The subject attains a high position in society by dint of perseverance. He has a good temperament. He acts with caution, circumspect and foresight. He leads a happy and contented life. If the line of Mercury is more prominent than others, the subject has a bent for arts and literature. He is conservative in his outlook and would not go against tradition. He has a pleasing personality and would help others with an empathic understanding. If the Saturn line and Mount are more prominent, the subject would become a successful politician or would take a keen interest in political science and politics. He would not seek wealth. He is well informed and would make his point at the right place and at the right time. If the Sun line and the Mount are more prominent, the subject would hold high office as an administrator. Such natives begin their career from a small position and rise to a high position eventually.

Vasi Yoga: The ring of Saturn and the ring of Mercury indicate the presence of the Vasi Yoga.Result: A person with this Yoga is clever and dexterous. He has a cheerful disposition. The mark of his ingenuity is stamped on whatever task he accomplishes. He helps his family and does not expect any help from the family. No enemy would dare to challenge him.
