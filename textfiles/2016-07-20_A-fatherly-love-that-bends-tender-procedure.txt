Charges of nepotism among other forms of corruption against political bigwigs of the previous regime raised much hullabaloo in the country at that time. And the people who set much store by the promise of a yahapalanaya voted the present administration into power.

However, stories are galore that rank corruption continues under the yahapalanaya administration as well.
One such story says that contracts for a number of government projects coming under the purview of a certain senior purohita have been awarded to a firm owned by his own daughter.
The Ministry sources claim that they are following the tender procedure in regard to the awarding of contracts for all construction projects, but it has come to light that practically all contracts for the Ministry projects have gone to the daughter’s firm.
