The judiciary and independent commissions including the Bribery and Corruption Commission in Sri Lanka have been strengthened in a way that no politician can influence it, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Tibilisi, Georgia today.

Speaking at the Open Government Partnership - Global Summit, the President said the independent commissions have been placed above politicians, public servants, business community and all citizens so that the impartiality of the commissions is unchallenged.

The ‘Open Government Partnership - Global Summit’ in Georgia opened today in the Conference and Concert Hall at Tbilisi with the participation of President Sirisena.

Enlightening the participants on how his tenure as President of Sri Lanka has improved the country in terms of the principles of the Open Government Forum, President Sirisena went onto say that when he became the President of Sri Lanka, the Presidency was vested with extensive executive powers that no other elected leader in the world enjoyed.

“It was under that absolute power that corruption spread. Therefore, within the first six months since I became the President, I curtailed those excessive powers concentrated around me as the Executive President and transferred them to the Parliament. That strengthened the Parliament,” he stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
