Aloysius had given liquor dealership to some MPs: Ranjan
	
Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius has given liquor sales dealerships from Mendis Ltd to several MPs at a discount, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake alleged yesterday.
Mr. Ramanayake told Daily Mirror that Aloysius had given dealership at a discounted rate of Rs 3 million per annum to the MPs whereas the usual price of the dealership had been Rs 6 million. Some who had received liquor sales dealerships are government MPs, he said.
He also said some government MPs have cancelled dealings which they were about to get into at the last moment after hearing that Aloysius was going to be arrested.
Mr. Ramanayake added that one prominent MP from the Opposition had got Aloysius to finance parties through which he had entertained his friends.
I feel that the punishment given to politicians and clergy for theft should be doubled, he also said. (Yohan Perera)

Anunayake's sermon: Those misunderstood it make statements-Gota
	
Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said today thathe could not understand why the President, the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister and others are interested in a private 'anushashanawa' by Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera.
Those who have not fathomed the context of the sermon are making various comments. After all, Im an ordinary person and not someone of importance. I dont know the reason for issuing so many statements over a private anushashanawa to me at my residence, Mr. Rajapaksa told journalists outside the FCID.
He said the statements may have been issued against the Anunayake Thera.
I dont think this is appropriate. Even the Buddha said the Dhamma should be preached to people who have the capacity and the wisdom to understand it. I of course understood well what the venerable monk said. Those who havent understood the meaning are making these statements, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
When asked about revoking his US citizenship to contest the presidential election, Mr. Rajapaksa said he had not made a decision in this regard.
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has not said anything to me about this. If the need arises, it can be done within two months, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

APPRECIATION: THE DR. RATNAM I KNEW!
	
One year and nine months ago I had the privilege of getting accommodation at Ratnams Private Hospital down Union Place. My friend Professor Sheriffdeen, called and said I had to see Dr Ganesh Ratnam about my request for a room.
I was apprehensive at first, but I need not have been, he was the kindest, gentlest, most simple human being I have met. I was introduced to his Secretary Chandrika, who took over from there and he just left everything in her capable hands. Running an institution like that is no mean task; it requires incredible patience, kindness and tenacity which fortunately Dr Ratnam possessed in full measure. As the days and months passed, I grew to appreciate this gentle human being, who was the epitome of kindness and concern.

"His patients and residents always came first, regardless of time or weather, if he was needed; he was always there, always. "
His patients and residents always came first, regardless of time or weather, if he was needed; he was always there, always. Even now I feel that if I look out of my room, I will still see him walking the corridors in his signature jeans and T-Shirt which was his standard attire.
Gardening was his passion. I remember mentioning once that I had nothing but concrete to look out on as I was the only person on that corridor. Imagine my surprise when I returned from the office that evening, I found a garden being constructed. Such was the sincerity of his commitment to anyone or anything.
Looking back over the short time I was privileged to have known Dr Ratnam, I am certain that all those who knew the doctor would say with proud conviction that we were richly blessed because he touched our lives.
He must be wishing how we could know today that nothing but our sadness can really pass away. His was a blessed death, he was gone before we knew it and only God knows why!
So, let us think of him as living in the hearts of those he touched, for nothing loved is ever lost and he was loved so much.
Today would have been your 72nd birthday dear Doctor, so together with the Angels I want to say Happy Birthday  our loss is heavens gain!
It is easy to leave footprints in the sands of time, but it takes a very special person to leave footprints in the lives of those he touched!

## Title: Cost of electricity in SL is very high compared to other countries in the region
## Section: Hard talk

Cost of electricity in SL is very high compared to other countries in the region
	
Saumya Kumarawadu

The verbal wrangling between the power regulator Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) and the powerful Engineers Union of the power monopoly CEB, has come to a boiling point with CEB engineers launching trade union action leaving the smooth power generation, transmission and distribution at risk. The Daily Mirror spoke to the President of the CEBEU, Saumya Kumarawadu on the issue. He shared the following views:


PUCSL MADE FALSE STATEMENTS TO MEDIA SAYING THEY HAD ONLY CHANGED THE INPUT PARAMETERS
	
	BY NOW 40% OF THE WORLDS ELECTRICITY DEMAND IS MET BY COAL
	
	WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THERE ARE SOME ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN LAKVIJAYA POWER PLANT.
	
	EVERY YEAR THE CEB MAKES A LOSS CLOSE TO RS. 50 BILLION


QWhat is the reason behind the work to rule campaign by the CEB engineers
There has not been an approved Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) for the construction of much needed power plants of the country since 2015 as the regulator, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), failed to approve CEBs LCLTGEP 2015-2034 and LCLTGEP 2018-2037. The CEB cannot procure or build power plants without a legally approved proper plan. This situation will definitely lead to a major power crisis for which CEB engineers finally get the blame. As a professional trade union we have a right and responsibility to intervene in this very sensitive issue within our domain.
We had a number of discussions with relevant stake holders and the government in order to get this issue resolved without resorting to trade union actions. Even though their responses at those meetings were positive, no tangible solutions to the issue were foreseeable. This situation made us launch mild trade union actions from time to time. However, when the PUCSL illegally prepared and approved their own Generation Plan discarding the CEBs LCLTGEP 2018-2037, we decided to fight for the rights of electricity consumers of the country. We started our trade union actions last September in mild form, as mentioned before, withdrawing our members from the Technical Evaluation Committees and Joint Working Groups appointed for the procurement of future power plants. This trade union action was gradually escalated step by step, when we noticed the lethargic approach of the authorities to settle the issue.

"We learnt that the PUCSL was making false statements to the media saying they had only changed the input parameters like coal and LNG prices in the model and their illegal plan had become more economical than the CEBs plan."

Ultimately, the President intervened and inquired from the PUCSL the reasons that prevented them from approving the CEBs Generation Plan. The reason given by PUCSL was that the government has a policy of not constructing any more coal plants in the country and, on the contrary, CEBs plan containing coal power plants. The President clarified that there is no such government policy and advised the PUCSL to grant the approval for the CEBs LCLTGEP 2018-2037. When the regulator ignored the advice of the head of state too, we had no alternative other than resorting to work- to-rule campaign to win our very fair demands.
QAs far as you know why does the PUCSL not approve the LCLTGEP running to 2037 from 2018
Even before the CEB prepared the LCLTGEP 2018-2037, the PUCSL had decided for what plan the approval should be granted. Their main objective was not to ensure formulation of the best Generation Plan for the country, but to use their authority to make way for investors who were willing to make money out of power generating projects. Since they did not receive the plan they had in mind from the CEB, they prepared and approved their own plan rejecting the CEBs plan. This action of approving their own plan is totally illegal as they dont have a mandate to do so as per the section 43(2) and 43 (8) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009. This is just like a person going to a Municipal Council to get his house plan approved, being instructed to put up a house handing him a plan designed to the liking of the MC.
We learnt that the PUCSL was making false statements to the media saying they had only changed the input parameters like coal and LNG prices in the model and their illegal plan had become more economical than the CEBs plan. But, actually what happened was they had forcibly removed coal plants in the CEBs plan giving irrational reasons even before the model was run. Even if they ran their model assuming their input data were correct, coal would still be there in the outcome. On the other hand, the CEB had submitted input parameters to be used in the model well in advance to the PUCSL and they had never disputed applicability of them until their plan was published. However, they unilaterally changed the input parameters in order to get the plan they wanted and then ordered the CEB to implement it.
QThe PUCSL does not want to approve coal power plants in Sri Lankas future power generation. As such, why do you fight for coal power generation
When deciding on future power plants, we have to consider not only the generating cost but also a number of other factors. Among them energy security, technical constraints and environmental concerns are key. When making your judgment on power generating technology, due consideration should be given to all those key aspects. If only the environmental pollution is considered, we will end up with a Generation Plan that will give rise to host of other issues such as high cost of electricity, low reliability and vulnerability for energy insecurity. The number one reason the CEB has selected coal power plants for our future power requirements is to ensure the energy security. To have better energy security, we need to have a proper mix of coal, LNG and renewable energy sources. If we are going to depend only on one firm energy source like LNG as proposed by the PUCSL, we are taking a very high risk as then the electricity cost of the country would overly depend on LNG prices. In addition to that, coal is still considered as one of the cheapest options to generate electricity. This shows very clearly when looking at the number of coal power plants planned to be constructed by other countries in the world in future.
QMany countries in all continents have begun phasing out coal power generation. But you want Sri Lanka to depend on coal power. Why
By now 40% of the worlds electricity demand is met by coal and many countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh in our region have planned to put up more coal power plants in their countries. It is better to inquire why countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh, being LNG producers. have decided to construct more coal power plants. Australia is the second largest LNG exporter in the world and yet they produce as much as 63% of their electricity demand using coal.
Like older people who consume less food, countries like the USA, China and India, which were overusing coal power, have started gradually reducing coal. They are shutting down coal plants, which are harmful to the environment, built in 1970s with older technology. But countries competing for foreign investments like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam have plans to increase their coal share in order to make energy prices more attractive to investors.
It is no secret that the cost of electricity in Sri Lanka is very high compared to other countries in the region. Because of that, electricity is subsidized to domestic and industrial consumers. Since the electricity tariff is not cost reflective, every year the CEB makes a loss close to Rs. 50 billion. Before commissioning the Norochcholai coal power plant, average cost of electricity was as high as Rs. 23.66 per unit and after commissioning the three coal power plants, the cost of a unit dropped to Rs. 15.07. However, cost of electricity has an upward trend again as the coal power plant planned to be constructed in Sampur was abruptly stopped. If the country has to be developed, more and more FDIs need to be attracted to the country. But, prevailing high electricity cost has become one of the key factors that discourage such investments as any industry today is energy intensive.

"When Norochcholai power plant was constructed, a number of measures have been taken to mitigate environmental pollution. They include Electro-Static precipitator (ESP) and Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) unit installed in the plant to capture fly ash and sulfur dioxide respectively from the exhaust flue gas."

Not only that, even local entrepreneurs find it very difficult to remain competitive because of the high cost of electricity. Hence, it is very important to bring down high electricity cost by replacing expensive oil based electricity with cheap electricity generated from coal. Since Sri Lanka is a poor country we have to depend on coal power until our economy becomes more stable. 
QThe benefits of coal power generation are much less than the ill effects of it, the environmentalist say. How do you see this from your perception
Environmentalists oppose not only coal power plants but also wind, large hydro and mini hydro power plants. For example, 100MW Wind Power Plant being constructed by the CEB in Mannar with a soft loan from ADB had also come under their attack. ADB almost stopped their financing for this project due to a protest by a group of environmentalists claiming it would be harmful to migratory birds. Now a similar situation has arisen in Moragolla 30MW Hydro Power Plant Project as so called environmentalists claim the project would be a threat to certain species of fish in the Mahaweli river.
Similarly, nobody can deny there arent any adverse effects of coal power. But, as one of the cheapest sources, coal is still the number one power producer in the world. Due to low cost of coal power, developing countries in the world consider coal as one of the best options for power generation. However, coal power developing countries have started using clean coal technologies to mitigate environmental effects and such plants are even located in highly residential cities of the world. We have proposed in our plan to construct such high efficient coal power plants using clean coal technologies. 
QIt is a known fact that the 900 MW Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant has done much harm to the environment in Norochocholai. People in Puttalam complain about plants of vegetables, fruits and houses have been covered with fly ash. How can we minimize these negative effects emanated from coal power generation 
We have to admit that there are some environmental issues in Lakvijaya Power Plant. At the same time, it is necessary to highlight that it supplies almost 50% of countrys daily demand of electricity. We have experienced power cuts in the country on many occasions when the plant broke down in the past. If not for this power plant, more oil could have been burnt at exorbitant cost to generate the same electricity produced by this very important power plant.
When Norochcholai power plant was constructed, a number of measures had been taken to mitigate environmental pollution. They include Electro-Static Precipitation (ESP) and Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) units installed in the plant to capture fly ash and sulphur dioxide respectively from the exhaust flue gas. In addition to that, there are very high chimneys to disperse remaining constituents in flue gas at higher altitudes reducing their impact in immediate surroundings. However, the major current issue in Norochcholai is coal and fly ash dust.
When the percentage of fine coal particles is higher in purchased coal, they are easily airborne and settle in areas close to the power plant. Coal dust problem would have been avoided, had the Standard Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC) appointed for the coal tender strictly adhered to coal specifications in which the composition of coal particle size has been defined. However, a committee comprising of villagers, environmentalists and other relevant groups have been appointed to look into the environmental issues at Norochcholai. In the meantime, a wind barrier and a lot of other improvements are expected to be carried out in the near future to address issues faced by the residents close to the Lakvijaya Power Plant.
QWhat do you have to say about the recent media reports that Sri Lanka was on the verge of commercially exploiting Natural Gas resources found in the Mannar basin in the North of Sri Lanka 
Natural gas exploration in Sri Lanka is conducted by the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS). Two wells namely Dorado and Barracuda have been drilled. Dorado indicates the availability of natural gas and it is estimated to have approximately 300 billion standard cubic feet (bcf) of recoverable gas reserves. Based on the above most likely quantity of natural gas, it is estimated that it could cater for a 1000MW capacity for approximately 15 years with a plant factor of 30-50%. The CEBs Base Case Plan contains the development of 1500 MW LNG combined cycle power plants during the next 20 years. The same plan proposes to convert existing oil operated combined cycle plants of nearly 600 MW to LNG operated combined cycle plants by 2023. With the proposed development of two new 300 MW LNG operated combined cycle plants in 2019 and 2021 a cumulative LNG combined cycle power plant capacity of 1200 MW would be available in the near future. If domestic gas reserves are exploited and could be economically extracted for domestic use, there will be a sufficient demand from the above plants for local gas supply.
QDont you think Sri Lanka must delay the construction of coal power plants until the completion of gas exploration, as gas is the most environment-friendly and clean energy
Every year electricity demand rises nearly by 300 MW. To meet that demand, we need to develop more and more power generating sources. It is true that environmental emission of combined cycle plants is half compared to coal plants. However, electricity generating cost is comparatively higher for LNG even at the cheapest price compared to coal at the highest price. The amount of extra money our country has to spend is higher if coal power plants are replaced with LNG power plants. Hence, striking a balance between coal and LNG is essential. That is why, an energy mix that consists of simultaneous development of both coal power plants and LNG power plants has been proposed by the CEB in its Generation Plan. Such a policy is very clearly evident in countries with plenty of gas reserves like Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh where construction of new coal power plants are taking place to supply their growing electricity demands.

" We have to admit that there are some environmental issues in Lakvijaya Power Plant. At the same time, it is necessary to highlight that it supplies almost 50% of countrys daily demand of electricity."

A very important matter of concern in LNG power plant development is the construction of relevant LNG infrastructure to import Liquefied Natural Gas. The cost incurred in developing LNG import and re-gasification infrastructure is significant. Since extraction of commercially utilizable domestic natural gas at desirable levels and the prospective time period taken for the extraction of natural gas are still uncertain,the decision to invest in LNG import infrastructure has to be carefully evaluated. In the event of discovery of a large quantity of local natural gas, importing LNG based on take or pay contract can never be justifiable. Therefore such decisions should be carefully evaluated in negotiations. 
QYou are demanding the removal of PUCLS Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe which insinuates that the failure to approve the LCLTGEP is an individual decision and not the collective or policy stand of the PUCSL. Your views on this....
Our country doesnt have an approved Generation Expansion Plan after 2014 due to irresponsible, unprofessional, illegal and unethical conduct of the PUCSL. The Commissioners and the Director General are directly responsible for this situation. So, we have demanded that the government appoint individuals with highest professional integrity and unblemished records to key posts of the Commission.
QPower and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says that Sri Lanka has the capacity to generate enough power for the next few years by the state and private sector providers to uninterrupted 24x365 power supply and there is no power crisis as forecast by certain quarters. Do you agree 
Since there is no plan in place, no major economical power plant has been constructed after 2014 to supply the growing electricity demand of the country. There are no plans even to put up such power plants in the near future too. It will take a minimum of six to seven years to construct such a power plant if it is started today. Until then only expensive oil fired power plants and non-dispatchable renewable power plants will be added to the power system incurring more losses to the CEB. The CEB that made profits in 2015 has recorded a nett loss of Rs.15 billion last year! If the government continues to act ignoring policies and plans like this, a power crisis of greater degree is inevitable. When you make mistakes today, you have to pay for them several years later. Therefore, we cannot rule out power cuts in future.

Dictatorships and authoritarian Rule
	
Totalitarian trends in JR, Felix, Premadasa, MR and Gota




A dictatorship in Sri Lanka will never be a benevolent onewithout any doubt will be a malevolent dictatorship.
	
	Authoritarianism and totalitarianism are other forms that have been spoken of in political science.
	
	Vijaya Kumaratunga the SLFP candidate who lost by a slender margin of 45 votes escaped unhurt when he was shot at; a person close to him succumbed to injury.
	
	Lalith Athulathmudali threatened to dispatch strikers to Kanaththa and Gamini Dissanayake, escorted a trainload of hooligans to Jaffna to rig DC election in 1977-88.

As the Dailymirrorreported on Friday, the President emphasized that he would not allow tarnishing the aspirations of the people of this country they bestowed on January 8, 2015. The freedom and democracy demanded by the people have been ensured not only 100 per cent, but 200 per cent in the country after putting an end to an era of dictatorship.
This is an effort to present some features and workings, one sees in authoritarian leaders and regimes in Sri Lanka in the past. They say history is the greatest teacher and history repeats itself, though dictatorships and authoritarian rule seems a vanishing model in contemporary politics.
Types of regimes described by Greek philosophers a couple of millennia ago were Oligarchy, Tyranny and Democracy.
Authoritarianism and totalitarianism are other forms that have been spoken of in political science.
Engagement of armed forces to suppress demonstrations by unarmed citizens in Weliweriya-Rathupasswala under Rajapaksas caused former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Madam Navi Pillay to comment Sri Lanka as heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction.
Many believe that the Jayewardene Regime [1977-88] was Authoritarian but it wasnt a dictatorship.
President JR Jayewardene preferred not to hold the General Elections scheduled for early 1983 and conducted an alternate with a fraudulent referendum.

"Brothers JR and HW Jayewardene shared a hidden anti-Tamil loathe in them: HWs QC-ship was delayed due to granting QC-ships to Tamil senior lawyers of the time. Professional rivalry or jealousy was the cause they say."

JR, the opportunist-racist and some of his Ministers in 1983 July purposely brought about riots against the Tamils and allowed Sinhalese hooligans to kill, rape, loot and humiliate the minority, set ablaze their businesses, whilst the Police and the armed forces were watching the fun.
Brothers JR and HW Jayewardene shared a hidden anti-Tamil loathe in them: HWs QC-ship was delayed due to granting QC-ships to Tamil senior lawyers of the time. Professional rivalry or jealousy was the cause they say.
JR introduced a draconian amendment to the Constitution and dismissed a people-elected Tamil Opposition leader and MPs. JRs anti-Tamil intolerance was exposed in an interview with Londons Daily Telegraph during Black July 83.
He was pretty hard Now the Tamils have to take care of themselves. I cannot help themI have to look after the interests in South

Vijaya Kumaratunga the Naxalite
In an act of random choice or personal whim, he removed the Civic Rights of his leading political Opponent Sirimavo Bandaranaike; falsely accused, prosecuted and jailed the Oppositions main political campaigner and popular film idol Vijaya Kumaratunga over a Naxalite charge.
He sacked 60,000 Government Servants who went on strike for a salary increase; compelling 58 of them to commit suicide. Mahara by-election and Jaffna DC election [Wayamba PC under CBK] will remain red marks on the history of free and fair elections the Mahara election petition, though the Courts rejected on a technicality, highlighted JRJs alleged use of immunity cover to make a bogus statement on the character of Kumaratunga, who was freed from detention as there was no evidence against him.
Vijaya Kumaratunga the SLFP candidate who lost by a slender margin of 45 votes escaped unhurt when he was shot at; a person close to him succumbed to injury. Minister of National Security Lalith Athulathmudali, who threatened to dispatch strikers to Kanaththa and Gamini Dissanayake, who escorted a trainload of hooligans to Jaffna to rig DC election in 1977-88, Ranjan Wijeratne in 1989-92 and Gen. Anuruddha Ratwatte in 1994-2005 and finally Gotabhaya Rajapaksa during Rajapaksa regime are alleged to be responsible of many atrocities committed or violations of democratic norms during their tenures.
The systematic ending of established institutions and the structure of controls in Government is a strong signal that the State is moving towards an authoritarian rule.
People in Rathupaswala wanted drinking water, Negombo fishermen asked for fuel subsidy, factory workers for welfare; they protested for not granting basic and fundamental rights, but they were treated militarily and violently by Rajapaksas.
Reporters Without Borders ranked Sri Lanka 163 out of 179 nations in 2012 on its global Press Freedom Index.

"Ranjan Wijeratne in 1989-92 and Gen. Anuruddha Ratwatte in 1994-2005 and finally Gotabhaya Rajapaksa during Rajapaksa regime are alleged to be responsible for many atrocities committed or violations of democratic norms during their tenures."

After a thrashing victory in 2010, MR amended the Constitution to boost his power over the Judiciary and Civil Service and ended the two-term Presidency limit.
MRs brother Gotabaya ran the security machinery and elements of the economy as Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development; the B-in-L, a planter headed [or ruined] the State airline. Other brother Basil handled the vital Economic Development, and eldest, the Speaker of Parliament. Several in the family circles served as Diplomats and Chief Ministers.
Rajapaksas arrested Sarath Fonseka who contested MR at Presidential elections. Fonseka was detained by the Military Police. In August he was convicted by Court Martial and stripped of his medals and rank. A month later, the Court Martial, serving under Gotabaya, found him guilty of Arms Purchasing offences.
During Jayewardene rule hooligans, with connections to the ruler, were let loose on Opposition activist, Judicial Officers and Minorities; even SC Judges were not spared.
Permitting dishonesty and making it the only way one could reach and achieve something in life they make a complete generation of liars and robbers with the ruler at the top.
A style that makes everybody contaminated with corruption, so no one can challenge the other.
Quietness and harmony are encouraged by making corruption widespread; the thinking in such regimes is that your file is with us which means you have to remain loyal.

Criminal Justice Commission law and Felix
Felix Dias Bandaranaike believed in a little bit of totalitarianism, this he mentioned during a ceremony held at the Russian Embassy where he was the Chief Guest.
The vision of Felix Dias, to take successful control of the Judiciary and nearly manage the Judicial Service was vehemently objected to by the Legal Fraternity in the early 1970s.
FDB had an exceptionally radiant mindset: to most in the Cabinet, he was the power at the back of the Government.
Bandaranaike [FDB], the controversial man had a dream for an informal system of administration of justice. When there is a transformation in any field there is potential for disagreement. The capacity to ride storm and craving to do so is what makes an autocrat. They say there is Little Hitler Psychosis concealed in the subconscious of every person; in FDB it began to grow steadily. He introduced the Criminal Justice Commission Law which allowed statements by the accused against others acceptable.
All politicians entertain the idea of ruling forever; think they have a right to rule for the good of the society, and become uncomfortable with the theory of the Rule of Law which they think would arrest the development procedures commenced by them.
A disagreement ensued between Felix and Victor Tennekoon CJ over the first sitting of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice alleged that the Minister had taken over the ceremony, he wrote saying that the invitation has been drafted without any mention to him and desires the guests presence at the inaugural ceremony of the SC.

"All politicians entertain the idea of ruling forever; think they have a right to rule for the good of the society, and become uncomfortable with the theory of the Rule of Law which they think would arrest the development procedures commenced by them."

The CJ emphasised the fact that the Judges of the SC had previously taken their oaths and fit in office and no supplementary act was needed. He further stated that it must be one that was left to the SC to make a decision on the date the venue and the presenters. In refusing to attend the ceremony, the Chief Justice stated, that he took the decision with hesitation and that he was doing so in the interests of the establishment. Some good work done by Felix on the development of the legal system was regrettably eclipsed by his weaknesses for a little bit of totalitarianism.

JR Jayewardenes Tamil Intolerance
JR Jayewardene, who took over the A little bit of totalitarianism deprived Felixs Civic Rights through a Presidential Commission, a law based on the infamous CJC introduced by Felix himself.
At the tail end of his career, FDB was seen seated in the lounge of the Law Library like an ordinary human sans his haughtiness and pomposity. 

"The dictatorial nature of the Rajapaksa regime left little space for balanced decisions with respect to the allotment of finances, enlistment of investments and essential human resource improvement."

The dictatorial nature of the Rajapaksa regime left little space for balanced decisions with respect to the allotment of finances, enlistment of investments and essential human resource improvement. Dictators always select their officials and advisers on the basis of loyalty alone. These advisors tell their leaders only what they would like to hear. The public dialogue turns out to be a biased one-sided affair.

Lee Kuan Yew, the benevolent dictator
In his book, On Liberty (1869), John Stuart Mill argued in favour of democratic rights for persons, he did make an exclusion for what he called todays developing nations an idea of benevolent dictator.
It was a popular expression in the early 20th century as a prop up for colonial rulings. The man who transformed Singapore from a meagre agrarian civilization into one of Asias wealthiest countries, Lee Kuan Yew, the most successful political pragmatists in the region, is also called a 'benevolent dictator.
During his thirty-one year rule he applied laws that were supposed to be tyrannical, and endeavoured to dismantle Opposition: the local politicians, who pay tribute to Lee Kuan, know well, that he was an authoritarian, who suppressed disagreement ruthlessly. However, he is often looked upon positively for his role in transforming the nation.
A dictatorship in Sri Lanka will never be a benevolent one-without any doubt will be a malevolent dictatorship. The 25-century old culture and traditions will not permit or tolerate a dictatorship of any form, benevolent or otherwise. People who wanted Good Governance and democracy should not be let down as they deserve a better future.
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has.-- Margaret Mead.

Egypt to extend state of emergency for three months
	

REUTERS, 24th JUNE, 2018- Egypts parliament approved on Sunday the extension of a nationwide state of emergency for three months from July 14.
Egypt imposed the emergency in 2017 after two church bombings killed at least 45 people. It was last extended in April.
Egypt faces an Islamic State insurgency in the remote North Sinai region that has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in recent years and has expanded to include attacks on civilians.
Other Islamists operating in the western desert bordering Libya have also attacked security forces.

Five injured after explosion at apartment building
	

DPA, 24th JUNE, 2018-Five people were injured late Saturday in an explosion at an apartment building in the western German city of Wuppertal.
Residents woke up just before midnight to a violent bang after an explosion ripped through large parts of the three-storey house. People ran out of neighbouring houses in panic as metre-high flames billowed from the rubble.
Several residents managed to escape immediately after the blast, and firefighters used ladders to save several others who were trapped in the building. A fire brigade spokesman said residents confirmed that no one else was in the building after sniffer dogs were deployed to look for survivors.
A large number of rescue workers attended the emergency and photos of the scene showed piles of rubble and debris surrounding the building. Photos showed large parts of the facade and roof missing, as well as a car in the street that was completely crushed by the rubble.
Specialist engineers were called in to stabilize the building after it was determined to be at risk of completely collapsing.
The cause of the explosion remains under investigation. How this came to pass and what the background is, that remains completely unclear, a police spokesman said.

High quality rice at affordable prices: Amaraweera
	
The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) will enter the domestic rice market shortly for the first time and sell high-quality rice varieties at an affordable price while maintaining a steady price for paddy, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said the government expected a bigger paddy harvest at the next Maha and Yala seasons because of the favourable weather conditions for paddy cultivation and private traders would no doubt attempt to purchase paddy cheap from farmers.
Our objective is not to earn big profits from paddy but to help paddy farmers to sell their produce for a higher price. We fix a minimum price for all paddy varieties at every season. That will help paddy farmers to sell their produce above the price fixed by the PMB. The PMB will purchase paddy at the fixed price in case paddy prices decline further, the minister said.
He said the PMB was ready to purchase any amount of paddy from farmers at the coming Maha and Yala seasons and mill rice from paddy of highest quality bought by it. The PMB cannot keep paddy for longer periods if private traders dont purchase price from the PMB. Therefore, the best solution is to mill rice from paddy purchased by the Board, packet them and sell in the domestic market, through the CWE under the brand name PMB Rice. Price of a kilogram of PMB rice will be lower than the price of rice sold by private traders.
There were proposals to close down the PMB but I and President Maithripala Sirisena opposed such moves. Our intention is mainly to control the rice market and prevent sharp increases in rice prices in the domestic market. The PMB right now runs as a loss-making venture. By entering the rice market, I expect the PMB could run as a no-profit-no-loss commercial venture and provide the consumer high-quality rice at affordable prices, the minister said.

I only meant governance based on firm policies: Anunayake
	
In response to critical remarks made by persons about a speech made by him in which the Nazi dictator Hitler was mentioned, Anunayake of the Asgiri Chapter Ven. Wedaruwe Dharmakeerthi Sri Ratanapala Thera clarified that he only meant governance based on firm policies with this reference.
The thera made such remarks in his address at a function to mark the birthday of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Issuing a statement, the Ven. Thera said a couple of words from his lengthy speech had been taken out of context by some politicians with vested interests for misinterpretation to achieve their ends. He compared it to the determination of the shape of an elephant only by touching its tail.
In a nutshell, I only said some people compared you to Hitler. I only asked him to develop the country. In governing a country, firm policies are required. I never wanted to equal the barbaric administration of Hitler that annihilated people to work done by him,the thera said.
The Buddha once said it was better to die in the battlefield rather than living as a defeatist. In saying so, he never recognized war. In fact, the Buddha underscored the importance of an individuals strength, he said.
He said it was inappropriate to give political interpretation to what he said in this respect.
Asserting that the Buddha also diversified his discourses befitting various audiences, he said he worded his sermon to the audience of politicians who were present at that birthday event.
He said the adoption of direct policies in governance had been underscored in the Dasaraja Dhamma laid down by the Buddha. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

Listen first to children caught in drug traps - EDITORIAL
	

ith Sri Lanka also facing a crisis where even tens of thousands of school children are being deceived into drug addiction by heartless mafias, the intentional community tomorrow marks the United Nations day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. In a statement, the UN says that by a Resolution approved by the General Assembly in 1987, decided to declare June 26 as the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking as an expression of its determination to strengthen action and cooperation to achieve the goal of an international society free of drug abuse. Supported each year by individuals, communities and various organizations all over the world, this global observance aims to raise awareness of the major problem that illicit drugs represent to society.
According to the UN, building on the success of last year, this years theme is Listen First - listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe.It is an initiative to increase support for prevention of drug use. This is based on science and is thus an effective investment in the well-being of children and youth, their families and their communities. 
The UN General Assembly held a Special Session on drugs in April 2016. This Special Session marked an important milestone in achieving the goals set in the policy document of 2009 political declaration and plan of action on international cooperation towards an integrated and balanced strategy to counter the world drug problem, which defined action to be taken by Member States as well as goals to be achieved by 2019. 
The outcome document recommends measures to address demand and supply reduction, and to improve access to controlled medicines while preventing diversion. The recommendations also cover the areas of human rights, youth, children, women and communities; emerging challenges, including new psychoactive substances; strengthening international cooperation; and alternative development. The text puts new emphasis on proportionate national sentencing policies and practices for drug-related offences, and features a strong focus on prevention and treatment, the UN says. 
In a message UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres says the General Assembly Special Session, urged the international community to take steps to mobilize a multifaceted, collective response to the full range of issues related to drug abuse and illicit trafficking. Governments came together to chart a new path forward. This he believed would be more effective and humane, and leaves no one behind. 
He says, the Special Session was a ground-breaking moment that provided a detailed and forward-looking blueprint for action. Together, we must honour the unanimous commitments made to reduce drug abuse, illicit trafficking and the harm that drugs cause, and to ensure that our approach promotes equality, human rights, sustainable development and greater peace and security the UN Chief adds. 
Mr. Guterres says he knows from personal experience, how an approach based on prevention and treatment can yield positive results. As Prime Minister of Portugal, I used the flexibility afforded by the three international drug control conventions to introduce non-criminal responses to the possession of drugs for personal use. Greater resources were allocated to prevention, treatment, and social reintegration programs, including harm reduction measures. Portugal now has one of the lowest death rates for drug use in Europe. In 2001, Portugal had the highest rate of HIV amongst injecting drug users in the region; since the introduction of the new policy, this rate, and rates of all sexually transmitted diseases, have decreased dramatically. Overall drug use rates have also fallen he adds giving an example that Sri Lanka and all countries need to follow. 
In Sri Lanka, after democracy and freedom were restored in 2015, it seems that drug smuggling and peddling have increased in what is another abuse of freedom. Reports indicate that in recent years, the drug peddlers appear to be targeting schoolchildren and selling addictive drugs to them in attractive forms. These heartless drug traffickers and peddlers appear to be unconcerned that they are ruining the education, health care and lives of the children and causing misery to their families as well. We hope the new Special High Courts will take up drug smuggling and peddling as offences, so that rigorous jail terms and heavy penalties could be imposed on the drug peddlers though some of them are known to be covered up or protected by politicians.

Only ministers under influence of drugs can condemn killing of criminals: JVP
	
Only Ministers who are under the influence of drugs could condemn the killing of the underworld criminal in Matara, JVP-affiliated Voice Against Corruption (VAC) Convenor Wasnatha Samarasinghe said today.
He said this while referring to a statement made by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera on Sunday that the killing of a suspect while in police custody could not be justified just as the police constable's killing, which could not be justified.
Only those who are under the influence of drugs (Kudu Gahapu Amathiwaru) could make such remarks as the one made by the minister, Mr. Samarasinghe said. The underworld leader was killed when attempting to shoot a policeman. I wonder where in the world is a criminal who has shot at the police spared."
He also criticised Asgiriya Chapter Anunayake the Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Thera who had reportedly called for a dictator-type leader to rule Sri Lanka.
A member of the Buddhist clergy should not make such statements. Is he unaware as to what happened in Germany during Hitlers time
He asked whether the prelate had forgotten about the killing of Roshan Chanaka at Katunayake and the abducting and killing of journalists during the previous regime.
Mr. Samarasinghe accused the government of misleading people by publishing wrong figures pertaining to the current economic growth. He said the real growth rate was 2.7 per cent while the government had published the growth rate as 3.2 per cent. He said the GDP in the first quarter of 2017 was Rs.2,164,477 whereas it was shown to be Rs.2,154,971 million when computing the GDP in the first quarter of 2018. (Yohan Perera)

Cashless solution provider for the MSME sector, PAYable, emerged the most awarded company at the inaugural SLASSCOM Innovation Summit 2018 held on 14th June. Three nominations and two Gold awards set the startup apart as the only participant with multiple nominations and multiple wins.
PAYable topped the Best Startup Product/Service and Best Client Delivery Innovation categories, and was named first runner-up in the Best Disruptor category.
Speaking on the wins, CEO/Co-Founder of PAYable Yohan Wijesiriwardane said, We are delighted to have been included in the SLASSCOM Innovation Summit 2018, and to be recognised for the positive impact we have had on the MSME sector. We were also excited to have had the opportunity to learn more about the Island of Ingenuity (IOI) and how we can contribute towards it as a business. We would like to thank SLASSCOM for organizing such an informative and interesting event.

The PAYable team with the awards for Best Startup Product/Service and Best Client Delivery Innovation categories
Ever since its commercial launch in 2016, PAYable has revolutionized the footprint of cashless transactions in Sri Lanka. Partnering with some of Sri Lankas top banks, the PAYable platform offers merchants the ability to accept cashless transactions at absolutely no cost. The solution has to date empowered over 12,000 merchants across Sri Lanka and has facilitated over Rs. 2 billion worth of cashless transactions to date.
Developed by CBA Solutions (Pvt) Ltd, PAYable is a free mobile application launched with the intention of empowering individual, micro, and small-medium enterprises through financial inclusion. This application when paired with a free Bluetooth card reader, enables merchants to accept credit and debit card payments from their customers, effectively converting any smart phone or tablet into a mobile, easy-to-use POS terminal.
Built on the visionary leadership of PAYables late Co-Founder and CEO Sujith Subasinghe, together with fellow Co-Founder and current CEO, Yohan Wijesiriwardane, the platform is now gaining traction across Sri Lanka in the form of popularity and financial success.
Across sectors, over 80% of businesses in Sri Lanka are SMEs, and with this resourceful new technology, the company has now proven itself indispensable in supporting this vital segment of Sri Lankas business community, and as a result the economy of Sri Lanka as a whole.
Nearly two years since inception, PAYable has since partnered with three of Sri Lankas largest private sector commercial banks and hopes to expand its network of merchants to 20,000 by the end of this year. In addition -and now with these most recent accolades under its belt- the business has plans to add on to its product offering as well diversify existing services to further improve on the customer-merchant experience.

People will see no reason for PCs: GL
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today people would question the practical need for provincial councils if the government delayed elections to them any further.
Party Chairman G.L. Peiris said it was nine months since the term of office of the Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North-Central Provincials Councils had expired while the Northern, Central and North-Western Provincial Councils would end their tenure by September this year.
The government is determined not to have elections to these six PCs till the next presidential elections are over. By then, the PCs would have been non-functional for two years, he said and wondered whether in such a situation PC were needed to administer the provinces.
If the yahapalana government fails to hold elections, why should the new government hold elections, Prof. Peiris asked.
Responding to remarks made by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, he said it was preposterous for him to say he would not object to the postponement of elections provided his term was extended.
Asserting that it was legally impossible, Prof. Peiris said the CM had no existence outside the provincial council. He said no government benefited from postponing elections. (Kelum Bandara)

Quitting HRC wont change USs goals in Sri Lanka
	

The US quit the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday (June 19) with rhetoric intended to assert the moral high-ground, slamming the council and selectively naming and shaming council members outside its charmed circle of friends. While the statements of US Ambassador to UN Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington reeked of imperial arrogance, the irony of this grandstanding by one of the worst human rights offenders on the planet would not have been lost on many in the global South, who have been at the receiving end of its worst depredations over time. 
Haley accused the council of being a protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias. The USs own glaring lack of even-handedness in branding its detractors as rights abusers while at the same time propping up its strategic allies militarily and economically, no matter how authoritarian or oppressive their conduct, may have escaped Haley. But not those in the majority world who have been forcibly democratised by the US at the cost of their dignity and sovereignty, or have become targets of colonization one way or another, through US efforts to maintain global hegemony in the course of history. Even as the US envoy preached human rights, accusing others of hypocrisy, her own government was implementing a harsh new immigrant policy of separating children from parents at the US border with Mexico, causing outrage within the USs own rights community among others. 

"The USs exit from the HRC: some have speculated that pressure to fulfil commitments made in the resolution will somehow be eased"
The US exit from the HRC the last analysis was spurred by rancour over its inability to persuade the council to change course over Israel  the USs Middle East ally - and its treatment of Palestinians. For months, Palestinian protestors in Gaza at the border fence with Israel have been facing tear-gas and live fire from Israeli forces, who are reported to have killed at least 125 since the mass demonstrations began in support of their right of return. The Human Rights Council last month voted to probe the killings, accusing Israel of using excessive force. Given the background, the superpowers bid to exit the HRC in the garb of a human rights leader comes across more like a modern-day tale of The emperors new clothes. 
The USs withdrawal from the HRC has been a matter of special interest in Sri Lanka, where the yahapalana government has been struggling to comply with the demands of a US-led Human Rights Council resolution, which it misguidedly co-sponsored in 2015. The resolution alleged human rights abuses by Sri Lankan forces during the war against the LTTE and sought reforms, for the purpose of what it called reconciliation and accountability. Not surprisingly many of these moves, to introduce new laws, institutional reforms, a new constitution that could weaken the central government and seen to encroach on sovereignty - have met with a groundswell of opposition  not least because they are seen by many to be dictated from Washington.
In the wake of the USs exit from the HRC, some have speculated that pressure to fulfil commitments made in the resolution will somehow be eased. This optimism would seem to be misplaced, if only because the resolution was never about human rights in the first place. It is no secret that the US interest in Sri Lanka derives from the islands location in the Indian Ocean, near strategically important sea-lanes. It is also well known that the US aims to counter Chinas growing maritime footprint, and therefore seeks to dislodge China from the privileged position it is currently seen to enjoy in its relations with Sri Lanka. The US Pacific Command was recently re-named the Indo-Pacific Command, to signal the shift in focus. The US needs to have a hold on Sri Lanka in order to make it a compliant partner in its strategic project, and this is where the resolution comes in useful. 
It was precisely to ensure that the GoSL does not get the mistaken idea that the US will back off, that the US embassy in Colombo on June 21, issued a statement about the decision to quit the HRC, saying that Ambassador Keshap met senior Sri Lankan officials to convey the assurance of the United States Government that it will remain fully engaged with the Sri Lankan Government to help it meet its continuing and standing commitments to the international community to advance the cause of reconciliation and lasting peace for all Sri Lankans.
There were other indications too, that the US has no intention of letting Sri Lanka drop off the radar. In Washington on 20th June a US House Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing titled Human Rights Concerns in Sri Lanka. Testifying at the event were J. S. Tissanayagam, journalist and human rights advocate; Michael Jerryson, PhD, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Youngstown State University; David M Crane, Principal at Justice Consultancy International, LLC; and John Sifton, Asia Advocacy Director at Human Rights Watch. Fresh avenues of information-gathering are being sought, it would seem. 
The opening comments of Congressman Chris Smith, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, betrayed a lack of familiarity with the background to the Sri Lankan conflict, and a barely superficial understanding of the issues. According to excerpts posted on his website, he began by describing the war waged against the LTTE, a banned terrorist organization, as a brutal ethnic conflict between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils. Other remarks were equally revealing. In a dead give-away of the real motivation behind the US interest in Sri Lanka, he said: 
Sri Lankas stability is of critical importance to the United States national interests. Strategically located in the sea-lanes linking the Persian Gulf to East Asia, this island-nation has seen a spike in recent activity by the Chinese. Chinas strategy globally is one of indebting countries and binding them in servitude so it can extract resources, so it is safe to say that Beijings initiatives will not emphasize ethnic reconciliation and/or human rights. This presents the United States with an opportunity to stand up for justice and the rule of law and to oppose Chinas malign influence.
It is intriguing how Smiths statement, which starts by referring to the United States national interests, morphs into an assertion of concern for justice and the rule of law in Sri Lanka which, somewhere along the way, becomes equated with the task of opposing Chinas malign influence. But for the US there is no dislocation here. The US rhetoric comes from the paradigm of the white mans burden. It is telling, in this regard, that Pompeo in his remarks in Washington began by saying that Human Rights were God-given, and the Trump administration was committed to protecting them. 
There is nothing to suggest that the US has given up its strategic objectives in Sri Lanka as an outcome of leaving the UN rights body. Only its methods of trying to achieve them may change.

Samsung Launches Extravagant Ultra Large  Q-LED TV
	
Samsung Sri Lanka has forged the next innovation in TV with the launch of its mesmerizing Ultra Large Q-LED TV in Sri Lanka for an intensely engaging viewing experience. Delivering the legendary Samsung picture quality with awe-inspiring style, the 2018 QLED TV continue to champion technological advancements and design innovations to deliver a spectacular viewing experience. The latest TV from Samsung boasts Quantum Dot technology, which uses a LED light source and a LCD panel. The QLED TVs exceptional picture quality lasts much longer and will not change over time due to a lack of burn-in issues. By using inorganic instead of organic material, the Quantum dot technology of the QLED TV makes burn-in obsolete and completely overcomes the problem of image retention. This is key to the Samsung QLED TVs long lifespan. The 2018 QLED TV comes with "Ambient Mode" that lets users convert their devices into a canvas and also act as a window to the world. It even can mimic the pattern on the wall behind the TV!
Users can watch TV for 24 hours a day without burn-in, thanks to Samsungs residual image prevention technology. Samsung QLED TVs are free of burn-in issues that have plagued displays built with QLED technology and are able to deliver the most premium picture quality available in the market today. Viewers often experience image sticking or Burn In while watching other TVs, which refers to an effect where part of an image that is no longer displayed, is still visible on a different image. Residual image, image sticking, image persistence, ghosting or image retention all refer to an effect that is temporary with the retained image elements reversed over time, sometimes very quickly, or by simply turning off the display. Screen burn-in is an extreme case of image sticking where the damage becomes permanent and cannot be reversed. The inorganic Quantum dot material used for QLED TV is durable and stays burn-in free. The QLED TV can reach 100 percent Color Volume and over 1,000 nits of HDR brightness, while also offering the best picture quality possible.
Commenting on the exciting launch of the Ultra Large Q-Led TV, Managing Director of Samsung Sri Lanka, Hanbae Park said, Samsung TVs are extremely popular in Sri Lanka and we are delighted to reward customers for their loyalty by pioneering the magical Q-LED technology to unveil the Ultra Large Q-LED TV that offers a captivating viewing experience. More and more people aspire to have large screen TVs as well as better picture quality to better enjoy spoorts, music and films and games, this is exactly what the Q-LED TV offers. Its revolutionary technology and intelligent features make this TV the clear choice for an unforgettaqble viewing experience. 
In testing, Samsung QLED and LED TV sets received a 10/10  perfect score  for image retention. Burn-in risks using Ambient Mode have already been tested and Samsung confidently guarantees its QLED TVs are burn-in free.
The latest QLED series will be available at select Singer, Softlogic, Singhagiri and Damro outlets islandwide to purchase soon.

SL Army peacekeeping mission held up due to delay in clearance by HRCSL
	
The deployment of another contingent of military personnel for UN peace keeping mission has been held up due to the delay in giving clearance for them by Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka HRCSL, it is learnt.
Previously, such clearance for troops bound for UN missions were done by the UN Human Rights authorities in Geneva. However, the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO) said that such clearance should be taken from the HRCSL from this year onward.
The new set of rules was introduced in March this year.
However, the HRCSL is yet to clear these personnel making it unable for Sri Lanka Army to send a contingent of 101 UN peace keeping duties in Lebanon.
Sri Lanka has been a Troop Contributing Country to the UN since 1994. Around 400-500 soldiers are involved in such work in different countries such as South Sudan, Mali, Central African Republic and Western Sahara. (Kelum Bandara)
