HINDUSTAN TIMES, 8 September, 2017 -  Pakistan has made great sacrifices in fighting terror and has a clear conscience, China said on Friday, barely five days after Beijing joined other Brics members in condemning the terror groups operating from that country.   


China’s message of support came during a joint press conference foreign minister Wang Yi addressed with his visiting Pakistani counterpart Khwaja Muhammad Asif.   


Some countries should recognise Pakistan’s great sacrifices, Wang said.   


“Pakistan is an important participant in fight against global terrorism,” Pakistan’s Geo News quoted him as saying.   


Leaders of the five Brics countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – who met for a summit in China’s port city of Xiamen on September 8, identified Pakistan-based terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed among groups causing violence and security concerns, bracketing them with Islamic State.   


India has been highlighting its concerns over cross-border terrorism at various global forums.
