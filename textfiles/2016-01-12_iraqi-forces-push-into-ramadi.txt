Members of the Iraqi government forces battle with Islamic State (IS) group fighters east of Ramadi, after they took control of the agricultural area surrounding the eastern part of the capital of Iraq's Anbar province today. Iraqi forces continue to clear the city and evacuate civilians two weeks after declaring victory against the Islamic State group, security officials said.  AFP
