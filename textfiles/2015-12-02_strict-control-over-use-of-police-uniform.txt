A recent advertisement featuring a Policeman has made the Police Department to strictly enforce the existing laws, which require the entertainment industry to request permission for the use of the Police Uniform.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said that he had lodged a complaint with the Fort Police today against the advertisement which allegedly ridiculed Policemen.
Legal action would be taken against the producer and the actors of the advertisement, he said.
ASP Gunasekara said the advertisement humiliated the Department which was established to protect and enforce the law.
“This is not the first time such an incident has taken place. It has happened on many occasions,” he said.
The Spokesman said the Department would enforce existing laws.
“Any production which humiliates the Department is punishable under the Police Penal Code 84. Therefore, unauthorised use of the Police uniform or a dress similar to Police uniform is a punishable act. A person could be remanded for three months for violating this law,” he said.
Permission would need to be sought from the IGP or the Ministry of Law and Order for the use of Police uniforms in any production in the future, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
