Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha said he would issue the gazette notice stating the number of members to be elected to each of the local authorities under the new electoral law.

According to the new law, 60 per cent of candidates will be elected under the first-past-the-post system and 40 per cent under the proportional representation system at elections to the Pradeshiya Sabhas, Urban Councils and Municipal Council.

“I hope to sign the gazette notice on Monday or Tuesday,” the minister said and added that thereafter the Elections Commission could go ahead by preparing the ground work to hold the elections. (Kelum Bandara)
