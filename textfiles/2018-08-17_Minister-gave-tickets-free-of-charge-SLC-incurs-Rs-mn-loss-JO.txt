Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha distributed some 800 tickets free of charge among his close associates for the recently concluded 50 over finals and the T20 between Sri Lanka and South Africa, thus incurring a Rs.4 million loss to Sri Lanka Cricket, the joint opposition said yesterday.

JO MP Shehan Semasinghe told a news conference that the minister had allocated some of these tickets for disabled soldiers while giving the the rest to his close associates to watch the two matches held at R. Premadasa Stadium.

“This act can be described as misappropriation of public property. The Minister should give an explanation about it,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
