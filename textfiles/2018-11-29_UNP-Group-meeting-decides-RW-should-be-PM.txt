The UNP's Parliamentary Group had unanimously decided that its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should be the one, who should become Prime Minister as long the party had a majority in Parliament, party sources said.

This decision was made by the parliamentary group which met at Temple Trees last evening according to party sources.

The group had focused on the statement made by President that he will never appoint Mr Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister again.

The group had also been of the opinion that the constitution of the country cannot be violated just to satisfy whims and fancies of one person. (Yohan Perera)
