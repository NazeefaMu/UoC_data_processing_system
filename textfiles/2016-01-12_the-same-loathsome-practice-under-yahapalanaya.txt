The same loathsome practice under yahapalanaya


	


A chairman of a State-owned commercial undertaking had recently told the purohita who appointed him: “Sir, we are planning to recruit a good number of employees to fill the existing vacancies in our establishment.  
If you have got any supporters looking for employment, please send me their list. I can consider them if they have got the necessary qualifications.”
And the chairman had been taken aback by the unexpected rejoinder from the purohita.
“Is it proper for us to make political appointments to a prestigious institution like this?”
This query had silenced the chairman. He did not receive a list of job seekers from the purohita either.
However, this chairman is being constantly plagued by some other purohitas who insist that their cronies be appointed to this position or that, they say.
