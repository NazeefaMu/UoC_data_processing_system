It is official. The Dictator is back. Yes, the imaginative re-working of H.C.N. De Lanerolle's play called ‘The Dictator’, which was staged at the Punchi Theatre last year, directed by the creative genius that is Namel Weeramuni, is back on the boards, this time at the venue it was originally staged way back in the 1950s, at the Lionel Wendt, on February 7, 2016.
For those of you who missed the previous performances of this hilarious yet poignant classic, here is the chance to see Malini Weeramuni as Hamine epitomizing the role of the dominant wife, and threatening to bring the house-down as she henpecks her husband the Dictator, himself. She gets brilliant outstanding support from Daya Tennakoon as Mahattaya and Pinnya Samarathunga as Stella. The supporting caste comprising thin, bespectacled, Galpotha (Prabhath Dhevindra) the reporter from the Daily News and Nella (Purnima Pilapitiya/Kiruthika Thurairajah) the no-nonsense woman of steel from the Times of Ceylon also render brilliant caricatures of those in the print-media while Pradeep Kumara who makes brief appearances as the exorcist is bound to give you a few goose-bumps regardless of whether you are a believer or a non-believer of the occult sciences.
Undoubtedly, Wijeratne Warakagoda, as Dictator, holds centre stage. From the first moment he steps onto the stage to the last scene when he stamps his foot and proclaims from now on he will be the Dictator in his home, one cannot fail to admire the ceaseless energy of this veteran actor and the skilled performance he delivers. Just to watch his face, crossing from bafflement to wide-eyed pleasure at how he manages to defeat the enemy through “huniyum and anjanam eli” is priceless.
In a way ‘The Dictator’ is a timeless tale about the dominance of the wife over the husband.
“Even Haminey obeyed me!” exclaims Ralahamy in wide eyed wonder as he recollects his dream. Even though he hopes to hold the reigns of his household from now on, it is highly unlikely he will succeed.
The strict look on Hamine's face with the corners of her mouth turned down indicating she will stand no such nonsense, says it all. In other words, no married man can ever have the power of a dictator at home. “We think we can, but we can't,” laughs Director Namel Weeramuni.
The set expertly designed by Lal Harendranath, the costumes by Senaka de Silva, make-up by Buddhi Galappaththi and music by Jayathissa Alahakoon culminate in bringing a bygone era back to life.
Here is a production that guarantees to give you one of the most enjoyable evenings spent at the Lionel Wendt in recent times.
The combination of a historically intriguing story, a heartily funny script and truly remarkable performances results in making ‘The Dictator’, one of the must see plays of 2016. (One warning though: by the time the play ends you might end up having a few permanent laugh lines on your face, but believe me, it's worth it.)
Be sure not to miss this hilarious theatrical masterpiece on 7th February at the Lionel Wendt at 7pm.
