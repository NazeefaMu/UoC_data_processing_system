PM to amend SLC Constitution after elections

 
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said that the Sri Lanka Cricket constitution will be amended soon after the elections scheduled for Sunday.
Minister Jayasekera said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe intends to amend the Sri Lanka Cricket constitution after having discussions with the International Cricket Council and the winning candidate in the near future at a press briefing held at the Sports Ministry premises yesterday with regard to the SLC elections.
"The Supreme Court asked the Sports Ministry to facilitate the two camps to contest in the forthcoming AGM of Sri Lanka Cricket," the Minister said.
"For the first time in Sri Lankan history the Supreme Court sat in judgment of a cricket AGM issue. It was a historical moment," Minister Jayasekera said.
MOBILE PHONES & WEAPONS BANNED
The Minister drawing up security plans for the elections stated that mobile phones and weapons will be banned during the election period at the ministry premises. "No one can enter with private security or Ministry securities. Special security will be provided with Special Police at the Sports Ministry premises. Only one door will be opened, that is the main gate of the ministry building at Reid Mawatha, opposite the Cinnamon Garden Police," said Minister Jayasekera.
"All the contestants and the voters are requested to be present at the Sports Ministry auditorium by 9am as our prime plan is to end the elections by 10 am," he said.
The registration will be done at the entrance on the ground floor and all proceedings of the elections will be recorded by the Ministry Media Unit. The newly appointed office-bearers will meet the media at 11am at the Mini Auditorium of the Sports Ministry.
