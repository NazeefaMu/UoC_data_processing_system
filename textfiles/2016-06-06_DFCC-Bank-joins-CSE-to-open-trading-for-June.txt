Commenting on the Bank’s contribution to the Sri Lankan capital market, Vajira Kulatilaka, Chairman of CSE said that the listing of DFCC Bank and value offered through the Bank’s shares played a vital role in sparking interest in the market, especially among retail investors around the country. He went on to state that the Bank’s share has since developed into an attractive stock for investors and continues to attract interest both locally and internationally.
