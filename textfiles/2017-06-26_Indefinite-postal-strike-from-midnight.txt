The United Postal Trade Union’s Front commenced an indefinite strike from midnight today over the government’s alleged silence towards the unresolved issues of the Postal employees and the Department.

The Front carried a 48 – hour token strike on June 12 disrupting the country’s entire postal service forcing the government to reverse  its alleged decision to handover several buildings which house post offices in Nuwara Eliya, Galle and Kandy to an Indian company to build hotels.

The Front’s Co-Convener H K Kariyawasam told Daily Mirror that several attempts made to resolve the matter were failed as the authorities are not willing to discuss the issues.

He said the trade unions’ action would halt the country’s entire postal services causing a huge loss to the department.However, he said they will not stop the strike until the employees demands are met.

Postal unions started their struggle over three main demands including the restructuring of the staff recruitment process.

During the last strike, the ‘Speed Post’ courier service and EMS services were gravely affected suffering a huge loss to the department. .Mail collection and distribution were also disrupted during the strike. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
