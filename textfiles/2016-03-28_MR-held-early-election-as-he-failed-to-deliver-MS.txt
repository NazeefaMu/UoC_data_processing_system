Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had failed to find solutions to the problems the country was facing, and that was why the former Government called for a Presidential Election two years before the predecessor’s term ended, President Maithripala Sirirsena said yesterday.

“The former President called for elections two years in advance because they were unable to deliver solutions to the problems the country was facing. People voted me in with the hope that I would deliver what I promised,” he said in an interview last night.

He said Sri Lanka, which had been one of the most isolated nations internationally in the past, was now transformed into a country accepted worldwide with many powerful friends.

Meanwhile, the President said the Unity Government ushered an alternative to the country torn apart by party divisions, since Independence.
