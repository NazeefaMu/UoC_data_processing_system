Another Rs. 40 million transaction by the Krrish Company to purchase a land in Puttalam was found while investigating the Rs. 70 million transaction between the company and Namal Rajapaksa, the FCID said at the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court today.  

The prosecution said they had identified four suspects including Nalaka Godahewa (former Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission) over the alleged deal and said the property was allegedly sold under a forged deed by the four suspects to the company.

The alleged deal was revealed when the FCID investigated a complaint filed by JVP Provincial Councillor Wasantha Samarasinghe earlier.

Meanwhile two others, Roni Ibrahim and Rukshan Fernando, have been summoned to the FCID to record statements regarding the Rs. 70 million transaction.

A statement given by the accountant for the Carlton Super Sports Ltd, Sujani Bogollagama, regarding the misappropriation of Rs. 70 million given by Krrish to conduct a rugby tournament, revealed that both Ibrahim and Fernando were aware of how the funds were spent by the CSS ltd, the prosecution said.

The final report of the case was sent to the Attorney General for his opinion, the FCID said.
