Three spill gates of the Udawalawa Reservoir were opened today owing to the heavy showers experienced in catchment areas, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said today.

The DMC requested people living in the downstream to be vigilant of rising water levels.

Speaking to Daily Mirror , DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili said the showers experienced in and around the catchment areas were reportedly reducing.

However, he said more spill gates would be opened if the rainfalls continue.

Meanwhile, one spill gate of Kukule Ganga Reservoir had also been opened today due to rising water levels. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
