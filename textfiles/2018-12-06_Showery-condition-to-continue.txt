It said a low-level atmospheric disturbance had formed in the Bay of Bengal to the South-east of Sri Lanka and it would be likely to develop into a low-pressure area during the next few days.

Showers or thundershowers would occur at times in Northern, Eastern, North-central and Uva provinces and in Hambantota district.

“Heavy falls about 100mm can be expected at some places in the Central, Eastern, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces,” it stated.

It further said misty conditions might occur at some places in Central, Sabaragamuwa and Western provinces during the morning.

As there might be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers, they requested the general public to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.

Sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Mannar via Puttalam and the sea area extending from Matara to Pottuvil via Hambantota can be fairly rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 50 kmph.

Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be vigilant in this regard. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
