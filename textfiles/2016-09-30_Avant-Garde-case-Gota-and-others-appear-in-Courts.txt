Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Nissanka Senadipathi and five others appeared in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court over the inquiry conducted under the Corruption charges filed by the Bribery Commission.

They were noticed to appear in courts by Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya early this month.

The commission alleged that the suspects had committed the offence by permitting the Avant Garde Maritime Services to operate a floating armory supporting AGMS to earn Rs. 11.4 billion causing a financial loss to the government.

The other six suspects were Sujatha Damayanthi, Palitha Piyasiri Fernando, Karunaratne Bandara Adhikari, Somathilaka Dissanayake, Jayanath Sirikumara Colambage and Jayantha Perera.(Shehan Chamika Silva)
