UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said the Supreme Court’s interim order on the dissolution of parliament was not the Court's final decision.

In a tweet he said he had never seen politicians get ‘so excited’ over postponing of elections.

“The UNP has a history of postponing polls but eventually voters will decide,” he said.
