Minister of Science, Technology and Research and SLFP Vice President Susil Premajayantha said he would reveal the reasons for the failure of the SLFP in the last Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Elections, when he retires from his political life and perhaps that day was not so far.

“Each and every decision was taken under the guidance of the party’s leadership and as a result of that the SLFP was able to be victorious in ten elections and was able to win in 95 electorates in the previous elections,” the Minister said while speaking at the UPFA’s Chief Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera’s swearing in ceremony held at the party headquarters today.

“There are some parties of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) which have made allegations against me, but if I have ever tried to correct them, they would land me in trouble. I would also like to request them to refrain from making such allegations in public about the things that they don’t know,” he added. (Diana Udayangani)
