A tense situation prevailed at the Galkanda Junction in Negombo a short while ago when a group of protesting three-wheeler drivers had pelted stones at police officers who arrived at the location to disperse the crowd.

When protesters pelted stones, police had fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse the protesters who were blocking the Negombo-Colombo main road. (Hubert Fernando)
