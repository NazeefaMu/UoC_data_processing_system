Portugal to free circus animals from life of imprisonment


	



 

Portugal has become the most recent country to take the step towards compassion against animals with their government passing legislation to ban wild animals in circuses. The new legislation prohibits more than 40 species of animals from exploitation in circuses, including lions, camels, tigers, elephants, and zebras.  Predictably, circus operators are in opposition of the ban claiming it will contribute to the “disappearance of business” but the government has advised that if they relinquish their animals to ethical sanctuaries by the 2024 cut-off date, they will be given support and training in a new profession. Animal rights groups from around the world applaud the move as Portugal joins countries such as Mexico, India, Iran, and the United Kingdom who have also passed similar bans.
