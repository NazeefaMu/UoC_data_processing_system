	Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya has instructed that marking of ballot papers should be done only with the pens provided at the polling centres.
	“There were media reports stating that people could take pens of their own. This is wrong. We will be providing either orange or brown colour pens to mark the ballot papers,” he said.
	The Elections Commissioner said ballot papers which were marked otherwise would be rejected.
	“The ballot papers which are marked in other colours will be rejected at the counting centres. People should use the pens provided without any hesitation,” he said. (Chathushika Wijeyesinghe)
