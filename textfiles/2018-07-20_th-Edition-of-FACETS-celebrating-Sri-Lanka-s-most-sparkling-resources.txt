Following its inception in 1991, FACETS has grown in scale and popularity over the years to become the premier event of Sri Lanka’s Gem & Jewelry industry. The exhibition’s purpose lies in the necessity to showcase the very best of Sri Lanka’s most precious resources, thereby boosting the sale of gemstones and jewelry among overseas markets and attracting more international dealers to the island. FACETS also serves as a means of levelling the playing field amidst the different segments of the local industry.

Organized by the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association and sponsored by the National Gem & Jewelry Authority and the Export Development Board, the FACETS International Gem & Jewelry Exhibition will be held, as always, under the patronage of His Excellency the President and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment.

The exhibition will also offer guests a glimpse into the lapidary sector of the Gem & Jewelry industry. A number of stalls will feature various pieces of machinery and tools used to cut and polish gemstones and craft jewelry. There will also be a number of laboratory stalls where visitors can get a look at the process of examination that a gem is subjected to. They can even test their own gems and receive a certificate proving the stones’ value and authenticity. 

The previous year’s exhibition had the added presence of industry related academic institutes, which cater to the interests of young people seeking to join the industry. Special informational stalls will be set up this year as well to provide knowledge and details about opportunities to be found in the Gem & Jewelry industry of Sri Lanka.
