Police had found an eight year old boy tied to table with a rope, inside a house in Kowul Ara South in Sevenagala. The boy had been left alone at home while his parents were away.

Police had admitted the child to the Embilipitiya Hospital for treatment.

On information received, police had raided the house and found the boy. Police had found bruises on his body.

At the preliminary inquiry police had been told that as the child was obstinate and that the parents, when they went out, were in the habit of tying him to the table. The child, a grade two student, had been cruelly treated by his father for being disobedient. Police had taken the father into custody for ill-treating the child -- and he was to be produced in the Embilipitiya court.
