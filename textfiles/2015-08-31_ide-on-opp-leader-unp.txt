	It is the speaker who has the power to decide who would be the Leader of the Opposition in the new Parliament, a United National Party (UNP) MP said today.
	UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella, who is tipped to be the Leader of the House, told Daily Mirror that the Speaker has the power to decide who the Leader of the Opposition would be as per the Parliamentary procedure.
	Mr. Kiriella was referring to the report which said President Maithipala Sirisena had agreed to allow the opposition members of Parliament to decide on the Leader of the Opposition.
	“Any opposition member can nominate any one to the post of Opposition leader but it is the Speaker who will make the ultimate decision," he said. (Yohan Perera)
