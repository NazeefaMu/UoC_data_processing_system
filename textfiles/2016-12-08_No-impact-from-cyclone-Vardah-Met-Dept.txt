The cyclonic storm ‘Vardah’ is located around 1,200 km away from Trincomalee coast but it would have no impact to the inner areas of the country, the Meteorology Department said today.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Duty Meteorologist Srimal Herath said cyclonic storm ‘Vardah’ was likely to intensify and move north-westward of the country. 

“The cyclonic effect will likely cause showers or thundershowers at several places in the sea areas. Winds will be north-westerly in direction over the sea areas off the coast extending from Galle to Pottuvil via Hambantota,” he said.

He said the sea areas off the coast extending from Kankasanthurai to Batticaloa via Mannar, Galle and Hambantota could be fairly rough at times as the wind speed would be increased up to 50 kmph.
