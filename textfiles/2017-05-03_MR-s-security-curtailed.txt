Forty two officers attached to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s security detail had been recalled to the Ministerial Security Division (MSD) today, Mr. Rajapaksa’s Private Secretary Udith Lokubandara said.

He said no replacement had been made so far. Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa's Media Secretary Rohan Weliwita said the group of security officers had been recalled on immediate service requirements.

However, when contacted, Police Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said no such order had been issued by the Police Headquarters so far but an internal order may have been issued by the MSD. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
