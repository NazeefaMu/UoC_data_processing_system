Amid complaints about public events after the declarations of the local government elections, the Elections Commission (EC) said notices would be issued restricting the participation of politicians at such events and confining them only to government servants.

The EC has received several complaints about such events involving ruling party politicians, the allocation of money for road development and the abuse of government properties such as rest houses for political work during the election period.

It said these activities were not permitted during election time because they give political mileage to a party or an independent group in the fray.

The EC is currently accepting nominations from the respective political parties and independent groups for the election to be conducted in February.
