Hendricks century clinches ODI series for SA


	

South Africa continued their dominance when they coasted to a convincing 78-run win as they clinched the five-match ODI series with their third successive victory over Sri Lanka played at the Pallekele Stadium in Kandy this evening.

Sri Lanka who were facing a must win situation in pursuit of a mammoth target of 364 runs never looked like making a match of it after they collapsed to 124 for five.

Despite a partnership of 95 runs for the seventh-wicket between Dhananjaya de Silva (who made a top score of 84 in just 66 balls with eight boundaries and three sixes) and Akila Dananjaya, it only delayed an inevitable win for South Africa.
