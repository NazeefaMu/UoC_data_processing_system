Feral kitten with no back legs gets tiny wheelchair

UK: A small rescued feral kitten with no back legs has been able to walk for the first time after a charity had a kitten-sized wheelchair made for the tiny survivor.
Cassidy the kitten was born to a feral mother and was discovered at around nine weeks of age, with his two hind legs missing and a series of health problems.
"By the time he was rescued, he had nearly starved to death and his depleted body had stopped fighting a horrific E. Coli infection in both stumps," a spokesperson from the Tiny Kittens Society wrote on its website.
The society rescues stray, feral, abandoned, unwanted and abused cats in Canada, and founder Shelly Roche has a theory as to how Cassidy managed to lose his legs.
