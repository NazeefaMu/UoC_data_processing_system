Budget rattles strategies of crumbling opposition

This is a post-Budget week with a difference. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake's budget has an interesting mix of proposals, with considerable price reductions, raising of taxes, and expanding sources of revenue, and a ban of duty free vehicle permits, which has so far not left room for strong criticism.
Not unexpectedly, the so-called "Joint Opposition" in Parliament is making noises about some aspects of the Budget, but the criticism comes in the confusing mix of most of them being members of the SLFP, and this party, also the largest section of the "Joint Opposition", formally deciding to support the Budget. What is exposed is the increasing rift within the SLFP, as President Maithripala Sirisena seeks to strengthen his own hold over the party, as the UPFA crumbles in disarray.
The overall success of the Budget-mix presented by Minister Karunanayake is best seen in cartoons that show Mahinda Rajapaksa and his bearers in the Opposition, being disappointed that the Budget proposals having no taste or spice, meaning for them to make a strong criticism of it or take such criticism to the public. The Budget debate will take its course and see its passage, despite the threat of a No-Confidence Motion against the Minister by a deeply rattled section of the UPFA.
If the Budget is an important political leap for the Government of Consensus, there is the clear emergence of challenges to it, especially in key areas of policy, such as peace building and reconciliation, and implementing of the Geneva 2015 resolution. The loudest opposition is on the proposal to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), and its replacement with a law more suitable to the needs of a country that is at peace, after the defeat terrorism at least six years ago.
The current international debate on terrorism, especially after the attacks in Paris on November13, and the situation of terrorist organizations in Belgium, is used by those opposed to repeal of the PTA, and will come as a key aspect of the pro-Rajapaksa campaigners in the coming weeks, ahead of the forthcoming Local Government elections. MR himself says War Heroes should not be arrested under the PTA, with no evidence whatever for such claim.
Voices of racism
The voice of the former Foreign Minister and teacher of law, Prof. GL Peiris, coming together with that of Wimal Weerawansa, better known for raucous incitement of people, is a sign of the strategy applied by the pro-Rajapaksa "Joint Opposition" within Parliament and supporters outside, to create a new South-based political issue in the country, fully in keeping with their politics of racism and division, and opposition to the policies of the West, in international relations.
The focus of opposition politics in the South is also enhanced by the demand for the release of the Tamil detainees who have been held for several years, most with no charges or indictments or no legal action against them whatever. Voices are already heard warning that the release of these Sri Lankan Tamils from lengthy detention, even with rehabilitation, as thousands of direct LTTE cadres have already been released, would lead to a situation similar to the recent terrorism in Paris, and would be a major threat to national security.
The decibels of opposition to reconciliation have risen after the Government decided to lift the ban on eight organizations of the Tamil Diaspora and 424 Tamil individuals last week. Those who protest at this are certainly mum about eight other Tamil Diaspora groups remaining banned, as well as 155 Tamil individuals.
Post-Geneva 2014
It is noteworthy that the ban on Tamil Diaspora Groups and individuals took place just days after the UNHRC adopted its resolution against Sri Lanka in March 2014 - on March 27 to be exact. Also interesting is that this took place shortly after the UPFA led by Mahinda Rajapaksa won the Western and Southern Provincial Council elections held on March 29, 2014. There is little doubt that the two provincial polls were scheduled for two days after the Geneva vote, to capitalize on the expected defeat in Geneva for political gain at home. As one journalist commented on it at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa saw this motion against Sri Lanka as another "Sword of Damocles" over him; the fear of the Electric Chair being further emphasized.
The UNHRC Geneva resolution of March 27, 2014 adopted by a vote of 23 in favour, 12 against and 12 abstentions, requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka, during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability, with assistance from relevant experts and special procedures mandate holders.
"Power" politics
The Opposition voices that are against this lift of the ban of some of the Tamil Diaspora and individuals, have also associated it with the arrival of US Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, a very close advisor to President Barack Obama.
As told to the media by GL Peiris, this is also a welcome gift to the US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, the policy of the government being to please foreign powers with scant regard for national security.
This opportunist thinking comes from one who had no concerns about pleasing western powers when he sought to persuade Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State in the US, to support Sri Lanka in the post-conflict situation, when the US took the lead against the Rajapaksa policies.
This will certainly be echoed by others in the pro-Rajapaksa camp who see the political advantages in the South of being opposed to any or all aspects towards reconciliation and the building of a peaceful Sri Lanka.
With Samantha Power being drawn into the debate against attempts at reconciliation in the country, it would be good if those in the foreign embassies who plan such visits, and others in his country who organize them, also think of the South of this country. No doubt there are matters in the North and East that are of particular interest to these visitors.
But it would be good to remember that the people of the South should not be excluded in such event organizations, which gives strength to the opponents of reconciliation and the new progress towards a better democracy, to carry on campaigns that help divide the North and the South, which is their political goal. Let's not forget that "Elle" is played in the South, too, as are volleyball and cricket, and even hopscotch, all or any of which visiting diplomats or officials of importance could try.
The Galle Dialogue
The Avant Guarde issue and the matter of floating armouries have taken a different turn with three Cabinet Ministers seeking Police action on alleged defamation by the head of Avant Guarde. Away from that, on matters of the sea and naval operations, this week saw the Galle Dialogue 2015, an event of increasing importance on naval and oceanic affairs. The Chief Guest Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a very useful contribution, with emphasis on the rising importance of the Indian Ocean in regional naval operations. I shall conclude with this extract from his timely and relevant address.
"Historically, Sri Lanka has always had significant interests in the Bay of Bengal. While Sri Lanka's economic zone falls within the area, we remain committed to preventing international terrorism, transnational crimes and people smuggling in the seas around our country.
"Therefore, the sea is seen as a strategic component of the country's security network. Although substantial resources have been made towards strengthening the security on land, due to internal factors, emphasis on reinforcing high levels of maritime security has been insufficient. In this context, supplementing the blue water capability of the Sri Lanka Navy and the consolidation of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard are areas of concern for the Government. We are also reviewing the possibilities of integrating the capabilities of the Navy and the Air Force.
"The Indian Ocean is in need of a mutually benefiting security architecture established on a Multilateral basis... The maritime security of the Indian Ocean cannot be guaranteed without filling this lacuna. Sri Lanka is willing take the lead to set up a multilateral forum that involves all stakeholders with UN support to address the security issues, including the control of choke points and the maritime security blueprint. Such a forum categorized by a collective approach is likely to set the stage for a timely and relevant mechanism to be established for open and comprehensive dialogue on a range of issues affecting the Indian Ocean in particular, and the Indo-Pacific region in general. The process if institutionalized, will allow for combined partnerships across a range of areas of interest, to Sri Lanka and other participating countries."
