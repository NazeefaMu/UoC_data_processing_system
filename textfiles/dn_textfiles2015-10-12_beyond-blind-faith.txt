[Christian Perspectives]
Beyond blind faith

Who is Jesus? Is Jesus God? See what Jesus said about himself, his equality with God, and what exactly Jesus did to prove it.
It is impossible for us to know conclusively whether God exists and what he is like unless he takes the initiative and reveals himself.
We must scan the horizon of history to see if there is any clue to God's revelation. There is one clear clue. In an obscure village in Palestine, 2,000 years ago, a Child was born in a stable. Today the entire world is still celebrating the birth of Jesus, and for good reason.
Is Jesus God? Did Jesus ever claim to be God?
We're told that “the common people heard him gladly.” And, “He taught as One who had authority, and not as their teachers of the Law.”1
It soon became apparent, however, that he was making shocking and startling statements about himself. He began to identify himself as far more than a remarkable teacher or prophet. He began to say clearly that he was God. He made his identity the focal point of his teaching. The all-important question he put to those who followed him was, “Who do you say I am?” When Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,”2 Jesus was not shocked, nor did he rebuke Peter. On the contrary, he commended him!
Jesus frequently referred to “My Father,” and his hearers got the full impact of his words. We are told, “The Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.”3
On another occasion he said, “I and My Father are One.” Immediately the religious authorities wanted to stone him. He asked them which of his good works caused them to want to kill him. They replied, “We are not stoning you for any of these but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”4
Is Jesus God?
When a paralyzed man was let down through the roof wanting to be healed by him, Jesus said, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.” The religious leaders immediately reacted. “Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
When Jesus was on trial for his life, the high priest put the question to him directly: “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”
“I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked. “You have heard the blasphemy.”5
So close was Jesus’ connection with God that he equated a person's attitude to himself with the person's attitude toward God. Thus, to know him was to know God.6 To see him was to see God.7 To believe in him was to believe in God.8 To receive him was to receive God. 9 To hate him was to hate God.10 And to honor him was to honor God.11
Is Jesus God? There are possible explanations.
“As we face the claims of Christ, there are only four possibilities. He was either a liar, mentally ill, a legend, or the Truth.”
The question is, was he telling the truth?
Maybe Jesus lied when he said he was God. Perhaps he knew he was not God, but deliberately deceived his hearers to lend authority to his teaching. Few, if any, hold this position. Even those who deny his deity affirm that he was a great moral teacher. However, they fail to realize those two statements are a contradiction. Jesus could hardly be a great moral teacher if, on the most crucial point of his teaching -- his identity -- he was a deliberate liar.
Another possibility is that Jesus was sincere but self-deceived. We have a name for a person today who thinks he is God. Mentally disabled. But as we look at the life of Christ, we see no evidence of the abnormality and imbalance we find in a mentally ill person. Rather, we find the greatest composure under pressure.
