The Commercial Bank of Ceylon was represented by its Chief Operating Officer/Executive Director S. Renganathan at the FinanceAsia Country Awards in Hong Kong, at which the bank received the award for the Best Bank in Sri Lanka for the seventh time. 
The FinanceAsia Country Awards are based on the respective banks’ performance along with key events of the year, financial results including profits, NPL ratios, provisioning, return on equity, capital adequacy ratios, total assets, loans, deposits, branch network, vision and long-term strategy, market position versus the nearest competitor, principal sources of profit, and feedback of stock market analysts. 
Sri Lanka’s largest and most profitable private bank and the country’s most-awarded financial institution, Commercial Bank plays a significant role in the national economy. 
The bank accounted for 4.31 percent of the total market capitalisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in 2016 with a market capitalisation of US$ 790 million at the end of the year.
