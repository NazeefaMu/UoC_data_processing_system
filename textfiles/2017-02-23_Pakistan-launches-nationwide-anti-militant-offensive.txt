ISLAMABAD AFP Feb22, 2017- Pakistan’s military on Wednesday launched a nationwide anti-terrorist operation days after a series of bloody extremist assaults killed dozens of people across the country, the military said.    “Pakistan army launches ‘Operation Radd-ul-Fassad’ (elimination of violence) across the country,” a military statement said.   The announcement came after army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa chaired a high-level security meeting in the eastern city of Lahore.  


Troops and police have been on high alert in Pakistan after last week’s wave of attacks, including one in Lahore and another on a Sufi shrine in Sindh province, killed more than 100 people.
