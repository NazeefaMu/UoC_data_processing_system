Monkeys and monkeys!


	



 

A close female relative of a high political authority is in the thick of a racket of blocking out coconut lands for sale under the hammer.

 


This fair one actively engaged in this lucrative business in a fast-developing district in the Coconut Triangle brazenly violates the law that requires obtaining due permission for fragmenting a coconut land exceeding 10 acres in extent, they say.


A former employee of a vehicles sales centre, this businesswoman who did not own even a three-wheeler is said to be having now two expensive jeeps to cruise around.


The high political authority, who often exhorts his constituents to protect their coconut crops from rampaging monkeys, has turned a blind eye to the greater damage caused by his close relative by fragmenting extensive coconut lands into small plots for sale, mostly for commercial purposes, they say.
