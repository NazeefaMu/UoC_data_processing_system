Swami Swaroopananda, Head of Chinmaya Mission Worldwide, will address devotees in Sri Lanka from January 11-14 during a scheduled  tour in the island. During his visit, Swami Swaroopananda will visit five Chinmaya centres in the country established in Kandy, Trincomalee, Ramboda, Jaffna and Colombo. 


The talks, scheduled after his visits to the centres, will be based on the theme ‘Life Management Techniques’ which he has mastered as a senior monk.   


Swami Swaroopananda took over the baton from his predecessor Swami Tejomayananda in order to continue the legacy of its founder Swami Chinmayananda. The vision of this organization is to disseminate the knowledge of Vedanta- a universal science of life-for the betterment of the society.  After studying business management, Swami Swaroopananda was interested in applying those management techniques in daily life. Inspired by God Hanuman, his talks will bring ancient traditions right to your doorstep.   


 

Swami Swaroopananda was formerly the Regional Head of Chinmaya Mission Australia, United Kingdom, Middle East, Africa and Far East. 


 


According to followers of this mission, after being ordained as a monk in Swami Sivananda’s Ashram, Swami Chinmayananda was always interested in studying ancient texts which were only available for orthodox priests. Despite various shortcomings and challenges he encountered his never give up attitude motivated him to do his first public lecture in Puna. At present at this venue stands the ChinmayaVibhuuthi, a large set-up which serves as a research centre. This is how the Chinmaya Mission was established.  


Swami Swaroopananda was formerly the Regional Head of Chinmaya Mission Australia, United Kingdom, Middle East, Africa and Far East. 


He has authored several commentaries on important spiritual classics such as IkOnkar, MahaMrityunjaya Mantra and SankaMochan. In addition to that he has also contributed to numerous books on contemporary lifestyle subjects such as Simplicity and Meditation, Storm to Perform, Avatar, Managing the Manager and Journey into Health.   The lectures will be held from January 11-14 at the Sri Sambuddhathwa Jayanthi Mandiraya at no: 32 Sambuddhathwa Jayanthi Mawatha Colombo  from 6.30pm to 8.00pm.
