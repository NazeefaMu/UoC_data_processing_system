The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has also decided not to attend the all-party conference scheduled for this evening with the President, MP Anura Kumara Dissanayaka said.

He said they would not attend the conference because there was nothing to discuss as the President himself should resolve the matter because he was responsible for the current political crisis.
