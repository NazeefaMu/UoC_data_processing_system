	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has reportedly ‘strongly’ advised a senior Cabinet minister of his Cabinet not to engage with any parties about the Avant-Garde issue in the future.
	Accordingly, the Prime Minister had a file containing all the articles related to the Avant-Garde case, made by this particular Cabinet Minister, and advised the minister not to tarnish the image of the government in the aftermath of the resignation of Tilak Marapana from the ministry portfolio, claiming that many parties praised Marapana’s decision.
