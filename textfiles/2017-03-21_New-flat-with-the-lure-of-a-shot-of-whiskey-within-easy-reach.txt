A sibling of a powerful purohita holding high office in a main political party has obtained a licence to run a liquor outlet at a high-end apartment building he owns in the city.

 


This was the first time that the licence to run a wine shop at a super luxury apartment house in the city has been issued, they say.


The liquor shop is intended to serve as an inducement to attract buyers for the highly priced flats, they say.
