Anger is a cause of harm. Anger stirs up mental turmoil

Anger gradually obliterates both mental and physical energy

Anger is a negative and destructive emotion which has caused much misery in our lives and also around the globe.   

Anger is an unwholesome mental disposition that exasperates untamed mind. It takes us to dark and complexity.   


However, anger can get out of control and become destructive and problematic.   


So why do we get angry? People get angry when their expectations are not met - whether those expectations are about the future, about themselves, or about others.   
When our expectations are unmet, we revert to illusions of control, “Unrealistically expecting all people to behave and all situations to turn out as we think they should.”   
Anger over these unmet expectations often leads us to blame others and shift aggression towards them. 

 
Some eminent scholars and professionals who are in the domain of psychology explain that there are several sources of anger: physiological, cognitive, and behavioural.   


Physiological anger is natural anger.   


In certain threatening situations, for instance, when we are attacked physically, our bodies respond by making us physically angry. Cognitive sources of anger are based on how we perceive things. These perceptions may be accurate...a situation may, indeed, be threatening, or they may not be.   


Sometimes we will perceive a threat, even though the external situation is not actually as dangerous as we think it is. 


In other words, there may be no real reason for anger, but our personal biases and emotions take over, leading to aggression. Finally, behavioural sources of anger come from the environment we create for ourselves. Chronically angry people create an atmosphere in which others become aggressive in return, creating a cycle of anger.   


It is amazing that most scholars and educated people especially those who are in the domain of psychology endeavour to find avenues and solutions to help individuals who deeply suffer themselves from ANGER.   


The Great Master, the Buddha said:   


“Anger is a cause of harm. Anger stirs up mental turmoil. People do not recognize the peril that has arisen from within”


Those who are constantly dwelling with anger not only destroy themselves but also hurt and harm others



“The angry person does not know the good. The angry person does not see the Dhamma There is just blindness and dense gloom when anger overcomes a person” 
In Buddhism, anger is not approved and accepted as positive.   


Anger is impure, noxious, unhealthy, harmful and dangerous emotion and temperament. The Buddha has always taught and encouraged people not to associate with and harbour any thought of anger at all.   


Those who are constantly dwelling with anger not only destroy themselves but also hurt and harm others. Anger is the most atrocious defilement and despicable virulent thought. Anger gradually obliterates both mental and physical energy and leads to various afflictions and disorders.   


Unfortunately, those who are ignited and inflamed with anger never understand the negative consequences and repercussions which they will ultimately face here and hereafter.   


Be very conscious, careful and mindful of the toxic thoughts which you associate with. May the intellectuals find their education helpful when dealing with anger and underlying disposition. Most people tend to ignore the detrimental gravity of their anger.   


“Monks, what is the person whose mind is like an open sore? Here, some person is prone to anger and easily exasperated. Even if he is criticized slightly he loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays and discloses irritation, hatred, and bitterness. Just as a festering sore, if struck by a stick or a shard, will discharge even more matter, so too some person here is prone to anger…and displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness. This person is said to have a mind like an open sore.” (The Buddha – AN)   


 “The wise person should eradicate this unwholesome quality.


In such a way one should train in the Dhamma: do not yield to recalcitrance.”


“Free from anger, their misery is gone,


Free from delusion, no longer avid, tamed, having abandoned anger,


The taintless ones attain Nibbana.”


(The Buddha – AN)   


“Bhikkhus, there are these five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone. What five? 


1. One should develop loving-kindness for the person one resents; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person. 


2. One should develop compassion for the person one resents; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person. 


3. One should develop equanimity toward the person one resents; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person. 


4. One should disregard the person one resents and pay no attention to him; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person. 


5. One should apply the idea of the ownership of kamma to the person one resents, thus: ‘This venerable one is the owner of his kamma, the heir of his kamma; he has kamma as his origin, kamma as his relative, kamma as his resort; he will be the heir of any kamma he does, good or bad; 


In this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person. These are the five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone.” (The Buddha – AN)   


The great master, the Buddha has kindly taught us the danger of anger and resentment. Even though they listen to hundreds of sermons and associate with many gurus most of them are incapable to manage their anger and people have created disastrous and unfathomable situations in our human society.   


Unfortunately, they do not know the danger of retributions of their hared acts. Whether they believe it or not, no one can escape from the result of the Karma. It is inescapable and unavoidable.
