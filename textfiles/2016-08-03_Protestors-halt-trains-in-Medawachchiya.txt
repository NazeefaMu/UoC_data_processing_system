Two trains bound to Colombo and Kankasanthurei on the Northern Railway line have been halted in Medawachchiya due to a protest carried out by a group of unprotected railway gates keepers.

The Collective of Keepers of Unprotected Railway Crossing Gates staged the protest demanding a salary increment.

The Railway said the trains were travelling from Mount Lavinia to Kankasanthurei and Thalaimannar to Colombo. (Dayaratne Embogama)
