The customs duty on Toyota Premio, Allion and Honda Vezel has increased between Rs.220,000 to Rs.400,000 fromt November 1, Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka Chariman Dinesh Senanayake said yesterday.

“The base value of the customs duty has been increased according to the vehicle valuation,” Mr. Senanayake said.

Accordingly, the new customs vehicle duty on a Toyota Premio will be Rs. 384,027, while Rs. 362,570 will have to be paid on a Toyota Allion and Rs. 220,222 on a Honda Vezel

However, customs media spokesman Dharmasena Kahandawa said vehicle valuations had not been increased by the customs but the vehicle manufactures had increased their prices for 2017 models for additional facilities.

The latest prices of the increased vehicles had been published on their own company websites and the valuation price of Sri Lanka customs had been increased according to the new company prices, he said.

This was not a sudden decision but taken according to gazette notifications issued by the government earlier, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
