AIA becomes the first insurer in the country to equip its entire wealth planner force with the revolutionary mobile insurance premium payment platform, e-wallet.
AIA joined forces with Sri Lanka’s national mobile service provider Mobitel, to offer its customers the best of convenience and cutting-edge technology with the innovative e-wallet, which lets you pay your insurance premiums instantly through the mCash service. 


This means that AIA policyholders can pay their premiums then and there, in the presence of their wealth planner and receive their e-receipt on the spot. So the policyholder doesn’t need to travel to branches and no time or effort is wasted, with the whole process done in a matter of minutes. 


AIA Director Operations Kelum Senanayake said, “As the Real-Life Company, AIA understands that people have busy lives and limited time to get everything done. That is why we prioritize customer convenience and ease of doing business with us. Our wealth planners are committed to ensuring that our customers get the best service and the e-wallet is our newest addition to a portfolio of innovative services.” 


He added, “We are currently travelling around the island raising awareness amongst our customers, taking convenience to their doorsteps, to let them know that premium payment is the fastest and easiest it’s 
ever been!”
