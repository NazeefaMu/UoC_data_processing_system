For him the plum job is yet to come!


	



 

There is a newly appointed purohita at state level counting the days until he is raised to the top team status, they say.

 


By the way, he has already obtained the vehicles he and his private staff are entitled to despite the latter is yet to be appointed, they say.


Whenever his Diyawanna colleagues inquire from him why he is keeping so many vehicles when he does not have even a staff to do his work, he would reply that he is expecting a portfolio at the highest level. 


However, this politico neither attends the office allocated to him, nor does any work related to his portfolio, they say.
