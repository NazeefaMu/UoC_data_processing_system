The flight, UL1423, is scheduled to land in Colombo at 5:15 p.m. today.
The engine cowling of a Bangkok-Colombo flight had been damaged when a baggage cart operated by the airport’s ground handlers had accidently crashed into the aircraft on Tuesday night.
“SriLankan airlines made immediate arrangements to bring back 32 passengers with onward flights in Colombo. The remaining 251 passengers were provided overnight hotel accommodation in Bangkok by SriLankan airlines,” the statement said.
An aircraft had been dispatched from Colombo to Bangkok within a few hours to operate a special flight to bring the remaining passengers to Colombo.
