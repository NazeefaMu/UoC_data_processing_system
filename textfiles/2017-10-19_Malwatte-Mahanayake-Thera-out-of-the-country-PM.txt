Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today charged that there is a move to mislead the public with regard to the statement issued by the Joint Karaka Sabha of Asgiriya and Malwathu chapters as the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter is not even in the country.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who made this remark just after accepting a report on a research carried out on the new constitution by the Sri Lanka College of Journalism and several other organizations at the Parliamentary complex last morning.

'One of the gentlemen gathered here said there are allegations with regard to the new constitution. Who is making those allegations? Look at the newspapers today. They are carrying a story saying the most venerable Maha Nayaka Theras are against the new constitution. I spoke to venerable Maha Nayaka Thera of the Malawathu chapter. He is out of the country at the moment. I spoke to him today. Therefore how can the media carry his picture? How can media mislead the public in this manner? The draft of the constitution is yet to be made. Will you give front page headlines for my story as well? You went ‘Kade’ for Rajapaksas once. Do you have to do it again," he said.
