Asia’s leading insurer AIA is proud to partner as Platinum Sponsor, The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) in presenting ‘Sri Lanka’s Most Admired Companies Awards 2018’, for the first time in Sri Lanka.  The awards are intended at recognizing companies that are a cut above the rest in terms of not just their financial performance but also on the value they create in a sustainable and ethical way for their employees, customers, investors and the general community. 

Companies that have been in business for over 5 years as at 30th June 2018 and are 40% or more of Sri Lankan ownership are eligible to enter this Awards competition   which is open to both listed and unlisted companies in Sri Lanka. Those ranked Top 10 will in addition to the title, be privy to publicity and recognition throughout the country and beyond, and use this as an opportunity to build further on their organizational image as well as brand. 

AIA CEO Pankaj Banerjee said in this regard, “as a key player in Sri Lanka’s corporate sphere, we take great pride in being associated with an event of this nature, which seeks to recognize and reward excellence and business ethics. As the second largest insurer in the world, AIA endorses international standards of excellence in business and enduring elements of successful business organization. In this light, we are delighted to be a part of this effort to recognize honesty, and integrity in Sri Lanka’s most reputed corporates.

He added, “The evaluation will be based on quantitative as well as qualitative criteria, through a stringent evaluation based on globally accepted criteria, by a distinguished panel of judges. The judging would consist of several rounds of assessment and scoring of defined attributes of value creation by the companies based on independent surveys, submissions and presentations by the companies. So, there is absolute transparency and accountability in the process.”  

Director & Chief Officer Legal, Governance, and External Relations for AIA, Chathuri Munaweera said, “this pioneering initiative which rewards excellence across a number performance criteria, is aimed at recognizing companies with the strongest reputations, that inspire other organizations and entrepreneurs. This is also unique in that it facilitates and encourages unlisted companies which usually don’t get the recognition they deserve, although they contribute significantly towards the country’s economic growth.”

“With over three decades of experience doing business in Sri Lanka, AIA is intimately familiar with the country’s corporate landscape. We are respectful of companies that succeed financially, but more so, through sustainable and ethical value creation- and it is our absolute pleasure to be a part of congratulating such companies on their admirable performance and contribution to the local economy” she added. 

ICCSL Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody noted “ICCSL values its professional relationship with AIA and are happy to work with them as our Platinum Sponsor on this initiative. As a sponsor, AIA will not be a contestant for the awards but as a company AIA most certainly upholds the values of excellence required to be associated with an event of this nature and we are happy to have them on-board”.
