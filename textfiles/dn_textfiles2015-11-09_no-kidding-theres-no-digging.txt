Container Gardening: Anytime, Anywhere
No Kidding, There's No Digging

Tips for a container garden
* Many pots have a single, large drainage hole at their base. To prevent this from becoming blocked with compost, cover with a layer of broken bits of pot.
* When displaying pots on a paved area, such as a patio, raise off the ground by resting on terracotta feet or even bricks. This will help water drain freely and prevent a build up of moisture at root level.
* Place a layer of broken pots (known as crocks) at the base of the container.
* Fill pot with your chosen compost to the level of the base of your largest pot - aim to leave a 2cm gap between the top of the compost and the rim of the pot.
* Fill in the gaps with compost and press with your fingers.
* Finish by watering well. Aftercare
* Replace the top soil of your potted plants with a fresh layer of compost. This will give plants an extra boost of essential nutrients needed for healthy growth.
* Plants in containers are in danger of drying out. Be sure to check the soil and water regularly.
Many moons ago, when I was a lodger in a match-box size apartment in Queens, New York, I was the proud owner of a tiny container garden. To gaze at the used yoghurt tubs brimming with lettuce and parsley was, well...almost like falling in love. “Be still my beating heart,” I used to mutter under my breath each time I went near that special corner in the hallway where my ‘roommates’ lived - in containers.
Now that I am home, I have a backyard where I do a little digging, a little planting, a little weeding and a whole lot of daydreaming. But now my heart is still, for I no longer have my ‘roommates’ with me.
And, come to think of it, for those of us who do not have access to a garden, a back yard or even a balcony, a container garden is really a great alternative.
To quote my real roommate who shared that apartment with me, “when there's no hope for a plant to poke its head out from between the floor-boards of your living room, when there is nothing called a balcony you can turn to, then you'd better get potty!”
Trust me, you are sure to find it worth your effort. If you think about it, you will realize container gardening offers many advantages that most of us tend to overlook: containers can be less work because they can be placed closer to a water source; they offer a smaller soil area to weed; they can be placed at a height that can minimize bending for watering; and they can provide a garden plot even in high-rise apartments.
How do we select a container, though? According to the information given in the National Garden Bureau website, virtually anything that will hold soil and water is a candidate for container growing. From a bag of soil with holes punched for planting and drainage to plastic tubs, old shoes, tin cans, hanging baskets and fancy ornamental pots there is nothing to stop you from choosing the size, shape and cost to fit your needs and desires.
Once you have a container you can probably walk around your neighborhood searching for good soil or buy a bag of soil from a plant nursery. It is said that the ‘potting soil’ should provide nutrients for plants as they grow, and should help retain moisture.
One important fact to note is that you should thoroughly water the soil before planting. Pour the water gently until water drains from the bottom of the pot. This way you can be assured that the entire soil mass is wet. If you are going to move the pots, you may want to move them before watering so they will not be as heavy as they will be after watering.
If you are planting seeds from packets, follow the seed packet directions for spacing and whether or not to cover the seeds with soil. Keep the soil moist by gentle misting or watering several times a day. When seedlings emerge keep them watered, and if you have too many plants thin them by plucking out the weakest looking ones.
“For transplants, plant the top of the root ball even with the soil line and keep plants well watered as they get established,” advise the experts a the Garden Bureaue.
A simple test as to whether or not to water is to stick your finger into the top inch of soil. If it feels damp, there is no immediate need to water; if it feels dry then you should water until some runs out the bottom of the container.
Plants that will be grown outdoors in full sun in containers can benefit from a layer of mulch on top of the soil. Mulch will help retain moisture in the soil, discourage weed growth, and break the harshness of raindrops or watering from a hose or watering can. Sawdust, and dried leaves can act as mulches-choose one appropriate to the container and the plants.
Containers placed in semi-shady or shady areas do not need mulch as much as those planted in full sun, but it is never a bad idea.
Experts say growing in containers gives you an opportunity to experiment on a small scale. If you have a shady area that you want to test to see how certain plants will grow, putting a few in a pot in that area will let you see how they do without a lot of work. Of course, you can do the same for sunny locations too. By grouping several pots, each with a different selection, (spinach, gotukola, tomatoes and brinjals) you can see which ones do better so that you can decide what to grow more and vice- versa in that shady or sunny corner.
Container growing is also an excellent choice for introducing children to gardening. Containers are easy to look after and can vary according to the age and interest of a child. Letting them choose their favourite vegetable or flowers to plant in pots would be the best way to get them started.
Surprisingly, containers can also mean much more than what they appear to be. For the Mediterranean Garden editor, Caroline Harbouri growing cannas in pots meant a marital compromise. “my husband loved cannas and, having pronounced sniffily, “They wouldn't suit the garden, we are not going to have cannas,” I reflected that this was ungenerous and suggested, “We can have a couple in pots on the balcony if you like”. And in fact they did perfectly well in pots... Today, in memory of Spyros, I still have several of his cannas on my roof terrace and find that they blend quite successfully with the other plants. This has led me to recognise that the aesthetics of pot-gardening and garden-gardening differ.”
This could be because we expect different things from our potted plants. A mature garden, even a small one, would have trees whereas a pot garden has no trees - and hence no shade. Moreover, shrubs grown even in large pots cannot attain the full stature that they would have in a normal garden. “What this means is that one tends to count more on flowers and on foliage,” says Harbouri, than one would, when growing trees in a ‘garden-garden.
For all this, Julie Lake, author of the book, Gardening in a Hot Climate, assures all gardeners “If it can be grown in the ground, it can be grown in the pot”. I confess it is a bit hard to agree with this optimistic statement - after all, what about big trees? On the other hand, if you are planning to have a container garden, I think this is a good principle to start with. Time and experience would show what you could and could not grow - in containers.
And, I'm certain, once you get going, you would never want to give up. For, as essayist and columnist Phyllis Theroux said, gardening, be it in pots or otherwise, “is the closest one can come to being present at creation.”
