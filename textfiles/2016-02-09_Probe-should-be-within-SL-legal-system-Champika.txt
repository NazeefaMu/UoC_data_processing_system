The judicial mechanism where the alleged war crimes committed by Sri Lankan tri-forces are to be examined, should be carried out in a Sri Lankan legal framework, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.


“I emphasize that the Sri Lankan armed forces carried out the war in a legal manner to defeat LTTE terrorism. Hence we can say that these war crimes have been done by LTTE,” he said.


“Only an unbiased judicial system can solve these issues. We see this situation as an issue which should be get solved within the judicial system of Sri Lanka. It is not a mistake to get foreign expertise. But the decisions should be taken within the judicial system of Sri Lanka,” he added by answering to a question by the media.
