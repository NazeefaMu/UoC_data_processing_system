Hindustan Times, Gangtok, 23.04.2017 -  Once crowned monarch, he now lives the reclusive life of a monk. Wangchuk Namgyal has preferred to slip into monasteries, caves and resultant oblivion despite being the scion of the Chogyal dynasty that once ruled Sikkim before merging with the Indian Republic to become its 22nd province in 1975.   


But some four decades later, Namgyal still evokes awe in at least some of his former subjects and derision among those opposed to the erstwhile royalty. Monarchists still speculate about his whereabouts and well-being. ‘Where is he’ and ‘how is he’ are frequent themes of discussions behind closed doors of many homes in Gangtok, the state’s laid-back capital.
