25 President's Counsel to be appointed


	

Twenty-five Attorneys-at-law will swear in as President’s Counsel (PC) on January 18 at a ceremonial sitting of the Supreme Court. The swearing-in as President’s Counsel is also known as 'taking silk'.

Attorneys-at-law who have practised as counsels in courts either in the official or unofficial bar are eligible to be appointed as PCs. Once appointed, one doesn’t lose the title even if they are appointed to the Judiciary.

Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Thomas de Sampayo and Frederick Dornhorst were the first to be appointed as King’s Counsel in 1903. It has been the practice since then to appoint lawyers who have served the country for long periods with professionalism and eminence.
