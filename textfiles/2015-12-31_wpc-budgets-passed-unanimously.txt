	Budget allocation for the ministries under the purview of the Western Provincial Council Including its Health Ministry was passed unanimously today.
	The Health Ministry’s budget was defeated on December 22 by a majority of 22 votes with 45 councillors voting against and 23 voting in favour.
	Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Chief Minister Isura Devapriya, who took over the Health Ministry following its budget defeat, said today’s voting proved the unanimity of the councillors.
	“We intend to keep it that way,” he said.
	“Even there is no unity among Parliamentarians. They are divided in to two factions. But in the Western Provincial Council, Ministers voted in unison. It is a good gesture,” the Chief Minister said.
	This was good for the budget and we will be working as a team in the future as well, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
