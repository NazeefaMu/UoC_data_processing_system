It is now part of history that the Blue party group that teamed up with the JO camp to trounce yahapalanaya split up with many of them playing truant at the eleventh hour leaving the Cabal of 16 to hold the sack. 

 


The truants have incurred so much of wrath of the Cabal of 16 for what they describe as the act of downright treachery, the latter have now baptized the two leaders of the truant group, the one from Rajarata and the other from deep South as Molligoda and Ekneligoda respectively, they say.


According to the Cabal of 16, there was another character who played a major role behind the scene to bring about the ‘great betrayal’. They have nick-named him now ‘John Doyly’. 


‘John Doyly ` is said to be a prominent politico from the Western province. 


The JO stalwarts be it during their conversations or serious discussions nowadays make it a point to refer to the three characters by their new names, they say.
