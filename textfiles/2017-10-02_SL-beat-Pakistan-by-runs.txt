Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 21 runs in the first Test of the 2-Test series as Pakistan failed to chase down a meagre 136-run target and were all out for 114. Sri Lanka lead the series 1-0 now.

Pakistan were 67 for 5 at Tea and with skipper Sarfraz Ahmad and Haris Sohail still at the crease, there was some hope still in the Test for the hosts. However, Pakistan kept losing wickets after the Tea break. Sarfraz got out after scoring 19 runs while Haris Sohail scored 34 runs, highest in the innings.

Pakistan were fighting to overhaul a modest but tricky 136-run target as they reached tea at 67-5 on the fifth and final day of the first Test in Abu Dhabi on Monday.

Skipper Sarfraz Ahmed was unbeaten on 13 and Haris Sohail 19 as Pakistan still need another 69 runs in the final session to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.

Earlier, leg-spinner Yasir Shah took 5-51 -- his 32nd five wicket haul in Tests -- to dismiss Sri Lanka for 138 in their second innings.

With the ball taking spin on a difficult Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch, Pakistani batsmen struggled against veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath (2-19) and off-spinner Dilruwan Perera (2-25).

Herath dismissed opener Sami Aslam for two before accounting for Asad Shafiq who made a fighting 20, reaching within four wickets of the 400-wicket milestone in his 84th Test.

Perera then had Shan Masood (seven) and a shaky Babar Azam for three to leave Pakistan struggling at 32-4.

In between fast bowler Suranga Lakmal had Azhar Ali caught behind for nought.

Pakistan, led by Shah, bowled well in the morning.

Sri Lanka, who resumed at 69-4, lost their last six wickets for 69 runs. Niroshan Dickwella fought hard during his unbeaten knock of 40 studded with four boundaries.

The second Test -- a day-night match -- starts in Dubai from Friday. (Dunya News)
