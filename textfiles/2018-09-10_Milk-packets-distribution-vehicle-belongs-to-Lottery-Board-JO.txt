The vehicle used to distribute the milk packets containing poisonous substance for the protesters of the Janabalaya Kolombata held on last Wednesday, belonged to the Lottery Board which comes under the Finance Ministry, Joint Opposition (JO) charged today.

Addressing a news conference, JO MP Shehan Semasinghe said they had sufficient evidence to prove that it was a plot by the Government to sabotage the protest.

“The vehicle (number plate of the vehicle is ND-3094) belonging to the Lottery Board has been used under the instructions of a top working director of the Board,

“It is questionable as to why Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has not announced his stance in this regard because the Lottery Board comes under the purview of Finance Ministry,” the MP said.

“It was evident with the recent statements made prior to the protest by Minister Harin Fernando, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayeka, and S. M. Marikkar related to their moves to supply food and beverages during the JO protest that the Government had hidden agenda to prevent the protest from taking place,” the MP added.

The JO members urged Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara to probe into this incident and carry out an impartial investigation. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
