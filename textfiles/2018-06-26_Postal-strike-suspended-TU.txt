The postal strike, launched two weeks ago would be suspended temporarily from midnight till Thursday (28) following the discussions held with Postal Services Minister Abdul Haleem, the United Postal Trade Union's Front said a short while ago.

United Postal Trade Union's Front co-convener H.K. Kariyawasam said that they had decided to suspend the strike after Minister’s promised to provide solutions to their demands by Thursday.

“Therefore, from tonight onwards we have decided to go back to work but only on a work-to-rule basis,” he said.

“If the Government failed to provide solutions by Thursday, the strike will continue,” Mr Kariyawasam said.

However, he said that the hunger strike held at the Central Mail Exchange (CME) would continue. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
