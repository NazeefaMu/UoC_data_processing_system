Namibia stuns defending champion SA to make q’finals

 
Qualifier Namibia upset defending champion South Africa by two wickets in a thrilling chase to join host Bangladesh in the quarterfinals from Group A of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup on Sunday.
Bangladesh beat Scotland by 114 runs in Cox’s Bazar for its second win and now clashes with Namibia in the last league match on Tuesday to decide Group A winner.
The winner of Bangladesh-Namibia match will feature in the first quarter-final against Group D runner-up (India or Nepal) in Mirpur on Friday, 5 February, while the side that finishes second in Group A will take on winner of Group D in Fatullah on 6 February.
England brushed aside Zimbabwe by 129 runs in Chittagong to top Group C with a third successive win. England will now wait the second-placed team from Group B in the quarter-final on 7 February in Mirpur.
The West Indies romped to a 262-run win over Fiji in another Group C match in Chittagong. It now faces Zimbabwe on Tuesday to determine the second qualifier from the group with the winner meeting Group B champion (Pakistan or Sri Lanka) in Fatullah on Monday, 8 February.
Namibia’s unheralded cricketers, who had beaten Scotland in their first match, kept their cool amid mounting tension to knock South Africa out in Cox’s Bazar.
The memorable win meant that Namibia, which finished 14th in the United Arab Emirates two years ago, will improve upon its best finish of 11th in Malaysia in 2008.
