Acting IGP C. D. Wickremaratne today directed the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) to investigate the incident in Mount Lavinia on Tuesday in which a group of protesters had allegedly harassed the group of 31 Myanmar refugees.

Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the police also obtained a court order from the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court to obtain unedited footage of the incident from the Television Channels.

A tense situation was prevailed when a group led by Buddhist monks stormed a United Nations-run safe house in Mt. Lavinia for Rohingya refugees demanding they be sent back to Myanmar.

Later, the Police transferred the refugees, 17 children, 7 women and 7 men, to the Boossa Detention Centre for their safety.

A Sri Lanka Coast Guard Vessel on routine patrol duty in the seas off Kankesanthurai intercepted the fishing boat and took the refugees into custody on April 30.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
