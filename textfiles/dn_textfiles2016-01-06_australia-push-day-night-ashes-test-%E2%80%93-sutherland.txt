Australia to push for day-night Ashes Test – Sutherland

Sports Letter:
A poser for ICC
I refer to your article under the caption ‘Govt. Seeks ICC help to inquire into financial irregularities and corruption at SLC” in your CDN of January 4th 2016.
Since a probe for the period 2011 to 2014 of SLC has been completed and the report handed over to the Minister of Sports, the above assistance from the ICC must be to probe the activities of the Govt. appointed Interim committee under the Chairmanship of Sidath Wettimuny. That is a good thing and why not?
It is strange however that the ICC has reached such understanding with the Government on matters that are purely internal to SLC to be under supervision of ICC and the Government of Sri Lanka.
Early last year, the ICC threatened suspension on Sri Lanka Cricket when the Minister of Sports Navin Dissanayake appointed an Interim Committee without conducting elections. The ICC says they do not tolerate government interference into the activities of their Members, but how come now.
How funny things keep changing around. I wonder what ICC has to say about all this? It is anyway good that Interim Committees are also probed not only elected bodies. The Government should also probe the
D.S. de Silva Interim Committee with the supervision of ICC for bringing SLC to bankruptcy a few years back.

Sydney, Tuesday: Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said Tuesday he will talk to his England counterparts about the prospect of scheduling a day-night Ashes Test in Australia in the 2017-18 series.
Sutherland said he has mentioned the possibility "in passing" with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) about playing a day-night Test in the next Ashes series.
Sutherland said he has already spoken to South Africa and Pakistan authorities about playing a day-night Test in Australia next summer following the success of the concept in Adelaide in November last year.
The historic Adelaide match against New Zealand attracted a total attendance of 123,736 fans over three lively days. The opening day gate of 47,441 was the biggest at the Adelaide Test since the famous 1932-33 'bodyline' series.
Sutherland said it would be logical that the continuing success of further day-night Tests in the next Australian summer would make it an attractive proposition to schedule a day-night Test in the Ashes series in the following season.
"We will be actively pursuing at least one day-night Test this year with our two visiting teams, South Africa and Pakistan," Sutherland told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
"And I guess on the assumption that we do play a day-night Test next summer or two that we will progress that further and it will be more of a fixture in our calendar.
"Needless to say the summer after that is an Ashes series and probably that just established tradition will continue."
Sutherland said England administrators were progressive thinkers and would be interested in the day-night Test concept.
"Only (spoken to them) in passing, nothing official and to be honest it's a long way off, but I know that the chairman (Giles Clarke) and chief executive (Tom Harrison) of the ECB are very progressive in their thinking about the game," he said.
"With CEO Tom Harrison's background in the media he'll certainly understand growing the popularity of the game is first and foremost in our minds as cricket administrators."
Sutherland said the Adelaide Test had shown the cricket public's curiosity and acceptance of day-night Test cricket.
"The point is that the hours of the Test match, if they are shifted in such a way that they move into the afternoon and evening, what Adelaide showed us is that more people will turn up to watch the matches and more people will be watching on television," he said.
"That's what we want Test cricket to be -- more accessible to the public than it is now and Adelaide was proof of that concept and we're going to see lots more day-night Test cricket in future."
