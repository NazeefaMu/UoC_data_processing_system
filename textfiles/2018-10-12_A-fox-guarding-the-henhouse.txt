A fox guarding the henhouse?


	



 

A leading political authority has reportedly appointed a black-listed shady character as the head of a financial institution at the periphery.

 


This discredited character had earlier worked in several banks some of which he had to leave under a cloud.


The man had taken to politics after being compelled to quit the banking sector and had campaigned tirelessly for the political authority in question at the last Diyawanna poll while functioning as the opposition leader of a mini-local body.


Meanwhile, some TU leaders are said to be putting up a brief for the political authority saying that he had made the appointment not knowing the man’s track record and adding that action was being taken to relieve him of the high post he had been offered.
