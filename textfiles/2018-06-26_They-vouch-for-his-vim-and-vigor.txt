Some employees of a research institute in the agricultural sector were up in arms when they heard that the authorities had decided to send their boss home on retirement.

 


So, a group of employees both male and female had met the purohita concerned to lodge their protest.


The purohita had explained that their boss was now past his seventies and it was high time to allow him to enjoy his well-earned rest.


“At this age, you can’t expect him to be quite active and energetic,” he had added. Then a young female employee had risen to speak on behalf of the employees. “Sir, our boss is quite energetic despite his age. He is physically and mentally strong enough to run our institute!” she had maintained. The other male and female employees readily endorsed her view, they say.
