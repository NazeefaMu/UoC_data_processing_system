By putting off provincial elections
Elections Commissioner has violated provisions of PC Ordinance

The Elections Commissioner has violated the provisions of the Provincial Council Ordinance by putting off Provincial Council Elections, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Secretary General and Parliamentarian Udaya Prabath Gammanpila.
He stated that public representation has been placed under an official by the act of placing Provincial Councils under Commissioners.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya head office.
MP Gammanpila further stated that the present government is attempting to postpone provincial council elections. He added that according to the provisions of the Provincial Council Ordinance, the Provincial Council election had to be held six months before the completion of the members' terms. He said that the term of Provincial Councils ended on October 16, adding that nominations have to be called immediately after the term ended, but there had been no such arrangements initiated by the government. He also said that by such delay, the Elections Commissioner had neglected his duties.
Gammanpila further stated that a commissioner is not allowed to use the powers of a mayor except for three reasons. He said by using the powers of mayors, commissioners could be brought before Court.
He also said that the the President as well as the Chief Opposition Whip in Parliament are "Swans."
He added the Chief Opposition Whip had no other topic other than the issue concerning Indian fishermen.
He said that the Opposition Leader had so far not raised any issue other than that of the North and East.
He further said that even the late UNP President J. R. Jayewardene did not attempt to take over the powers of the Opposition. He said the UNP is at present attempting to do so.
