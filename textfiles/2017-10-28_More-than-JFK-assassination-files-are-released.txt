More than 2,800 JFK assassination files are released


	



 

US, (Daily Mail), 27 October 2017 - The White House has released 2,891 documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy that have long been kept secret.   


The trove of files was published on the National Archives website on Thursday night, and produced revelations and prompted more questions about the fateful day in Dallas in 1963.  


The documents revealed that Lee Harvey Oswald was being tracked by the FBI before JFK was killed and met a KGB agent in Mexico City’s Soviet Embassy two months before the shooting.  


An unidentified man also called the FBI and said they were going to kill Oswald - just 24 hours before he was gunned down by Jack Ruby while in police custody.  


But not all of the records were released, because President Trump has kept some back so federal agencies can black out portions.  


A White House official told DailyMail.com during a conference call that while Trump wants to remove the ‘veil’ of secrecy regarding the 1963 killing, he has ‘no choice today but to accept those redactions rather than risk irreversible harm’ to the country.
