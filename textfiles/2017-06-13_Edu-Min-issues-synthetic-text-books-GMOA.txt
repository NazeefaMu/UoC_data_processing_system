The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today claimed that the Education Ministry has distributed among students text books printed on synthetic paper causing health hazards to children aged below 12.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference said the Education Ministry had printed more than 500,000 Geography text books at a cost of Rs.150 million for use by grade seven without considering the recommendations of the National Planning Department (NPD).

“We believe that more than 200,000 books may have been already issued to students,” he said.

Dr. Aluthge said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam had submitted a Cabinet paper but the NPD rejected the proposal.

“The Education Ministry has not conducted a field study on finance, technical, environmental and health before going ahead on the pilot project. NPD has said the books may cause health issues among students below the age of 12,” he said and added the chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic paper could cause shortage of breath, eye diseases and skin problems.
