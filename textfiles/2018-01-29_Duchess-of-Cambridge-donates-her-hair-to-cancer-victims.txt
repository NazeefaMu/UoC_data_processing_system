UK, (daily Mail), 28 January 2018-The Duchess of Cambridge has donated some of her hair to go towards making wigs for young patients suffering from cancer.  


The 36-year-old’s hairdresser is believed to have trimmed more than seven inches from her usual length.  


An aide is believed to have picked up the hair which is thought to have been sent to the Little Princess Trust.  


The organisation helps make wigs for children who have lost their own hair after receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment.  


The idea is believed to have come to the Duchess after she had her hair cut at Kensington Palace by hairdresser  


‘It was sent using someone else’s name, so that the trust didn’t know it was from a royal source – they just thought it was from a female donor in the Kensington area.’
