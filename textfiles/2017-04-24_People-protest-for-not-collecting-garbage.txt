Residents in the Orugodawatte area last evening held a demonstration at the Orugodawatte junction, blocking the Colombo -Avissawella Low Level road, expressing displeasure against the authorities for not collecting their garbage gathered in the area, police said today.

The protesters claimed that a large amount of garage were spread all over the area as the Colombo Municipal authorities had not collected the garbage during past few days.

Residents claimed that the authorities reduced the collection of garbage in the area following the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump Collapse. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
