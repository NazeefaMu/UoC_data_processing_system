While welcoming Sri Lankan government's focus on economic growth and reform, Australia said today that it would continue to support Sri Lanka as it makes progress on national reconciliation.
Visiting Australian Foreign Affairs and Trade Department Deputy Secretary Ric Wells, who led the Australian delegation to inaugural Senior Officials’ Talks with Sri Lanka on Monday in Colombo, said the inaugural talks would enable both countries to enhance bilateral relationships.   
“I was pleased to visit Colombo for these inaugural talks, which will enable us to build our already strong relationship. This year, a major focus was on strengthening cooperation in ways that build our economic relationship. Australia welcomes the Sri Lankan government's focus on economic growth and reform. We will also continue to support Sri Lanka as it makes progress on national reconciliation,” Mr. Wells said.
Mr. Wells and his counterpart from the Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Ministry, Additional Secretary Ranjith Uyangoda, had discussed opportunities in trade and investment, development assistance, reconciliation and human rights, as well as people-to-people links. Australia and Sri Lanka's broader roles had also been addressed, the Australian High Commission said in a statement.
Mr. Wells said that it was a time of great optimism in Sri Lanka and Australia shares this belief and see great potential for bilateral relationship to grow in new and dynamic ways.
