Now that a politico involved in marketing a protein-rich food item has recently been appointed to a high post, the people in his area have begun expressing the belief that they would be able to buy this item at a bargain price.

 


This politico is said to have made big money by marketing this food item and continues with this business even after making his foray into politics.


Active as an opposition politico, this politico is often being referred to by the nickname, ‘Mega-polis’. People had begun calling him by this nickname, following a public statement made by him that he would set up ‘mega-polis’ centres rather than Mobile Police Posts.
