Decisions with regard to educational policies should be taken by the Government and not the students, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said today.

Issuing a statement, Minister Kiriella said the Government had provided all the facilities required by the university students including the increase of bursaries and student allowances.

“Arrangements have been made to provide all university students with hostels facilities by 2018. Therefore the students have no problems to complain. The previous regime introduced a private university but protest marches are being held demanding to close it down five years later. No one opposed to SAITM Campus in Malabe when it was introduced,” he added.

He said even though the previous regime introduced it the government has been unable to close this down because around 500-600 students are currently studying there.

“I believe the Court will give a favourable verdict. We are ready to accept any decision given by the Courts," he added.
