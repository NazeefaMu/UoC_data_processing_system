However it said more atmospheric depressions are expecting in the coming days in the Bay of Bengal.

“Showery and windy condition about 60-70 kmph are expected over the island particularly in the South-Western part in the coming days. Heavy rain fall of about 100 to 150 mm can be expected further at some places in the Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Uva and Western provinces,” it added.

Meanwhile, the Irrigation Department said that the water levels of Pitabeddara, Panadugama and Sapugoda areas in Nilwala River and Thawalama area in the Gin River were reaching spill levels.

However, he said according to the present data, the Meteorology Department could not predict its behaviour this early.

“We advise the public to be vigilant even in the next couple of days,” he added.
