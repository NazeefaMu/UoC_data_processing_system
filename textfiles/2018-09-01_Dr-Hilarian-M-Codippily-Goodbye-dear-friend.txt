Dr. Hilarian .M.Codippily Goodbye dear friend


	

My dear friend Hilarian is no more,  
As his immortal soul has gone through Heaven’s door,  
While his mortal remains lie under ground,  
To mother-earth-till thy kingdom come-bound.  
His sojourn on planet earth,  
Lasted around 80 years from the time of birth,  
During this lifespan – as a Mathematician, Physicist & Economists-he reached great heights  
To bag a world Bank top slot to set the Developing World’s- Financial, Economic and Development- strategies right.  


As an eminent ballroom dancer,  
He danced his way into the arms of charming Sheila-his lifelong marriage partner,  
And lived happily for 54 years thereafter,  
In accordance with the matrimonial vows they took before the church altar.  


On the 18th of August 2018,the Earth received an honoured guest,  
As Hilarian was laid in peace to rest,  
Where in that state he will stay,  
And rise on the final judgement day.  
Goodbye dear friend,  
Though your life on earth has come to an end,  
Memories of you will linger,  
In the minds of those near & dear to you, for ever.  
 A.Pulle
Dehiwela.
