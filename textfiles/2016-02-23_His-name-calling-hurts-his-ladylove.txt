His name calling hurts his ladylove


	



It made newspaper headlines when a certain politico described those delegates of local authorities who attended the much publicized conference in Negombo as rogues, cheats and shysters.  Now this worthy has incurred the wrath of his ladylove for making this hard-hitting statement.

 


The ladylove had given her paramour a tongue lashing pointing out that he had overlooked the fact that she herself was a target of the abusive epithets he had used.


“You called all delegates at this conference rogues, cheats blah, blah, blah virtually tarring me with the same brush.  I too was on the stage at that conference,” the irate mistress had railed at the politico.
