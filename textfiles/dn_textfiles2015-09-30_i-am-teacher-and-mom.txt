I am a teacher and a mom...!

I have quite an interesting and entertaining job. It involves your children. Yes, I spend my days enjoying myself with your children.
They make me laugh; they make me cry - in short- they make me feel young again. As a teacher I have to handle them with responsibility, love and care. It is such a challenge to work with them. But usually the biggest challenge is with you parents. It is hard to meet with the demanding expectations of school. Believe me, I know. I am a mom too. Yet, there are some things that need to be attended to for the sake of our child no matter what our position in life is. In my life as a teacher, when certain issues happen to any of my kids in class, it makes me stop and think, "Is this the usual way this child is brought-up? Does this parent even know of the plight her child is facing? Is this the price that the child pays when her 'educated-parents' have high profile jobs?"
But still, we all have great expectations of what our child must and should be in the future. There is a famous quote by an author named Stacia Tauscher - "We worry about what our children will become tomorrow, yet we forget that he is someone today."
In this article I would love to share with you some situations that generally happen in a Montessori / Pre-school, what we have experienced as teachers and what we expect from you as parents. I understand that you may find some hard to believe, but I promise I am not making anything up!
School bags and bottles:
You have been given a list of items at the beginning of each academic year of what should be brought daily to school. Buy a bag that all these things fit into. Some children bring little fancy bags (shape bags) which has their favourite cartoon character in front (there is no problem with the cartoon character - only the shape and size). Ok. So all the items in the list are stuffed into this 'bag'. There is no neatness. There is no order. Your child will not learn to organize her stuff.
Bottles should be non-toxic and of good standard. The ones that could be cleaned easily. (When I say cleaned, it doesn't mean only outer appearance- you should be able to clean it right to the bottom.) Do not send plastic re-usable bottles (sprite, coke, fanta etc.) with water. It is unhygienic and also a health hazard.
Check their backpacks everyday:
Yes, it contains their daily work. Paper, glue, glitter, clay, and sometimes unidentified objects made by them. Take them out and appreciate their efforts (even if you have no idea what it is.) Keep them in a separate box/drawer/shelf/cupboard at least for some time. (And then get rid of it - your wish)
Some bags are not emptied daily. Its amazing what you could find in backpacks of pre-schoolers which had not been 'checked' during the week-end.
Crumbs (from Fridays snack)
Banana skin
Cockroach (dead)
Gecko (one actually jumped right onto a teacher when she opened the bag)
Small beads
Building blocks/ pieces from jigsaw puzzles/ chalk (sometimes taken from the class)
PLUS Friday's handwork of paper, glue, glitter etc.
Lunch boxes:
OMG! The discoveries in a lunch box! Without explanation I shall report it; you decide what possibly went wrong!
Expired cheese wedge (when the foil was opened it was filled with fungus!)
Cockroach (live - this time)
Box filled to the brim with rice. (the poor child does not even know from where to start..)
Unwashed box with food in.
Empty lunch box!!
Please, please see to your child's food. I think most of these situations occur when either the parent is too busy running around in the morning, or, a maid/servant attends to the child's needs. (Obviously she would only be bothered to put the food in, regardless of how unhygienic it is)
Whatever the reason may be, please take responsibility of your child's food intake. "Better to be safe than sorry" as the saying goes..
Most schools offer a Healthy food timetable so that you could prepare "healthy food" and send them on the specific days marked. Please adhere to this since it is good for your child. If he/she is a fussy eater give him/her something he/she prefers to eat at home before you bring him/her to school. (NO JUNK FOOD PLEASE) and pack the food item mentioned in the list in her box. Believe me, when they see the whole class having the same food item, they kind of get a liking to their own food in the box. Get them used to different varieties of healthy food. The appearance does not always have to look the same boring stuff. You could bake, cook, grill, grate or do whatever, (so long as its edible) to your child's fancies.
"Children are not a distraction from more important work. They are the most important work."

You should always....
Respect your child. Give them lots and lots of love. Show them that you care and be there for them in their fleeting life of pre-school. It will never come again.
