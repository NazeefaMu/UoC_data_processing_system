PM delays UNP LG nomination list for Kolonnawa UC


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had advised the UNP hierarchy to temporarily put on hold the handing over of the party’s nomination list for the Kolonnawa Urban Council, party sources said yesterday.

The source said the party leader had given this instruction as a result of the controversy that had taken place after the nomination given to Mrs Sumana Premachandra, wife of late Presidential Advisor Baratha Lakshman Premachandra and mother of MP Hirunika Premachandra was found to have been erased using tippex.

The news of the wilful removal of Mrs Premachandra's name had raised eyebrows in the UNP headquarters "Sirikotha".

These sources said it was likely that Mrs Premachandra’s name would be re-instated in the list as the party leader, General Secretary Kabir Hashim and Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake were all in favour of the nomination given to her.

However, it was reported that a certain UNP Colombo District MP was opposed to fielding her as a candidate. The matter is expected to be resolved today. (Yohan Perera)
