Embilipitiya was the ninth location of the AIA-in-Town programme, a much anticipated event for adults and children alike. This town storm type activity spanning five days had the busy city buzzing with excitement as AIA carried out its fun-filled activities. 
AIA balloons swarmed the skies with music, games and entertainment galore on-ground. But it wasn’t just fun and games. AIA-in-Town’s main objective is educational, helping people understand the gaps that exist in their protection and pensions needs, whilst giving them advice and solutions on how best to bridge those gaps.
A host of eye-opening workshops were conducted through the event. Some of the popular workshops were those designed to help entrepreneurs with financial planning, retirement and pensions planning for Sri Lankans, how to save for education and how to handle the unforeseen loss of a breadwinner. 
AIA Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani commented, “We’re delighted by the response we have had from the residents of Embilipitiya who participated with great enthusiasm and appreciated our event and the effort to help them understand the importance of preparing to face the future, especially with regard to saving for their retirement and putting in place an education plan for their children.”
