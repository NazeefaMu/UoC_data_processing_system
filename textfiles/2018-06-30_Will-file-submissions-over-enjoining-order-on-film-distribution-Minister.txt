Submissions will be filed on Thursday's enjoining order issued by the Colombo District Court restricting the National Film Corporation from taking over local film distribution, Higher Education & Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

The EAP, CEL, MPI and LFD film circuits which had hitherto handled local film distribution since 2001, filed action in court, following a decision by the National Film Corporation to take over local film distribution.

“The decision to allow the National Film Corporation to handle film distribution was taken on the grounds of the private sector monopoly which has led to a catastrophe in the Cinema Industry. These private companies have done nothing towards the up-liftment of the Cinema Industry. We want to protect the Film Industry and for that, we need the cooperation of all stakeholders,” Mr. Rajapakshe told a news conference.

He said they had discussed the issue with President Maithripala Sirisena who had promised to render his support and also to grant tax concessions to the film industry.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
