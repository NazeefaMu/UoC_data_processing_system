An Ode to Sybil


	

Sybil Wettasinghe

 

Many a time I commend,
With my daughter the eldest,
Making her a reader, far ahead of avid and voracious,
By your Umbrella Thief, Kuda Hora, I mean.
You the phenomenal literary icon, now a proud NONEGENARIAN!
PRIDE of the nation, fired the young’s imagination.
Modern generation, poignantly lacking,
Their potential is nil, it seems to me.
Who is your MUSE? Is still the wellspring deep?
Sybil the colossus! Doyen of the genre!
Living at your age, the only solace.
When I fly to the land of Kangaroos, on the ninth of December,
I am carrying KUDA HORA, the b’day gift to my Hima,
My e-grandparented, cute son the grand, the pride of the third generation.
Dear respected Sybil let me crown you.
The jewel of the literary giants,
Our soil has ever seen, our children have ever felt, so
‘’So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
  so long lives this, and gives life to thee.’’
