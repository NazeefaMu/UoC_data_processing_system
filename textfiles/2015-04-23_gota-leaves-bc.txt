Former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa left the Bribery Commission a short while ago after his lawyers requested more time as the matter he was questioned was different from the one which was informed to him.
Mr. Rajapaksa told media outside the Bribery Commission that he would help any investigation against him.
