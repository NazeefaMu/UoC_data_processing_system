Now for the Clifford Cup k/o

With the league rugby season for the year over, where Kandy Sports Club won it for the 17th time in 22 years, it's time for the Clifford Cup knockout rugby. All eight clubs will be seen in action. The first quarterfinals are fixed for March 11, 12 and 13 and the semi-finals for March 19 and 20 and the final on March 26.
The Clifford Cup is the most prestigious club rugby knockout tournament in Sri Lanka and arguably the oldest rugby tournament in Asia. The Clifford Cup commenced in 1911 and has been played continuously since 1950. The tournament began as a competition between the Mercantile executives in Colombo and Planters in the hill country.
This is how the Clifford Cup came into being. In 1911 Lady Elizabeth Clifford (the wife of the acting Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hugh Clifford) was interested in the annual rugby football fixture Low Country versus Up Country, and expressed a wish that a match take place in Colombo on her birthday, 26 August, between teams representing the United Services Kandy and All Ceylon.
Due to unforeseen circumstances the scheduled date was put off by a week and the first Lady Clifford Cup match (as it was originally called)[ was played on 2 September 1911, with the United Services Kandy team defeating All Ceylon 25 points to 0. The All Ceylon team was composed entirely of European expatriates and the United Services team of members of the army and police force. In 1914 the Army regiment from which many of the United Services were drawn was transferred from Ceylon following the outbreak of World War I.
At one time Up-Country and Low Country group leaders clashed for the richest prize in the local rugby scene - the Clifford Cup. Then came a knockout system, searching for the ultimate strength of the two top slot occupiers for the respective groups. Thereafter came the overall knockout system considering the fact that the reputation in the league was nothing.
Once again the format of the tournament was changed and the leader of the league tournament was considered the winner of the Clifford Cup. In 1975, the format was further adjusted to give prominence to the teams who are able to score the highest number of goals.
It looked as the system denied the team with the best record from a top position unless they crowned their victories with more and more tries and goals. Now the Clifford Cup competition has come a long way with most of the clubs winning it.
Then came the competition for the clubs in 1950, and today this is the oldest rugby tournament in Sri Lanka, the first clubs to play in the Clifford Cup were Havelock SC, CH & FC, CR & FC, Dimbulla A & CC, Kandy SC, Uva, Dickoya MCC and KV.
Kandy Sports Club has won the Clifford Cup a record 19 times, including a consecutive period of ten years between 1995 and 2005 (the competition was not held in 1998) and six consecutive years between 2007 and 2012.
In 2006 Kandy SC and Navy SC both withdrew from the tournament (Kandy due to dispute over the ground allocation and Navy as their members were called up for national service duty), the Cup was won by the CR&FC.
The CR&FC have won it 14 times, including a tie with Dimbulla ACC, Havelocks SC have won it 13 times including a tie with Police SC, Police SC 8 times with ties against Havelock SC and Army SC, CH&FC 7 times, Dimbulla A & CC twice including a tie with CR&FC, Army SC twice with one tie with Police SC, whilst Air Force SC and Navy SC have only won the cup once.
