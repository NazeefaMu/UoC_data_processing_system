Flights between Kochi, India and Colombo had been temporally suspended as Cochin International Airport had suspended all its operations until Saturday afternoon due to floods, NDTV reported awhile ago.

The report said: “The torrential rainfall, which has forced the state's reservoirs to release excess water causing flooding and landslides, was expected to stop today.

“But the Met. office has said it is likely to continue till Saturday. A red alert has been issued for several districts today and tomorrow. Forty two people have died since August 8 in incidents related to what has turned out to be the state's worst monsoon in almost a century.”
