First local bank to offer fully-integrated electronic PCM 
Until recently, the offering of a fully integrated electronic banking portal to top tier corporates to better manage their payments and cash management was a captive business of the multinational banks. What is noteworthy is that with the launch of HNB Online, HNB now enters this market as the first local bank to support corporates in this important business sphere. HNB Online is designed to allow corporates comprehensive real time control over their day to day management of collections, payments and liquidity investments whilst also supporting in-depth performance capabilities that can easily be integrated into any Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system such as SAP and Oracle, in order to deliver a total banking solution for enterprise-level clients.

In more recent years in particular, the Bank has worked   aggressively develop and refine its product depth and service offering, both from a human resource perspective as well as from the adoption of breakthrough technologies. Our new Payments and Cash Management platform - HNB Online, represents the latest and most bold step in this long journey and we are confident that its unprecedented functionalities and capabilities will revolutionize the experience of banking in Sri Lanka and permanently raise the bar for customer expectations of integrated banking systems,” HNB’s  Ruwan Manatunga, DGM Corporate Banking said.

Migrating from traditional 
manual payments
Sandun Hapugoda, Head of Payments and Cash Management, further elaborated that the portal is rich with many functionalities that includes migrating manual paper based cheque and pay order payments to electronic-based processing, as well as supporting electronic fund transfers such as Sri Lanka Interbank Payments (SLIPS), Common Electronic Fund Transfer System (CEFTS) and Real-Time Gross Payments (RTGP) etc, as template based transactions or as bulk payments through file upload or direct ERP integration. 
With the use of HNB’s electronic fund transfer product suite, corporates are capable of experiencing reduced processing costs and improved workflow efficiencies whilst been able to initiate transactions through a highly secure environment. HNB Online also allows corporates to maintain complex authorization matrixes as well as schedule payments to be effected at a future date.

Additionally, an array of MI reports are available for ease of reconciliation.
Compatibility to receive data files 
in any format and initiate transaction alerts
Another key feature of HNB Online is the ability of the system to accept any file format of a corporate without the company having to incur any additional cost to change their corporate ERP system to be compatible to upload files to HNB’s platform. The system also initiates automated alerts to the beneficiaries as well as authorizes transactions confirming the completion of transactions effected.
 Real-time reconciliation of collections and receivables
The platform further supports a fully-integrated collections solution through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Electronic Invoice Presentment & Payments (EIPP) that provides capabilities for streamlining collections and receivable reconciliation. These features provide significant value to corporates that have a large daily collection volume from multiple sources. 
With the EDI solution, the bank makes available and extends to corporates HNB’s full 250 branch network along with 400 plus  ATMs and cash deposit machines  as collection points. Collection transactions from across the Bank’s delivery channels are processed by the EDI system and updated real-time with the corporate’s ERP account receivable module. This automation of real time reconciliation of collection transactions help eliminate manual reconciliation requirements and as a result Corporates are now able to leverage on this system to fasten time critical business processes. That is the release or dispatch products and services immediately upon the realtime update of collections and reconciliation of accounts receivables.
