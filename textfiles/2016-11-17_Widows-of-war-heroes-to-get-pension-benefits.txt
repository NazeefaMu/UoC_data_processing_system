City Planning and Water Supply State Minister, Dr. Sudharshini Fernandopulle said President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi to formulate a life pension scheme for widows of war heroes.

Dr. Fernandopulle expressed hopes that the war hero widows will get the benefits similar to that of retired disabled soldiers from February 17, which the government granted on Feb.7th.

This follows weeks of protests staged by disabled soldiers demanding the same retirement benefits paid to retired soldiers.

The decision was taken after a discussion between Mr. Hettiarachchi and representatives of disabled soldiers held at the Defense Ministry.
