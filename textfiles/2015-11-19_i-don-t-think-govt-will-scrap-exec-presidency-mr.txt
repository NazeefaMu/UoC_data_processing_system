Former president Mahinda Rajapakse said yesterday, in Kandy, that the executive presidential system would not be changed by this government.
“What I feel is that the Executive Presidency will not be changed by this government,” he said.
The former president told the media so after paying homage to the Tooth Relic at the Dalada Maligawa on the occasion of his birthday. He then had a discussion with the Diyawadana Nilame of the Dalada Maligawa, Pradeep Nilanga Dela.
Thereafter he called on the Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter, the Ven Niyangoda Vijitha Siri Thera and had a private discussion. The Venerable Thera spoke to the media saying that, considering what is now taking place in the country, the former president was now seen to be worthy of merit.
The former president also paid a courtesy call on the deputy registrar of Asgiriya Chapter, the Ven Narampanawe Ananda Thera.
Commenting on the Avant Garde case, the former president said, "The Attorney General has ruled that no action could be taken on the Avant Garde case, I regret to note that a large number of employees of Avant Garde will lose their jobs."
He also said that releasing the LTTE cadres, including hardcore Tamil Tigers was an election pledge. "Now they are keeping their promise," he said.
With regard to the accusations levelled against the Rajapakse family about corruption and fraud, he vehemently denied any direct or indirect involvement in any such activities.(J A L Jayasinghe)
