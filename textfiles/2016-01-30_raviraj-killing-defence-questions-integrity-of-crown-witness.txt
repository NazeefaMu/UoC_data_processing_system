While cross examining the crown witness in the non-summary inquiry into the killing of former TNA Jaffna District MP Nadaraja Raviraj, Defense Counsel who appeared for the second suspect, alleged that the crown witness, Sampath Prithiviraj, and his accomplices from Karuna’s party had been involved in the alleged killing and later appeared as a crown witness to protect himself from facing charges.
The Defense Counsel further alleged that the crown witness, former police constable, Sampath Prithiviraj’s three statements which he had given to the CID on February 26, March 20 and 23 in 2015 respectively were contradictory and seems false.
The crown witness was earlier a suspect in the killing. He went on to say that so called statements made by the crown witness lacked credibility, as he had added new facts in all three statements.Earlier, seven suspects, Palana Sami Suresh, Prasad Hettiarachchi, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda, Sivakanth Vivekanandan, Fabian Royston Toussaint and Sampath Munasinghe were charged with five counts over the killing of Mr. Raviraj.
Magistrate Thilina Gamage postponed the inquiry until February 11 and further remanded the suspects Prasad Hettiarachchi, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda and crown witness Sampath Prithiviraj. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
