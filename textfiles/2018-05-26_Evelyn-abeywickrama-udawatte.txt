A grateful gathering paid their last respects to Mrs Evelyn Abeywickrama Udawatte at Kanatte on 16th April 2018. She was a vibrantly pretty elegant lady and an outstanding personality resident in Bullers Lane for very many decades.


She was the second daughter of the legendary late Hon Simon Abeywickrama who was a Member of the Legislative Council, State Council and the first Parliament as Parliamentary Secretary of colonial Ceylon and the Chairman of the Dehiwela - Mt Lavinia Urban Development Council in the 1940s simultaneously, having won the Council election admirably in the constituency as well . His record majority victories in the Baddegama electorate was also outstanding in the 1930s and’40s. Evelyn portrayed her legendary father’s leadership command and qualities.


She lost her illustrious father when he was just 49 years of age and she was in her late teens. She married genial Don Robert Udawatte a well endowed proprietory planter and a very hospitable gentleman, who died when he was quite young. Evelyn managed the estates, domestic and family matters with distinction. Her son Hiranya in USA and family, daughter Gayani who were very near and dear to her could be justifiably proud of their ancestry, their father and their mother who lived to be 91 years. Her sister was late Mrs Manel Hettiarachchi and her brothers were late Hamilton, Felix, Rajah and SD. Her younger sister Astrid is now their only surviving family member.

Evelyn was very helpful and generous to the poor, her father’s constituents, friends and relatives especially in need, With her late father’s respect and acceptability enshrined, she held the great political divide of Sri Lanka with equal ease and distinction, strengthening her family friendships with them built solidly from her childhood. She was a social elite, outspoken and quite at home for many decades on equal par with the political leaders of the country, as most of them were her father’s parliamentary contemporaries or dear family friends thereafter. Though she did not need their patronage personally, I am well aware that she was able to help many in need, who could otherwise never have come close to the powers that be, for justified priority assistance.


It is futile to elaborate on quality vintage Champagne as their bouquets are self-explanatory. Evelyn lived a life generously helping all those who came to her for assistance and need. She will be long remembered with undying love, thanks, affection and heartfelt gratitude, in prayers and beyond, by so many who benefited immensely from her unfailing assistance. She touched hearts genuinely.


Many will miss her benevolence, presence in the hour of need and generosity without any prejudice to all walks of life - May she attain Nibbana.
