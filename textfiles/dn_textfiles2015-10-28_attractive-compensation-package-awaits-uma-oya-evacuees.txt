Attractive compensation package awaits Uma Oya evacuees

An attractive compensation package will be offered to those who will lose their dwellings for the construction of the Uma Oya Project, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa said.
Addressing the media yesterday at his Ministry, Minister Soysa said that Rs.4,000 million had already been granted by the government to pay compensation to the affected families.
Apart from that, a decision has already been taken by the government to provide alternative land one acre in extent to each farmer family who will lose their lands due to this project.
"Those who are currently engaged in cultivation in state lands without a licence, will also receive lands under this compensation scheme," the minister said. He also said that around 2500 families will be affected by the project and an assessment of damages suffered in the area is currently underway.
