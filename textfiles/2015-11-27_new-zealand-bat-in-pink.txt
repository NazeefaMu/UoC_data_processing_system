New Zealand bat in Pink-ball Test


	


	Brendon McCullum finally won his first toss of the series and New Zealand will bat first in the inaugural day-night Test against Australia at Adelaide Oval. It means that Mitchell Starc will likely enter the history books as the first man to bowl a pink ball in Test cricket, with either Tom Latham or Martin Guptill to face the first delivery.
	New Zealand made one change to their line-up with spin-bowling allrounder Mitchell Santner called in to make his Test debut at the expense of fast bowler Matt Henry. Santner is listed to bat at No.6 and gives New Zealand a second slow-bowling option, with Mark Craig having retained his place as the frontline spinner.
	Australia made two forced changes due to the retirement of Mitchell Johnson and the hamstring injury suffered by Usman Khawaja in the second Test at the WACA. Peter Siddle came in for Johnson and Khawaja's replacement, Shaun Marsh, is listed at No.4. Josh Hazlewood was retained despite some queries over his workload, with James Pattinson released to play in the Sheffield Shield.
	The match was due to start on a pitch with much more grass than usual for an Adelaide Oval surface, with Cricket Australia keen to ensure the pink ball is given every opportunity to hold its colour throughout the innings.
