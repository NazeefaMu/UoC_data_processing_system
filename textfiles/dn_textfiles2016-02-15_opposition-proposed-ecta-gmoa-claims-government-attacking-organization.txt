Opposition to proposed ECTA: GMOA claims government attacking organization

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) yesterday claimed that the government is attacking their organization and individual officers due to their opposition to the proposed Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA).
Current Secretary of the organization Dr. Nalinda Herath was on Friday summoned to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to record a statement regarding a document published by the GMOA in 2012.
According to him, the move is an attack on the organization as they were key organizers, of the protest against the ETCA held on Thursday. He claimed that the government is engaging on a vicious attack against professionals who voiced their opinion on the proposed agreement with India.
"The document is a guideline on licensing foreign doctors to practice in Sri Lanka which was developed by the GMOA in partnership with the Ministry of Health," Dr. Herath said.
According to him, the questioning was about a detail included in the document.
"There was a problem with unqualified Indian doctors performing cardiothoracic surgeries in Sri Lanka. There was an inquiry and we developed this guideline to approve any application to practice in the country. But this was not published during my time. So I was not able to give them any details," Dr. Herath said.
He has also been told that Dr. Anurudda Padenniya will also be summoned for questioning this week.
