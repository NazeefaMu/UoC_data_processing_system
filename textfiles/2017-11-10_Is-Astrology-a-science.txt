Is Astrology a science?


	

 “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Shakespeare’s Hamlet Act 1 Scene 5


Punning on the bard’s words, one may say that there are more things in heaven and earth than are acknowledged by modern science. 


Scientific theories to justifying calling Astrology a science 

Those who believe in Astrology very often draw upon new discoveries and developments in modern science in support of the validity of Astrology as a science. Some learned persons have banked on the Theory of Relativity and the Quantum Theory to establish that Astrology is scientific and therefore is a science. Some years ago Indian scientist Prof. Raj Kumar drew inspiration from the Neuron Principle to prove that Astrology is truly a science.


What is Astrology?


Astrology is generally described as the study of the correlation between the positions and movements of cosmic bodies – planets in particular on life and environment on earth. However, many eminent astrologers in India have, while acknowledging that man and all physical processes on earth are influenced by the physical forces of Nature, taken up the position that Astrology is a body of knowledge built up on the Law of Karma or Kamma. 


Science and Law of Karma


But does science take cognizance of the Law of Karma or is it possible to prove scientifically that there is a thing called Karma?


If we are to confer the status of a science on Astrology, we have to explain scientifically how Law of Karma operates. Is there a mechanism by which the accumulated result of our thoughts and deeds gets stored for it to manifest in our present birth or in future births? 


In fact, Astrology is a body of knowledge our ancient sages built up both through insights gained by meditation as well as years of study done by observation and experimentation of the patterns of the effects cosmic bodies made on man and his environment.  


In the course of their study they discerned a definite relationship between the pattern of Karmic potential of an individual and the celestial map – the configuration of planets – at the particular moment of time and place of his birth. The data, they thus unraveled was codified using a symbolic language. 


Is Astrology fatalism?


If the results of people are Karma so pre-determined, does it mean that he has no control over what happens to him? Is he an utterly helpless of victim of an agenda pre-determined? 


Ancient Indian sages have not propounded such a fatalistic viewpoint. Though subjected to the results of his own actions, man still enjoys power of a free will. He can modify or steer clear of the effects of his previous actions by the proper exercise of his free will.
