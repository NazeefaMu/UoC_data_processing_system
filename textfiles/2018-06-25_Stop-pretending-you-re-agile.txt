Rohan Perera, Director Engineering at WSO2, SubukiShihabdeen, Head of Architecture at Pearson and Rajeev Jayawardena, Director Delivery at Sysco LABS will be speaking at the latest edition of the Engineering Nexus, on the 4th of July at the Sysco LABS Engineering Center. The event will feature speeches and a panel discussion by these tech leaders on a hot button issue: why is it that despite all their best efforts, companies fail to be agile. 

This will be the second Engineering Nexus, an initiative designed to advance the tech industry in Sri Lanka by bringing together leading experts from diverse disciplines to share their insights on tackling a single issue. The first meetup covered the issue of Engineering Productivity from the perspectives of Quality Engineering, DevOps and Architecture. This nexus will delve deeper into why companies struggle to become agile despite adopting agile practices from an architectural, process and delivery standpoint. 

This is a free event open to the public register at bit.ly/engnex4july
