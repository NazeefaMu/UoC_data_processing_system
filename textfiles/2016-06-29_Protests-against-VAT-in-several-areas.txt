The Collective of Trade Associations from several areas including Kiribathgoda, Kelaniya, Katugastota and Badulla staged protests against the increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) this morning.

Most of the shops in these areas were closed for hours.

Protesters at Kiribathgoda blocked the Kandy-Colombo Road for several hours and burnt a coffin in the middle of the town. A signature campaign was also launched by the protestors in Badulla against VAT. (Lal S. Kumara and Palitha Ariyawansa)
