	Former President Mahinda Rajapakse today said a government should be headed by one leader not by two leaders. Two leaders trying to administer one government was similar to using an ox and a buffalo to plough one field, he said.
	“This will never work out. There was a similar incident during the state ploughing ceremony in Polonnaruwa recently,” the former President said.
	Commenting on the affairs of the current government, Mr. Rajapakse said President Maithripala Sirisena should control the government completely or hand it over to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and join the opposition.
