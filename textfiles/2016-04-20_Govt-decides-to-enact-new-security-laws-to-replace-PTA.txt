The Government has decided to enact three new laws relating to national security and law and order, Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake had informed the UN Counter Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED).

Minister of Law and Order said yesterday these new laws would be the ones that will replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) which is in existence as of now.

Minister Ratnayake had informed this to CTED Executive Director Jean Paul Laborde when he met him in New York last morning.

Minister Ratnayake said the government has decided to enact three new laws relating to the national and public security and law and order, to comprehensively and efficiently respond to the contemporary manifestations and threats of extremism and terrorism, other attacks on national security including organised crime and to address the issues of public order and maintenance of essential services.

Minister Ratnayake met the CTED Executive Director as part of a continuing dialogue between the government of Sri Lanka and CTED. This was following a country visit by the Directorate to Sri Lanka earlier this month.

The Ministry said discussions centered around the revision of anti-terrorism legislation including technical assistance to draft comprehensive counter-terrorism legislation to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act, in accordance with United Nations Human Rights Council Resolutions and in keeping with international best practices.

The Minister also reiterated the importance of updating the 2014 CTED interim report on Sri Lanka to reflect ground realities, incorporating the positive changes made since January 2015.

In welcoming Minister Ratnayake, Mr. Laborde had reiterated that Sri Lanka and CTED have had a long tradition of cooperation, and that his Directorate fully supported Sri Lanka’s renewed efforts to restore democracy and the Rule of Law. He said his team had concluded a fruitful visit to Sri Lanka, and appreciated the support and hospitality afforded by the Sri Lankan authorities, and the open and constructive nature of the discussions held during the visit.
