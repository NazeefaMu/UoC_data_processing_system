Ex-chief JMO's revision application: HC notices respondents


	

Colombo High Court Judge Pathmini N Ranawaka today noticed the respondents, cited by former chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara in his revision application, to appear in court on October 27.

He filed a revision application in the High Court after his anticipatory bail application filed in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court in connection with the investigation into Wasim Thajudeen’s missing body parts, was rejected.

Mr. Samarasekaera cited the Attorney General and the OIC of the CID’s Homicide Division as respondents.

His anticipatory bail application was rejected by Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe.

When the application was taken up for consideration, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake objected to the granting of bail on the grounds that witness statements alleged that a few days before Mr. Samarasekara’s retirement, he had dispatched Thajudeen’s body parts.

The DSG informed Court that the CID was investigating the disappearance of the body parts under the Public Property Act on the basis that the body parts had been taken into the former JMO's custody and therefore they belonged to the State.

An anticipatory bail application can be filed by an individual seeking bail in anticipation of being named or arrested in connection with a nonbailable offence.

Mr. Samarasekara had also filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the imminent infringement of his fundamental rights in connection with the investigation into Wasim Thajudeen’s killing. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
