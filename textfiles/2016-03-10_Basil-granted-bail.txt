Following the indictments served by the Attorney General against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Divi Neguma Department Director General R.R.K. Ranawaka over the alleged misuse of Divi Neguma Department funds, the Colombo High Court today granted bail on them under strict bail conditions.

They were ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs 500,000 each with two surety bails of Rs.5 million.

Colombo High Court Judge Padmini N. Ranawaka also issued an order to impound their passports and also ordered them to report to the Cinnamon Gardens Police once a week.

Court also cautioned that if any of the witnesses were threatened by them or any violation of bail conditions imposed by the court was reported, the Court may cancel the bail and place them under remand custody.

Court also summoned the first and second witnesses to appear during the next hearing.

Acceding to Counsel Anil Silva's request, the Judge allowed to submit a preliminary objection in relation to the case on the next date.

They were charged by the prosecution for using Rs.29 million of the Divi Neguma Department, without the permission from the Central Bank, to distribute five million Almanacs using former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa’s picture, during the previous presidential election campaign.

The case was put off for July 22, 2016. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
