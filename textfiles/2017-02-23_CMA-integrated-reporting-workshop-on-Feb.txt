The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA)-organised ‘Integrated Reporting - Practical Aspects’ workshop will be held on Tuesday, February 28, 2017, at Taj Samudra, Colombo, from 1:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
This workshop will enable companies preparing integrated reports (IR) to achieve excellence, improve their reports and enter the CMA Excellence in IR Awards, which will be held in July this year at the inauguration of the Annual Conference. The Ten Best IR will receive awards together with the overall winner and runner-up. A special award will also be made for the most concise report.  
IR is enhancing the way organisations think, plan and report the value creation story of their business and will be based on the IIRC Reporting Framework.
Organisations are using IR to communicate a clear, concise, integrated story that explains how all of their resources are creating value. IR is helping businesses to think holistically about their strategy and plans, make informed decisions and manage key risks to build investor and stakeholder confidence and improve future performance. It is shaped by a diverse coalition including business leaders and investors to drive a global evolution in corporate reporting.
IR applies principles and concepts that are focused on bringing greater cohesion and efficiency to the reporting process and adopting ‘Integrated Thinking’ as a way of breaking down internal silos and reducing duplication. It improves the quality of information available to providers of financial capital to enable a more efficient and productive allocation of capital. Its focus on value creation and the ‘capitals’ used by the business to create value over time, contributes towards a more financially stable 
global economy.
The purpose of the IR framework is to establish guiding principles and content elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report and to explain the fundamental concepts that underpin them.
