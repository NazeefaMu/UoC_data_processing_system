The construction of the Rajagiriya flyover is scheduled to begin in July this year as an interim traffic solution in the Megapolis plan, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva announced today.

The flyover is expected to reduce the current travel duration to half from Nelum Pokuna to Battaramulla.

In a Facebook post Dr. Silva said the work is scheduled to begin in July and end in January 2018.

“The project is financed via a soft loan from the Spanish Government and the project which I have been fighting for a long time and I am very happy that finally we are going to see the construction will get underway,” he said.
