After the decision taken by the National Transport Commission yesterday the ticket fares of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) will be reduced by two per cent from midnight today.

Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman Ramal Siriwardane said the NTC’s decision to reduce the bus fare rates would also apply to the SLTB fares.

There would be no change with the minimum fare which is Rs.12, he said.

Yesterday, the NTC had taken the decision to reduce the bus fare by two per cent after a discussion held with several private bus associations.

The NTC had taken the decision to respect Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa over his decision to cut down the price of auto diesel by Rs.7 with effect from November 1, Mr Siriwardane said.

Therefore, the SLTB had also decided to grant the benefit of the fuel concession to the people by reducing the fare, he said.

The Interim bus fare revision issued by the NTC, the fare stages Rs.12 which was the minimum stage, Rs.15, Rs.20, Rs.34 and Rs.41 would not change, Mr Siriwardane said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
