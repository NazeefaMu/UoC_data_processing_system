Parliament session was suspended till noon following a tense situation arose over the attempts to amend the Local Government Election (Amendment) Bill.

The MPs of the Joint Opposition objected to Government’s attempt to amend the Bill saying it cannot be amended at the Committee stage level.

Following heated arguments between the two factions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said the session should be suspended to seek the Attorney General’s opinion over the matter. (YP & AJ)
