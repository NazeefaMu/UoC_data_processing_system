Holidaying at public expense!


	



 

This white collar high-up heading a key State establishment has a daughter domiciled abroad. She and her family members   were here on a holiday  recently and the indulgent father  generously used the resources of the State-owned body he helms to provide all facilities necessary for them to enjoy their holiday here, they say.

 


The white collar bigwig placed a Merc and a van belonging to the establishment at the disposal of the holiday makers to go places in comfort. He also had made it a point to fix new tires to the Merc at a cost of Rs.195, 000 before releasing it for the use of the privileged holiday-makers. 


What is more interesting is that the bigwig had purchased the tires from a private supplier at this exorbitant price, when he could have obtained them from the Supplies Division of the same establishment at a cost of Rs.95, 000!
