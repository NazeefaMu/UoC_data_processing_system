Eight patients confirmed to be infected with the H1N1 virus are undergoing treatment at the Bibila Hospital in isolation, Hospital Director Dr. Y.M. Sunil Senarath said today.

He said 28 to 30 patients, suspected to be infected with the virus are also receiving treatment at the hospital.

“These patients are being treated in isolation. The Medical Research Institute (MRI) confirmed the eight patients were positive for H1N1,” the Director told the Daily Mirror.

He requested the public be cautious of symptoms of fever, cough, headache, sore throat and body pain as well as diarrhea and vomiting that have been there for more than three to four days.

Pregnant women, children below the age of two, elderly above the age 65 and patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and those who receive long term treatment for diseases such as cancer and HIV are vulnerable to the disease, Senarath said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
