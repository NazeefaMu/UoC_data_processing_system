Steering by stars


	

There is a lady occupying a high office in a certain province thanks to the fortuitous circumstance of being a reputed astrologer which appears to have taken precedence over any other credentials.




The lady has become more a soothsayer than an astrologer and she has to cope with an unusual rush of leading politicos seeking to consult her about their future prospects these days.  Leading politicos either over the phone or in person would seek answers to questions such as “May I get a place in the top team?” “Will the no confidence succeed?” and “Will the government fall?”, they say. 


Many politicos from both sides of the great divide reportedly put much store by her predictions.
