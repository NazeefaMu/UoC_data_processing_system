Cargills Bank recently announced its tie-up with MyDeal.lk, one of Sri Lanka’s leading e-commerce website, to guarantee greater convenience to its growing customer base of online shoppers.


The partnership will enable Mydeal.lk customers to make payments for their purchases at any Cargills Food City outlets 365 days of the year, from 8:00a.m. to 10:00p.m.


The simplified process now allows customers to click on the ‘Pay at Cargills Food City’ payment option on Mydeal.lk website, once they check out their purchases. A simple click of a button generates a reference number which the customer can provide at their preferred Cargills Food City outlet, to process the payment through their Cargills Cash facility. The automated system will then ensure that the customer’s purchases are delivered to their doorstep, once the payment is made. This latest partnership with Cargills Bank offers customers the ease of making purchases using their Cargills Cash account at any of the 330 plus Cargills Food City outlets.


Commenting on their latest tie-up, Cargills Bank Retail Head Buddhika Pererasaidthe goal of such partnerships was to create financial inclusion for all Sri Lankans, a value underscored by the bank. “In addition to convenience, this partnership also encourages one of our key focal areas of financial inclusion for all Sri Lankans,” he said.
“We offer customers the convenience of purchasing goods without the hassle of making separate visits to the bank, but with a simple visit to their relied supermarket chain. Not only have we provided our customers the convenience of depositing and withdrawing cash at any Cargills Food City outlet through Cargills Cash Savings Account, but through the extension of this service with Mydeal.lk customers have more convenience in paying their merchants at  Cargills Food City outlets that operate from 8:00a.m. to 10:00p.m. throughout the year. The collaboration with Mydeal.lk will undoubtedly benefit many Sri Lankans across the country,” he noted
