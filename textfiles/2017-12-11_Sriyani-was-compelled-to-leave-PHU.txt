The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) referring to the cross over of JO MP Sriyani Wijewickrama to the group led by President Maithripala Sirisena, said she did not do so voluntarily, but was driven to do so.

It said Ms. Wijewickrama had no issue with the joint opposition on matters of principle until the committees handling the nominations were convened.

“She is the JO's only female MP, who spoke at the very first JO rally held at Nugegoda soon after the 2015 election. She is a great asset to the JO. Journalists ask why she left. Actually, she was compelled to leave,” PHU leader MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference.

He said she had attended the Ampara nomination committee meeting on more than six days but some leaders failed to attend these committee meetings though repeatedly requested.

“The last meeting was held on Saturday where she told party leaders that she can’t go to the village without solving these issues. However, I’m not saying Ms. Wijewickrama’s demands are reasonable and should be granted. She should have been given an opportunity to talk about these demands, but didn’t get the opportunity,” Mr. Gammanpila said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
