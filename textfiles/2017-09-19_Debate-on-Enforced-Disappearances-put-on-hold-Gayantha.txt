The government has decided not to take up the debate on the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances on September 21, Parliamentary Affairs and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said on Monday.

He also said this decision was taken during the UNP Parliamentary group meeting which met Monday evening with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the chair. It has also been decided not to take up the debate on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution as well.
Meanwhile, it was reported that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had told the UNP Parliamentary group to get ready for elections as there won’t be a postponement of any poll including the provincial council elections.
The term of the Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern provinces will end in October this year and the polls will have to be held in December this year.
The Business committee in Parliament is to meet today to decide on what has to be taken up in Parliament instead of the 20th Amendment. However an Amendment to the Provincial Council Act is to be presented to the House on Tuesday (19).(Yohan Perera)
