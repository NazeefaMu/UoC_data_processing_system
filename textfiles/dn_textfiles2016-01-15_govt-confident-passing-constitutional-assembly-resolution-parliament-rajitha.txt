Govt. confident of passing Constitutional Assembly resolution in Parliament - Rajitha

The government is confident that the resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly would pass in Parliament on January 26, said Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne. He made this observation at yesterday's Cabinet briefing at the Information Department auditorium.
He said that the government has decided to consider the suggestions made by the joint opposition as well as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
He added that this motion was not formulated for a Constitution but to convert the entire government into an assembly to draft a Constitution.
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Army Spokesman Brigadier Jayantha Jayaweera also spoke at the occasion.
