Sacred Tree Of Life

A branch of the sacred Bodhi tree was brought to Anuradhapura from Bodhgaya in India over 2,000 years ago. I caught a leaf and learnt about the incredible importance of Anuradhapura as a pilgrims site.
Sri Lanka’s first capital city Anuradhapura is where the sacred tree Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya is found. Over 2200 years ago Sanghamitra Thera brought a branch of the sacred Bodhi tree (under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment) to Anuradhapura from Bodhgaya in India. The tree was planted by the then reigning monarch, King Devanampiyatissa and is the oldest recorded tree in the world. To explore this magnificent ancient city, get a guide and better still book a bike tour so you can really go off the beaten track.
Nature’s inspiration
Cannonball flower given as puja
My guide J P Ravinia Jayalat aka ‘Tharanga’ explained entering the holy of holies, that if you fold a Bo leaf you will see how nature inspired the architectural design of the areas magnificent temple stupors. I also learn the meaning behind the colours of the Buddhist flag from Tharanga organized through Ulagalla resort. “Each colour has a meaning: Blue- confidence, Yellow – holiness, Red- wisdom, White – purity and Orange – desire.”
If you have time talk to the fascinating priests based at the most sacred site on the island, they will explain why. “All Sri Lankan Buddhists believe in the Sri Maha Bodhi. The tree has many special qualities like the way that only one leaf falls at a time from the south branch, but from the other branches three leaves fall simultaneously.”
The temple guardians
Walking around clock wise I learn how the city founded in 337BC was made the capital of the country by King Paundukabhaya, who started the far sighted irrigation works and tanks that have made the area so inhabitable and are still great places to cool off. At one time, the city was ranked alongside Nineveh and Babylon for its colossal proportions, with avenues that artists occupied and areas where foreign merchants had their houses. Most impressive is the enormous Lovamahapaya, situated on the processional way that leads to the tree, an extraordinary ruin with countless rows of tightly packed granite columns, originally seven storeys high and housing more than 3,000 monks.
Sri Maha Bodhi
If you want to see the Sri Maha Bodhi among the other 44 amazing sites remember the temple is only open from 6am and closing between 12-2pm and reopening when it gets cooler from 2pm-9pm. If you arrive during lunch hour do go and see one of the many impressive museums starting with the Anuradhapura Archaeological Museum (open 8.30am-5.30pm except for Tuesdays and public holidays) between the Brazen Palace and the Ruwanweli Seya. Then there is the Folk Museum next door detailing the culture of the north-western province, the small museum at the Isurumuni Raja Maha Viharaya where you can see the beautiful 4th-6th century Isurumuni Lovers carved in stone, the Abhayagiri monastery museum and the museum in the treasure room of the Jetavanarama Monastery.
Every night at 9pm, this benevolent man awaits the moment, when the great doors to the temple are closed and the last pilgrims are ushered out, diya (oil lamps) glow from stands and the smell of incense lingers in the air. With the other seven resident monks he conducts private worship in front of the tree. Biking back along the old ox cart tracts with stars twinkling over head, including the constellation Anuradha which the city is named after, it is clear as the star filled sky Rawaela feels privileged to live in the grounds of Sri Lanka’s most sacred ancient city.
Bike Tour
The three hour amazing guided bicycle tour I took can be done in the morning or evening when the temple stones underfoot are not so hot and the light is better for photography. By bike you can cut through the old paths and ox cart lanes.
Temple offerings
If you fancy a cycling tour then Ulagalla is an outstanding resort to organize this and make your base, as this is also how you get around this wonderful nature resort. This is a place that celebrates all things natural and throws in special things like picnic surprises in the ruins. Also water just when you need it and as if by magic appear with a bottle.
If you are doing it on foot and staying near the ruins, do try out the night market with a magical range of foodie stalls in the high street selling tasty fish balls, fried lake fish, spicy samosas and rotti. Little carts also appear around town and by the lake early evening with delicious sweet delicacies and during Poson festival the place turns into a carnival like city. With 25,000 pilgrims visiting the city during this period finding a room is practically impossible, so book ahead or bring a tent and join one of the most spiritual and special events of the year, when everyone gives gifts of food and the country shuts down for several days to celebrate this deeply spiritual period.
