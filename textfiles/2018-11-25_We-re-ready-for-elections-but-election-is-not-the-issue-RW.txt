Indicating that his party could support a motion in the House to ask President to dissolve Parliament and go for an election, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said over the weakened that Parliament could decide on having an election, the type of election and the time it should be held.

“Parties in Parliament will decide on the election. They will decide on the date of the election as well,” he said.

“They can also decide whether to hold the Presidential Election first or the General Election.

“Parliament can decide on the elections with a two thirds majority. However, the main issue is not an election, but to safeguard the rights of the people,” Mr Wickremesinghe said at a public rally in Kandy on Saturday.

“Election is not the main issue. The main issue is to safeguard people’s rights; to ensure that the Constitution of the country is followed.

“If a group does not have a majority they should resign. They cannot hold on to office like leaches. If they did not resign even after November, 29 when the next vote is taken in Parliament, we will have to take to the streets,” he added.(Yohan Perera and J A L Jayasinghe)
