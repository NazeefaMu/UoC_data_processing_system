One of the two rail tracks between Wellawatte and Mount Lavinia will be closed for four days from Friday 8.00 p.m. to Tuesday 4.30 p.m., Railway Operations Superintendent Wijaya Samarasinghe said.

He said it was being done to carry out repairs to the existing bridge and to facilitate the construction of a new bridge between Wellawatte and Mount Lavinia.

“There will be no change in the scheduled train times on the coastal line though there may be a slight delay because of the trains having to travel on a single track during this period,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
