The former strongman the other day attended a wedding held at a hotel located close to Diyawanna and there he met three colleagues -two top team members – one looking after the country’s purse and the other our ports and the political chief for the Western Province.

 


They all shared the same table and were having a friendly chat. 


“Rice prices have gone sky high. What do you say?” the former strongman asked.  


“Yes, Sir. Eatery owners say that they have to increase the price of a meal packet at least by Rs. 10,” the provincial chief readily agreed. 


“How do you account for this sudden sharp rise in rice prices?” the former strongman asked again.
“Traders have sent stocks underground, they say, Sir!” the provincial chief replied.


“If the traders have sent stocks underground, it’s your job to unearth them. Bring out hoarded stocks!” the former strongman urged the provincial chief.


The provincial chief smiled and made no reply. 


“Ok. I’ll tell you how you can get the hidden stocks disgorged. You ask ahawala (that person) … He will tell you…”


However, the former strongman did not name the ahawala, they say.
