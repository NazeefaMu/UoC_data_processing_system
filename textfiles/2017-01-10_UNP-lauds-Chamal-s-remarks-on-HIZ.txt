The views expressed by former Speaker and joint opposition MP Chamal Rajapaksa are always welcome, United National Party (UNP) MP Mujibur Rahaman said today adding that the UNP held views similar to those expressed by Mr. Rajapaksa.

“The former Speaker welcomed the setting up of the Hambantota Industrial Zone (HIZ) as a good move and urged the government to refrain from acquiring cultivated lands those belonging to temples for this purpose,” he said. “The government had been transparent in dealing with the Hambantota matter unlike the previous government and the agreements signed with the investors will be tabled in Parliament.”

Mr. Rahaman asked why the joint opposition MPs were silent and remained paralysed when lands in Colombo were taken over by the previous regime.

“We wonder where MPs Udaya Gammanpilla and Dallas Alahaperuma were when former defense secretary took over several lands in Colombo,” he asked and underscored the fact that some of the people whose lands were taken over by the previous regime were yet to receive compensation.(Yohan Perera)
