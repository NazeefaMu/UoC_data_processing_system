CIA chief says he warned Irans Soleimani over Iraq aggression
	

SIMI VALLEY REUTERS Dec 2 - U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he sent a letter to Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani and Iranian leaders expressing concern regarding Irans increasingly threatening behaviour in Iraq. Speaking during a panel at the annual Reagan National Defence Forum in Southern California, Pompeo said he sent the letter after the senior Iranian military commander had indicated that forces under his control might attack U.S. forces in Iraq. He did not specify the date. 
Iranian media earlier quoted Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani, a senior aide to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as saying an unnamed CIA contact had tried to give a letter to Soleimani when he was in the Syrian town of Albu Kamal in November during the fighting against Islamic State. 
I will not take your letter nor read it and I have nothing to say to these people, Golpayegani quoted Soleimani as saying, according to the semi-official news agency Fars.

Fed officials fret over yield curve; warn on pace of hikes
	
REUTERS: Two Federal Reserve policymakers urged caution in raising interest rates, saying that the flattening of the yield curve was a signal that the central bank should proceed slowly.
The Fed is likely to raise interest rates when it meets in December and the current economic projections of rate setters indicate that it will hike three times in 2018.
New projections will come from Fed officials at their December 12-13 meeting, which could indicate whether concerns over the yield curve and a related debate over weak inflation have started to shake confidence in the 2018 projections.
The shallow slope of the yield curve - the spread between 2- and 10-year notes is currently 58 basis points, near the flattest in a decade - and whether it could invert, a signal of a possible economic recession, have triggered doubts in financial markets over the Feds rate rise plans.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard warned on Friday of a key bearish signal emerging for the economy if the Fed continues raising interest rates as fast as policymakers currently intend and called on his colleagues to move more cautiously in the drive to more normal monetary policy.
If investors believe the Feds actions will cause the economy to slow and yields to fall, they may buy more longer-dated paper to lock in current yields, rather than take the risk of continually rolling over shorter-dated debt where the yields they earn are declining.
Higher demand for the longer-dated paper pushes prices up and yields, which move in the opposite direction, down, causing the curve to flatten.
A flattening curve can have a pernicious effect by making it less profitable for banks, which typically borrow short and lend long, to make loans.
Modern-day recessions in the United States have always been preceded by an inversion in the yield curve, but not every inversion has been followed by a recession, though it does generally signal economic risk.
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan also voiced his concerns over the flattening curve, saying that it showed any removal of monetary accommodation is going to have to be done patiently and gradually.
Bullard said that as it stands, within a year, short-term interest rates, pushed higher by Fed action, may move above long-term interest rates - an inversion of the yield curve.
Caution around the curves
It is unlikely that long-term rates will move higher on their own to keep pace with the Feds moves on short-term rates, he said, which he felt should make the Fed slow down. The Fed has little influence over longer-term rates.
The simplest way to avoid yield curve inversion in the near term is for policymakers to be cautious in raising the policy rate, Bullard said in a presentation to the Arkansas Economic Development Institute.
There is a material risk...if the (Federal Open Market Committee) continues on its present course, Bullard said. Inversion is a naturally bearish signal...This deserves market and policymaker attention.
Weak inflation has led to division among policymakers over whether they should slow the pace of rate hikes until it is clear that prices are going to recover.
Expected inflation is a key component of long-term bond prices since investors would want securities to hold value on an inflation-adjusted or real basis over time. That inflation weakness is another reason the yield curve may flip from its normal slope, which compensates investors for the risk of holding longer-term securities with higher interest rates.
The yield curve is not infallible as a predictor of the economy, Bullard said, and some researchers have argued that it is losing its usefulness as an economic signal given the global decline in interest rates.
But Bullard said policymakers and investors need to take the possibility of a yield curve inversion seriously.

Govt. ignored int'l storm warnings: JO
	
Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane today asked in parliament why the government had ignored the international warning about the recent tropical storm issued three days ahead of the impending disaster.
He said the government agencies had only issued an advisory to the fishing community.
"This has not only dealt a severe blow to the people and the economy but had also tarnished the country's reputation among the tourist industry and the industrial and commercial sectors," the MP said.
He said the tropical storm had resulted in 14 people killed and several houses and power lines damaged or destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people displaced or homeless.
The MP said the government had not carried out its duty properly in this crisis situation and asked why the people were left in the dark about the impending disaster.
He asked what action the government would take to face future storms.
House Leader and Minister, Lakshman Kiriella said international agencies had not warned of stormy weather between of November 28 and 30 and had predicted that the atmospheric disturbance would result in a storm which was some 400 miles away from Sri Lanka towards West.
He said Meteorology Department had issued weather warnings to naval and fishing communities at the proper time which had prevented a huge disaster.
"We would have had to face a huge disaster if the fishing community was not informed about the strong winds and rough seas," the minister said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: Hamnet, Prince from nowhere

Hamnet, Prince from nowhere
	
A beautiful modification of a Shakespearean story without ghosts but with incarnation

The author of Hamnet, Gwen Herat needs no introduction to the general English reader. Apart from publishing a number of books like The Splendour of Trees, from a Distance and a Biography of Pope Francis. Her series of articles in the newspapers on Shakespeare proved beyond doubt that she was an authority on the Bard.

Hamnet is her latest publication which takes the reader back to Hamlet, one of the greatest tragedies of Shakespeare. In fact, the author has built on Hamlet and in a way is an extension to the
great classic.
While both Hamlet and Hamnet find common ground at Elsinore Palace there are some characters common to both like Hamlet, Ophelia, Queen Gertrude, and Laertes.
Hamlet although is the story of Hamlet and Ophelia it is also a story of court intrigue, jealousy, and hatred.
But Hamnet being a love story, the author has shaved off the frills of the original story and weaves one of her own, delivered in beautiful prose and verse. While the section she identifies as Transition is in prose the section that follows as Incarnation is in verse. In the court of Elsinore in Denmark king Hamlet, who had reigned for a decade had been yearning for an heir. Both Elsinore and the queen were frustrated which strained their relationship.
So, when they found that the Queen was with a child they were elated and when she gave birth to twins Hamlet and Hamnet, the entire kingdom was elated.

"Incarnation is new dimension introduced by Herat in modifying Shakespearean story"
Two lovely boys from GodFrom childhood, the twins were identical but different in character and attitudes. Hamlet was the superior leading the way to Hamnet, who was a loner but joined his brother in hunting sprees. While Hamlet had no time to read, Hamnet was buried in books.Then in between two of them appears Ophelia. She was Hamlets love.
But Hamnet found himself getting drawn towards her as he observed the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia getting unstable.
When Hamnet was killed by a bear Ophelia opened her heart out and confessed, It was him I loved and not Hamlet. And not long after she followed Hamnet Clinging to Hamnet.
Ophelia breathed her last, yielding her body and soul to deaths last call in a soliloquy:-
In this vicious world when mortals are still asleep and the waning moon flits across the smoky heavens, fate threw open the corridors to life unknown beyond the gloomy stars and floating clouds when my Hamnet, lost his sacred life for reasons unknown. My ripped heart aches for his love declared too, reasons in the wilderness. It was him I loved and not Hamlet, the secret I kept locked in my heart as we held back our forbidden passion for each other.

"From Hamnet, the authors creativity and imagination flow like a river. To read Hamnet was a novel experience."

We were the Elsinore dream but fate had her reasons unknown to us and shortened our lives before the early buds opened in their glory to paint the flowers in myriad hues and sap the nectar of youth from us. To live or not to live. With that ends the prose and from there verse takes over which author subtitles as Incarnation. The incarnation of Ophelia and Hamnet, two of them who remained chaste and pure to the end have now joined and roam about as spirits.
Herat puts it beautifully:
We are adrift buoyed by strong bonds, And a love deeper than the sea,
Will it define our lives forever,
As memories come crashing our way,
Thy endless wisdom keeps me warm,
And sparks the flame and ignites the day,
On falling snow of winter white (Page 72)
How peaceful is death, my precious Prince
How gentle is its feel,
I see thee lying as in gentle slumber,
As fragrant as the morns crystal dew,
The lips are soft as the blushing rose, The smile still softly playing on them,
The eyes are closed in blissful sleep (Page 97)
Incarnation is a new dimension introduced in Hamnet by Herat in modifying a Shakespearean story. Some of Shakespeares stories ghosts do appear as in Macbeth and Julius Caesar. But not an incarnation.
From Hamnet, the authors creativity and imagination flow like a river. To read Hamnet was a novel experience.
The books front page illustration says it all. The awesome image in cover suggesting the mysteries around Elsinore palace is spectacular on impact at eye level leading the reader to Herats world of innovative creation and imagination in a hardcover, hand-bound publication.
Herat has dedicated her wondrous work, Hamnet, Prince From Nowhere to Dr. Devsritha Valence Mendis, the scholar Bishop of Chilaw.
Herat, Gwen; Prince From Nowhere. 1st edition 2017: Pp 155; LKR 500. (US$20). Author published.

Lak Jaya Micro Finance opens head office
	
Lak Jaya Micro Finance Limited officially opened its head office at No. 386B/1/1, High Level Road, Pannipitiya recently.
The opening ceremony was well-attended with participants from all leading microfinance institutions and some commercial banks.
Central Bank Microfinance Institutions Supervision Department Director Keerthi Wijetunga was the chief guest and the keynote address was delivered by former Samurdhi, Land and Trade Ministries Secretary Dr. R.M.K. Ratnayake.
The company Chairman Dirk Brouwer, members of the board of directors, senior management, long-serving employees and some long-time customers also attended the opening ceremony.
Lak Jaya Micro Finance Limited commenced operations on March 8, 2002 on the basis of group guarantee with the objective of providing credit facilities to the economically active poor, the entrepreneurial poor and vulnerable non-poor who cannot access credit from formal source of finance.
In 2006, it adopted the ASA methodology of microfinance, founded by Md. Shafiqual Haque Choudhury in Bangladesh. ASA methodology of microfinance is based on individual-liability loan system instead of group-liability loan system. The ASA methodology, originated in Bangladesh, has the reputation for its cost-effectiveness and scalability, standardization and transparency, which turns it into one of the most successful models of microfinance in the world.
Catalyst Microfinance Investors (CMI), a leading international investor in microfinance business in the world, invested US $ 1.6 million in Lak Jaya shares through a locally incorporated company called CMI Lanka Holding (Private) Limited. The injection of capital and the adoption of the ASA methodology marked a turning point in evolution of the company and the number of branches increased from six to 46 within little over one year.
Lak Jaya is a microfinance institution with a considerable exposure in the field of microfinance in Sri Lanka. It has come a long way in prospering to its present position. It has successfully outreached to 19 districts with 59 branches operative in remote areas as well as pockets of poverty in urban districts. The company has maintained its operations satisfactorily meeting the demands of the micro and small business sector supporting the female entrepreneurs of the country as evidenced in its steady growth of the loan portfolio and the clientele.
As at present, around 60,000 micro entrepreneurs benefit from the loan programmes of the company and the amount of loans outstanding is around Rs.1.2 billion. The average loan size of Rs.23,000 indicates that the poorer segments of the population are reached. The loans are provided on the basis of trust with simple documentation procedures.
While remaining as a leading microfinance institution in the country, it has maintained a loan recovery rate of around 98 percent throughout the recent years. Its strength lies in the effective supervision of loans that substitutes the requirement for collateral. Its loan operations are conducted through groups of borrowers at field level and these groups are called centres and in a centre there are about 20 borrowers who attend weekly centre meetings in their villages to carry out their financial operations.
Lak Jaya has played an important role in creating employment within the company and in the projects it has financed. Presently there are 444 employees in the company of which more than 50 percent are field officers. In addition to the provision of loans, the company is actively promoting financial literacy among its clients and assist them with the necessary advice in carrying out business effectively. Also, it has been active in providing assistance during the times of natural disasters and helping the affected clients to rehabilitate their projects.
Brouwer addressing the gathering highlighted the achievements of the company and the role played by Catalyst Microfinance Investors and ASA International, which is dedicated to promote the ASA methodology in supporting the microfinance sector in the world.
Brouwer emphasized that ASA is recognized as one of the lowest cost, most efficient MIFIs operational in 12 countries and we are very happy to having Lak Jaya as an important member of their family.
While addressing the gathering Wijetunga highlighted the significance of regulation and the types of regulation that would be effected under the Micro Finance Act introduced in 2016. In addition, he emphasized the significance of client protection, responsible finance, deposit insurance schemes and the role of the Credit Information Bureau for minimizing loan risks.
Delivering the keynote address, Dr. Ratnayake analysed the policy towards pro-poor development in Sri Lanka and concluded that the apparent inadequacy of policies of the state to address income inequality led the government to pursue the concept of pro-poor growth as an effective measure to reduce the inequality during the process of growth.
The extent to which growth is pro-poor depends on how much a chosen measure of poverty changes as the result of implementing of such policies. The process will lead to better distribution of resources and improving living standards of the poor. Pro-poor or inclusive growth strategies enable poor people to participate in and benefit from the growth process.
Therefore, he emphasized that adequate policies and programmes are required to reach the poor with capital, if poverty is to be reduced in a meaningful manner. Microcredit initiatives are some credible ways to deliver the most-needed capital to the doorstep of the poor in a speedy manner. In this initiative, the poor families may find credible ways to move out of poverty using their own skills in their own projects using borrowed capital. Thus, what they all needed is capital in the form of small loans, delivered to their doorstep.

Pentagon evaluating US West Coast missile defense sites
	

THE HINDU, 03rd NOVEMBER, 2017-The U.S. agency tasked with protecting the country from missile attacks is scouting the West Coast for places to deploy new anti-missile defenses, two Congressmen said on Saturday, as North Koreas missile tests raise concerns about how the United States would defend itself from an attack.
West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack.
The accelerated pace of North Koreas ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build-up missile defenses.
On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km, placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday.
Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off.

Now when you look at this audience, in a country where there have been impunity for crimes against journalists, where you expect a high attendance of all heads of media organizations, there are only two heads of organizations here. They are the people who should be fighting and saying there should be no impunity for crimes against journalists. They should be attacking us and saying we are not looking into the cases and have not prosecuted the offenders. Why arent they here today Why only politicians and civil society are here It is because some of them did not stand up or fight for the rights of journalists, Wickremesinghe said.
He further added that some heads of media organizations who didnt attend the event yesterday were more interested in keeping the Rajapaksa regime going and even today they would do anything to topple the current government with the purpose of bringing the Rajapaksa regime back, ensuring they make profits.
He claimed that Sri Lanka was a peculiar country where the government has ensured to end impunity for crimes against journalists, while the editors and owners of media organizations want the Rajapaksa regime back so that there will be impunity for crimes against journalists.
Meanwhile, the Premier said no one questioned him on what happened with the murder of the Former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunga.
This is the truth. We are making an effort to protect journalists. Do the heads of media organizations make such effort Previously they used to do business with the blessings of Rajapaksa regime. Now they attack me because we have ensured freedom of expression and democracy. It is apparent that they are fed up with democracy and they want their old business back on track, he said.
He vowed to end impunity for crimes against journalists and expedite investigations into the killings and disappearances of journalists.
Crime against the media is a crime against democracy. As a promise to the media, we will investigate and bring to justice those who have ended the lives of our journalists. I would like to send a very clear message that this government will protect journalists by all measures and I hope this commitment is sufficient to get the heads of media organizations and editors bring all together with us to carry on a fight for the rights of journalists, he said.
Recalling that many journalists were attacked, murdered, and harassed during the previous regime, he said after the establishment of the current government, there is no place for such crimes in todays democracy.
I am proud to say that we have achieved great global recognition for the steps we have taken in only two years. We will continue to strengthen the democracy in Sri Lanka and we will ensure the UN Plan of Actions on Safety smooth implementation," he added. (Piyumi Fonseka)

President shoots down tax concessions for beer
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today shot down the budgetary proposal to reduce the tax on beer, saying it was contrary to the policy of his government. However, he hailed the overall budget saying it was developmentoriented.
He said no one could agree with the granting of tax concessions to beer.
"No one can agree with the granting of tax concessions to any type of liquor because the policy of this government is to minimise the consumption of liquor and minimise the smoking habit," the President said at the committee stage debate on the budget.
He said foreign cigarettes could not be permitted into the country. No other country in the world allows it," the President said but however, lauded the budget proposals as a whole saying they are development-oriented. Enhancing and enriching spiritual values of the people is as important as as improving economic indicators such as the per capita income. Similarly maintaining the free health and free education system is important. The Buddha said this when he preached that health is the most valuable resource one could possess. Therefore it is important that we continue with the welfare facilities essentially for the poor."
He stressed the need to allow the ministers to work independently. "I have allowed the Health Minister to work independently as I think it is important. I recall how I suffered mentally during my tenure as the minister of health. I had to face several obstacles when I made an effort to introduce a national health policy," the President said.
He pledged to enhance the facilities provided to kidney patients as pledged during the presidential election. I pledged to use the funds allocated for my posters for a fund for kidney patients and that was done. It is now converted into a national fund for kidney patients. We will open the first kidney hospital in Pollonaruwa shortly. This has been constructed with a US$12 billion grant from the Chinese government," the President said.

Sehwag slams SL players for complaining about smog
	
Virender Sehwag has slammed Sri Lankan players for wearing masks and complaining about smog on the second day of the Delhi Test, calling it a pre-planned strategy, the DNA reported today.
He said that the it was meant to stop Virat Kohli from scoring a triple century.
While speaking to a TV channel after the day's play, Sehwag said, "It was all a strategy against Virat Kohli. They wanted to stop him as it seemed that he was inching towards his triple century."
"They could have requested the BCCI to host the match in some other city two days before the match if they felt uncomfortable. But it seems like it was all a plan to stop Kohli from reaching 300 runs," he added.
Sehwag said that the Sri Lankan players 'acted' really well. He explained, "When they came to bat, they didnt wear masks. Did the pollution level reduce all of a sudden then It was the same. Indian players batted in the same condition and they were all good."
Sehwag recalled how this is not the first time Sri Lankans have done something against the spirit of cricket. He said, "This is not the first time that Sri Lankans behave like this. In 2010, they bowled no-ball while was batting on 99 and we needed 1 run to win."
He added, "This is not sportsmanship conduct. Match referee should give his report to the ICC regarding the matter that went down."
Behind in the match and struggling in the conditions, several Sri Lankan players returned from the lunch break sporting facemasks as the seasonal haze affecting the region thickened over the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium.
The smog eventually held up play twice and 22 minutes was lost in total as Lahiru Gamage and his pace colleague Suranga Lakmal both left the field during the second session as they found it difficult to breathe.
Umpires Nigel Llong and Joel Wilson were discussing the air quality with the tourists when Kohli declared India's first innings.

SL family deported after govt. denies final plea to stay in Canada
	
A Sri Lankan family in Montreal, Canada boarded a plane Sunday evening and was deported back to their home country after Ottawa refused to give them a last-minute reprieve.
The Lawrence family arrived five years ago as refugee claimants and have since found either jobs or academic success.
But the family members refugee claims were not approved. Their flight back to Sri Lanka took off at 8:10 p.m., almost three hours behind schedule.
Several federal and provincial politicians as well as Amnesty International have called on the Canadian government to grant the family a reprieve.
Quebecs immigration minister also issued them selection certificates that could have paved the way to permanent residence if they were allowed to stay.
Their lawyer, Stphane Handfield, said Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale chose not to use his discretionary power to suspend the deportation order and wrote to the family to indicate he would not intervene in their case. Handfield said the family still fears persecution in their home country.(The Canadian press)

Three SL players vomited: Pothas on Delhi pollution
	
Sri Lanka's interim coach Nic Pothas has said their bowlers badly struggled to cope with the conditions and even threw up in the change room, seeking to validate their demand regarding the suspension of play due to air pollution, the Indian Express reported today.
In a first of its kind incident, international cricketers wore anti-pollution masks while fielding due to poor air quality in New Delhi.
With players complaining of uneasiness, there were multiple interruptions resulting in loss of 26 minutes of play, forcing India to declare their innings at 536 for seven.
Sri Lanka did come out to bat and scored 131 for three.
"Obviously, it is well-documented that Delhi has a high level of pollution. They had got extremely high at one point, we had players coming in at one point and vomiting, Pothas said at the end of days play.
Breathlessness and irritation in the lungs are the common phenomena in the pollution-hit cities but vomiting is something rarely associated with smog.
"The pace bowlers obviously were struggling, Suranga Lakmal and Lahiru Gamage in particular. The match referee (David Boon) was in our change room when Suranga was vomiting. Doctors were there as well."
"Dhananjaya de Silva was also vomiting. It was tough. You rely on doctors to give you medical advice because you are not medical person, Pothas said.
The coach said that it was a unique situation where players suffered in an abnormal manner.
"There were oxygen cylinders in the dressing room ( a common practice during every international sport). It is not normal for players to suffer in that way while playing the game. From our point of view, it had to be stated that it is a very, very unique case," Pothas said
"I thought all the officials, the Match Referee and umpires handled the situation very well. When it is a new situation for everybody, it is not easy to make decisions. I feel for the umpires and I feel for the Match Referee. But the job of me and the manager was to make sure that the players are safe. Thats all what we do, he added.
Pothas and Asanka Gurusinha (team manager) were seen taking turns to talk to on-field umpires.
Asked as to what transpired, he said, "We had only 10 people (on the field) at one stage as there were not enough people to get on the field. The umpires were very clear where they were coming from. I dont envy them. Their position was tough as well. There arent too many rules written on pollution."
But he did agree that when Angelo Mathews batted, the situation was easier.
"I havent spoken to him (Angelo) still whether it was hard or easy to bat. When our guys were struggling, the numbers were at 400 out of 500 on the pollution scale. At the end of the day, now they are around 300. I presume it was easier."
