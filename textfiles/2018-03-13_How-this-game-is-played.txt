Many politicos had deliberately kept away from the district in the hills when it was hit by communal riots, but most of them were seen later in a long queue to show their face to a very high authority when the latter visited the hill capital in a damage control bid, they say.

 


According to reports, only a handful of politicos from the district had taken the trouble to rush to the troubled areas to make an effort to bring the ugly situation under control.


A number of politicos representing the people in the district at both local and national levels had rushed to Kandy as soon as they had learnt about the high authority’s visit there. Only the ones who were busy in the volatile areas trying their best to defuse tensions and prevent further incidents had to give the high authority’s visit a miss, they say.
