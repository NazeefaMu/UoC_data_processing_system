There’s another in the same boat with her!


	

 <U+200B>This good-looking fair Diyawanna member recently met a friendly high-ranking diplomat at a chancery of a European country in the city to seek his advice and help to get over a big problem she faced.  
Explaining her problem to the diplomat, the fair one said: “I’ve managed to make it to Diyawanna for the first time and the nearest rival whom I beat in the race is exploiting this issue in a bid to grab my seat in the House. I know nothing about your country’s law…Please help me to sort out this problem.”
The diplomat who gave the fair one a patient hearing said: “You say that you have no understanding of our law. I must say that I don’t understand how the law in your country operates either!”
“I don’t understand what you mean. Why don’t you be more explicit?” the fair Diyawanna member asked.  
The diplomat said: “There is another member in your council holding the citizenship of our country, but it has not adversely affected his status as a member of your council. What I don’t understand is why the law that does not apply to him should apply to you!” 
The good-looking one looked amazed and her amazement soon gave way to sheer joy. “Gee, what a break!” she exclaimed. “Who is he? Please tell me…”
“It is left to you to find out who the person is,” the diplomat replied.
No amount of coaxing and sweet talk could get the name out of the diplomat, they say.
