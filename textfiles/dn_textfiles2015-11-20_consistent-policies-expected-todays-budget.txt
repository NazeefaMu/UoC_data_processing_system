Consistent policies expected from today's Budget

Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake will present the 2016 budget today
in Parliament. This is the first budget to be presented by the coalition government.
It is expected that the budget will a be capital oriented one aiming at higher revenue than recurrent expenditure. The Minister said that the capital expenditure will be significantly increased in the coming budget.
The Minister also hinted that the budget is aiming to raise taxes in areas which have not been looked at before without placing a greater burden on the public. "It will create revenue, the revenue will be greater than the recurrent
expenditure of the year 2016. But the revenue plan won't have a cost impact
on the people," Minister Karunanayake said when a group of Sri Lankan based foreign correspondents met him in his ministry Wednesday evening.
Meanwhile the automobile industry that went though several ups and downs
due to policy changes is looking at a long term policy.
Tax consultants and the Mobile operators too are expecting a similar long term policy to be in place.
"We hope the budget for the fiscal year 2016 to be read by the Minister of Finance to be a one that will focus on framing long-term policies for the development of the country.
Ideally it has to lay the foundation of a concrete plan that will spell out a clear pathway for the business community to boost confidence among all,"a leading banker said.
"We Sri Lankans are tired of changes in policy every time a new government comes in to power or even at change of officials.
This has to stop and we are hopeful that there will be transparency in fixing policy looking at the interest of the country as a whole and not to favour a selected group of people," said
Gihan Pilapitiya, Chairman Ceylon Motor Traders' Association Chairman.
The expectation of the Motor Industry is that the government will adopt a long term strategy and maintain a three to five year constant policy towards the industry rather than changing policies in an adhoc manner. It is only then the industry can invest on infrastructure and create employment added, Chaminda Perera, Chief Executive Officer, Ideal Motors(Pvt) Ltd.
