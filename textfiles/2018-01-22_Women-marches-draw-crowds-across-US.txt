US, (Daily Mail), 21 January 2018 -   On the first anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, people across the country took to the streets carrying clever and hilarious signs at the 2018 Women’s Marches.   


The banners broadcast the participants’ motivation for showing up, in some 250 cities across the country.   


Reproductive rights was a popular theme at the second annual installment of this event. One sign read: ‘We need to talk about the elephant in the womb’.   


Many of the banners on display at the 2018 Women’s Marches were thought-provoking and serious, others funny and some downright brutal.   


On Saturday, the 2018 Women’s March again drew crowds all over the nation, from Los Angeles to New York City.   


Several cities had hundreds of thousands show up to protest against issues including misogyny, sexual harassment and assault, lack of equal treatment in the workplace, and the deportation of immigrant children.
