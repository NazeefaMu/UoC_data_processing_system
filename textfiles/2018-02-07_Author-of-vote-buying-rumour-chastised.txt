A Diyawanna member from the main alliance of the North phoned up Number One the other day to make a serious complaint against the sole Blue party member from the North who had made it to Diyawanna through the charity list. 

 


The main alliance member told Number One that the Blue one Rama had accused his alliance members of obtaining a hefty ‘santhosam’ from yahapalanaya as the price for their vote for the last annual Budget. “We came to the rescue of the government at a time when it needed our support most.  If your own members make accusations of this nature to disparage us, how can we consider supporting the government in future?” he asked Number One.


After thanking the alliance one for bringing the matter to his notice, Number One gave Rama a severe tongue-lashing capping it with the   warning of zero tolerance for any act of misconduct on his part in future, they say.
