A Green politico who made it to Diyawanna from Polonnaruwa has told his colleagues that he had no intention of seeking re-election to the council in future.

 


The politico had confided in his colleagues at a hush-hush in the House lobby that he was highly disappointed over his failure to render a worthwhile service to his constituents. “My once highly successful business ventures suffered a setback as a result of my involvement in politics. There is discontent over this on my home front as well. So I have decided to give up politics to devote more time to business undertaking in Kolonne,” the politico has explained.
