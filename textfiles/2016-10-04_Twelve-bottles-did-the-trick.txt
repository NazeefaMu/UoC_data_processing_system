Twelve bottles did  the trick


	



 

A local politico backing the yahapalanaya had attended a protest staged by a group of peasants in Rajarata recently. Soon after reaching the venue of the protest, he had contacted a high political authority on behalf of the protesting peasants.

 


The local politico was a bit shaken by the curt reply he received from the political authority who had demanded what he was doing at this anti-government protest. “I say, we can’t change the government policies every time a protest is held. You had better leave the place and mind your own business.”


The politico found himself between the devil and the deep blue sea. He could not afford to defy the orders given by the political high-up. Nor could he let down the peasants who were his mainstay in politics.  So he had immediately sought the advice of a close friend on how he could retain the support of the peasants without antagonizing the powerful political high-up.


“Don’t worry, Machang,” said the friend. “There’s a simple solution to your problem: Get back home and send some bottles to the protesters.”


The local politico who immediately got back home had sent 12 bottles to the protesters and that had saved the situation.
