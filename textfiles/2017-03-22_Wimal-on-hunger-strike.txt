NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa has commenced a hunger strike this morning at the Magazine Prison, Prisons Spokesperson Thushara Upuldeniya said.

It was reported that MP Weerawansa had rejected to have his breakfast.

The National Freedom Front (NFF) said MP Weerawansa had commenced a hunger strike against the political revenge of the government.

“He has taken this step as a personal decision. He has also informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya about his decision. At present, he is on a hunger strike at the prison cell. Perhaps, he would continue it,” the NFF said.

Earlier, MP Weerawnsa was arrested and remanded for allegedly misusing 40 state vehicles belonging to the state engineering corporation causing a loss of Rs. 90 million. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Kalathma Jayawardhane)
