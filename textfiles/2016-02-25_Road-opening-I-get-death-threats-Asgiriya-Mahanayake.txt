Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayake Ven. Galagama Sri Atthadassi Thera said yesterday he was intimidated with death threats from various factions as he objected to the reopening of the road opposite the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.


“I receive letters from various factions threatening me with death,” the thera said.


The Thera, making a special statement, said that he and Asgiriya Chapter were strongly objected to the reopening of the road and that even President Maithripala Sirisena was of the same opinion.


“I objected to the reopening of the road from the beginning. Why are they in such a hurry to open the road? The traffic congestion will get worse, if it was opened. Lots of people including foreigners gather around these roads. So, how vehicles could be allowed to use the road,” the Thera asked.


Ven. Atthadassi Thera said if the road was opened by force, they could do nothing and added that however, the President said a few months ago that the road would not be opened and asked to propose alternative roads.


The Thera said alternative roads -such as subways-should be constructed instead of opening the road.(J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
