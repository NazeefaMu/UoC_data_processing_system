A person elected at the recent local polls had demanded the mayoral office at pistol point from a chief purohita, says a report from the periphery. 

 


This person had called on the chief purohita in a fit of anger on hearing that the party had nominated another successful candidate for mayor and had threatened that he would gun down all and sundry if he were not nominated for the office. The chief purohita is said to be in a dilemma over what action he should take against the belligerent politico as the latter happens to be a leading activist of the political party in the area.
