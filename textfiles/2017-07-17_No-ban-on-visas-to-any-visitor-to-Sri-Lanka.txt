Dismissing claims that visas were not being issued to foreigners arriving from some countries, Immigration and Emigration Chief Nihal Ranasinghe said today that all foreigners would be issued visas without any special test or delay irrespective of their country of origin.

It was reported that visas for citizens of some countries including Syria, Nigeria and Pakistan were only being issued after a special test.

Mr. Ranasinghe said according to the current procedure, the department had not specified any country or set of countries for which the were banned.

“Any foreigner who hopes to visit Sri Lanka for business, leisure, educational or any other purpose can apply for a visa online and obtain visas for 30 days. After arrival the foreigners can extend their visa by applying to the Department of Immigration and Immigration” he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
