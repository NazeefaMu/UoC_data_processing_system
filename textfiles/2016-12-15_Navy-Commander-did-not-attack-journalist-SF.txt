Minister Sarath Fonseka said yesterday the Navy Commander had not attacked a journalist but he had only pushed him away from the security circle and that everything had happened in an acceptable manner.

He said the Navy Commander had arrived at the port to assist in piloting the ship which was seized by the protestors and clad in the uniform required for that purpose.

“It was reported in the media that the navy commander had arrived at the scene with a dress meant for sports. But it was a uniform worn by marine pilots. We have only two marine pilots in the Navy and the Navy Commander is one of them,” the minister said.

“The Navy’s Special Boat Squadron (SBS) had formed a security circle because of the protestors occupying the port premises. The journalist who was said to have been attacked had breached the security circle without permission and had attempted to video the SBF operations. Then the Navy Commander had pushed him out,” he said.
