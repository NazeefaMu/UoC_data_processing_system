The Supreme Court today rejected the fundamental rights petition filed by former economic development minister Basil Rajapaksa where he sought an order to prevent his imminent arrest by the FCID in five cases connected to the purchase of land.

The petition was taken up for hearing by a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justices Sisira J. De Abrew and Anil Gooneratne. They ruled that there was no legal basis for proceeding with the petition.(S.S. Selvanayagam)
