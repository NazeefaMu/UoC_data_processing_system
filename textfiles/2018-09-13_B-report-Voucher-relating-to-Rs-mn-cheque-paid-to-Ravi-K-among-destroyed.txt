Filing a B report in Court, the prosecution informed court today that according to a statement submitted by a W.M. Mendis & Company’s finance officer, the ‘voucher’ relating to the Rs. 10 million cheque paid to the ‘Global Towers Company’- which has a connection to Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake- was also among those vouchers which had been destroyed.

The Prosecution has stated this based on a statement given by Sujith Alwis (Finance Manager of W.M. Mendis & Company), who had confessed before the CID on August 31, 2018.

He had also revealed that he was aware that Arjun Aloysius had instructed W.M. Mendis & Company CEO, Suneth Abeykoon in the latter part of 2017 to destroy the voucher related to the particular payment which Mr. Karunanayake had received through Mr. Sinniah.

Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda revealed that 102 original vouchers relating to transactions between WM Mendis & Company and third parties had been destroyed and replaced by some officers of the company upon the instructions of its CEO in November 2017, while the Bond Commission was in progress.
