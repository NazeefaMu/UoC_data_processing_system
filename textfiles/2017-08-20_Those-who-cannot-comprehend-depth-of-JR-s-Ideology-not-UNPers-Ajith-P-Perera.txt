The people who don’t understand the core of the former president late J. R. Jayewardene’s ideology are not true UNPers, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said today.

Speaking to the media after attending a function to commemorate the United National Party (UNP) Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s 40 year-political-journey, the deputy minister said those who cannot understand the meaning behind the late president Jayewardene’s words are not true UNPers.

“Those who cannot comprehend the depth of his ideology and do not wish to continue his legacy, should not call themselves true UNPers,” the deputy minister said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
