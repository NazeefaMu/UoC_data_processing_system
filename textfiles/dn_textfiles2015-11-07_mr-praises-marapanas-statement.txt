MR praises Marapana's statement

 
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa commended the statement made by Public Order Minister Thilak Marapana on the Avant Garde controversy.
Rajapaksa made this remark yesterday when he addressed a pocket meeting in Kadigamuwa in the Hambantota district.
Rajapaksa praised Marapana's position on the matter and said he was a "respected" lawyer.
"The Public Order Minister said some Police officers who wanted to gain points triggered the Avante Garde controversy. He said it was similar to the Millennium City issue in 2002. We all know what happened as a result of the Millennium City revelation. When I look at other inquiries conducted against me, I see a similar trend. Some people are trying to gain points by leveling false allegations against me," Rajapaksa said.
