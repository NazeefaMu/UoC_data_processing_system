The second in command of yahapalanaya is being inundated with complaints against wheeler-dealer Ministerial ones these days. Allegations being made against three of them are rather serious, they say.
Two of the three facing serious allegations are from Colombo and the other is from the South. One of them is involved with shady deals with leading businessmen while the other two are bent on making a fast buck out of anything that comes their way. Even tax secrets are grist to their mill, they say. Most   white collar ones in the Ministries who are forced to fall in line with the ministerial designs are said to be very unhappy over the situation and the stress they are undergoing is obvious to any discerning eye, they say.
Highly concerned new Big Boss and his second in command have now embarked on a plan of action to keep track of the scams the corrupt Ministerial ones are involved in.  
Meanwhile, the white collar higher-ups also have been given strict orders not to be a party to any illegal activity initiated by their Ministerial ones.
