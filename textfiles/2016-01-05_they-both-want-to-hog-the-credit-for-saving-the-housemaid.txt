<U+200B>People in this country heaved a collective sigh of relief when they heard that the Saudi authorities had decided, in response to appeals made by our government high ups, to spare the life of the Sri Lankan housemaid who was to be stoned to death.  
Incidentally, the two Ministries involved are said to be engaged in a keen contest to hog the credit for saving the life of this housemaid. 
The Foreign Ministry mandarins have claimed that their purohita had saved the life of the woman by enlisting the good offices of Samantha Power, the US permanent representative at the UN. However, the officials of the Ministry in charge of the subject claim that their relentless efforts through the diplomatic channels saved the woman’s life. 
While the debate over this issue was raging unabated, a Foreign Ministry high up had said: “Well, if a situation similar to this arises again, let them handle it alone if they are so resourceful.”
