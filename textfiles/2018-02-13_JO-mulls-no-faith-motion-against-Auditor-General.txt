The Joint Opposition (JO) today said it was mulling a no-confidence motion against the Auditor General for making a statement over State loans during the silent period of the election campaign, in what it called a last minute attempt to mislead the voters.

MP Bandula Gunawardana said no political party was allowed to make a response to the Auditor General’s statement because he made it during the silent period of the election campaign. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
