Development Strategies and International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe is reported to have questioned at the UNP electoral organizers’ meeting, as to how the President’s Office referred a complaint against his Ministry and the Board of Investment (BoI) to the Bribery Commission for investigation.

The United National Party had a meeting for its electoral organizers on Tuesday to discuss the organization of the party in view of the future elections.

Parliamentarian Senasinghe had said that ‘a certain party’ had lodged a complaint with the President implicating the Minister, the State Minister and the BoI that they tried to seek bribe for the approval of a project.

He asked how such a baseless complaint could be referred to the Bribery Commission for investigation by the President’s Office.

He said the complainant party had not fulfilled requirements to secure any project to the country.

He told the meeting that the project proposal had transpired through the Single Window Committee after being referred to the BoI.

Also, he questioned as to how the President’s Office leaked information to a certain media organization. (Kelum Bandara)
