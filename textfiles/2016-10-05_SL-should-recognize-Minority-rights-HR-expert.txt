SL should recognize Minority rights: HR expert


	

UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues Rita Izsák-Ndiaye, who will be visiting Sri Lanka this month, said the recognition and promotion of minority rights are critical in achieving long-lasting peace and reconciliation, particularly in countries such as Sri Lanka which were once divided by ethnic conflicts.

She said any efforts towards accountability and reconciliation must include a careful examination of the extent to which the rights of minorities are protected and promoted in the country considering the long-standing grievances that were at the roots of the 25 year civil war in Sri Lanka.

Ms. Izsák-Ndiaye, who is scheduled to undertake an official visit to Sri Lanka from October 10 to 20, recognised the important advances made in Sri Lanka since the appointment of the new government but said it still faces immense challenges in terms of fostering unity, non-discrimination, peace and understanding among groups in the country.

A statement issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said the human rights expert will visit Colombo as well as other locations in the Northern, North Central, Eastern and Central Provinces during her visit to meet with minority communities to hear directly from them about their issues and concerns.

The Special Rapporteur will also meet with a wide range of other stakeholders, including State authorities, the National Human Rights Commission and civil society actors.

“My visit is intended to assist the Government and the Sri Lankan society at large in identifying challenges and solutions, as well as sharing experiences at this critical time for Sri Lanka,” she added.
The Special Rapporteur will present her preliminary findings and recommendations at a press conference which would be held on the last say of her visit in Colombo.

Ms. Izsák-Ndiaye will present her full report on the mission to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017.

Ms. Izsák-Ndiaye is an independent expert tasked by the UN Human Rights Council to monitor, report and advice in the field of minority rights globally and she will be visiting the country at the invitation of the Government.
