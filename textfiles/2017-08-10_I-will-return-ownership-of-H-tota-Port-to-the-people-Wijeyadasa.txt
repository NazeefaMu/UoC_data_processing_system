I will return ownership of H'tota Port to the people: Wijeyadasa


	

Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the sale of Hambantota Harbour - a public asset-to the Chinese was a wrong and assured the public that he would not rest until he regains its ownership on behalf of the people.

In an interview with our sister paper the Sunday Lankadeepa the minister recalled that as a politician he had always done what was right by the country and fought against corruption. As a result he said he had been able to secure government resources worth more than Rs.1,000 billion which included the Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Insurance Company and Litro Gas Company and vest them with the people.

The deal with China in relation to the Hambantota Harbour is decisive within the sphere of global politics as it has prompted India to demand possession of the oil tanks in Trincomalee, the minister said.

He warned that as 89 per cent of the ships arriving at the Colombo Harbour were there for re-export these ships would not want to sail an extra 400 nautical miles to Colombo when with the further expansion taking place at the Hambantota Harbour they could dock there and unload their goods. This would then end up turning the Colombo Harbour into a swimming pool while the Chinese company with a major stake in the Hambantota Port would flourish.

The minister stressed that whether he was still in the government or was forced out he would continue his fight against corruption and the tyrannical attempt by the Chinese to take over the world of trade. (Prasanna Sanjeewa Thennakone)
