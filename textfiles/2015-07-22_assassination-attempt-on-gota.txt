A man, who was found guilty of having concealed information of an attempt to assassinate former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa by the LTTE, was sentenced to six months imprisonment by Colombo High Court Judge Lalith Jayasuriya today.
Maithree Saman Kumara of Gampaha was accused of having concealed covered information about LTTE cadres Ikendran and Suresh Kumar who had been employed by the LTTE to assassinate Mr. Rajapaksa at Welikada sometime in 2009.
The convict who is said to be a political supporter of former Gampaha District MP Sarana Gunawardena was indicted by the Attorney General under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
The judge imposed a six month jail term considering the fact that the convict was in remand for more than six years in this connection.
