In line with its commitment to caring for its customers and adding greater value to their lives, Sampath Bank announced that is distributing over Rs.100 million in medical benefits to Sampath Sanhinda Saver account holders.


This is the highest value of medical benefits being awarded in a given year by Sampath Bank under the Sanhinda Saver account. The bank has been awarding such benefits to Sanhinda Saver account holders based on their annual average account balance for nine consecutive years, from 2009. They are just one of the many privileges offered by the account.


Sampath Bank has designed the Sanhinda Saver account from the ground up to specifically meet the needs of its esteemed customers who are over the age of 55. Account holders receive a higher rate of interest, with interest payments being made twice a month. Additional interest is paid for foreign currency (US$) savings accounts. The bank also offers them a host of deals and discounts at several leading hospitals, pharmacies, medical labs and other merchant partners.


Sampath Bank PLC Deposit Mobilization Assistant General Manager Sanath Abhayaratne said: “At Sampath Bank, we take great pride in being a truly Sri Lankan financial service provider. We have always strived to live by the nation’s values and belief systems and incorporate them in everything we do. Inspired by our society’s regards for elders and the tradition of caring for them when they get older, the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account is tailored to meet the unique needs of customers over the age of 50. It offers account holders a host of benefits and privileges that are aligned to their lifestyle. Thanking them for placing their trust in Sampath Bank, we are delighted to offer over Rs.100 million in medical benefits this year, the highest ever in our history.”


Sampath Bank has also launched the Sanhinda Medical Benefit Card to enable Sanhinda Saver account holders avail their rewards and benefits with greater ease. Coming in place of the Sanhinda vouchers currently in use, the cards bring in greater convenience and security. Unlike the vouchers, account holders will now be able to pay out only the specific amount they need from the total value of benefits available in their card using the new Sanhinda Medical Benefit Card. While the cards will be valid for five years from the date of issue, the benefits being distributed currently are valid until 28th February 2018.
