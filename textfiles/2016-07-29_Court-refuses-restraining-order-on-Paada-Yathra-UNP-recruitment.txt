Attanagalle Magistrate Dinesh Lakmal Perera today refused to grant a restraining order to prevent the Joint Opposition from holding meetings in Nittambuwa on Sunday in line with its Paada Yathrawa and the United National Party (UNP) from conducting a membership recruitment drive during the weekend.

Nittambuwa Police OIC Prasanna Welikala filing a petition informed the Magistrate that the Paada Yathrawa led by former president MP Mahinda Rajapaksa was scheduled to arrive in Nittambuwa on Saturday and to hold a meeting on Sunday.

He said Attanagalle UNP Main Organiser Chandrasoma Sarathlal was also scheduled to conduct a membership recruitment drive during these two days.

The OIC had therefore, requested a restraining order banning both events saying the events could cause disturbance to the public.

Refusing the request, the Magistrate said the court had no authority to prevent events of a political party and noted that any party was entitled to act in a democratic manner.

However, the Magistrate said there was no restriction for the Police to carry out its duties according to the Police Ordinance. (Ananda E. Jayakody)
