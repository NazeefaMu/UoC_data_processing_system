Scottish engineer due in court in SL over nightclub brawl


	

A Scot is due in court in Sri Lanka over a nightclub brawl with the son of a former government minister in the country in 2014.

James Casserly, 44, is expected to appear at court on Wednesday in the south Asian island state along with Malaka Silva and his four bodyguards after they were involved in a fight in a club in 2014.

Silva is the son of Sri Lanka's former minister for public relations and has a reputation in the country for his unruly social life. Silva is banned from a number of night spots, including the one were the fight happened.

Mr Casserly, originally from Shotts in North Lanarkshire, moved to the country's capital Colombo after getting a job as a senior engineer at a manufacturing firm in 2013.

He went with his partner Belinda Mackenzie to a Halloween party at a nightclub while staying in the city and became involved in a confrontation after Ms Mackenzie was allegedly harassed by Silva, who was banned from the venue over previous incidents there.

Mr Casserly says he reacted after Silva groped his girlfriend then attacked her when she pushed him away.

The Scots says he struck Silva but was thrown to the floor by his bodyguards who repeatedly kicked and stamped on him until he was unconscious. He lost his job as a result of the investigation and says his life, and that of his partner, has been adversely affected.

Now he is seeking "justice" and closure with the case dragging on for around two years without reaching court.

Mr Casserly told STV News: "After I stuck him (Silva) the bodyguards grabbed me and kicked me around until I was unconscious.

"My partner was left with pretty bad anxiety after it and I lost my job. It was a big money job and that's gone because of this. We've lost a lot. It's all because of this guy.

"There were so many witnesses so the case kept on getting put back and delayed. But they seem to have gathered all the evidence now so I'm just glad it's coming up but I wouldn't be surprised if there is another delay.

"The guy has a reputation as a troublemaker and I've received threats. I've been offered compensations but I want justice."

Mr Casserly will stand accused along with Silva and his four bodyguards. Two ministerial police also faced charges in the case but they have been dropped.

The Scots engineer will be accompanied by a representative from the British High Commission. (stv.tv)
