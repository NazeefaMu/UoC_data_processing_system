She goes single again


	



 

A story that has gone viral in political circles says that a dainty fair Diyawanna member from the South has begun a new single life.

 


A leading newsmaker, this fair member had been lying low in the recent past and was hardly seen in public  even when her area was badly hit by massive floods. A storm that ripped through her domestic scene had kept her away from the public eye, they say. 


The storm, of course, had begun when a dear one living under the same roof tracked her down to a place in the gem city where the fair one was engaged in a political discussion with a colleague. A heated exchange between the couple had led to a cascade of developments culminating in her decision to go single. 


All efforts by friends to bring about a reconciliation had failed and the matter is now lying in the hands of the black-coated gentry. And the fair one has picked a legal expert hailing from a reputed political family who also happens to be a son of a governor.


The fair one highly upset over the domestic problem is not in a frame of mind to continue in politics, informed ones say. However, those interested in getting the information from the horse’s mouth have found that the fair one has gone incommunicado.
