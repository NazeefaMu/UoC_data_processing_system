Permanency doesn’t come so easy as the appointment!


	



 

There is a top team member in yahapalanaya who is a good go-getter.  He is good at making a big noise about what he has done and is doing too.

 


The politico provided jobs to a large number of youth in an authority coming under his purview as trainee workers. These workers remained placed on a temporary basis even despite having completed the so-called training and worked at the authority for over two years. Getting perturbed over their job security, the workers began agitating for permanent status and the top team member asked his colleague handling finance to grant due authority to grant permanent status to these employees. 


However, the Treasury bigwigs turned down the request.


Not to be outdone, the politico approached Number One for a solution to his problem. He also suggested to Number One that the workers seeking permanent status be deployed as part of the latter’s ‘Grama Shakti’ regiment. 


However, Number One declined the politico’s suggestion saying that his Blue party loyalist ‘pigeons’ constituting the Grama Shakti ‘regiment could go into a panic if the Green party ‘hawks’ were thrown into their midst. 


Now the top team member who believes that nothing is impossible is said to be exploring new ways to find a solution to his problem, they say.
