The suggestion made by Northern Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran for an MoU between the Northern Provincial Council and the Central Government to divide the ownership of Moragahakanda Project was unacceptable, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said on Thursday.

Mr. Dissanayake who was speaking “Sahodarathwaye sithama” (Painting of brotherhood) organised by the JVP led socialist students union at Vihara Mahadevi Park said this was a statement, which arouses communalism.

“This statement of Mr. Wigneswaran is a clear example of trying to use communalism for his political survival,” he said.

“Is such an MoU needed?” he questioned.

He said communalism had become a tool of political survival today.

“Some politicians use it to recapture lost power and some use to stay in power. The flag of national reconciliation should be raised against these forces,” he added.

The JVP leader said the Northern people should realise that they would not gain anything from separation.

“There is a large onion harvest in Jaffna but the market for it is the south. It is same when it comes to vegetable industry in the North. Both North and the South is bound by the market, it is bound by the culture, the road network and by irrigation schemes.

“When you consider all these and the history there is potential only for a merger of North and South, not for separatism,” he added.

Mr. Dissanayake said a struggle to unity should be launched. He said a powerful voice had to be raised against communalism. But he said no other political party was prepared to raise their voices.

“They don’t want national unity. Does former President Rajapaksa want national unity? No! Does Ranil Wickremesinghe want it? Does Sampanthan want it? Or Rauff Hakeem and Thondaman? No! No one wants it,” he said.

This he said because they all would be politically wiped out when national unity in this country was ensured.

He said Mr. Hakeem’s politics was based on Muslim hard line, Sampanthan on the Tamil hard line and Former President Rajapaksa on the Sinhalese hard line .

He said this was a multi racial country, a nation where there was a mixed culture. Therefore he said national unity could be achieved by ensuring equal rights to all ethnic groups and religions.(Yohan Perera)
