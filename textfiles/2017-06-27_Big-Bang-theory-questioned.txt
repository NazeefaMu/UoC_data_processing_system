‘Big Bang’ theory questioned


	



 

Stephen Hawking’s vision on the creation of the universe are wrong, claims one of his closest friends.   


Professor Neil Turok, director of the Premeter Institute in Canada, has questioned the renowned theoretical physicist’s ideas on the Big Bang and the origins of the universe.   


Hawking’s view that space, time and matter burst into existence at once with the Big Bang, has long been the centre of physics and cosmology studies.Turok has now released research suggesting that Hawking’s maths was incorrect, saying that science should re-evaluate the claims.   


‘Our research implies that we either should look for another picture to understand the very early universe, or that we have to rethink the most elementary models of quantum gravity,’ Job Feldbrugge, one of Turok’s co-authors, said.   


Hawking has disagreed with Turok’s new theory, according to The Times.In the 1980s, Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time.
