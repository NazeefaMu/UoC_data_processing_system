The one who strikes deals with the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is the leader of the JVP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, said former President Mahinda Rajapakse, yesterday in Anuradhapura.

In reply to a question raised by a journalist, the former President said that there is no truth in the statement made by Anura Kumara Dissanayake to the affect that there are deals between himself and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“He is the one who struck deals during elections, and still he continues with these deals. Anura Kumara is the one who strikes deals even with the President. Despite Anura Kumara being the leader of the JVP he only speaks in Parliament matters that are favourable to the Prime Minister,” he said. (Athula Bandara)
