The road to fitness through CARDIO


	



We, living in this modernized world are highly competitive, running a never-ending rat race. Most of us heat up our chairs all day to meet career goals, hardly paying any attention to the importance of exercise. In a society like this, sparing some extra time working-out is encouraged in order to be healthy.  


As you visit the gym daily and work hard to prepare your body for the next beach session with fit abs and an attractive figure, have you ever wondered whether your body is responding to your efforts as much as you expect it to? ‘Cardio’ does all the magic here and becoming aware of it will help you carry out your fitness sessions with more effectiveness and knowledge.

What is Cardio?
It is the short term for ‘Cardiovascular’, which involves the heart and blood vessels which circulate oxygenated blood throughout the body. ‘Engaging in cardio’ simply means the involvement of an individual in endurance exercises, which enhances the effectiveness of our cardiovascular system.   Any activity which makes your heart rate go up to 50-75% of the maximum value owned by your body comes under Cardio. This value can be roughly calculated by reducing your age from 220.   E.g.: If you are a 30 years old, the maximum heart rate you can go up to is 220-30= 190  

 

Where does the secret lie?
Cardio can be tiring, yet it is a powerful tool when aiming for a healthy fat loss. It also creates an energy deficit in our metabolism, which significantly reduces the amount of food needed. It must always be carried out in a style which targets a maximum break-down of fat for energy while sparing muscle mass and that is where the need for HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) arises.   
This special tactic involves 20 minutes of cardio comprising of,  

 

 Warming-up  
	 Short high-intensity period   
	 Moderate low-intensity period  
	 Cooling-down phase  

Warming up and cooling down are two MUSTs to be carried out during a work-out. Warming up, at the very beginning, prepares our body for strenuous exercises, whereas cooling down will get our body back to its normal pace at the end of the session. We are going to examine the benefits of these two activities, properly blended up with cardio in order to gain the maximum physical results expected.  

 


Warming-up
There are several bodily changes observed during these exercises, like increased heart rate, respiratory rate, energy releasing reactions and blood supply to muscles with oxygen and glucose.  
It is obvious that our body excessively heats up during work outs, just like a car engine. Therefore, slowly adjusting your body to such changes is highly important, since sudden heating up procedures without any prior preparation can even end up in death. A good warm-up will dilate blood vessels and ensure a good blood supply to your muscles whereas body temperature will get adjusted for optimal efficiency.  


Light cardio and dynamic stretching exercises are effective in avoiding muscle and ligament strains. The ulterior motive of this is to prepare your cardiovascular system without shocking it at once, by exposing it to a sudden strenuous exertion.  


This cardio workout of 5 minutes will play an active role in the vigorous activities about to follow. As a bonus point, the calorie burning role of these light bodyweight cardio movements will introduce your body to a jump-start for fat burning.  


Once this cardio warming-up session is over, your body will be fit enough to face any challenge on strength, HIIT, endurance, power, toning or stretching.  

 

Cooling-down
This is as important as warm-ups, because all your heated body muscles and dilated blood vessels should come back to its normal status, following a tough session of work-out, in order to function in the normal manner. 


Lack of these may lead to vomiting and discomfort, so it is always good to spare a few seconds on pampering your tired muscles through dynamic stretching and cardio.   


Dynamic stretching will reduce the formation of lactic acid in muscles, which is responsible for cramps and stiffness.  

Swinging between high and low intensity phases will keep your body in a ‘fat-burning mode’ without burning carbohydrates or proteins for energy. Several research studies have shown that HIIT is highly effective on optimal fitness which burns fat 50% more efficiently than low-intensity cardio, which is definitely a plus point!  


However, all this hard work could go down the drain if you practice wrong techniques without proper guidance. So, always stick to a professional and work-out in a manner where you can gain the maximum benefits while working the least.
