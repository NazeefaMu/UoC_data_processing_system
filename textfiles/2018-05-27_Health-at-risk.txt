Health at risk


	

Is the health of the Ministry of Health hanging on its last straw? Picture shows the name board of the Health Ministry (Suwasiripaya) at Rev. Baddegama Wimalawansa Thero Mawatha in Colombo 10 with letter ‘H’ hanging on one last nail. The letter has been hanging like that for several months despite being pointed out to officials.
