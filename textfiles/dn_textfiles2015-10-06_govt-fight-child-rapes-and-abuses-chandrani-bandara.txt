Govt. to fight child rapes and abuses - Chandrani Bandara

The government will take measures during the next five years to minimise child rapes and abuses, said Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara.
She said that the implementation of capital punishment is not a means to reduce child rapes, abuses and other crimes, but the implementation of long term programmes to eliminate the causes of the crimes would be the only solution.
She made these observations in Parliament yesterday responding to the adjournment motion moved by UNP Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra stressing the need to implement capital punishment on the culprits of child rapes.
Minister Bandara said the government has identified the need of a special High Court to hear the cases of child rapes. She said a day of a week of Courts Calendar could be spared to hear these types of crimes so that the hearings wouldn't drag for years.
She said the government has identified the need to amend and revise the law related to these crimes to mete justice to the victims and punish the perpetrators. She said the need has arisen to strengthen the existing laws.
She said President Maithripala Sirisena's stance was to implement capital punishment if Parliament passed the move with a majority.
Minister Bandara said the adjournment motion moved by MP Premachandra was timely. She said among many facts that could be considered as the causes of committing such crimes are poverty, lack of education, psychological imbalances, stress and being a victim of child abuse. She said the government will implement long term plans to eliminate the causes of child rapes.
Lanka to continue moratorium on death penalty

Sri Lanka will continue the moratorium on death penalty, Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe told Parliament yesterday.
The minister made this observation while participating in the debate on the adjournment motion moved by UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra on re-implementing the death penalty.
The minister said Sri Lanka had voted in favour of the UN resolutions calling for moratorium on death penalty in 2007, 2008 and 2010. In 2012, Sri Lanka had abstained from voting for the resolution.
However, the minister said Sri Lanka has decided to vote in favour of the UN resolution for moratorium on death penalty in 2015 when the vote is taken at the UN General Assembly. "The world opinion with regard to the matter is in favour of not implementing it. Punishments are aimed at correction and rehabilitation in democratic countries," he said. The minister said the Pope when addressing the inaugural session of the UN General Assembly on September 24 requested all countries to abolish death penalty. He said Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera at his address at the UNHRC on September 14 stated, on behalf of the Sri Lankan government, that capital punishment would not be implemented.
Parliamentary proceedings suspended for 15 minutes

Parliamentary proceedings were suspended for 15 minutes due to a tense situation emerged when some Opposition members exhibited a mass scale banner inside the House yesterday.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala suspended the House at 1.35 pm and resumed proceedings at 1.50 pm.
The tense situation emerged when UPFA Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa asked about a debate on the investigative mechanism in the US resolution and some Opposition Parliamentarians exhibited a banner in which "Say No to Hybrid Court, Protect our War Heroes," was noted.
Wimal Weerawansa raising a point of order stated that he brought the matter of hybrid court against War Heroes to the notice of Parliament and asked the Speaker for a debate on the matter. He said the matter is not included in the agenda for this week.
Leader of the House and Minister Laxman Kiriella said the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister are abroad during this week. He said the matter was taken up at the Party Leader's Meeting and promised to accommodate a debate on a future date.
The minister said although Wimal Weerawansa spoke of a hybrid court, such a court has not been mentioned in the resolution.
Weerawansa said although the term wasn't in the resolution, the concept was there in other words. At this stage, government and Opposition members started to shout and hooted.
Rauff Hakeem said when such an incident takes place, Weerawansa usually stages a protest opposite the UN office. But today, he took a photograph with his mobile phone. He said Weerawansa's need is to get publicity.
Weerawansa asked the government not to betray War Heroes to a foreign court.
Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said one should not take photos in the House and exhibit banners to obtain cheap publicity.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala asked the opposition members to remove the posters from the House. He also asked the members to behave well.
The banner which seemed 20 feet long and five feet wide was held by Opposition Members Niroshan Premaratne, Sisira Jayakody, Jayantha Samaraweera, Lohan Ratwatte, Weera Kumara Dissanayake, Piyal Nishantha, Udaya Gammanpila and Jagath Muthukumarana.
UNP MPs Palitha Tewarapperuma and Nalin Bandara Jayamaha were seen coming towards the well. Sergeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekara and Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando and Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms Kushan Jayaratne who came to the well prevented the government members going towards the Opposition members who were holding the banner in the well.
However, the members did not take their seats and the tense situation continued.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala suspended the sitting for 10 minutes at 1.35 pm. No sooner the sittings suspended, Nalin Bandara Jayamaha who seated the Opposition members did try to scratch the banner. Palitha Thewarapperuma was also approaching. However, UPFA MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage turned those two government side members in a friendly manner while the Opposition members were still carrying the banner. However, the Sergeant-at-Arms Samarasekara took the banner from the members in an amicable manner. The situation claimed down and the quorum bells rang at 1.45 pm. The sittings were resumed at 1.50 pm presided by the Deputy Speaker.
Hirunika wants to reactivate capital punishment
Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Disna Mudalige
UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra told Parliament yesterday that measures should be taken to reactivate capital punishment. The reactivation of capital punishment would help arrest the increasing wave of crimes. She said so while moving an adjournment motion.
Today, capital punishment is inactive in the country. Some hardcore criminals do not serve at least 20 yeas of their life sentences. People are not afraid to commit crimes because of this situation, she said.
People would respect law if they have fear of punishment. Sometimes, innocents get punished owing to lapses in the legal system. That is an issue for which we should find a solution. We should not mix religion and law, because that would hinder the implementation of the law against criminals, she said.
Social Services Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake seconding the motion said that the motion questioned as to who would take the responsibility of the rights of minors between five to 10 years. We should not let criminals go back to the society. Capital punishment is in practice in many nations. The people of those countries do not engage in crimes easily. They scared of the law.
Those who have the power of money have no problem, but the children of the poor are helpless. We should make use of capital punishment for about an year so that there will be reduction in crimes.
Water Supply and Town Planning Deputy Minister Dr. Sudharshani Fernandopulle said that reproductive health subjects should be introduced to the school syllabus to increase awareness among children. There are many non-bailable offences, but rape and abuse of children and women are bailable offences. We should make them non-bailable offences, she said.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said the Judiciary and Police are politicized. Before implementing capital punishment, we should depoliticise these organisations. We should implement capital punishment for the well-being and protection of the children.
DNA MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said people come out and stage protests when a crime occurs because they are not sure whether law will be implemented. People don't trust the Judiciary and Police due to various reasons. We remember how the Presidential pardon was given to several murderers during the previous regime. That should not happen again.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said capital punishment will not prevent crimes. What should be done is to find out the root causes of crimes and resolve those issues.

He made the assurance in response to a question raised by DNA Parliamentary Group Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who wanted to know as to why the government delayed responding to Parliament with regard to the Avant Garde issue.
"We will not hide any facts or details regarding to the Avant Garde deal. The government will respond to the questions of the MP in the next sitting week of Parliament," the Leader of the House said. The question was raised on September 22. The government had not been able to respond even after 18 days, the MP said.
No crime wave in country - Rathana Thera
Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Disna Mudalige
There is not an alarming crime rate in the country as some group of people and the media attempt to point out, said United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) Parliamentarian Ven Athuraliye Rathana Thera in Parliament yesterday.
The Thera said however, it is a commendable fact that people discuss this matter as they are moved by recent crimes.
The Thera said though our situation is not as worse as that of South Africa and India, we could soon reach such a situation if country would not take corrective measures.
The Thera said the murder of Seya was committed in the western province. If the situation in the Gampaha district is so much bad, the situation in other provinces and districts could be terrible, he said.
The Thera said food people eat today has consequences on creating abnormal sexual behaviour in people. He said chicken we have in market today is one such food.
The Thera said some food items have serious impacts on life expectancy as well. He said the life expectancy in the Anuradhapura district has lowered to 60 years.
He said criminals are not rehabilitated most of the time before they are released.

Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Disna Mudalige
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday in Parliament requested the Chair to instruct the television channels telecasting live Parliamentary sessions not to edit the content before transmission. He said that the Speaker has not imposed any restriction on live broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings, adding that no editing or censorship is required with regard to the content.
He made these observations before the UPFA MPs in the Opposition commenced a protest against the hybrid court while holding a banner in the Chamber. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the matter could be discussed at the Party Leaders' Meeting.

Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Disna Mudalige
JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake said a special court should be established to hear crimes against children and women. He made this observation in Parliament joining the adjournment motion moved by Hirunika Premachandra on the implementation of death penalty.
Bimal Ratnayake said death penalty is not a solution to child rape incidents.
He said the victims of such crimes are not from rich families. Poverty should be addressed, he said.
He said some problems cannot be corrected by means of law only.
Vasu demands special Parliamentary committee on capital punishment
Sandaen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Disna Mudalige
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday in Parliament requested the government to appoint a special Parliamentary committee to submit a report to Parliament after a detailed study on implementing capital punishment.
The MP was participating in the debate on the adjournment motion moved by UNP MP Hirunika Pramachandra on the reimplementation of the death penalty.
Nanaykkara said the committee could obtain the views of experts in the field and analyse the survey reports connected to the matter.
He said when such a report is placed before Parliament, it could be debated extensively and take a final decision on reimplementing the death penalty.
MP Nanyakkara said rather than giving death sentence, it is better to make rapists impotent, stating it would be a heavy punishment for them than the death penalty.
He called on the government to withdraw the motion on the reimplementation of the death penalty.
Urban Development and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem said a committee was appointed in 2014 to review the case of prisoners on the death row, adding that an interim report of the committee has been submitted to the President.
Law and Order and Prison Reforms Minister Tilak Marapana said there must be a case to case assessment when implementing death sentence.

Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Sisna Mudalige
TNA Parliamentarian Vadivel Suresh said the member of child rape and abuses have increased in the estate sector due to liquor shops in the up-country.
