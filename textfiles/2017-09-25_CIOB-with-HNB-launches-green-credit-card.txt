The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), the pioneer which actively promotes green constructions in Sri Lanka, together with Hatton National Bank (HNB) recently launched a green credit card for people engaged in the construction industry as well as for professionals, at the HNB auditorium. 


The function was attended by CIOB President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, Advisor Professor Chitra Wedikkara, Deputy Presidents Jayakesh Tudawe and Ruwan De Silva, Executive Member Kalana Alwis and HNB Head of Credit Cards Roshantha Jayatunga as well as a host of 
distinguished guests. 


Dr. Karunaratne expressing his ideas said that the latest trend in the construction industry is sustainable construction and green construction and this is the first time a credit card specializing in these areas has been introduced. 


He said that the green credit card would help those engaged in the sector to practice these concepts continuously by providing the much-needed finance through the green credit card. 
“I thank HNB for coming together with us to support this task,” he said.


He further said that most of the mega construction projects are undertaken by large foreign companies due to their strength in finance, manpower, material and other resources. The local companies cannot compete alone with foreign companies and this is one of the challenges faced and to win this challenge the CIOB is trying to gather all large-scale construction companies and create 
a new structure. 


“We are also having discussions with the government to get small portions of large projects given to foreign companies. The green credit card will encourage green builders and support the endeavours launched by us,”


 said Karunaratna.Jaytunga explained the significance of the CIOB-HNB green credit card and said that the entrepreneurs and professionals who are members of the CIOB can obtain this credit card, which is also valid internationally. Therefore, this credit card can be used to make payments locally as well as internationally and can pay up to Rs.1 billion while the interest is very nominal. A long time is offered to settle the credit card. In addition, when the entrepreneurs and professionals go abroad, the green credit card will help them immensely.


The CIOB has been engaged in promoting green construction for the last six years. In addition, the CIOB has launched many programmes to promote green construction and among them are issuing the CIOB green mark certificate for large-scale green constructions, organising a green award ceremony and awarding the CIOB Green Mark for green buildings, green products and green construction services, introducing the Advanced Certificate Course for Green Project Managers are some the initiatives undertaken by the CIOB. Green construction has many benefits and among them are eco-friendly, healthy, energy saving and longevity.
