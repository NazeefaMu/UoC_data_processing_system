The Joint Opposition today brought the attention of the government on the impounding of passport of six members of Parliament.

Joint Opposition Group leader Dinesh Gunawardane who raised the matter in the House said all MPs are members of International Parliamentary Union (IPU) and therefore they should be free to travel.

He said passports of some former MPs have been impounded as well.

Deputy Speaker Tilanga Sumathipala who responded said impounding has been done by Courts to ensure that they report to courts when cases against them are called up.

However, he said both the Speaker and the Prime minister are not favourable towards impounding passport.

"The Speaker will take up the matter with the Attorney General and will see to it that MPs rights are restored" he added. (Yohan Perera)
