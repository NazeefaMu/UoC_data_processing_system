Following its unprecedented success of organising two colossal events this year, SLIM will host yet another major event, in collaboration with international motivational coach, Tim Wade. SLIM will proudly present Tim Wade for the first time in Sri Lanka for an exclusive workshop titled, ‘Enhancing Performance through paradigm shift’ on the 06th and 07th of December.

Australian born Tim Wade is a science graduate of the University of Queensland having majored in Psychology. He is a past President of Singapore’s National Professional Speaking Association where he created and developed their Speakers Academy curriculum to teach people to become professional presenters. He is known for delivering entertainingly dynamic, energetic, engaging and interactive presentations, with relevance couched in humor that connects with audiences and delivers results.

Tim is a business speaker who has worked in corporate fields and has faced, and solved many issues prevalent in the business and marketing sectors. He has managed corporate departments and divisions of between three and 400 staff in different organizations in Asia and Australia, and has experienced many of the changes most organizations experience during their various business cycles whether in junior roles as a front-line service staff member, team leader, or when he was in senior roles such as National Manager for Operations, or Vice President of the International Group of a $2.2 billion revenue company evaluating suitable mergers and acquisitions.

His claim to fame has been his success in helping business leaders and their staff to motivate change to create positive business results. He has also designed, managed, coached and implemented the changes, as he has been there in the thick of it and speaks from actual experience, which is the reason so many clients have engaged him to design programs that successfully reach out to people and help them embrace positive changes while being inspired to deliver positive results.

His speaking, training, facilitation and consulting clients include MNCs, Government Ministries, Agencies, SMEs, Institutions, Associations and organizations as diverse as: Ferrari, John Deere, Singtel, Credit Suisse, Royal Caribbean, Cotton On, Daimler, Saudi-Hollandi Bank, Government of Singapore, its ministries and agencies, as well as universities and tertiary colleges, the Government of Dubai, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, and many more.

With over 19 years of operational leadership and multi-award- winning consulting experience in businesses across Australia and Asia, Tim Wade’s corporate leadership has resulted in multiple industry awards won by clients including the United Overseas Bank (Singapore) and China Light & Power (Hong Kong). He has also been presented with a number of awards for services to the speaking industry and to leadership development at international conventions.

As the national body for marketing, SLIM believes in adding value to the nation’s ambitious development agenda. This opportunity will dust the loop holes and gaps in organizations, which will be making a higher employee turnover by enhancing the staff performance through positive mind-sets. SLIM is committed to impart global knowledge and experience and therefore we continue the process of featuring exceptional global personalities for the benefit of the business fraternity of Sri Lanka.
