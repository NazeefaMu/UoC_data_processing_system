Italy threatens to throw EU migration summit into chaos


	

BRUSSELS AFP June28, 2018 - Italy’s hardline new premier threatened Thursday to block a joint EU statement on migration at a summit that embattled German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned could decide the bloc’s fate.  Rome has recently refused to let several migrant rescue boats dock at Italian ports, reviving fresh tensions despite the fact that numbers of arrivals have dipped sharply since the height of Europe’s migration crisis in 2015.   


Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who heads Italy’s month-old populist and anti-immigration government, said he would refuse to endorse the conclusions of the meeting in Brussels if fellow leaders fail to do more to help Italy.   


 “Italy does not need more words, but concrete actions,” Conte told reporters as he arrived at the summit. “It’s a possibility I hope not to consider, but if we reach that point, on my behalf we will not have shared conclusions.”
