In view of the World Consumer Rights Day today and National Consumer Rights Week from March 14 to 20, 2016, Hatton National Bank (HNB) will be offering a host of exclusive benefits and concessions for its customers. 


These select and limited offers will be available at all HNB customer centres islandwide and will encompass products and services ranging from minors’ savings accounts to loans and advances and credit and debit cards. 


In the savings category, HNB will have two unique value additions for consumers through National Consumer Rights Week. During this period, every minor’s savings account opened for newborn infants will have their initial deposit matched up to a maximum of Rs.1,000 by the bank through its ‘Kiriketiyo’ scheme. Additionally, HNB will issue a valuable branded gift for every new savings account opened in this week with an initial deposit of Rs.10,000 or more. 


In the loans and advances segment, personal and housing loans and leasing facilities, obtained during this period, will have a 25 percent discount on the documentation charges as a special concession for consumers. 


Moreover, there will be special discounts, ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent, on a varied assortment of products and services with HNB credit and debit cards.  


Commenting on the National Consumer Rights Week initiated by the Consumer Affairs Authority, which is a first in Sri Lanka, HNB Deputy General Manager Retail and SME Banking Thimal Perera said that it was important for the bank to always live by its slogan ‘Your partner in progress’ by which, the bank always puts the customer at the heart of all its initiatives and strategies. 


“As seen by our recent marketing campaign, we are a bank that focuses on building and nurturing relationships over just transactions. HNB being positioned as the best retail bank in Sri Lanka by the Asian Banker magazine on seven occasions further emphasizes the fact that the bank should take the lead in identifying such important initiatives introduced by the Consumer Affairs Authority in Sri Lanka.”


Consumers can visit their nearest HNB customer centre to enjoy these exceptional benefits during the National Consumer Rights Week.
