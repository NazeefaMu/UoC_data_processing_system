Vandersay: on the road to stardom

Jeffrey Vandersay was a virtual unknown until he burst into the international scene with a match bag of eight wickets for Sri Lanka Board President's XI against the touring Pakistanis in a three-day warm-up game at the CCC grounds in June.
Five months down the line Vandersay, a leg-spinner of quality is on the verge of making his maiden One-Day International appearance for Sri Lanka against the touring West Indies side.
With the ongoing three-match series already in the bag for Sri Lanka who hold onto an unbeatable 2-0 lead the chances are that they will be looking to give some of their youngsters a chance to gain exposure against international opposition in the third and final game scheduled at Pallekele on Saturday.
The fast-rising spinner has already made his bow in T20 internationals playing two matches against Pakistan. However where his main focus lies is in Test cricket.
"My ultimate goal is to play Test cricket for a number of years, to do something for the country and kind of see myself as someone who has achieved my goal," Vandersay told the Daily News.
""Test cricket is testing your skill. I like the longer version of the game, I have the patience to play it. T20 and ODIs are good versions of the game, I love them but I love Test cricket more.
"But right now my focus is to get into the Test team and play in a Test match. In order to do that, I will have to work harder. The path that I have taken is correct only time will tell. Let's see how it goes.
"It will be another stepping stone in my career if I make it to the ODI squad, I can see myself going there. But at the same time you also have loads of work to do."
Vandersay believes the breakthrough for him came with the five wickets he took in an innings against Pakistan in the practice match.
"That performance so far has been the highlight of my career. Playing in that match was a very big experience for me. I was very excited to play and I also took it as a challenge to showcase my talent.
"I was kind of nervous at the beginning before I bowled but when the captain told 'Jeffrey you will be bowling from this end' my nerves calmed down. I thought this is what I am supposed to do, bowl like in a normal match. When I took the ball into my hands there was no nervousness or anything like that."
Vandersay's first victim was Ahmed Shehzad who came down the track and tried to hit him over mid-off but only succeeded in giving a catch. However the wicket he prides taking is that of Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq who was dismissed for 15.
"After I took 28 wickets in 6 matches for SSC in the Premier league last season it made the selectors think that I was someone worthwhile looking at. That could be the main reason for my selection for that match."
Vandersay's rise to success has been a steep gradient. After the Pakistan series he went to India with the Development Squad and took part in the Moin-ud-Dowla Gold Cup tournament where the flat pitches with no spin and bounce helped the spinners. But on the subsequent tour to New Zealand with the Sri Lanka A squad Vandersay bowled brilliantly to take two five-for in an innings hauls in the two four-day unofficial tests against New Zealand A thus underlying his ability to bowl on any kind of surface.
"The pitches were flat the only help I got was the wind which I used to my advantage because there was no spin at all. There was a lot of drift and I used it as well as the crease."
To a great extent Vandersay owes his success to Sri Lanka Cricket's spin bowling coach Piyal Wijetunga with whom he has been working.
"Piyal sir knew that I had the potential and the talent and he has always been pushing and backing me. He always tells me 'you have the talent and the quality you need to be more accurate'," said Vandersay.
"That's what we are working on every time we bowl at the nets - the more accurate you get the more pressure you can put on the batsman. He says bowl in one area in one line, draw the batsman out it doesn't matter if you get hit for six in front. A short ball is normal and as spinners we need to cut down on it. Every time a four goes you will lose the pressure.
""As a leg spinner you always want the ball to turn, that gives you loads of confidence especially when you see a turning track, but you rarely get turning tracks now so you have to be adapt and be good enough to bowl on any type of pitch."
Initially when he started Vandersay said he had only the googly. "I used to bowl it in three ways but one of my coaches said to master one, which I did."
Apart from the leg break Vandersay bowls the googly a lot and keeps the top spinner mainly for the longer game. For ODIs and T20Is he bowls the slider, the quicker one which contains runs.
What Vandersay has learnt from the great Shane Warne by watching videos of him is that as a leg spinner you have to spin the ball, if you don't there's no point in being one.
Vandersay's coach Piyal Wijetunga said, "He is our future. He is a conventional type of leg-spinner and we should preserve him for Test cricket, not for ODIs and T20Is. He needs a lot more experience and must be given every opportunity to play with the Sri Lanka A team."
The 25-year-old trundler was only 15 when he made it to the first eleven cricket team at Wesley College, In the season 2007-08 he took 35 wickets from 10 matches and also captained the school in five matches when appointed captain Ryan Kern was called up for national duty with the Sri Lanka under 19 team. "I used to be a bowler who was not accurate even though I loved playing cricket and loved bowling."
Vandersay of Dutch origin had to wait until his brother Arnold had stopped playing cricket for Wesley to begin his career because they needed someone to tend to their sick father who suffered from diabetes. Although employed in Qatar, Arnold became the breadwinner of the family following the death of their father ten years ago.
Vandersay who is unemployed at the moment said that he was first came under the eyes of Sri Lanka Cricket coaches when he was picked among the best five bowlers from his school and sent for training.
"Because I was small they didn't show much interest in me and I dropped off and went to England to play a season of cricket with Grampound CC in the Cornwall league. On my return I joined Seeduwa-Raddoluwa CC and had a very good season. I took 50 wickets in 9 matches in the Premier League and that's where actually everything kicked off. The coaches started to show interest in me wanting to find out who I was. They invited me to become a net bowler for the national team," said Vandersay.
But it was not until he joined SSC halfway through the 2014-15 season that he got the big break that was to change his career. In his first match for them against Sri Lanka Army Vandersay took seven wickets and was subsequently selected to play for Board President's XI against Pakistan. The rest of the journey from there onwards has been a fairytale.
 
Jeffrey Vandersay
Jeffrey Vandersay captained Wesley after a number of senior players were suspended following disciplinary action taken by the school principal MAP Fernando. This was meant to be detrimental to the school records but the contrary happened. Leading a team of boys from the Under 17 and Under 15 teams Jeff managed to get the best possible results. From this team Wesley were able to build a strong reputation - a blood and guts reputation with players like Danny Bartholomeusz, Ranindu Suriyakumara and Ashan Fonseka shining that season. They were good enough for the Warden of S. Thomas' David Ponniah (a former Thomian opening batting star) to pay them many compliments. Danny was the mainstay and had a coach who believed in his job. He was Jerry Woutersz an international cricketer and a team mate of mine at the BRC.
However interference from a section of the old boys from cockpits of yesteryear caused Jerry to walk off.
Jeffrey is now making great inroads but unlike Farveez Maharoof he has not got the publicity he deserves. I would like to ask all of you to open the Cricinfo website choose "Sri Lanka" and give Jeff a ‘like’. I know him as an unassuming cricketer who was always hungry for a ‘chinese roll’.

Readers’ viewpoint
I met Farveez Maharoof at Kumar Sangakkara’s last Test match at the Sara Oval. He was very happy and praised the performances of Wesley’s Jeffrey Vandersay. Vandersay got a lot of publicity when he took a lot of wickets against Pakistan and when he played one-day international for SL. Not fair to state that Jeffrey unlike Farveez has not got the publicity he deserves.
Farveez captained Sri Lanka U19s and was the only Wesleyite to do so. He played a lot of Test/One-day/Indian Premier League cricket so obviously got more publicity. Agree to your comments about Jerry Woutersz. Some even tried to educate Wesley cricket traditions to Jerry. I wonder what those traditions are. LOL.
