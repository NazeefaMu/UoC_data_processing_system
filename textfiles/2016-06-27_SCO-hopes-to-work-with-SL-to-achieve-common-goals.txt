Ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), an inter-governmental grouping of Asian countries, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Li Huilai said his country hoped to work with Sri Lanka to achieve the common goals of all stakeholders.

Sri Lanka is SCO's the first dialogue partner. The Assistant FM told journalists that China would cooperate with the Sri Lankan Government irrespective of the political party holding office.

He met a delegation of 30 media personnel from 18 member states, observer states and dialogue partners of the SCO at the Chinese Foreign Ministry on June 14.

The envoy outlined the achievements of the SCO in the spheres of politics, economic development, cultural exchanges and people to people contacts and was optimistic that the journalists would play a key role in achieving these targets.

The visit was organized by the SCO Good-Neighborly and Friendly Cooperation Committee. Apart from Beijing, the delegation visited Hangzhou and Shanghai.

The SCO said counter terrorism was another objective to be achieved. (Kelum Bamdara)
