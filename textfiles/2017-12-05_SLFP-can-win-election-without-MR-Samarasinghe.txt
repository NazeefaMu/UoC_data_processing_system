There was no need of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to win at the upcoming Local Government (LG) elections, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.

While addressing a media briefing today at the SLFP Head Quarters he said the Joint Opposition had no right even to say that they would not support SLFP at the elections.
“We will definitely win the upcoming LG elections even without the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. More people are gathering with the President Maithripala Sirisena than ever before,” the Minister said.

“It is illegal for the JO to support any other party than the SLFP,” he said.“If they go and work for the victory of another party, that would be against the party Constitution. Therefore, we have to act against them. The door is still open. They can join President Maithripala Sirisena whenever they want and work to strengthen the SLFP,” he said.

“How can the JO members request the people in election campaigns to cast their vote to the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) while sitting in Parliament? SLPP is a political party which is created to destroy the SLFP,” Minister Samarasinghe said.

“We are also using new technologies and we have records and photographs. We will had it documented wherever or whenever any of the JO member ask voters to support the SLPP,” he said.

“Not even at public rallies we will send people even to rural election campaigns of the JO.
“They act like that. If they are attempting to destroy and act against the party it is clearly against the constitution. Therefore they cannot be in the SLFP and they cannot remain in Parliament or Provincial Councils,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
