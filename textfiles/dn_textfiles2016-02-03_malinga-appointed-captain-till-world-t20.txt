Malinga appointed captain till World T20

Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday appointed fast bowler Lasith Malinga as captain of the national Twenty20 team till the end of the ICC World T20 in India in April.
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala said that Malinga has been appointed captain for the bilateral T20 series in India and the Asia Cup in Bangladesh both this month and the World T20 in India in March.
"Angelo Mathews will be the vice-captain and Dinesh Chandimal will be his deputy," said Sumathipala.
"These three people have been given the responsibility to work as brothers and build the national team.
They have a colossal amount of experience and knowledge and ability to build the team," said Sumathipala.
"At the end of the day they have to go to the middle and perform and carry the Sri Lankan flag that is their responsibility. If they don't go as one united single family it is very difficult to perform. We believe the three of them are working tirelessly towards that goal.
"We spoke to the Sports Minister and took a decision that we want to secure the position of national captain for the three T20 series and decided to appoint Malinga for all three," he said.
It was under Malinga's captaincy that Sri Lanka won the World T20 title against India in the final played at Dhaka in 2014.
