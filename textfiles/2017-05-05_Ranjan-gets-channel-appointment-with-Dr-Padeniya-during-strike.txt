Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake alleged that Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anurudda Padeniya had attempted to engage in private practice today despite the GMOA’s 24-hour countrywide strike, but refrained from doing so as the Rr. Ramanayake had exposed his double standard on social media sites,

The Deputy Minister said he made an appointment with Dr. Padeniya on Thursday through e-channelling to consult him on Friday at a private hospital in Colombo.

The deputy minister said he paid Rs. 1,925 through his credit card for the appointment under reference no 14845842. The appointment time given was 4.05 pm today.

Later Mr. Ramanayake had posted the receipt of his appointment on his Facebook page this morning.

During a media conference held yesterday the Deputy Minister received a telephone call from the respective private hospital informing him that the doctor was not coming for channeling.

The Deputy Minister questioned the caller from the hospital about their delay in informing him about cancellation of the appointment. He said the doctor should have informed the public at least a day ahead without inconveniencing the patients as he was well aware of the trade union action he had organized.

“The GMOA President is making money through a major strike led by his own association. GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa recently requested doctors not to engage in private practice during the strike days. I think he has forgotten to make the request from his own association’s president,” Deputy Minister Ramanayake said.

He said he made the appointment to highlight the double standard of the GMOA President and the GMOA’s political agenda, however Dr. Padeniya’s had cancelled his private practice on the strike day as soon as he posted his appointment on the social media.

Further he said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had visited Dr. Padeniya soon after handing over his nominations at the last General Elections and Dr. Padeniya had appreciated Mr. Rajapaksa for contesting the election.

Mr. Ramanayake said that he was not criticizing all doctors, but Dr. Padeniya’s action had exposed the GMOA’s true intention.

However, Minister Ramanayake said Dr. Padeniya had to reimburse his money.

Responding on the matter GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa said that Dr. Padeniya had informed the private hospital authorities that he would not attend patients on the day of the strike, but the hospital authorities had failed to update the channeling web page.
