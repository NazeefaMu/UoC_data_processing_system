I’m not a dual citizen, reiterates Samarasinghe


	

Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday reiterated that he was not a dual-citizenship holder and invited those who make such allegations to request the Foreign Affairs Minister or the Speaker to check who among the 225 MPs hold dual-citizenship certificates.

Responding a question at a news briefing held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Head office, he said even the thought of applying for dual citizenship had never crossed his mind.

“I’m 61 years old now and never in my life ever thought of applying for dual-citizenship. I personally believe it’s immoral for a politician to be a dual citizen because a person has to pledge to uphold the Constitution of another country,” the minister said.

He said he was one of Sri Lankan legislators who continued to defend the country at UNHRC sessions in Geneva by opposing the stance taken on Sri Lanka by other countries including the US.

“If I am a citizen of such a country, how could I have protected Sri Lanka? How can I raise my voice against those countries? I was able to function independently because I had no dual citizenship,” he said adding he was not prepared to betray his motherland. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
