Amana Takaful’s third party insurance brings many benefits


	

In Sri Lanka, it is an essential legal requirement that every motor vehicle on the road be equipped with at least a third party insurance cover. This requires that motor vehicle owners approach an established and reputed insurance company to acquire the necessary documentation. 


Furthermore, as all insurance companies establish branches in towns and city centers it leaves little or no option for the people residing in the suburbs to travel to the city in order to fulfill their insurance requirements. Amana Takaful (ATL), an insurance provider known for its customer centricity has come forward to put an end to this cumbersome practice and has now established over 450 authorized 3rd party agencies island-wide, thus making third party insurance schemes easily 
accessible to all.


Furthermore, unlike existing 3rd party insurance schemes available, ATL’s 3rd party insurance policy comes loaded with the following benefits.


The policy holders are essentially entitled to receive Rs 50,000.00 in case of accidental death, up to Rs. 1500.00 per day up to a maximum of 14 days a year in case of hospitalisation. The insurance scheme releases a sum of Rs 25,000.00 as funeral expenses.


Amana Takaful invites you to make use of these unique and unparalleled benefits of a fully loaded third party insurance scheme that is accessible to all Sri Lankans via its 450 plus 3rd party agents strategically located island-wide.
