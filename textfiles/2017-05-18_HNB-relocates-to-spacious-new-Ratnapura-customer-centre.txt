HNB Deputy General Manager SME Jude Fernando opens the new customer centre together with HNB Assistant General Manager Network Management Nirosh Perera, Kandalanda Tea Factory Partner Chandana Mithsen, Balangoda Plantions MD/CEO Lalith Obeysekera, Additional District Sectary Ratnapura Dayananda Colombagama and HNB Ratnapura Manager Waruna Samarakoon

 

Catering to the rapid growth in commercial and retail banking activity in the area, Sri Lanka’s premier private commercial bank, HNB PLC, officially opened its newly relocated Ratnapura customer centre at No: 9, Senanayake Mawatha, Ratnapura. 
Designed to provide customers a new paradigm in banking convenience, HNB’s state-of-the-art Ratnapura customer centre offers a complete spectrum of banking products and services including automated cheque deposits, real-time transactions and digital account opening facilities. 
Additionally, customers can also benefit from HNB’s extensive range of benefits and advisory services offered under the Priority Circle plan at the newly opened customer centre, which will be open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and weekends 9:00 a.m. to 
1:00 p.m. 
Serving as the chief guest at the event, HNB Deputy General Manager SME Jude Fernando made special mention of the unique relationship HNB had developed with the businesses and retail customers in the town.
“Historically, HNB has long played a dynamic role in enabling economic growth across the Ratnapura area. Since the establishment of our first branch over 43 years ago, we have partnered with a wide variety of businesses, entrepreneurs and SMEs in the region, spanning gems to plantations and it has been a distinct privilege for HNB to have supported these businesses and empowered them to grow from humble beginnings into powerful companies that are even able to compete in international markets.”
Recounting some of the rich history built into the HNB’s presence in the Ratnapura region, Fernando explained how in 1974, HNB’s Ratnapura customer centre began the practice of weekend banking, driven solely through the hard work of the bank manager, who at the time lived in the same premises above the bank branch itself and who would personally accommodate urgent banking needs of customers and businesses in the area, which would thereafter be validated at the start of the work week. 
“Given that Ratnapura serves as a vital hub for regional commerce, HNB, under the visionary leadership of former HNB Chairman Rienzie T. Wijetilleke, had identified the region for special development and that legacy has continued into the present day where we are now able to offer the best, most cutting-edge digital services in the market, complemented by highly personalized service delivery, including our comprehensive Priority Circle service offering,” Fernando elaborated. 
In that context, he also thanked HNB’s loyal customers for their patronage over the years and requested people to make a visit to enjoy the personalized service and unparalleled diverse range of products which only HNB can offer. 
Operating across 252 customer centres islandwide, HNB PLC is Sri Lanka’s largest retail bank. The bank continues to play a vital and energizing role in the Sri Lankan economy and has been declared the best retail bank in the country for nine years to date.
