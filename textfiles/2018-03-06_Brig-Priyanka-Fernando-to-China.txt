Brigadier Priyanka Fernando who was serving as a Defence consultant at the Sri Lankan High Commission in Britain is scheduled to leave for China on a five month course soon, the Army said.

He is going to China to follow a course to better his professional prospects, according to Army spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu who added that Brigadier Fernando had been recommended for this course when he was serving in Britain.

The Army said the Brigadier had expressed willingness to go to China for this course when he met the Army Commander recently.

Brigadier Fernando was recalled by the Army claiming it was for a consultation after he was spotted making a throat slitting gesture towards protesters who thronged the Embassy office in the UK recently. (Indika Ramanayaka)
