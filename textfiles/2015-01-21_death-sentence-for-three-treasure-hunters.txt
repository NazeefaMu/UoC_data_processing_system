Three people who were found guilty of the charge of murdering a 10-year-old child, as a sacrifice before digging for treasure at Balangoda in September 2005, were sentenced to death by Ratnapura High Court Judge Achala Sengappuli.
The three convicts-- Darmaraja Bandara, N.A. Senevirathne and G.M Harischandra  --in a dock statement after death sentence was passed said they were in no way connected to the murder. (Lasantha Niroshana)
