CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao on Thursday appointed Edappadi K Palaniswami as chief minister. The Governor invited him to form the ministry at the earliest.

The governor requested the chief minister-designate to seek the vote confidence of the assembly within 15 days.

His appointment is in acceptance of the "letter of submitted by Palaniswami on Tuesday that he was elected as the leader of the AIADMK+ legislature party at a meeting of the party MLAs held on that day," a Raj Bhavan press note said.
