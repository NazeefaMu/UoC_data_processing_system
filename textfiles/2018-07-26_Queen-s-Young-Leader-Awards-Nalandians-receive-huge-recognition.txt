‘Queen’s Young Leader Awards’.  Nalandians receive huge recognition


	



Nalandians have always been top among the new innovators throughout the world. In proof of this contention a group of Nalandians recently marked another milestone when their achievements were recognised at the ‘Queen’s Young Leader Awards’.   

The group of Nalandians was able to bring pride to Sri Lanka by achieving top awards for excelling at the young scientists Research Tournament held in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia recently. Members in this group competed against participants from 30 countries. The reason behind them being successful is that they have been able to directly address certain burning issues that Sri Lanka is currently faced with.   


Dineru Susiriwardhena, Akila Dulsara and Januka Dharmarathne of year 10 have been able to invent a product which promises the maximum benefits when scraping coconuts.


The Sri Lankan representatives at the competition comprised only Nalandians. The group had to compete against children from affluent countries who enjoy all the facilities. The team from Sri Lanka comprised M.M. Tharindu Deepaloka Munasinghe, Maneesha Pramuditha Rajapaksha, Senith Nimneka Rajapaksha, Ayodya Panchla De Silva, Dinera Susiriwardhena, Akila Dulsara and Januka Dharmarathne.   

Tarindu Deepaloka introduced a special ‘barrel’ to address the garbage problem in Sri Lanka. According to Tharindu mounting fumes, as a result of burning polythene, is a huge contributory factor towards environmental pollution. Anyone using the barrel is capable of burning even 1 kilogram of household polythene without releasing fumes to the air.   

Alerting lifesaving authorities 

Senitha had been thoroughly moved by watching how death comes quickly to people when they sink into rivers while travelling in vehicles. He was troubled by the fact that during such incidents there was no way that a party in trouble could send a message. Senith had been able to introduce a system which gives the opportunity for the party in trouble to send a message to life saving authorities. This message can now be sent at the moment the accident takes place. The new system enables passengers to open up doors and shutters of the vehicle automatically. This action automatically passes the message to the authorities. 

Maneesha Pramuditha Rajapaksha (Year 13), Senith Nimanka Rajapaksha (Year 12) and Ayodhya Panchala De Silva (Year 10) obtained silver medals for their new invention which helps to separate chemicals from drinking water and purity it. This system is capable of separating Trichloromethane or Chlorofoam by using solar power. 



The benefits of this equipment can be obtained by placing it on a household water tank. This is a low cost product and it can even be utilized to purify a small quantity of water. This equipment will help users drink a cup of pure water which is not contaminated with cancerous germs. Dineru Susiriwardhena, Akila Dulsara and Januka Dharmarathne of year 10 have been able to invent a product which promises the maximum benefits when scraping coconuts. Through their finding they have shown that if a coconut is blended at a low speed for a longer time, one can obtain better coconut milk which is full of protein and low in fat.   

It’s noteworthy that Sri Lankans recorded these wins at a time when the Sri Lankan Embassy of Malaysia marked its 60th anniversary.   

Nalanda College Principal Thilak Watthuhewa said that Nalanda College does not make their students focus only on classroom education, but guides them towards extracurricular activities too. He said that the Research Guild of the school deserves the credit for all these achievements.

He also mentioned about the guidance these students received from the Research Guild. He said that he is also indebted to the Ministry of Education and other research persons who rendered enormous support to these students. According to him, Nalandians have  also obtained the ‘Queen’s Young Leader Award’ at the 2017 edition of the event.   

The Research Guild of Nalanda College was commenced by the former principal of the school Ranjith Jayasundera. Upeksha Abesekera is in charge of the guild at present. She has mentored the students who come under her charge.   



Upeksha said, “We started this in 2011 with a specific aim. Each year we take a batch of 50 and get them to pool their ideas. Then we cooperate with the resource persons and direct students for national competitions. 


The Sri Lankan representatives at the competition comprised only Nalandians


Those who are successful in national competitions are selected for international competitions. By now our students have recorded many victories. But these students haven’t been properly recognized and appreciated by the country’s authorities. 

Thus their future isn’t certain. The achievements of the students must be given due recognition. However the principal and the staff of the school have always encouraged these students to take part in international competitions. This is the result of those efforts”.
