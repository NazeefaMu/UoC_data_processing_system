Abolish SAITM: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today urged the government to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) without further delay.
JHU General Secretary and Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka said there was no need to await the Supreme Court ruling and a proper methodology introduced by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to mete out justice to the students who had been enrolled.
He said the students who had the required Z-score should be given proper theoretical and clinical training to become qualified medical practitioners while those with lower qualifications should have the monies paid refunded or they should be assigned to some other positions in the medical field.
The minister said the Neville Fernando Hospital should be acquired by the government and assigned to another state university.
The Moratuwa University hopes to establish a medical faculty. So this hospital could be assigned to it, he told a news conference. This issue cannot be resolved on the road. It can only be resolved with the assistance of the SLMC."
He said about 7,000 medical students and about 5,000 students who had completed the final examinations and undergoing clinical practice had boycotted lectures because of the ongoing crisis and added that they should be given priority.
The minister said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was the main cause of this problem and added that neither Maithripala Sirisena nor Ranil Wickremesinghe nor Neville Fernando were responsible for the SAITM controversy.
It is Mr. Rajapaksa who has to be blamed. When I objected to SAITM in 2012, he asked me to discuss it with the then higher education minister S.B. Dissanayake. We realised that his plan was to launch SAITM and feel the pulse of the people and then launch three other such universities under Basil Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa, he said.
The minister said SLMC Chairman Carlo Fonseka should continue in office at least until this issue was resolved.
When asked whether the JHU raised this matter at the cabinet meeting he said he could not talk about what was discussed at Cabinet meetings.
When asked whether the JHU was opposed all government proposals on this matter, he said they were agreeable to acquiring the Neville Fernando Hospital but were opposed to placing SAITM in the stock market because it was against the good governance to sell education. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Anti Corruption body locked out
	
Officials of the Anti Corruption Committee Secretariat (ACCS) await response from the Prime Ministers Office for further action, as the term of the much debated body that handled major scale corruption cases ceased to exist from Saturday, July 01.
The six-month term of the Secretariat that was renewed for the fifth time since January 01 this year to June 30 by a special Cabinet decision ceased to continue as it had not been validated by another term, which should have been approved in the last Cabinet decision making meeting that met on Tuesday, June 27.
A senior official at the ACCS disclosed to the Daily Mirror yesterday that the office would be closed for both the public and the staff from today onwards as they had no legal provision to continue their duties as usual.
He said several reminders made to the Prime Ministers Office -both verbally and in written- last week about the imminent expiry of the term of the Secretariat, had not raised any concerns so far and they were yet to receive any response.
He said the officials that had been assigned to carry out the duties of the ACCS were actually absorbed from a range of State Departments and offices, where they were expected to report back from today. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

## Title: Banks adopt Basel III capital standards to strengthen resilience

Banks adopt Basel III capital standards to strengthen resilience
Commencing July 1, 2017, the licensed banks in Sri Lanka will adopt the minimum capital standards based on the direction issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in late 2016.
This direction is in line with the Basel III guidelines issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) related to capital, leverage and liquidity in order to strengthen the resilience of banks. 
Strengthening quantity and quality of capital in banks
The Basel III capital standards endeavour to strengthen the quantity and quality of capital in banks through the introduction of capital buffers in addition to the minimum capital requirement as follows:
Capital conservation buffer, which is required to be built during good times to be drawn down in a stressed situation.
Countercyclical capital buffers to curb excessive credit growth and asset bubbles in the
financial system.
Capital buffer for systemically important banks (SIBs) to avoid a systemic risk.
Higher capital requirements for licensed banks
Licensed banks will meet the increased Basel III minimum capital requirements against the risk-weighted assets on a staggered basis in line with the international timeline for full implementation by January 1, 2019 as follows:
Six licensed banks identified as domestic systemically important banks with assets of Rs.500 billion and above, accounting for 71 percent of the banking sector assets will need to enhance their capital from the current 10 percent to 14 percent.
All other licensed banks with assets less than Rs.500 billion from the current 10 percent to 12.5 percent.
Implementation and readiness of banking sector
In 2015, the banks implemented the liquidity coverage ratio in terms of the Banking Act Direction issued under the Basel III liquidity standards. Capital planning processes of banks have been further strengthened to enable banks to be compliant with the stringent rules under Basel III.
Large state banks and private sector banks in Sri Lanka have been augmenting capital through the infusion of fresh capital and retention of profits. 
It is intended that small state-owned banks will be consolidated to further strengthen their capital positions and to grow their balance sheets.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is assessing the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessments compiled by banks reflecting the capital position, risk management and business expansion over the medium term and will continue to monitor the implementation of the Basel III standards in banks. 
The licensed banks in Sri Lanka will meet the requirements of July 1, 2017 and going forward, the banks are expected to further enhance their capital. This is expected to boost the ability of the banking sector to attract funds for expansion at a reduced risk premia benefitting the economy of Sri Lanka. 
Way forward 
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka envisages issuing guidelines to banks on Basel III: Leverage ratio and net stable funding ratio standards in line with the international timelines.

Book review: The truth about cancer,  A timely book in Sinhala
	
Pilikawe Sebe Thathu (The truth about cancer) is a timely book in Sinhala about cancer, the most dreaded killer disease next to AIDS.
In a highly detailed book, two doctors  Dr. Jayantha Balawardhane and Dr. Duminda Handapangoda  cover in non-academic language a general overview of cancer including its history, its causes, types of cancer, types of treatment, as well as an introduction to phenomena such as pre-malignant lesions which if spotted and treated early can prevent the onset of cancer. The book looks into reasons for the common prevalence of cancer today, and methods of prevention. 
In the second part of the book, twenty seven types of cancer are identified. As the general public are not aware what the symptoms of even the most common types of cancer are, the information given in this section will be very useful to readers. The third part details how testing can identify cancers, including relatively simple self-testing which can be done by an individual at home, as well as treatment and medication available, and contains related topics such as if there is any connection between mobile phones and cancer, cancer and sexuality and common misconceptions about cancer.
(The book is an author publication priced at Rs. 900)

## Title: CA Sri Lankas BSc in Applied Accounting Degree marks highest ever intake in 2017

CA Sri Lankas BSc in Applied Accounting Degree marks highest ever intake in 2017
	
The BSc. Applied Accounting Degree offered by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), which has gained much respect and popularity amongst students and employers within a short span of time, recorded the highest ever intake this year, with over 500 students including foreign students following the specialised degree.
Explaining the reasons why the BSc. Applied Accounting Degree has gained such popularity, CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that the institute, which commands a history spanning nearly six decades, has been always the preferred destination for recognized accountancy education in the country.
In 2013, we commenced the degree with an intake of 12 students but within just a few years, the intake has grown to over 500 presently, which is a testimonial to the growing popularity of this qualification. In fact, we achieved the highest intake this year, which reflects a growth of 140 percent over the previous year, he said.
Hundred students who were part of the inaugural intake successfully completed their degree and graduated in November last year. 
According to Wickremasinghe, the high standard and quality of the degree programme is demonstrated by the high level of confidence that the students have in the programme.
This has led us to achieve the highest intake recently. There are many reasons as to why the students prefer this degree  chief among them is the fact that this degree is recognized and supported by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and it is the only degree and professional qualification that is offered by a professional institution, which puts it on par with degrees offered by state universities, he pointed out.
As a result, the students who follow the CA Sri Lanka degree have the same status as state university graduates when it comes to employability. More importantly, the two-year internship offered through this degree programme is part of the programme and one-of-a-kind, adding more value and quality to the entire programme. This internship ensures that the graduates enter the workplace with practical experience and clear insights into demands of the workplace.
CA Sri Lanka School of Accounting and Business Chairman Heshana Kuruppu said that the degree is helping retain talented students in the country, who otherwise would have been forced to go abroad to gain higher academic and professional qualification.
As a leading tertiary education provider, CA Sri Lanka launched this degree to accommodate the students who are unable to get admission into state universities due to lack of seats despite having strong academic records.
Also, the CA Sri Lanka degree programme in applied accounting guarantees employable graduates required by the industry. Our students have the flexibility to seek employment in the public sector as well, since this degree is approved by the UGC, he said.
Encouraged by the increasing interest for the degree, Kuruppu said that the CA Sri Lanka degree school is also looking to expand facilities to a more spacious location.
We are delighted with the swift global recognition being bestowed on the degree. We also intend to extend merit-based scholarships to students in the future. Negotiations are also on with leading international universities to partner with us to provide further options for students pursuing the degree, he said
Kuruppu also added that it was refreshing to see a rising demand for the degree among working executives, as the degree is also offered at a part-time basis.
Apart from recognition from the UGC, the BSc. in Applied Accounting Degree has also been internationally accredited from highly respected accounting organisations such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and CPA Australia, while leading Australian universities such as Deakin and La Trobe offer transfer opportunities to students following the CA Sri Lanka Applied Accounting degree.
Students require passes in three subjects (in any subject stream) at the GCE Advanced Level (Sri Lanka) examination or any foreign qualification equivalent to the GCE Advanced Level Examination in Sri Lanka (Edexcel/Cambridge). Registration is available for students with pending A/L results as well.
Loan facilities have also been arranged for students in order to facilitate fee payments for the course. Further, students from non-commerce streams can enrol for this degree, as prior knowledge of accounting is not a prerequisite, thereby offering great flexibility. The medium of instruction for the programme is English and there are two annual intakes, one in March and another in September.
Students can avail state-of-the-art IT labs together with an experienced faculty to ensure they have access to the best of resources. The panel of lecturers consists of highly-qualified lecturers from state universities who are professors, PhD and doctorate holders in their respective fields. The lectures are conducted on a full-time and part-time basis where classes for the part-time programme are held on weekends to accommodate student needs. Furthermore, the students in their third year are integrated into some of the leading companies in the country for industrial training.
Currently, exemptions for professional qualifications such as CA, CIMA ACCA, SLIATE HNDs and AAT and ACCA are offered. The students also have access to fully-equipped lecture halls, libraries and modern computer labs within the CA Sri Lanka compound and also have access to extra-curricular activities, which form part of the usual university environment.

De Mazenod Scholarship foundation: St. Eugene continues to inspire his children
	
Thirteen undergraduates who received scholarships with the Provincial Superior and other priests of the Oblate of Mary Immaculate (OMI) congregation. (Seated from L to R) Rev. Fr. Ajith Wellington OMI, Rev. Fr. Clement Waidyasekara OMI , Rev. Very Rev. Fr. Irwin Moraes OMI, Provincial Superior of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda OMI, Rev. Fr. Justin Silva OMI, and Angelo Wijewickrama OMI.

The French Revolution and its aftermath left the Church in France in a state of sad disarray and devastation.
France was a shattered society. It was at this hour of terrible tragedy, in order to revitalize the church and bring hope to people living in despair that Eugene De Mazenod founded the Missionaries of Provence in 1816. It was ten years later in 1826, although the new society numbered only a few members, Pope Leo XII approved the Institute with its Constitutions and Rules conferring on it the name  Congregation of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI). 
Eugene, though never a missionary himself, was a true missionary in mind and heart. His missionary zeal made him a unique and outstanding servant of God, committed not only to the proclamation of the Good News but also caring for those in need, especially the poor and the marginalized. His extraordinary missionary zeal made him send missionaries to many countries including Asia  Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was known then and of that time under the British rule. This became one of his first missions. He loved to refer to this tear-drop Island in the Indian Ocean, as the most beautiful island in the World and for the oblate missionaries and for him, the most promising mission. 
Eugene De Mazenod, Bishop of Marseilles, Founder of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate accepted to send his oblates, at the request of Mgr. Bettacchini, who was residing in Jaffna as pro-vicar and co-adjutor of the Vicar Apostolic of Colombo. The first batch of Oblates with Fr. Etienne Semeria as their superior arrived in the island in 1847, and began their missionary activities in the North. Fr. Etienne Semeria later became the first bishop of Jaffna. Since 1847, hundreds of foreign missionaries came from France, Italy, England, Poland, Ireland, Belgium, Canada and the United States. The missionaries were involved not only in parochial ministry but also in administrative and educational activities in the Island. 


"Eugene De Mazenod felt a special commitment to children and youth. This has inspired a group of Oblates headed by Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda OMI, to start the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation

A close look at the history of the Oblates in Sri Lanka reveals how God has been part of the long history and how the mission of Jesus has been at work among the people through the Oblates, the sons of St Eugene. The history of the Oblates in Sri Lanka is the story of a group of persons, who inspired by Jesus Christ, have dedicated their lives totally to his mission by emulating the example and zeal of their founder, St. Eugene. The Oblates missionaries went a long way in sustaining and continuing the great work of St. Joseph Vaz, the apostle of Ceylon. It is undoubtedly the Oblate congregation that has contributed much to the building up of the Sri Lankan Church. 
From the day of his ordination, Eugene De Mazenod felt a special commitment to children and youth. This same love of St. Eugene for children and youth has inspired a group of Oblates headed by Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda OMI, to start the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation, with the noble aim of continuing St. Eugenes love and care for children. The Scholarship Foundation was inaugurated on 21st May 2016, when the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Sri Lanka, celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Foundation of the Congregation, on the feast day of their beloved Founder. This is one way of sharing the joy of the Oblates for the numerous blessings they continue to receive from God. The De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation will be a new sign of missionary activity in Sri Lanka, re-reading and re-energizing the Founders initial inspiration, evangelizare pauperibus misit me, pauperes evangelizantur. 
The vision of the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation is to empower the underprivileged children and youth through education. In view of realizing this vision the Foundation intends to partially fund the students who are eligible but have no financial means to complete their university education.
It was with great joy and anticipation that the Annual Get Together of the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation was held on June 24 at Fatima Church, Maradana. Very Rev. Fr. Irwin Moraes OMI, Provincial Superior of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Sri Lanka, was the Chief Guest .Twenty five students were awarded scholarships. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda OMI, the Founder of the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation, addressed the gathering, sharing his inspiring thoughts. All preparatory and related work was handled by Rev. Frs. Clement Waidyasekara OMI, Justin Silva OMI, Angelo Wijewickrama OMI and Ajith Wellington OMI who together with Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda should be lauded for this committed service towards this worthy cause as they strive to shoulder the enormous responsibility of continuing the mission of Jesus.

GMOA to launch strike from July 5
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has decided to resume its countrywide work stoppage from July 5 urging the government to resolve the SAITM issue.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen De Zoysa told a news conference that they had suspended their trade union action on a request made by President Maithripala Sirisena but however, they were compelled to resume the work stoppage because their demands had not been granted.
He said the SAITM issue had worsened because of the interference of certain ministers.
Dr. De Zoysa said they would take measures to minimize the impact on patients and that they TU action would not cripple the treatment of dengue patients.
The GMOA launched a work stoppage on June 22 bringing the health sector to a standstill. It was called off on June 24 after a discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena.
On June 25 the president's office said in a statement that SAITM had been instructed to suspend enrolling new students until the government issued the gazette notice stipulating the standards to be adopted where private medical education was concerned.
Later that week Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said at a news conference that the Presidents had only held informal discussion with the GMOA.
Meanwhile, Dr. De Zoysa said the final decision on the strike details would be disclosed within 24 hours. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

HNB calls for EGM to obtain shareholder nod for Rs.15bn rights issue to beef up capital
	
Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) is to call for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on July 5 to obtain shareholder approval for a rights issue to raise Rs.15 billion to improve the capital base of the bank in view of the higher capital adequacy requirements set out in the BASEL III accord, a circular issued to the shareholders said.
The bank has proposed to issue 55,995,792 new ordinary voting shares at an issue price of Rs.220 and a further 14,086,436 ordinary non-voting shares at Rs.190 in the proportion of one new share for every six shares held.
At last weeks market close, the HNB ordinary voting share closed at Rs.241.20, up Rs.4.10 or 1.73 percent. The ordinary non-voting share was trading between Rs.190 and Rs.200.
HNB is the second licensed commercial bank to raise capital via a rights issue as Commercial Bank PLC, Sri Lankas biggest private lender by assets, recently raised Rs.10.1 billion through a similar exercise.
Meanwhile, Sampath Bank PLC last week announced a Rs.6.0 billion convertible, subordinated debenture, also in view of the higher capital adequacy requirements under the BASEL III accord, which came into effect on July 1.
Earlier this year, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC raised little over a Rs.2.0 billion via a rights issue for the purpose of partly meeting the Central Banks minimum capital while staying in line with the BASEL III capital adequacy requirements, which will gradually increase on a staggered basis until January 1, 2019, by which time the banks must be in fully compliant.
According to the directive issued by the Central Bank last December, the banks with over Rs.500 billion in assets must have 8.5 percent under Common Equity Tier I, 10 percent under Total Tier I and 14 percent under Total Tier II or total
capital adequacy.
Under BASEL III, the latter two ratios have increased from 5.0 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively.
By March 31, 2017, HNB had a Tier I capital ratio of 10.24 percent and a Tier II capital ratio of 13.85 percent.
As such, immediately upon allotment of shares, the funds raised through the rights issue would result in the improvement in Tier I as well as total capital adequacy ratios of the bank thereby materializing the objective of improving capital, the shareholder circular noted.
HNB also said they expect to fully utilize the rights issue funds within a matter of 12 months from the date of allotment for lending.
During the interim period, the funds shall be invested in treasury bills and treasury bonds, which is expected to yield a return of 10 to 12 percent.
During the January-March quarter, the bank grew its advances book by as much as Rs.30.0 billion.
Nevertheless, the bank said, In case of an unprecedented drop in the demand for credit, the bank is unable to meet the specific objectives within a stipulated time frame, then the funds raised would be invested in government securities until such time the funds are fully on-lent.
As at March 31, 2017, the government held up to a 27.24 percent stake in HNB through the Employees Provident Fund, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited and National Savings Bank.
Harry Jayawardena-controlled Milford Exports Ceylon Limited, Stassen Exports Limited and Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka collectively held a 17.85 percent stake but their voting rights are limited to 10 percent.
The HNB group with little under Rs.950 billion assets reported earnings of Rs.3.8 billion for the January-
March quarter.

Japan PMs party suffers historic defeat in Tokyo poll
	

REUTERS, 2nd JULY, 2017-Prime Minister Shinzo Abes Liberal Democratic Party suffered an historic defeat in an election in the Japanese capital on Sunday, signaling trouble ahead for the premier, who has suffered from slumping support because of a favoritism scandal.
On the surface, the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election was a referendum on Governor Yuriko Koikes year in office, but the dismal showing for Abes party is also a stinging rebuke of his 4-1/2-year-old administration.
Koikes Tokyo Citizens First party and its allies were on track for between 73 to 85 seats in the 127-seat assembly, according to exit polls by NHK public TV.
Later vote counts showed the LDP was certain to post its worst-ever result, winning at most 37 seats compared with 57 before the election, NHK said, while Koikes party and allies were assured a majority. We must recognize this as an historic defeat, former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba was quoted by NHK as saying.
Rather than a victory for Tokyo Citizens First, this is a defeat for the LDP, said Ishiba, who is widely seen as an Abe rival within the ruling party.
Past Tokyo elections have been bellwethers for national trends. A 2009 Tokyo poll in which the LDP won just 38 seats was followed by its defeat in a general election that year, although this time no lower house poll need be held until late 2018.

LankaClear-JCBI partner to establish National Card Scheme in Sri Lanka
	
From left: LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd Chairman Anil Amarasuriya, LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd GM/CEO Channa de Silva, JCB International Senior Vice President  Head of Division III Business Development and Coordination Yuichiro Kadowaki, JCB International Assistant Vice President Business Development and Coordination Yo Sato, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy and Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka Deputy Head of Mission Koji Yagi


LankaClear (Private) Limited (LankaClear), an organisation incorporated in 2002 and owned by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and all licensed commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka, and JCB International Co., Ltd (JCBI), the international operations subsidiary of JCB Co., Ltd (JCB), announced that both parties have entered into a strategic partnership for the establishment of the National Card Scheme (NCS) to introduce the issuance of LankaPay-JCB co-branded cards and to jointly promote the acceptance of such cards with JCBpayment solutions.
By integrating JCB payment solutions to LankaPay participant members and leveraging the planned interconnection between the payment networks of LankaClear and JCB, the LankaPay-JCB co-branded cards issued by LankaClear participant members would be accepted globally via the JCB international network and locally through the LankaClear network.
In addition, the strategic partnership would also facilitate the acceptance of international JCB cards at ATMs and merchants accepting LankaPay-JCB co-branded cards across Sri Lanka. Both parties are targeting to complete the implementation and launch of the issuance and the acceptance of LankaPay-JCB co-branded cards by beginning of 2018.
Through this strategic partnership, the issuance of the LankaPay-JCB co-branded cards would be the first-ever JCB-branded cards issued in the country. The acceptance of the internationally issued JCB-branded cards in Sri Lanka is expected to reach the same level of acceptance as the LankaPay-JCB co-branded cards issued in Sri Lanka.
This would undoubtedly meet the demand of the usage of cards by the increasing number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka, especially those travelling from India, which is the biggest tourist contingent to Sri Lanka, where JCBI is expected to have a large card base in the near future.
LankaClear General Manager and CEO Channa de Silva said, Our quest is to promote cost-effective and efficient electronic transactions with the primary objective of reducing cash-based transactions, thus, reduce the burden on the economy. In this context, NCS is one of the key elements in which we envisage to increase the usage of card-based transaction in the country via our Common Card and Payment Switch (CCAPS).
By conducting a transparent selection process, LankaClear identified JCB as the partner for NCS based on a set of stringent evaluation criteria and subsequently carrying out extensive negotiations from the pool of proposals received from many international card schemes. The primary objective of the selection was to select the partner who would give the best value proposition to this national endeavour.
Launching NCS in partnership with JCB payment solutions would be a significant milestone in the Sri Lankan payment ecosystem to reduce cash usage. I am confident that issuance of LankaPay-JCB co-branded cards by all card issuing organisations and via international acceptance of such cards would strengthen the already established economic relationships and further enhance the exchange of cultural experiences for both nations.
JCBI Senior Vice President Yuichiro Kadowaki said, We are pleased to be selected as the partner for the establishment of NCS and excited to contribute to this national endeavour with our payment solutions. As Sri Lanka is one of the most attractive travel destinations in the world, it is very important for JCB to expand and maintain better acceptance across the country as one of the aspects of the NCS project.
In addition, accompanied with the stable economic growth in Sri Lanka, the number of Sri Lankans travelling outside the country would also bound to grow.

MRI miracle to fight dengue: New larvae introduced by MRI to control dengue
	
Toxorhynchites-splendens or Elephant mosquitoe

Dengue in Sri Lanka has spread rapidly and has turned out to be a severe threat to its people. It is reported that nearly 70,000 cases have been detected so far all over the island and it has reached to a deadly disaster with 210 deaths reported within the first half of 2017. A number of methods to fight dengue have been proposed, the government is also playing an active role but we are yet to find a productive and effective solution to eradicate the dengue killer. In this regard the Medical Research Institute (MRI) with its expertise knowledge has discovered a way to fight back dengue which is increasing at a dangerous rate. 
Matured mosquitoes

It is absolutely commendable that the Entomology Unit of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) has been able to introduce a new larva for tackling the spread of dengue after having gone through a lot of hard work and research procedures. The Medical Research Institute is the premier centre in the country for bio-medical and applied health research. MRI conducts research in diverse areas in the fields of Virology, Bacteriology, Parasitlogy, Rabies, Nutrition, Biochemistry, Histo-Pathology, Hematology, Immunology, Entomology, Molecular Biology, Pharmacology, Mycology, Health Informatics and Animal Studies. MRI is also a major service provider for all hospitals in Sri Lanka with special and specific analytic laboratory tests.

We are delighted to mention that the newly introduced larva called Toxorhynchites splendens is the end result of the dedication, hard work and research conducted with the head of Dr. Sagarika Samarasinghe. She told Daily Mirror that the newly introduced larva was identified in 1911 in the world and used by the different countries to control the spread of dengue with different success 
Dr. Samarasinghe said, The group headed by me started the establishing of Toxorhynchites splendens colony in 2016. This is a tough research and therefore we cant do it overnight. We have released these larvae to the environment several times without publishing about it. We further expect to make measures to get these larvae adapted to the urban areas.

The place where the matured larvae are reared.
Toxorhynchites splendens is around 19mm long and Bluish-white metallic colour with a lifespan of 3 months. They mainly suck honey and plant juice. These larvae do not suck blood as their Proboscis has bent 90. backwards. Therefore, no harm would cause to the humans. Their larva stage lasts for 5 weeks and this may exceed in cold climates. 
These larvae who are in the 4th stage can consume 350-400 dengue larvae during their larvae stage and those who are in the stages of 1, 2 and 3 can consume more than 100. These species are much bigger than the ordinary mosquitoes and they are also called elephant mosquito, or mosquito eater. It is crucial to mention that these larvae are not herbivorous but carnivorous. These mosquitoes lay their eggs when they fly. Hence, they can lay their eggs in places where we cant reach and they can consume dengue larvae in the hidden places. She said. 
In conclusion, Dr. Samarasinghe categorically emphasized not to depend on this method alone as it would not be sufficient to wholly eliminate the dengue killer. Besides, she invited the general public to render their aid in every possible occasion so that this will not be a challenge to put an end to this issue.

Muslim women threaten to take up arms against cow vigilantes
	

(Hindustan Times), 02 July, 2017 - The mob lynching of a Muslim trader in Jharkhands Ramgarh two days ago has sent ripples of anger through the local population with women of the community saying they would pick up arms against self-styled cow protectors. 
The women say they are disillusioned with the police and believe the government is in cahoots with cow vigilantes. A mob of 100 people on Thursday thrashed trader Alimuddin, also known as Asgar Ali, and set his car on fire on the suspicion that he was transporting beef  the latest in a string of similar incidents of cow-related violence. 
Mob justice would be meted with mob-justice, said Mariam Khatun, the wife of the dead trader, as scores of people flooded her modest home to console her. Around her, 70-odd women, many of them associated with local organisations, nodded in agreement.

No decision to keep liquor shops open on Poya Days: Rajapakshe
	
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the government had not taken a decision to keep liquor shops and bars open on Poya Days. He was responding to questions posed to him by the media after calling on the Mahanayake Theras in Kandy yesterday.
He said some ministers made statements in Parliament and that was their right. He said there was no need to talk about keeping liquor shops open on Poya Days as no such decision had been reached.
He said certain dollar-crazy NGOs were harming national reconciliation. Also, he said undue publicity given to such statements by the media had hampered the reconciliation process.
He added, I spoke to the Mahanayake Theras about the conservation of temples as well as the reconciliation process and development of the Budda Sasana. Various NGOs are acting with ulterior motives such as harming the national reconciliation process and national unity. I spoke with the Mahanayake Theras about these things.(J.A.L.Jayasinghe)

Nomination  for  3 LG polls on October 2
	
The Elections Commission would issue the Gazette notification calling for nominations on October 2, 2017 for the elections to the North Central, Sabaragamuwa and the Eastern Provincial Council, an official said yesterday.
The term of all these three Provincial Councils will lapse by October 1.
Accordingly, the Commission has authority to proceed with steps for calling for fresh elections.
Commissions Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya told the Daily Mirror that the pending elections could be postponed only with the Amendment of Article 154 E of the Constitution.
The relevant Article says:
A Provincial Council shall, unless sooner dissolved, continue for a period of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as dissolution of the Council.
The Commission believes that this could not be amended only with a two-thirds majority in Parliament. This is a matter linked with peoples franchise. Therefore, the Commission believes that it would require the approval of people by referendum. However, it has to be determined by the Supreme Court, Mr. Deshapriya said.
The Elections Commission has communicated its position on nomination calling to the representatives of the political parties last week. (Kelum Bandara)
