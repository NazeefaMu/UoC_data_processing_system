Bill of Local Authorities Elections challenged in SC

A Special Determination petition challenging the constitutionality of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill was yesterday filed before the Supreme Court seeking a determination that several clauses of the said Bill are inconsistent with several Articles of the Constitution.
The petition had been filed by Attorney-at-Law Nuwan Ballantudawa through Attorney-at-Law H. M. Thillakarathne and Kanishka Vitharana. The petitioner further sought a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner said the Bill of "Local Authorities Elections (Amendment)" presented to the Parliament and placed on the Order Paper of the Parliament on January 12, 2016.
The Petitioner states the clauses 2, 3, 4,5,6,7 of the Bill are in violation of and are inconsistent with Articles 3, 4, 10, 12(1), 12(2), 14 and other Articles of the Constitution.
The petitioner further stated that clauses 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the said Bill are infringing the franchise of the youth and their rights to contest at the Local Authorities Elections as recognised and secured by section 28 (2)(B) of the present Act.
The petitioner said the Bill paves way and vests with the secretaries of the contesting political parties, absolute and unfettered right to act arbitrarily in nominating and qualifying members to the vacancies of the respective local authorities, by disregarding the order of priority previously specified and declared in the lists of candidates in the respective nomination papers.
The petitioner maintained that, this clause undermines and infringes the sovereignty of the people relating to franchise and freedom of thought and expression.
