Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) ASP C.H. Chandrathilaka told Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya that their officers would be going to India to question T.R. Roy, who is thought to be the mastermind behind the illegal kidney transplant scam that has been taking place in both India and Sri Lanka.

The ASP also requested the Magistrate to postpone the inquiry into the case for another date as DSG Chechnya Gunasekera who conducts the prosecution case was not available for the case as he had been called to Hambanthota for another case.

The ASP also said a team of officers headed by its OIC Neville Silva and IP Ajith Eranga Fernanado were conducting investigations into the kidney donation scam and had already perused over 500 documents with another 600 documents, that were recovered during their investigations, to be scrutinised.

The Magistrate further detained the suspects N. Ramachandran, E.C. Sri Nivas, M. Imtias Khan, Y.S. Chavin Krishna, Ragavel Uppalan, N Christopher and Gopalan till June 22.
