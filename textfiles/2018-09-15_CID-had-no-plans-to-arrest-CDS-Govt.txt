The government said that CID had no plans to arrest Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne as claimed by the media.


“He was only requested to make a statement regarding the allegations against him,” Director General of the Government Information Sudarshana Gunawardena said.


The reports said the arrest was to be made in connection with allegations of the CDS protecting a wanted Navy Officer.
“Some of the print and electronic media, saying that a high ranking figure of a security force is to be arrested, was apparently providing publicity to the opinion of the Opposition that the government was on a mission to hunt war heroes,” state owned Daily News said quoting Mr. Gunawardena.
