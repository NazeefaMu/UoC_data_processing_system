Court refuses to issue notice to 11 Joint Opp. MPs


	

The Colombo Fort Magistrate today refused to issue notice to 11 Joint Opposition Parliamentarians for allegedly disobeying a court order and continuing a protest against the Central Bank Governor near the Regal Cinema.

The police requested the court to issue the MPs’ notice via the Speaker of parliament, stating that the 11 MPs had allegedly disobeyed court order and continued the protest.

Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the court order was not handed over to the protestors by the police as directed by the Criminal Procedure Code, therefore she refused to issue notice.

She also said the police had no obstacles to take actions if something unlawful was reported during the protest.

The Magistrate also directed the court registrar to send letters of advice to media organizations who had falsely published stories stating the court had issued notice to the 11 parliamentarians. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
