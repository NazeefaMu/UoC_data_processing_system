Short Story
Master Sir...

Perera sat at his desk in the office gazing listlessly out of the window, chewing the end of his pen. The “In” tray was piled high while the “Out” tray stared at him devoid of contents. His colleagues too were at their desks, some with legs cocked up, others with a cigarette stuck between their lips, contemplating the tendrils of smoke that formed before they vanished in the air. The younger ones were perched on the desks of the female of the species, disturbing them with their comments and jokes.
This was the humdrum section of the office where the much burdened clerks and those of their category were accommodated with a few rusty fans, walls tearing open their plaster here and there as though yearning for a bit of fresh air like the occupants therein.
In the foreground was the gleaming new storeyed, stream-lined building, replete with air-conditioning, sprawling and spacious where the favoured and privileged ones of the upper rungs worked or idled in luxurious comfort. The contrast was striking like the proximity of Wanathamulla to Cinnamon Gardens. But this was how matters stood in society. Who were they to grumble against such conditions and to what purpose? They could only enviously eye that building and carry on regardless, hoping for a miracle of a transfer from here to there.
Sarath swivelled round in his chair and caught sight of the normally industrious Perera wrapped in thought, his pile of work still intact. It was not like Perera to be caught napping. He was so conscientious, performing his duties to the letter. Perera by his upbringing was one who believed that slackening in work was equivalent to defrauding his employers. Hence his meticulous attention to his work. But today! Sarath chuckled. It was good to see Perera idling. It was a salve to their conscience. After all if Perera was not worked it was something to crow about.
“Here machang!” Sarath called out mischievously “Look over there! Perera Mahattaya too has caught the fever from us. But the look on his face shows he has caught it real hard “Most heads were turned in Perera’s director but he seemed hardly to be aware of it, wrinkles of worry furrowing his broad forehead. A few inquisitive young chaps sauntered over to his table.
“Perera Mahattaya any problem? Can we help you?” As he was much older, they, in deference addressed him as Perera Mahattaya. It took Perera a few moments to realize that he was being spoken to and a look of guilt came over his face as he glanced instinctively at his piled up “In” tray.
As he was of a normally taciturn disposition he had no desire to enlighten them on the subject. Muttering “No, nothing” he meddled with the files in the “In” tray. The youngsters were not going to be put off that easily and were joined by others too who kept on pestering him. Finally he succumbed to their pressure.
“You see every evening after work I go to a private institution for classes in Accountancy. What can we do with this paltry salary we earn here in this position? It’s hardly enough to keep body and soul alive; and unlike most of you I have a family to maintain. Three kids have to be fed, clothed and educated on this pittance. So I thought of bettering my prospects. In two weeks I have to sit for part two of this exam and the boss has turned down my application for leave.”
“But you hardly take leave; he can’t do that to you?” remonstrated one.
“Why can’t he” chimed in another “You know the old saying, if you hold the ladle how can’t you dish out?”
“That is why Perera Mahattaya we have told you not to take your work so seriously.” Interrupted Sarath.” See how relaxed we are! Whether you work seriously or casually you get the same deal. Deaden that miserable conscience of yours Perera Mahattaya; just deaden your conscience. Flat it co....ol like us. He drawled on the word cool pirouetted and broke into song
There’s a long, long way for us to go
Before this tug-o’-war can ever end
When that day will be I don’t know
Master Sir! When can I call you friend?
“You know this is a perennial story. This will go on. No solution.” The songster broke off and continued.” I’m sorry if I sound pessimistic but this system will never change.”
“You see Perera Mahattaya you are always punctual, you never leave till your work is over, everyone including the boss knows you are efficient. But OT was given to the new hand the boss brought in. Here we are slaving but no promotions for us. The new ones get quick promotions. Must have given paga machan!”
“The point is our union is also defunct”
“The boss complains we don’t work. What can he expect when he treats us so shabbily?”
“It’s a shame! Perera Mahattaya, the only thing is to take French Leave”
Thus various comments from Perera’s supportive and sympathetic colleagues
“What! And be kicked out? I can’t afford to lose my job. Still have have to do the exam after having spent so much time and money” rejoined Perera
“But why does he object?”
“He seems to think I’m too ambitious sitting for accountancy exams.”
“There you are! That’s his nature. He blocks people from bettering their prospects. He expects us to slave for him while he reaps the profits.”
“What’s the commotion here, I’d like to know” rang out the stentorian voice of the boss who had entered unnoticed. Sheepishly one by one slid back to their seats and the feet on the desks were by now firmly on the floor. ‘Why aren’t you people in your seats? So this is what you do whiling away your time?” thundered the boss.
“Mr. Perera I’m surprised at you. The most senior man in this department rollicking with these youngsters instead of setting an example.”
“I have an important announcement to make. With effect from today you’ll have a superintendent in your department to oversee your work. He will report to men on the doings here.
“Mm....a spy!” muttered the irrepressible Sarath under his breath.
“And Mr. Perera” the boss continued “as you seem to desire a couple of weeks leave I have brought in Mr. Fernando to replace you in your absence. I will be compelled to make a deduction in your salary to pay him as he is a substitute for you. You are taking leave for your personal benefit. As he is here today I have no objection whatsoever to your taking leave with effect from today.”
