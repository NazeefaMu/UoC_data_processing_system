Alleged dual citizenship gives him a glimmer of hope!
	
A Blue party senior from Galle lost his seat at the last general election. He is said to be among the few Blue seniors who stood by the Compassionate One from the outset and as a result, he received no support from the former strongman who led the Betel leaf election campaign, they say.
Six others who were in the same boat with him found their way to Diyawanna through the National List and this one was left high and dry.
Highly disappointed Blue senior got a glimmer of hope when he heard that a certain fair one who got the better of him on manape was facing the forfeiture of her seat due to her dual citizenship.
The politico is busy these days visiting diplomatic missions in the city in a bid to unearth evidence to unseat his manape rival, they say.

Coming down from Finance to Highways!
	
It is no secret that there is now a tussle going on for the Ministerial portfolios which is typical on the eve of the formation of any government. The most coveted and therefore the most in demand of all portfolios, according to informed sources, is the Finance one.
The first to express his aspiration to hold this key responsibility at a meeting where the Big Two were present was the one who earlier held a high position in the opposition now back in Diyawanna despite losing the electorate he tendered. I have been in politics long enough and there is no purpose for me to function in the opposition at this age. I would like to handle an important subject like Finance now, the senior politico had said. However, his earnest appeal had gone unheeded. He is not likely to get even a part if this portfolio is divided into two, they say.
This stalwarts request that he be appointed the Deputy to the Defense also had failed to get a positive response. Now he is to be assigned the job of looking after the Highways, they say.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who congratulated Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, said today the new government intended to introduce parliamentary oversight committees, a budget office and a new constitution.
He said he believed the new Speaker would use his wide and long experience both as a diplomat and a politician and play the pivotal role as the custodian of parliamentary precepts and traditions in achieving these objectives.
The Prime Minister said the people expected political parties to work together in the new parliament in the greater interests of the country.
He said the Speaker could perform the tasks entrusted to him without too many obstacles because even the civil society was keen on strengthening the committee system.(Kelum Bandara)

A group of disillusioned Betel leaf stalwarts have taken a collective vow not to face the hustings again in their lifetime, they say.
The bearded red firebrand who became a docile follower of the deposed strongman and several others who made their Diyawanna debut in 1989 belong to this group.
A Blue stalwart who contested in Wayamba alongside the deposed strongman, apparently the most disillusioned of this group poured out his heart to several confidants of his.
I will never contest again, he was saying. I would rather get myself ordained a monk. Tell the new Boss to do us justice while he could.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Udaya Gammanpila's speech in parliament was met with protests by some government members when he mentioned an armed struggle.
In his speech to extend his congratulations to new Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, he said the parties had unanimously elected the new Speaker. He said there were attempts to revive federalism in the new parliament to achieve certain objectives which were initially tried through an armed struggle.
Mr. Gammanpila said the armed struggle was defeated militarily and it would not serve the intended purpose if the same were allowed to be achieved through federalism .
He met with voices raised in protest at this moment. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe got up and asked Mr. Gammanpila to stick to the matter at hand rather than talking about an armed struggle which was outside the subject.
Mr. Gammanpila was elected to parliament on United People's Freedom Alliance ( UPFA) ticket. (KB and YP)

The Green party Chief determined to run the administration on the yahapalanaya track has drawn up a list of guidelines for strict compliance by the Green party Diyawanna group.
He briefed the  partys Diyawanna group members on these guidelines the other day and he was in dead earnest, they say.
My advice to those who consider attending funerals, signing at weddings etc. more important than discharging their official functions is: dont accept responsibilities like holding Ministerial office. He added: Those unwilling to participate in the proceedings in the House for eight hours a day are not wanted either!
The Green party Chief had also advised the group members to attend the House dressed in proper attire. He had warned: Dont expect to get the portfolios you ask for. The House will meet for at least three weeks in a row in the first month to pass urgent Bills. Remember dire consequences await those caught playing truant.

zThe Green leader also was in good humour at this lively discussion marked by friendly banter and camaraderie. However, the Green leader is said to have lost his temper over a certain suggestion made by a new Diyawanna member hailing from the home turf of the Compassionate One.
The new Diyawanna member had said: Sir, we should make it a point to keep to ourselves all the Ministries that can generate jobs for our people and distribute the rest among the unity partners.
An angry Green leader had immediately pulled up the new member for making a suggestion that goes against the spirit of yahapalanaya.

This ex-tuition master, a faithful follower of the deposed strongman, held Ministerial office under the Betel leaf regime and now he has been returned to Diyawanna from the Colombo district.
Seeing his colleagues queuing up for portfolios on offer, this worthy also was wavering between two minds about following suit. Things were moving fast and he had no time to lose. However, he had to think of his self-respect. So he decided to go about it the democratic way.
The politico summoned an emergency meeting of the electorate-level party organization and placed the matter before the membership: The new government wants me to accept some important office. So may I accept this invitation so that I will be in a better position to serve you all 
The question he posed was the signal for bedlam to break loose. Some heckled him and some others jeered at him. Go! Go! But dont come back, some of them shouted. Remarks such as Go! We can find another leader There is none here to follow you! were heard above the din.
The former Ministerial one was still trying to make up his mind one way or the other when he left Homagama for Colombo, they say.

House should decide on Executive Presidency: Maithri
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena today entrusted the power to make a final decision on the executive presidency to the members of parliament.
	He assured parliament that the new government would enact electoral reforms, adopt an Asia-centred non-aligned foreign policy and achieve economic development through an environment-friendly, knowledge-based thorough an innovation-driven approach.
	The President said he had been able to set up a national unity government between the two main parties on similar lines of the government formed in South Africa after the end of Apartheid.
	He said it was a departure from a culture of coalition governments between one major party and a few other small parties.
	The President said such a government would have been ideal immediately after the war was over, but it was not to be. He said this government hoped to achieve socio-economic development based on modern trends within the next five years.
	The President said he would seek to incorporate his basic policies presented to people at the January 8 presidential election, with the policies outlined in the manifestos of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG), the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
	He said the introduction of a new electoral system and the abolishing of the preferential voting system would be a priority of this government through the 20th Amendment, presented to the previous parliament, as the launching pad.
	Referring to post-war reconciliation, he said it was up to the members of the legislature to take political decisions and enact measures with the intention of fostering a true Sri Lankan identity .
	The President said it was the duty cast upon the legislators to decide whether the country should persist with the executive presidency or the powers transferred to parliament.
	The President also assured that as Minister of Defence he would protect Sri Lanka's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
	Describing Asia as a key global player in the 21st century, he said the country's strategic geographic location would be harnessed fully for its benefit.
	The President said he would not hesitate to take action against those who abused state resources irrespective of their status of position. This assurance was welcomed by government members who thumped their desks in agreement.
	He said the a economic model based on the teachings of the Buddha would be used as a guideline in the pursuit of economic development. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Ministerial portfolio more alluring than main opposition chair!
	
In an unprecedented development in the countrys Diyawanna history, the members of the main political party that lost the election have been given the option either to throw in their lot with the government or to sit in the opposition.
In this situation the question of picking a suitable member for the main chair in the opposition from among those opting to sit in the opposition has become a hot topic in the Betel leaf circles.
One of the three names for the oppositions main chair now being bandied about is that of the Senior Banda from the hills who lost his seat, they say. The former Madam currently taking a keen interest in the affairs of the Blue party has proposed the name of the former Wayamba provincial chief. However, the Compassionate One has pointed out that the young former Ministerial one from Rajarata is better suited for the post as he is already holding a responsible position in the Blue party. Meanwhile, the deposed strongmans favorite, the Prince from Kalutara is still in the running for the post. However, the three Blue party members now being considered for the main opposition chair are covertly eyeing Ministerial portfolios. In the circumstances, an eleventh hour surprise choice for the post is not ruled out, they say.

	Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera called on authorities to stop hunting army intelligence personnel for the benefit of foreign parties, and protect law abiding Sri Lankan army personnel instead.
	It has come to our notice that international conspirators and those working for many Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) want to portray the law abiding Sri Lankan army as being atrocious killers. Several army intelligence personnel had been arrested without any investigation. All those who were deported and groups who acted against the country in the past are now entering the country again and have begun to raise their heads, the Thera said.
	Those who now speak of good governance would not know the results of their actions until it dawns on them in five or ten years time, he said. As Sri Lankans, we should question why these intelligence personnel are being arrested and for whose benefit it is being done", the thera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Terrorism should be looked at as Common Threat: Karzai
	
Unless the International Community began to see terrorism as a common threat to the very survival of the world, there could not be an end to the chain of extremism, coupled with terrorism, Former President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai said participating as the keynote Speaker at the inaugural session of the Defence Seminar - 2015 at Galadari Hotel.
Mr. Karzai calling Sri Lanka as a country which is very close to his heart predicted that Sri Lanka could be the most beautiful country in the world as it was able to wipe out terrorism from her soil.
Attributing his remarks to the conflict that went out of control in his own country, he opined that terrorism was made possible with different types of backups.
Themed National Security in the Context of Emerging Global Threats, the two-day sessions, Mr. Karzai said that international politics need to be armed with morality if national security of the states are to be defended by eradicating terrorism from the soil of every country in the world.
There are only two options to be free from terrorist menace, either you have to return to the morality of international politics or you have to conduct your internal politics with high degree of morality. There will not be an end to terrorism and extremism as long as we do not look at terrorism as a common threat to the world order. It would not certainly end if some of us would say that it does not affect us. It is a collective urge if we were to get out of it, former President told the gathering drawing parallels from his own experiences in Afghanistan. To end human suffering we have to reach a collective decision by collectively approaching it. Therefore this morality is the tool that could save the countries, particularly the poorer ones from grips of terrorism.
The remaining balance of power should also consult emerging world powers like China, India and Russia, especially when international decision-making is done. Use of religion or ethnicity would not bring violence and terrorism to an end and such practises should not be encouraged. In many countries, terrorism is backed by non-state actors or by other states as a means to serve their own national interests.
The Chief Guest of the day, President Karzai appealed a new redefinition and a moral conduct be introduced to the security interests.
If a country needs to influence another or promote its own interests in the recipient, it will use all means available to do so. In other words, they would fan ethnicity or religion and this is the biggest crime that we would ever do.
He further questioned whether was it morally right to send suicide bombers or bomb another country in its pursuit of its own interests. So if the other option is peace, there should be consultations between USA and its allies, India, China and Russia. It is our prime duty to cut down human suffering. So, the need is there to engage in regular consultations. Otherwise, what is the way forward, the former President asked. (Army.lk)

Indian Deputy National Security Advisor Dr Arvind Gupta said that the ever increasing India - Sri Lanka relations were now on a sound footing and Sri Lanka was a vital component in the periphery as regional development was taking root.
He expressed these views contributing to the Session 1 on the theme Nature of Threats Affecting the National Security of a Nation of the Defence Seminar - 2015 at Colombo Galadari Hotel
Dr Gupta basing his address to the session on five major areas of Role of Economic Powers, Reforms in Security, Terrorism, Fragile Economy and Competition for Resources, added that considering emerging trends, one need to reform the effectiveness of the emerging economic powers.
Similarly, maritime security such as piracy, safety and communication are new facets which we need to look at closely if we were to keep our economies as well as Indian Ocean stable.
Dr Gupta said terrorism still remains a major challenge as young crowds are getting more and more radicalized with the speedily growing cyber space with ample openings for training and added that without ignoring good old methods of terrorism, cross-border unified preparedness and alertness need to be strengthened.
He said crash of stock markets and financial crises were common elsewhere while a lot of economic growth was taking place in Asia.
As development went on water resources have emerged as another challenge. More and more crises could be expected in the future as the need for cooperation was fast growing, he said.
He also underlined the significance of fostering Sri Lanka - India relations further which of course took place with the arrival of Sri Lankas President in India and Prime Minister Modis visit to Sri Lanka.(Army.lk)

Yearning for power grows after tasting it!
	
Many Diyawanna members these days call on the new Big Boss seeking Ministerial office. Some of them happen to be onetime diehard loyalists of the former strongman who had disdainfully turned their back on the new Big Boss in the recent past.
Among the Ministerial hopefuls who called on the new Big Boss recently was a namesake of the former strongman who was returned to Diyawanna from Matara at the recent election. 
This one had first called on the former Madam to seek her support. Later he met the deposed Betel leaf secretarial one and the former opposition chief. They gave a sympathetic hearing to his tale of woe and told him: We too are helpless. You may meet the new Big Boss himself.
So this Ministerial hopeful called at the main office to meet the new Big Boss even without making a prior appointment. He did meet the new Big Boss after cooling his heels seated in a corridor for four hours, they say.
After the exchange of greetings, the Matara politico told the new Big Boss: Sir, I am prepared to extend my co-operation to you. Please reserve a slot for me in the new Cabinet.
The new Big Boss guffawed, but made no reply.
Incidentally, by this time, a kinsman of this politico from the same district had been picked for a key portfolio, they say.
