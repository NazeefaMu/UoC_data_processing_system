Tense situation in Mt. Lavinia


	

Heavy traffic was reported in Mt. Lavinia due to a protest organised by a group of residents and Buddhist monks against the detaining of Rohingya refugees at a house in the area by the UNHRC.

The refugees were taken under the police custody earlier today due to security concerns.

However, they had been brought back to the two-storey house because of the lack of accommodation at the police station. (Rekha Tharangani)
