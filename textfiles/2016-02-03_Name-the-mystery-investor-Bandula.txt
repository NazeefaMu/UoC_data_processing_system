The Joint Opposition today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to direct the PRECIFAC to look into the details of foreign investors including the ‘mystery’ Belgian investor, who had invested billions of USDs in Sri Lankan banks without declaring sources of his/her income.


The President, in a special Gazette notice gave the PRECIFAC (Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges) the authority to obtain information relating to bank accounts and details of asset declaration of suspects.


UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said quoting Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake that foreign investors had invested 1.2 billion USD in Sri Lanka because of the investment friendly atmosphere and that another ‘mystery’ investor would park USD 1 billion USDs to defend Sri Lankan rupee.


“We don’t know who these investors are or the sources of their income whether they are investing black money or LTTE Diaspora money here. As representatives of Parliament, which has the authority to make decisions on funds of the government, we have a right to know who these investors are. Therefore, we request the President to screen these investors under Money Laundering Act,” he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
