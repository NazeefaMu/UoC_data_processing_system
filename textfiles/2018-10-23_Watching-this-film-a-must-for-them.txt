Some school Principals have come under pressure to arrange for their children to watch a certain film produced by a coterie with political interests, they say.

 


A Principal of a school in the Colombo District, excited by an order coming from above, is said to be collecting Rs. 150 from each child to hire a bus to take them to the cinema hall.


Poor parents are reportedly complaining that they cannot afford to show films to their children when they have to make a struggle to give them a square meal a day.
