MR’s absence: Clear sign of Govt’s deal with Rajapaksas


	

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the Government’s deal with the Rajapaksas was clear when former president Mahinda Rajapaksa kept away from yesterday’s voting on the no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.

JVP MP Vijitha Herath said the investigations against the Rajapaksas were going on at snail’s pace because of these deals with the Rajapaksas.

He said Mr. Rajapaksa had not singed the no-confidence motion either.

“Mr. Rajapaksa should have voted against the no-confidence motion but he evaded it just as he did during the vote on the budget. Though he criticizes the actions of the government,” Mr. Herath said.

He said even though Mr. Karunanayake was able to defeat the no-confidence motion, the people would not stop protesting against him.

Mr. Herath said the JVP’s vote in favour of the motion did not mean that it had aligned itself with any other party and that the vote was a protest against the government,which is leading the country into an economic crisis. (Ajith Siriwardana)
