London,(Daily Mail)-   As invitations begin to drop on doormats ahead of the Christmas party season, there is one ‘stiffie’ that only a very select few can hope to receive.  


I can disclose that the Queen and Prince Philip are hosting a dinner party at Windsor Castle next month to celebrate their platinum wedding anniversary.  


Only their closest friends and family members will be invited to the event, which will be held around November 20, when the couple reach the 70th anniversary of their marriage Only their closest friends and family members will be invited to the event, which will be held around November 20, when the couple reach the 70th anniversary of their marriage.  


The party will be the only celebration of the milestone occasion, which no members of the Royal Family have ever previously reached.  


There will be no public festivities, in contrast to their silver, golden and diamond anniversaries, which were marked with national services of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey.
