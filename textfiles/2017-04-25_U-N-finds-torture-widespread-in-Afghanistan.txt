KABUL REUTERS April 24- Torture and mistreatment of detainees by Afghan security forces is as widespread as ever, according to a U.N. report released on Monday, despite promises by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and new laws enacted by the government.   


 At least 39 percent of the conflict-related detainees interviewed by U.N. investigators “gave credible and reliable accounts” of being tortured or experiencing other mistreatment at the hands of Afghan police, intelligence, or military personnel while in custody.    That compares with 35 percent of interviewees who reported such ill treatment in the last U.N. report, released in 2015.    The U.N. report comes as senior Afghan officials prepare to appear before the U.N. Committee Against Torture in Geneva this week to face a review of Afghanistan’s record of implementing anti-torture laws.   
 The International Criminal Court in The Hague is conducting a separate review of torture in Afghanistan.
