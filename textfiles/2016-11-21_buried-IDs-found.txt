About 1050 national and company Identity cards were recovered from Beminiyanwala in Ambalantota this evening while digging the ground in an irrigation reserve with a backhoe, police said.

They said the Identity cards were found packed in a polythene bag and buried in the irrigation reserve land.

Many of the IDs are illegible and the photographs are unrecognisable, but several others can be identified as belonging to residents of the Mamadala, Beminiyanwala, Hanganwagura, Jansagama, and Walawewatte areas in Ambalantota they said. (Sanath Gamage)
