Are they now reluctant to meet face to face?


	


	
	People in our country have made it a practice to invite VIPs to officiate as witnesses at marriage registrations. Parents consider it a great honour and a privilege to have the Head of the State as an official witness at the marriage of their son or daughter.

Despite now being out of office, even the deposed Big Boss continues to receive as many invitations to weddings as the New Big Boss does these days.
Both the new Big Boss and the deposed Big Boss had been invited to two weddings held recently – the bridegroom of one wedding was the son of a former commander of a security force who had also served a stint as the country’s envoy in a foreign country and the bride at the other wedding was the daughter of a sibling of a former Minister.
Only the deposed Big Boss had turned up to sign as the witness at both weddings. Disappointed parents and wedding guests are said to have openly wondered whether the relations between the incumbent and the deposed have grown so bitter that they now avoid face-to-face meetings.
