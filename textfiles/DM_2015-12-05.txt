President misled by Ravi's 6% claim-Dullas
	
UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had even misled President Maithripala Sirisena by making false claims about the 2016 Budget allocations.
Mr. Alahapperuma said the President had in a speech at a school recently said that the government had allocated 6 percent of GDP for education based on the Finance Ministers claims.
The truth is the government has not allocated 6 per cent of GDP for education. It would have been acceptable if the government had said they couldn't allocate 6 percent for next year, but would do so in the coming years. Instead, the government hoodwinked everyone, he said, speaking to the media at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella.
Mr. Alahapperuma said the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera would have been greatly disappointed by the budget as one of the main demands of the National Movement for Social Justice headed by the prelate was the allocation of 6 percent GDP for education.
He added that the SLFP MPs of the joint opposition had voted against the budget as it had violated the basic principles of the SLFP and was based entirely on UNP economic principles. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Abrew's FR petition: Debate continues over instituting criminal proceedings
	
The Counsel for Justice Sarath de Abrew yesterday submitted to the Supreme Court that there was no proper investigation or no sufficient evidence against Justice Sarath de Abrew to institute criminal proceedings against him.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva also submitted the Attorney General had refused to grant an opportunity to the Petitioner for an interview to give material evidences to counter the uncorroborative statement or evidences of the victim and maintained that the charges were incredible and fabricated.
He further said that the materials available did not warrant any charges against him and contended that some influential power had compelled him to initiate criminal proceedings.
He stated in the light of the contradictory positions taken by the victim, an opportunity for an interview should have been given to the petitioner but the Attorney General had not done so.
He maintained that there was no due process followed and the statement of the witnesses of the petitioner was not recorded. He claimed the Attorney General could have succumbed to pressure and his decision was arbitrary and capricious.
Additional Solicitor General Yashantha Gothagoda countered that the Attorney General's Department had not succumbed to any pressure or interference.
He submitted that the complainant's version was tenable to criminal proceedings.
He said the Attorney General acted with the volume of evidences in the affirmative and it was now a part of the domain material as the indictment with the attachments are filed in the High Court as well as in the Magistrates Court.
He justified the decision to initiate the proceedings in the High Court and advised the police to initiate criminal proceedings in the Magistrates Court as well.
He stated that he had to justify the decision of the Attorney General to institute criminal proceedings against the Petitioner and maintained that there had been due and proper process.
The fundamental rights petition was filed by the Supreme Court Judge Sarath de Abrew challenging the decision of the Attorney General and the police to institute criminal proceedings in the Colombo High Court and Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court respectively.
The Bench comprised Chief Justice K.Sripavan, Justices Priyantha Jayawardane and Upaly Abeyrathne. The Court fixed the matter to be resumed on Tuesday (8) at 2.00 pm.
The petitioner cited Mount Lavinia Headquarter Inspector Chanaka Iddamalgoda, Chief Inspector Wanasinghe (CID), CID Director B.R.S.R.Nagahamulla, the IGP, CID OIC Karunathilake, ASP C.W.Wickremaserkera and the Attorney General as Respondents.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva with Uditha Egalahewa PC, Senior Counsel Daya Gamage and Arinda Wijesurendra appeared for the Petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasanatha Kothagoda with Senior State Counsel Yuresha de Silva appeared for the Attorney General. J.C.Weliamuna with Pulasthi Hewamanne appeared for the interest of the victim complainant Nilusha Damayanthi.
The Attorney General has already filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court against Sarath de Abrew for allegedly committing grave sexual abuse on a domestic aide on or around June 26 this year.(S.S.Selvanayagam)

SL in talks with India and Pakistan to bolster military
	
The government is holding discussions with several countries, including India and Pakistan, to strengthen Sri Lanka's military, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene informed Parliament yesterday.
Speaking during the Committee Stage debate on the 2016 Budget, Mr. Wijewardene said India was expected to provide two war ships to Sri Lanka, while talks had already begun with Pakistan to obtain new aircraft for the Air Force.
He said several other countries had also offered assistance to help Sri Lanka's military become on par with other advanced military forces in the world.
Our government is committed to convert the Sri Lankan military into an advanced force, unlike the previous regime which used it to transport sand bags for night races, Mr. Wijewardene said.
We will not undermine the security of this country and we are fully committed to safeguard the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.
He said plans were afoot to introduce a special benefit card system for security forces personnel that would allow them to obtain a number of goods and services at a special rate.
Commenting on the new Defence Headquarters being constructed in Pelawatte, Mr. Wijewardene said the first phase would be completed by January 2017, while the project would be fully completed in 2019.(Yohan Perera)

SL ready to resume Port City project -China
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Sri Lankan Government has expressed its willingness to resume the suspended Colombo Port City Project, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. South Asian Division Counsellor and Director Chen Feng told Sri Lankan journalists visiting China that the Chinese Government welcomed the SL Governments decision to resume the project.
We think the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port are important for the development of Sri Lanka which is a very important part of the Silk Route. China is developing fast and we want our neighbours including Sri Lanka to benefit from this, he said.
Mr. Cheng said the issues with regard to Chinese projects, arising soon after the new government assumed office, had been ironed out and many of these projects had resumed work.
China understands that a new government will re-evaluate projects that were started by the previous government, he said. The purpose is to understand the common prosperity of the region and Sri Lanka is not only an important part of the Maritime Silk Route but also a country with traditional links to China. When asked if he was sure that the new government will allow the Port City Project to resume work, Mr. Chen said the two governments had been in constant contact and that all Chinese projects had gradually resumed work.
We are in close contact with the company and they say the Sri Lankan government is reacting positively. Suspending the project did cause a few problems but they have been resolved and the new government expressed its willingness to continue with the project. We understand that they need some time to clear some procedures, he said.
When asked whether Chinese companies were skeptical of investing in Sri Lanka after the Colombo Port City Project fiasco, Mr. Chen said the Chinese government would encourage firms to invest in Sri Lanka and to look for more opportunities in the Island. He also stressed that improving relations with Sri Lanka had a purely economical motive. We are not here to compete with other regional powers, our interests are economical, Mr. Chen said.(NABEELA HUSSAIN)

SriLankan to bring back stranded pilgrims in Bodh Gaya
	
SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka have arranged a special flight tomorrow to bring back a group of 120 pilgrims who were stranded in the Buddhist holy city of Bodh Gaya (Buddha Gaya) due to the floods in India, a spokesman for the SriLankan Airlines said
The pilgrims had been scheduled to travel by road to Chennai and fly to Colombo, but flooding shut down the Chennai airport, leaving them stranded in Bodh Gaya.
Once again, SriLankan Airlines is responding rapidly to an urgent appeal and fulfilling our duty as the national carrier. Initially we tried to reroute these passengers through Calcutta, but given the situation and the stress these senior citizens are under, we thought it best to operate a special flight direct to Gaya. In the coming days we will expedite the repatriation of other pilgrim groups who are in Southern India as well, using special flights if required. This is an unprecedented national emergency that we must respond to, Captain Suren Ratwatte, CEO of SriLankan Airlines, said.
The Airbus A320 aircraft flown by budget carrier Mihin Lanka is scheduled to arrive in Bodh Gaya tomorrow morning and return to Colombo in the afternoon, with the flight expected to take 3  hours.
Keeping to its famed standards for hospitality, SriLankan has gone to the extent of arranging special vegetarian meals as the passengers are Buddhist pilgrims. Apart from a full complement of cabin crew, several officials from the airlines offices in Colombo would be on board to assist the pilgrims.
SriLankans Flight Operations Department has arranged the necessary permits and overflying clearances rapidly given the nature of the situation.
High Commisioner HE Esala Weerakoon has coordinated matters regarding the pilgrims with the vihare in Gaya where the pilgrims found shelter, and authorities in Bodh Gaya.
