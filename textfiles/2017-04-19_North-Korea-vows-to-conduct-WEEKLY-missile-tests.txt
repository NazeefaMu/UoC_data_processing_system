North Korea has threatened to launch weekly missile tests after US Vice President Mike Pence warned that the ‘era of patience’ with Kim Jong-un is over.


Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-Ryol has ramped up the tension between the two nations by saying: ‘We’ll be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.’


He also said that an ‘all out war’ was a possibility if the US responded by taking military action against Pyongyang.


The secretive state’s deputy U.N. ambassador has also accused Washington of turning the Korean peninsula into ‘the world’s biggest hotspot’ and creating ‘a dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out at any moment.’


Kim In Ryong told a news conference today that U.S.-South Korean military exercises being staged now are the largest-ever ‘aggressive war drill.’ 


He said North Korea’s measures to bolster its nuclear forces are self-defensive ‘to cope with the US vicious nuclear threat and blackmail.’


Before adding that his country ‘is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the US.’ 
The statement of intent comes after Pence, speaking in the perilous Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea, reiterated that ‘all options are on the table’ to deal with the threat posed by Kim Jong-un’s administration.


Pence said President Donald Trump are hopeful that China will now use its ‘extraordinary levers’ to pressure the North to abandon its nuclear and ballistic programme.


This morning he warned Kim Jong-un not to ‘test the resolve’ of the President and insisted any use of nuclear weapons by the secretive state would be met with ‘an overwhelming and effective response’.
