In 1978 the first-past-the-post system was changed to a proportional representation system or PR system. 

  In the PR system you vote for a party, and for the candidate of your choice. Furthermore the PR system increased the division within our people, in addition to main political parties, to candidates within parties, ethno-politics and many other factions.


 Your dislike to the PR system gathered momentum and your voice of dissent to the PR system was heard, and now it is changed to the first- past-the-post system. So, for the first time voter and for many others who voted for the first time after 1978, this is going to be a new experience, as you are going to select the candidate of your choice, not the choice of the party hierarchy.  


 Take this opportunity and exercise you’re voting right and pay homage to our forefathers who convinced our colonial masters that our people are ready to exercise universal adult franchise, and was given this right in 1931 even before India. This will convince the political powers that you are part of all decision making for Sri Lanka and after this, they will make sure to consult you, the voters, when any crucial national decision is taken. 


This local government election is as important as a national election, as it has the power to change the course of an elected government to sit back and change in to a system you aspire to be



Hence, this local government election is as important as a national election, as it has the power to change the course of an elected government to sit back and change in to a system you aspire to be. Furthermore, it will bring balance and checks, as those opposing a government may get power in some local government areas. Hence, as much as the government in power they too will exercise some power to make your aspirations come true.   
This will act as a yardstick for you, when you vote next time in a national election.  


Women have been voting since 1931, however, there participation in decision making on crucial matters, outside their families, is lacking. This system is further improved by increasing the participation of women in this decision making process.   


This is the beauty of this system.   


You may think one vote --your vote -- may not make a huge difference. 


But millions of  ‘one vote’ sure will.
