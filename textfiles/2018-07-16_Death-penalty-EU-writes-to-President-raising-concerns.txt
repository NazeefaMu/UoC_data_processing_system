The delegation of the European Union in Sri Lanka as well as the diplomatic missions of Canada and Norway have written to President Maithripala Sirisena to verify the worrying information in the public domain about the intention of the Sri Lankan government to resume implementing the death penalty after a moratorium of more than 40 years.

These diplomatic missions have made known in their letter that they strongly and unequivocally oppose capital punishment in all circumstances and in all cases.

Issuing a statement, the EU Embassy in Colombo said the death penalty is incompatible with human dignity, does not have any proven deterrent effect, and allows judicial errors to become fatal and irreversible.

The diplomatic missions have requested the President to maintain the moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty and to uphold Sri Lanka's tradition of opposition to capital punishment.

The diplomatic missions that wrote this letter are the delegation of the European Union, the British High Commission, Embassies of France, Germany, Netherlands,Romania, High Commission of Canada and the Norwegian Embassy.
