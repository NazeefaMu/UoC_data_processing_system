THE HINDU, 05th MARCH, 2017- Amid preparations for a leadership overhaul later this year, China on Sunday unambiguously focused on President Xi Jinping’s standing as the “core” leader, to steer the country’s political and economic reforms, which are expected to yield 6.5 per cent growth in 2017.
In his annual work report, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang signalled the consolidation of power under President Xi as a strategic undertaking, as the Communist giant initiates preparation for the 19th Party congress in autumn.


Excluding Mr. Xi and Mr. Li, the remaining five members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, representing the top leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), are expected to be changed.
In his presentation of the annual work report to the National People’s Congress — China’s legislature — Prime Minister Li stressed that following “the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core” was the first among the 17 tasks that China needed to accomplish.

He highlighted that achievement of other goals such as economic development and stable growth had to be coupled with Mr. Xi’s vision, thinking and principles.
