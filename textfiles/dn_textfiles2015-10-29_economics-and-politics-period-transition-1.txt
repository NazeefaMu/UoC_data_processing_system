Economics and politics in period of transition - 1

Sri Lanka is experiencing a period of transition. It is a transition from a crony capitalist dictatorship to a liberal democratic capitalism. The process of change or transition initiated on January 8 and reinforced on August 17 is nothing more than that. To ascribe to it characteristics of a social revolution is a gross exaggeration though politicians are at liberty to identify it as such.
A period of transition is such that the old structures though defeated are still not vanquished and the new ones are still struggling to be born. An inevitable struggle takes place for the defeated strike back with vigour and venom of a snake harmed. The ultimate victory of the new is yet not established. This political factor has to be kept in mind especially when considering economic and political reforms.
The legitimacy for the transition depends on the trust placed by the people in the present administration twice in the course of several months. Obviously that trust is not unconditional or everlasting. The moment this trust wanes off the legitimacy of the government gets eroded.
Unfortunately the importance of economic revival and measures towards its attainment are hardly the subject of public discussion. Still less attention is paid to the relation between politics and economics in any reform process that must be followed.
Burning economic issues
To put it in ordinary parlance two things should be sustainable for the success of the transition. One is the sustainability of the masses at present cost of living or how much further hardships could they endure. People expect better living conditions and not a worsening of them. If the latter happens their trust would be lost giving way to the defeated to come back to the saddle. The other, related the first is the sustainability of the Government. Should it fall the consequences could be a return to crony capitalism and its dictatorial ways. That is why economics cannot be divorced from politics or textbook cures or universal recipes formulated elsewhere, would not suit us.
Both the Government and the people should understand that every inch of ground has to be won in a relentless struggle with the enemy. It was so in the struggle to get the 19th Amendment to the Constitution passed.
It actually deranged the composition of the Constitutional Council. More and far bitter struggles lie ahead despite the consensual nature of the Government. While burning economic issues have to be resolved political expediency too should not be forgotten in doing so.
Most economists agree that a rosy picture of a healthy economy is a luxury we do not possess at the current juncture. Despite all talk of "rapid development" and "miracles" several negative economic factors have crippled our capacities for development. They include among others a debt trap into which we have fallen, huge deficits in the terms of trade and balance of payments and an economy not geared for production.
We live in a highly globalized world and it is necessary for us to take part in the international division of labour. Self-sufficiency is an unsustainable policy though it could be practiced in limited areas under special circumstances. On the other hand as a developing country trying to build its own industries and develop its own agricultural production it needs certain safeguards against the penetration of foreign goods into the local market.
Foreign direct investments
Because of the low savings ratio Sri Lanka lacks adequate capital for investment which compels us to depend on foreign capital. Further we have been unable to draw in foreign direct investments in sufficient quantities and had to borrow foreign capital at commercial rates. This has aggravated the foreign debt and debt servicing takes over 25 percent of export earnings, most of which is earned by the poorest of the poor in our society - domestic slaves in the Middle East and the plantation proletariat. Further our foreign debt to GDP Stands around 60 percent. The meagre and progressively diminishing State revenue also comes mostly from the masses (around 80 %) and not from the rich and the filthy rich that are lightly taxed or not taxed at all.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka has to depend mainly on export revenue as the local market is quite limited. However low productivity of labour makes our goods costly and hence less competitive in the world market. Thus we lose in the world market due to unequal exchange. This makes the development of technology an imperative for our development. Unfortunately we do not spend enough on Research and Development as well as on innovation. Besides we do not possess state of art laboratories for such research.
All these problems call upon policy planners and economists to think out of the box and define a path of economic development that best fits our needs. Production for export without finding a means of bridging the technology gap at least in a selected key industries and services will not be of much use in freeing ourselves from the debt trap. On the other hand the mandatory debt servicing saps our resources.
The increase of the debt/GDP ratio would sooner or later land us in a situation similar to Greece and it would be too late to think of remedies. The donors including the international financial agencies would dictate terms that our people would be unable to agree.
That is why the present government has a do or die task of improving production in the country, generate employment and create wealth. Unless this could be done only a miracle could save it when it has to go before the people.
As far as the donors are also concerned they will not have a friendly government in place that could guarantee their investments unless they help out the present government. Hence the consensual government should seize this opportunity of guaranteeing enough investment for development through selective investment promotion that guarantees sure short and medium term returns unlike showcase projects of the former government.
An important measure in improving the investment funds is to propose a moratorium on debt servicing at least for a period of five years and negotiate a revised re-payment option at the end of the moratorium period.
In the aftermath of the tsunami the donors agreed to such a moratorium. Experience would have already told the donors that such a moratorium and a revised schedule for debt-servicing is still possible and would be in the interest of both parties.
Otherwise it would lead to a situation of debt default. It would give Sri Lanka a breathing space to put its economy in order and embark on a path of fast development without heaping unbearable austerity on the masses who are already finding it difficult to make ends meet, especially with the floating Rupee and the spiralling cost of living.
