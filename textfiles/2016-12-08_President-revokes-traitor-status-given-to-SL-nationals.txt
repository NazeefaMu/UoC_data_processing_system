President Maithripala Sirisena today cancelled Gazette No: 851 issued by English Governor Robert Brownrigg in January 10, 1818 listing 19 Kandyan leaders including Keppetipola Disawe as traitors.

The President declared the 19 leaders who fought for the freedom of the country to be National Heroes.

In a tweet, the President said, “After 198 years, I cleared the names of the Wellassa Heroes including Monarawila Keppetipola,”

Keppetipola Disawe, Kiwlegedara Mohottale, Godagedara Rate Adikaram, Ketakala Mohottaale, Maha Bethmaraale, Kuda Bethmaraale, Polgolla Mohottaale, Watte Kale Mohottaale, Polgahagedara Rehenaraale, Posrewatta Vidane, Yalagombe Mohottaale, Udumadure Mohottaale, Kohukumbure Rateraale, Kohukumbure Walawwe Mohottaale, Butuwe Rateraale, Baginigahawela Rateraala, Mahabadulle Gammane Rateraale, Bulupitiye Mohottaale and Palle Melheyaye Gamethiraale are the 19 Kandyan leaders who were given ‘National Hero’ status on the special order issued by President Sirisena on December 8, 2016,.

The 19 Kandyan leaders were branded traitors by the British Government for spearheading the Uva Wellassa riot in 1818.

On Monday, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe recommended to the President to cancel the gazette which was issued 198 years ago and bestow the title of ‘National Hero’ on the 19 leaders.
