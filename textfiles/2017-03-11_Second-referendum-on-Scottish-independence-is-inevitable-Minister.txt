(Daily Mail, London), 10 March 2017- A second referendum on Scottish independence is ‘inevitable’ Government ministers have revealed.


Downing Street believes that it is only a matter of time until Nicola Sturgeon is granted her wish for a second vote on breaking up the Union.


The Scottish First Minister has continued to issue threats over a second referendum following the UK-wide decision to leave the EU last year.


A minister told the Financial Times: ‘It’s looking inevitable, I don’t think we’re in any position to stop it happening.’ 


While a source close to Theresa May’s team said the only debate over a second referendum would be about ‘the date’.Sources also say that No10 would try to delay the vote until Britain has left the EU.


However, a poll has showed Scots voters split down the middle on the independence issue.
