Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara has issued three restraining orders preventing protests by the Sri Lanka Nurses’ Association, Inter University Bikku Federation (IUBF) and the Student Union of the University of Aesthetics Studies.

The Colombo Magistrate Court issued the orders following a request made by Deputy Solicitor General DSG Janaka Bandara.

Sri Lanka Nurses’ Association was to launch a protest in front of the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine, showing its displeasure of student unions forcibly entering and damaging government properties during a anti- SAITM protest held recently.

Meanwhile, the IUBF and the Student Union of the University of Aesthetics Studies were schedule to stage a protest demanding the release of students arrested during the incident. (Yoshitha Perera)
