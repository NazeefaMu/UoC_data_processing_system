With reference to our article headlined ‘Help Hasini’ appeared on June 22, we have inadvertently stated that the account number (81061255) to help her is at People’s Bank, whereas the account is at the Bank of Ceylon, Hiripitiya.

Hasini’s parents, R.M. Aruna Krishantha Rajapaksha and Thushari Dilhani Jayasundera, are residents in Nikadalupota, Ganewatte.  Their only child - Hasini is suffering from Thalassaemia since childhood and the treatment began when she was just eight months old.  She is registered at the Thalassaemia Centre of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital under Number 470.  

Hasini’s father had been fighting to save his daughter’s life by raising the necessary funds making requests from kind hearted people.  According to the father, the total amount of hospital fee is Rs. 10,900,000 and they have already collected ten million and two hundred thousand rupees but they need another Rs. 700,000 within a week to discharge their daughter from the hospital.
