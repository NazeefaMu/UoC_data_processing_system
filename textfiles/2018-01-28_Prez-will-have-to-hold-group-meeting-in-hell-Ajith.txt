Prez will have to hold group meeting in hell: Ajith


	

UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said today in case President Maithripala Sirisena intended to form a government with 96 MPs of UPFA, he would have to conduct the government’s group meeting only in the Buddhist realm of hell known as Avici.

He made these comments in reply to a point made by the President that those who engaged in corruption and fraud would be condemned to Avici, which is the lowest level of Naraka or the hell realm, according to Buddhist canons.

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Perera pointed out that if this were the case the President himself would be compelled to go to Avici for the conduct of the government’s group meeting if he was able to form a government with 96 members of his own party as he vowed to do, at an election rally held in Ratnapura on Saturday (27).
