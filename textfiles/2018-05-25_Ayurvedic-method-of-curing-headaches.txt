Headaches are one of the most common medical complaints. It would be difficult to find someone who has never had a headache.   


“Headaches should be taken good care of because it might be the sign of a serious underlying issue. This is of course if headaches are frequent.” says Ayurvedic Physician Ranjith Abeywardena, the former Ayurvedic Instructor attached to the Ministry of Tourism and Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau.   


“A headache can occur in any part of the head, in both sides or in just one area or all around the head. Reasons are many for a headache. It usually doesn’t represent one disease, but most probably a pre-symptom of another disease, such as catarrh, migraine, high blood pressure, excessive tiredness, anger, depression, as well as side effects of some medicines, weakness of the eye (constant staring at an object like computer screen), weaknesses of nerves, problems in blood vessels in brain, brain tumor, brain cancer or infections in the ear. High levels of phlegm stored and blocking cavities in the cranium is also responsible for headaches. The patient must know the rhythm, time and should pay close attention to constant severe headaches. When the simple home remedies fail to control a headache one must seek medical assistance.   



 

Home remedies 

 Medicinal steam to ease the pain. Boil Nika leaves, Paavatta leaves, Beli and Dehi (lime) leaves together. It is fine to use one or two ingredients if it is difficult to find all four ingredients. When the hot steam emanates, keep it on the floor and get ready to steam. Your chest and head should be well exposed to this steam. Therefore, sit close to the steaming pot and breathe well, covering yourself with a blanket. Breathe in with the nose and breathe out through the mouth. Breathe deeply. The medicinal combinations of these leaves and the hot steam reduces the pain and relaxes the head. Stored phlegm in your body is also loosened, helping to clear it out easily.   
Ayurvedic concoctions should be taken for constant headaches, by visiting an Ayurvedic doctor. Some patients do make medicines without consulting a doctor.   

  Boil raw ginger and coriander adding eight cups of water. Boil until the water reduces to one cup. Drink half a cup and keep the other half to be consumed later. These medicines are usually taken in the morning, and night. If the first half cup is consumed in the morning, the other half is to be taken at night. If the first one is taken at night, the rest is taken the next morning.   
	 Using raw ginger will loosen phlegm while dry ginger will dry it up. It is not advisable to use dry ginger when suffering from coughs.   
	 Take Beli roots, Babila roots and dry ginger in equal amounts {four kalan (a measuring unit of Ayurveda) 20g of each ingredient – total 12 kalan}, boil adding eight cups of water. Wait until it reduces to one cup, and have it as described above. But add some rock salt (Sahinda lunu) into it before drinking. This medicine will quickly cure the severe headache.   
	 Boil and drink the five ingredients packet (Pas panguwa) or the ten ingredients (dasa panguwa)available in Ayurvedic Medicinal shops and retail shops. Choose a trustworthy shop and a brand since there are many low quality Pas panguwa packets.   
Commenting on the pain killers used in Ayurveda, the doctor said, “Yes there are pain killers in Ayurveda, but due to lack of ingredients available, it is not produced. The permits are required to make those medicines, called “Rasa” medicines. The making of 90% of these medicines has been stopped.   


“We usually do not give priority to pain killers since we treat the root cause of a disease, in Ayurveda. Inhaling medicinal powders and oils are done to relieve headaches with the guidance of an Ayurvedic doctor. Head massages also play an important part in relieving headaches. Pouring oil on the head is yet another method of massage which is known as ‘Shirodhara’.   The medicines used in Ayurveda are 100% natural and free of side effects. The present society does not pay attention to curing a disease for life and enjoy good health, but opt for quick treatments without considering Ayurveda; largely because of the long process of making Ayurvedic medicine, or high costs. By opting for quick treatment the disease worsens in the long-term,” he said.   

 

Avoid these foods

 Frozen food, refrigerated food and drinks  
	 Processed food (such food produce acids in digestion and disturbs the effects of medicine)   
	 If the headache is caused by phlegm, avoid eggs, curd, ice creams and other refrigerated food.   
	 Do not bathe daily; twice during the week is sufficient for patients with phlegm. Avoid evening or night showers.  
	 Do not bathe after a long sleepless night.   
	 Drink warm water as much as possible.   
	 Massage head with a warm water soaked cloth.   
 

“If someone is experiencing frequent headaches and has high blood pressure in the family, and is also suffering from some serious diseases, pay close attention to such headaches. Many headaches can be a sign of an underlying disease in such cases,” the doctor concluded.
