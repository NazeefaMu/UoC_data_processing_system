Their fight against corruption no longer welcome?


	

Two purohitas who were at the vanguard of the anti-corruption movement that brought the yahapalanaya to power have become the targets of a concentrated attack from certain quarters, they say.

 


The purohitas have told their political associates that there is a devious campaign to vilify them and destroy them politically because of their avowed objective to rid national politics of corrupt elements.
Meanwhile, the duo has decided not to support a certain move planned by the government for this month, informed sources say.
