In the wake of extremist attacks in the country, Bangladesh is considering to abandon Islam as its official religion, according to a report in the Daily Mail.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments that challenge Islam's status as an official religion. The debate comes after the deadly attacks by Islamist extremists on people belonging to other religions.

Religious leaders of minority communities are leading the battle in court against Islam. Moreover, US had warned that Islamic State group continues to recruit its fighters from Bangladesh.

Majority of Bangladeshis are Muslims and constitute nearly 90% of the country's population, while Hindus account for 8% and rest includes Buddhists and Christians, Deccan Chronicle said.

Bangladesh was declared as a separate country after its split with Pakistan in the year 1971. In 1988, the country declared Islam as a state religion.
