Serving indictments on Tiran, three others postponed


	

Colombo High Court Judge Kusala Sarojani Weerawardena today postponed the serving of indictments to former MP Tiran Alles and three others to November 2, since the clarification from the Supreme Court over its Interim Order was pending.

The Attorney General had filed indictments in the High Court against four accused for financial fraud amounting to Rs.200 million - including former MP Tiran Alles and former senior LTTE leader Emil Kanthan- alleged to have taken place at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) in 2006.

Earlier, during the Magisterial inquiry, Tiran Alles had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in Supreme Court seeking an order to prevent him from being arrested over the allegations.

Subsequently, the Supreme Court gave an Interim Order on every party to maintain the status-quo until the FR petition is finished. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
