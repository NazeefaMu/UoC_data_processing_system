The Ceylon Workers Congress led by Arumugan Thondaman, which functioned as a constituent party of the UPFA supporting the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is to join the United National Front government sometime next week, UNP sources indicated.

With this proposed joining of the CWC with the UNF, its leader is tipped to be appointed as a Cabinet Minister. Government sources also indicated that a Deputy Minister post is also to be allocated to the CWC.

Mr. Thondaman is likely to meet with the President and the Prime Minister this week and the final decision to join the government is expected to be taken afterwards. (Anjula Maheeka Weerarathne)
