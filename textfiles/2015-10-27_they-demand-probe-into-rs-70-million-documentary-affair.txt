They demand probe into Rs.70 million documentary affair


	


The story about a former high official of a state regulatory body who had to lose his job following the expose that he had misused public funds to the tune of Rs.70 million on the production of a documentary to promote and foster national reconciliation is now in the public domain. 
Some say the scandal would have remained under wraps at least for some time if he had played ball with the new high authorities after the regime change. He had instead ignored a series of instructions that had come from above, they say.
In one instance, he had disregarded a request from a VVIP to set right an injustice done to a certain media outfit. Meanwhile, another high authority had found reason to pass a stricture on him. It was at this stage, the issue relating to the Rs.70 million teledrama had surfaced, they say.
By the way, the scandal relating to the Rs.70 million documentary took a back seat when both this official and his boss who occupied the chair of the same statutory body had to face charges that they had misappropriated public money amounting to Rs.60 million for distributing white clothing among ‘sil’ devotees in the run up to the January 8 Presidential poll. The case in this regard is now pending in courts.
Meanwhile, employees of the statutory body in question are said to be wondering why the law enforcement authorities have so far failed to take action against the official in connection with the documentary affair
