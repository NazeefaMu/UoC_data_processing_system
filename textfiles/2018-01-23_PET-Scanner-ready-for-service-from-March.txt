The long awaited Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner which was purchased by public contribution has arrived in the country, the Kadijah Foundation President and the Fight Cancer Founder Dr. M S H Mohamed said yesterday.

It landed in the country on Sunday at 7 PM via Qatar Airways flight QR 8642.

The High Tech state of the art machine which costs around Rs. 202 million was a “Siemens” brand product of Germany with a capacity of performing over 100 scans per month.

Dr. Mohamed said it would take nearly a month to install the machine and the patients could receive the service from March.
