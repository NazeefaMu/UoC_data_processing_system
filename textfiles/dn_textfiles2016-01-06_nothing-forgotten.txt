Nothing is forgotten!

Saranga Mendis made news in the circles with his tele-drama Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli. How he brought the emotion factor into this action packed story is noteworthy. His unquenchable thirst to learn and experiment in the sphere is remarkable.
Saranga firmly believes a stage drama, tele-drama or film director is not born overnight but as a result of years of dedication towards learning the subject and working with veterans.
This humble human being is related to senior lecturer and playwright Mangala Senanayake, actress Jayani Senanayake and script writer Morris Mendis.
Saranga Mendis spoke his heart out to Daily News on his works and local tele-drama sphere. He disclosed an action-film with his direction is in the offing which is scripted at present. His leisure time is totally devoted to study newest trends in global cinema.
Excerpts of the interview...
Q. You have become a tele-drama director to reckon with. How did you enter this field?
A. After leaving school I studied a two year course in creative arts at Sunera Foundation. Subsequently I worked with Prasanna Vithanage, Nalan Mendis and Harold Wijesinghe. I respect them as my mentors in the field.

Late Harold Wijesinghe taught me the theory side of television. He offered me to work as a co-director in his tele-drama Sihina Wasanthayak with Sunil Costa. This was the turning point on my quest to become a tele-drama director.
I directed the tele-drama Ganga Addara which was followed by Bharyavo and Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli.
Q. Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli was a noteworthy tele-drama.
A. People needed heroes on television. I wrote the script to give it a Robin Hood touch and it paid dividends. Cast comprised mainly of stage drama actors who knew the depth in acting. I tested all my knowhow on Gini Avi. After Dandubasna Manaya best action scenes came in Gini Avi. These were real fights and were more credible. We did 300 episodes.
Still Gini Avi DVDs are being sold in the marketplace and people comment on the web page. Gini Avi redefined local mega tele-drama and made masses ambassadors of this tele-drama.
We proved via Gini Avi the versatility of an actor is much more important than his looks. A segment of viewers who were not tele-drama lovers sat in front of TV to watch Gini Avi. Thus we revolutionized the tele-drama sphere with this tele-drama.
Q. How was the budget allocated for Gini Avi?
A. We sold one episode for 115,000 LKR whereas an episode of Dandubasna Manaya was sold at 350,000LKR decades back.
Thus we worked within a limited budget though the technology is now advanced. It was a challenge for us and we had to counter the competition to have an edge.
Q. Your newest tele-drama is Dedunnai Adarae. It is presented in a completely different manner which reminds us of Indian Soap Operas.
A. We did it with a purpose. At present many TV channels tend to dub Indian tele-dramas in Sinhala and telecast. TV Derana offered me a challenge to do an original Sinhala tele-drama to counter these dubbed versions. Hence I resorted to this presentation style.
A tele-drama director or a film director for that matter should not try to project his/her image via his works. We have to adapt a style best suited for the creation. Yet our philosophy could be one. To do this a director should know his onions. I personally like to differentiate my works and reluctant to languish in one genre or style.
With Dedunnai Adarae we approached the market segment of viewers who have been watching dubbed tele-dramas. Dedunnai Adarae is not made in the Indian mould though. We only benchmarked with technical aspect of Indian tele-dramas and localized that to suit our viewers.
If you take all my tele-dramas you could see they revolve around varied styles of presentation. Prasanna Vithanage once told me presentation style is demanded by the creation itself.
The most important thing is to be sincere to your creation.
Q. Can a tele-drama have cinematic qualities?
A. Tele-drama is different to cinema and we have to bare that in mind. It is a joke that in some award ceremonies awards are presented to tele-dramas which have best cinematic qualities.
If they are the best tele-dramas households must watch them since they are shown in your drawing room unlike cinema. But it doesn't happen. Why is that?
Take India for an example. They have clearly separated the two spheres. They have cinemas that provide light entertainment as well as art house productions. They treat tele-drama field differently.

Q. Many actors starred in Gini Avi are cast in Dedunnai Adarae too.
A. Yes. That itself shows the prowess of those actors. They can adapt to any character with ease. Athula Jayasinghe is one good example. We have shown the viewers an actor should be able to do any character coming his way credibly. Many actors in our country cannot perform. Their performances are not credible and not felt by viewers. This is one major reason people resort to watching Indian tele-dramas. Viewers value acting over glamour.
Q. How is the dedication of new actors in the local tele-drama field?
A. Dedication of many popular actors is zero I should say. But who come from stage drama sphere have the dedication and discipline. I mostly work with them. They explore for new opportunities because they have studied the subject and they are eager to confront challenges. Acting is a subject that can make you a Professor.
Many new actors and actresses seek instant popularity. They think this is a hobby. This is a profession and one should respect it. We are in a lucrative industry.
Q. What is in store for you in 2016?
A. I hope to venture into cinema. Digitalization of local cinema is our hope.
My first cinema will be one like Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli or a sequel. Presently we are working on the script.
