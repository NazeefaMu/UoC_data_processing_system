Abolishing SAITM: GMOA tells Govt to inform SC of its stance


	

The GMOA says Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should inform the Supreme Court the Government’s decision on abolishing SAITM when the court takes up the case tomorrow.

Earlier the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had appealed to the Supreme Court against a Court of Appeal ruling that two MBBS graduates who passed out of SAITM be provisionally registered.

The SC is to take up the appeal filed by the SLMC today and a ruling given on it.

GMOA's Assistant Secretary Navin de Zoysa said they had told the Harsha de Silva Committee that the Health Minister should convey its stance to the Supreme Court.

He said the GMOA would resort to trade union action if the minister failed to do so. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)
