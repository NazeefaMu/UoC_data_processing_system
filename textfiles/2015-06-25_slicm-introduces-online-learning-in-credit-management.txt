Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management (SLICM) is a professional body enacted by an Act of Parliament with the mandate to offer education and training related to credit to Sri Lankan corporate entities. 
It has been successfully running its signature programme, the Advanced Professional Diploma in Credit Management for years and this qualification is a stepping stone for candidates to become an Associate Member of SLICM which is a title highly respected in the financial services and banking industry. 
SLICM stated that it is offering the Advanced Professional Diploma in Credit Management through a state-of-the-art online learning platform, All Asia Institute (www.allasiainstitute.com). Candidates will be able to create an individual profile enrolling as a student. The platform contains modules for each programme and each module has lessons which are available in video format. The video will showcase the lecturer on one side of the screen and the transition of the slides on the other end of the screen. This enables the student to follow the lesson along with the lesson notes which are made available on a PDF format. 
Speaking about the launch of the new online programme Nalin Wijekoon, Chairman Finance Houses Association (FHA), Council member of SLICM and the CEO of Softlogic Finance said, “Sound knowledge in credit is compulsory for the industries focused on lending. The signature Advanced Diploma of SLICM covers all the key aspects of credit which is required by the industry. Enabling distance learning through an online platform makes the programme more accessible to the staff who are involved in credit.”
All Asia Institute is a product of Asia International Academy which is the study centre for SLICM programmes. Speaking about the online learning platform, R. Muralidharan, Chairman of Asian International Academy said “Our academy provides an equal opportunity for students to learn irrespectively of which part of the country or which part of the world a student is from, believing in education accessibility to all. The platform has been created after studying a variety of distance learning models and technologies. Students are able to obtain an experience similar to what they would receive in the class room by using the online learning techniques of All Asia Institute platform. For instance, it has multiple choice questions to test the knowledge of a student after completing a particular lesson, a platform to interact with fellow students, facilities to take your own notes which can be stored for future use and more.”
Jithendra Gunatilake, Council member of SLICM and DGM / Head of Finance Operations of LOLC emphasizes on the unique benefits of offering the Advanced Diploma online. “The growth for the industry is outside the western province, hence the training requirement too. With the introduction of the online learning mode, students from around the country benefit from a top end faculty which is usually available to student within the Colombo metropolitan area only.”
