Machang, no time to respond to every inaccurate news: Keshap


	

Outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap, in response to a blogger on the Daily Mirror article on the Ambassador’s meeting with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said if they responded to every inaccurate news story that appears, they would have little time for anything else.

Tweeting the Daily Mirror article which said US was not in favour of Gotabaya Rajapaksa becoming President, the blogger asked the Ambassador "Machang, Atul, you guys couldn't stop a reality TV show host from becoming your president. Maybe get your own house in order before you dictate terms to everyone else, noh?”

Ambassador Keshap replied “Machang, if we responded to every inaccurate news story that appears, we would have little time for anything else,”.

An article about the Keshap-Rajapaksa meeting had initially appeared on Tamil daily Kaalaikkathir which said Ambassador Keshap had reportedly said the US and the Western did not welcome the prospects of Gotabaya Rajapaksa contesting and becoming the President of Sri Lanka.

However, when the Daily Mirror inquired about the meeting from the Embassy earlier, the Embassy remained non-committal.

“The Ambassador meets routinely with political leaders, civil society and community leaders. The Ambassador honours the confidence of private meetings and does not discuss the contents of such meetings publicly,” it said.

Earlier, the media unit of former President Rajapaksa said false reports were circulating over the meeting held with Ambassador Keshap.

“The contents of the cordial discussion held between Mr. Rajapaksa and the Ambassador had been altered in the media reports. We have not issued any official statement over the meeting and we are not responsible for any of these false reports,” the media unit said.
