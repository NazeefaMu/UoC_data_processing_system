They ran helter-skelter for safety in nightwear


	



 

A group of politicos from the West on a visit to the North recently had to suffer a terrible scare when they got an alarm over the phone in the midnight that a fire was raging on the 5th floor of the hotel they had checked in to.

 


Panicked by the alarm, the politicos had rushed out of the hotel in their nightwear and run for their life in different directions. 


The politicos had realized only later that they had been misled by a false alarm given by some prankster. Their relief from fear had later given to an anger for being taken for a ride. 


It had come to light later that some members of their own group had set off the false alarm and they had even videoed their frightened colleagues fleeing in their nightwear for their life!
