ComBank introduces ‘e’ passbook on mobile phone


	

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has broken new ground in technology-enabled convenience by becoming the first bank in Sri Lanka to offer customers an e-Passbook that provides access to details of savings, current, NRFC and RFC accounts on Android and iOS powered mobile devices.


A breakthrough digital virtual mobile application offered free by the country’s largest private bank enables account holders to have a real-time view of transactions of the past 30 days on their mobile phones or tabs anytime, anywhere.


The app, which updates automatically whenever the user is online, also stores the last view of the e-Passbook on the user’s mobile device, making it possible to view it even when the phone or tab is offline, the Bank said.


 “This is one of the most exciting new developments in our technology offering,” Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said. “Our team is constantly looking to push the boundaries of what is possible in our search to offer the ultimate in convenience to customers. This app is a great example of the Bank’s capabilities in, and commitment to, technology-enabled banking.” He added that once the e-passbook is downloaded and the access code is set, checking an account is as easy as tapping on the phone screen.


The e-Passbook is able to display account history as in a standard savings passbook or a current account statement. It offers users real-time tracking of account transactions of the last 30 days, and can be used as a single repository for multiple accounts enrolled by an account holder for the facility, with the capability to view each account separately.


Users may label different accounts with preferred names or codes for easy reference. The e-Passbook app offers the user the flexibility of operating with or without a log-in password. 


Any existing personal savings, NRFC, RFC or current account holder of Commercial Bank who has a valid mobile number registered with the Bank may activate the e-Passbook facility by calling a branch, by calling the e Banking Call Centre on 011 2353576 or by visiting a branch, the Bank said. New customers who open personal savings, current, NRFC or RFC accounts can also request the facility which will be provided at the time of opening the account.


Joint Account holders too could obtain the e-Passbook facility after submitting the written consent of all parties, the Bank said.


Besides the new e-Passbook facility, Commercial Bank also offers mobile phone users the convenience of accessing many of its services via the Bank’s own sophisticated app for users of Apple or Android-powered smart devices.


Offering both on and off line functionality, the App which can be downloaded free of charge, enables users to conduct a wide range of transactions and view key information on their mobile phones 24 hours of the day.


Among the online features are a dashboard view for account inquiry and bank notifications sent via secure messages, credit card balance inquiry, bill settlement, current cycle of transactions and online payment history, inquiries on investments and loans, payments and online payment history,  transfer of funds between own and registered accounts with online transfer history, and password changes.
The offline menu of the Mobile Banking App provides locations of Commercial Bank branches and ATMs, exchange and interest rates, general notices, a ‘Help’ feature and the ‘Contact us’ option. 


The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for five consecutive years, Commercial Bank operates a network of 250 branches and 625 ATMs in Sri Lanka, the largest electronic cash dispensing facility owned by a single bank in the country. The Bank was ranked the most valuable private sector brand in Sri Lanka in 2014 and has also won multiple awards as Sri Lanka’s best bank from a number of international publications over several years. The Bank was adjudged one of Sri Lanka’s 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in 2013 and 2014.


Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 18 branches and Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon. In September 2015, the Bank received regulatory approval for the establishment of a fully-fledged Tier I Bank in the Republic of Maldives. The Bank also received license to operate a fully owned Money Transfer Operation in Italy recently.
