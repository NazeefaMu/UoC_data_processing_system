Ayurvedic physician Chitra Wickramarachchi says that untreated phlegm can develop to a cancer

Hailing from the Nawagamu Weda generation, ayurvedic doctor Chitra Wickramarachchi cures complicated diseases. She started memorizing the ancient medicinal inscriptions given to her by her grandmother every morning when she was 7 years old. She successfully completed her studies and was employed before getting married. Soon after her marriage, her husband encouraged her to continue with the ‘Wedakama’ (Treating of patients) which is known as Ayurveda (alternative medicine).   

Dr. Wickramarachchi had treated patients without possessing a certificate from the Ayurvedic Council for 15 years. However she finally received her certificate to officially practice Ayurveda from the Navinna Ayurveda Council. She had cured more than 40,000 patients even before she received her Ayurvedic certificate.   
She is the mother of three daughters. One of them Piyumi Wickramarachchi has already started her studies in Ayurvedic medicine and helps her mother when the latter treats patients.   


(More information about this method of alternative medicine can be obtained by visiting Ayurvedic Dr. Chitra Chandani Wickramarachchi at 345, Siddhadi Weda Medura, Nagara Seema Mawatha, Athurugiriya Road, Homagama or by calling 0713464276 0759061771. She can be reached via electronic mail on siddhadiwedamedura@gmail.com)


Dr. Wickramarachchi has a trained staff engaged in preparing medications; including dry balls, concoctions, medicinal oils and all types of medicine that’s prescribed for patients. She has a vast supply of raw herbs that are stored in large barrels for future use. Even if many Ayurvedic and traditional indigenous doctors view the process of finding herbs and medicines arduous, she affirms that it easy to collect genuine medicine through familiar suppliers.   

Produces her own oils and powders   



Medicine making, packaging and storing takes place from morning till night under the strict supervision of Dr. Wickramarachchi, at her residence. They have user-friendly concoctions that are already made and stored in glass bottles which are later refrigerated. Dr. Wickramarachchi has her own oil productions and powders that are used to treat arthritis, cholesterol, lack of hair growth and numerous other ailments and for general well-being.   
“Diabetes and bypass patients can be treated within six months, but arthritis is one of most difficult to cure diseases with Rheumatoid Arthritis being the hardest to treat. Cancer is also curable. Fatty liver is cured within a month,” she said.

According to her, gastritis has become the most common disease. Most of her patients suffer from this ailment.   

Dr. Wickramarachchi takes the full use of western medicinal practices such as blood tests, scans, and other numerous tests. The doctor states that she does this for the benefit of patients because it helps her to recognize and analyze diseases before starting treatment. She said that she uses such practices to make Ayurvedic treatment more efficient.   

Emphasizing on the importance of the timely treatment of phlegm, Dr. Wickramarachchi said that phlegm is the leading cause that invites a number of diseases to the body. “ Untreated phlegm accumulates in the human body and grows to be a giant calcified component which eventually develops cancer. Therefore, cancer patients should never have leafy greens like ‘Kathuru murunga’ and ‘Wel penela’ which are high in calcium,” she noted.   



She treats patients between 9. 00 am and 6.00 pm, except on Fridays and full moon poya days.   

 

Dr. Wickramarachchi strictly advised Arthritic patients to consume only warm water when washing themselves or taking a shower. She also advised these patients to avoid food that is considered to arouse ‘Waatha’ in the body. She also instructed cancer patients to avoid oils and using coconut milk in their cooking. Gastritis patients are advised to keep their ‘tummy fires’ under control and warned to avoid highly acidic food.   

Dr. Wickramarachchi is skilled in ‘Rasa Wedakama’, a system of treatment which incorporates mixing ashes of gold, silver, and mercury. She treats patients between 9. 00 am and 6.00 pm, except on Fridays and full moon poya days.
