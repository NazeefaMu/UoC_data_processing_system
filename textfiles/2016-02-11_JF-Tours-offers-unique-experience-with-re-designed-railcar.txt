Viceroy Luxury Steam Train fame JF Tours has re-designed the T1 railcar (Diesel Deluxe), manufactured by the English Electric Co.UK in order to offer one-of-a-kind rail ride with luxury comforts.

 
The rustic railcar, which was in passenger service between 1947 and 1970, is now elegantly restored including air-conditioning to put back on rails with modern standards for convenience expected by today’s travelers. Booking of the entire railcar is offered, which is also more cost-effective than using a longer train. It has seating for 32 with tables to support food and drinks and also features a modern kitchenette equipped for preparation of food with trained and uniformed stewards in attendance. 


Other accommodations include sanitary facilities, Wi-Fi PA system and phone/laptop charging. This unit can be chartered by family groups and corporates for their outgoings. JF Tours delivers unparalleled quality and service to customers to experience enjoyable railway journeys in the island where every route is scenic, whether it is Southern Coastal line, the East Coast Regions or ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. 


In the hill country mainline, the railcar travels up to Rambukkana, facilitating the popular day excursion to the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage.
