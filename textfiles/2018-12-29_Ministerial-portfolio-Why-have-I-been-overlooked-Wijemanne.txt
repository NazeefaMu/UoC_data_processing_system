Ministerial portfolio - Why have I been overlooked: Wijemanne


	

UNP Kalutara District MP Lakshman Wijemanne said yesterday said he would take a serious political decision if he was not given a ministerial portfolio.

He said it was unfair for UNPers like himself not to be given a ministerial portfolio. “We have never left the party at times of trouble and defended both the party and the leadership and therefore it is unfair not to be given a ministry,” he told Daily Mirror.

“Ministerial portfolios have been given to some who are junior to me. I asked the party leadership why they were given ministries leaving me out. They said it was done based on their performance. I don’t understand what was meant by performance as those who were appointed as ministers have shouted in Parliament while I have managed to bring in more votes than they have done. I have been with the UNP from the time of President J. R. Jayewardene." he added.

The MP said he would take a political decision which will be felt by the whole world. “However, I am not going to reveal what I am going to do just yet,” he said.

Mr. Wijemanne was the second UNP MP to demand a ministerial portfolio while former Minister Palitha Range Bandara also expressed his displeasure at being overlooked. (Yohan Perera)
