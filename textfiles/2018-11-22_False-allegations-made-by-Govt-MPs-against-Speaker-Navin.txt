False allegations made by Govt. MPs against Speaker: Navin


	

UNP National Organizer Navin Dissanayake yesterday charged that false allegations were being made by the Government MPs against him saying he was unduly influencing Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to make certain decisions.

Mr Dissanayake, who is the son-in-law of Speaker Jayasuriya, told a media briefing that no Member of Parliament could influence the Speaker.

“My politics and the politics of the Speaker are different. You may recall that Mr Jayasuriya joined the Government of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and then came back to UNP but I did not follow him during that time,” Mr Dissanayake said.

“They say I am getting Mr Jayasuriya to promote me as the next leader of UNP but this is totally false,” he added.

Also, he said that he had informed the Mahanayake Theras that the common candidate, who they were going to field at the next Presidential Election, would be from the UNP. (Yohan Perera)
