 Expert financial planner NDB Wealth has introduced its innovative ‘Money Plus’ account, an attractive alternative to savings accounts, as part of its all-new wealth planning solutions range. 
The Money Plus account offers customers much higher rates in comparison to regular savings accounts, with an added unique feature of this innovative new product from NDB Wealth being that income is credited daily so one can see his/her savings grow day-by-day.
Additionally, Money Plus allows a customer the flexibility of depositing and withdrawing cash at any time, with no penalties. Also, the income earned from the Money Plus account is tax-free in the hands of the customers. NDB Wealth offers even more convenience for Money Plus customers via its ‘at your doorstep’ service and new state-of-the-art, fully-secure website. 
“Money Plus is simply more than banking,” opined NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera.
However, most important of all, what is truly remarkable about NDB Wealth’s Money Plus account is its earnings potential, with the current yield at 7 percent, which is much higher than savings accounts. 
Commenting further, Samarasekera added, “Most clients start with a basic savings product like the Money Plus and later go on to build more sophisticated plans, with the expertise and advice of the NDB Wealth team of relationship managers. These plans can include building a fund to educate your kids or provide for retirement savings. We can even plan for a retirement income fund, which pays clients a regular income during retirement, or create a facility to enable continuous charitable giving. No matter your plan, ‘It’s Time’ to take it forward and truly invest in your own life.”
