An amateur metal detectorist in the UK has made an extraordinary find-a gold-carved ring depicting a nude portrait of Cupid, mythological homewrecker and god of erotic love.
The ring contains a dark onyx and blue engraved nicolo stone, and may once have rested on the finger of a man or woman during the reign of the Roman Empire.
Cupid is also known by his Greek name, Eros, and can be identified in the 1,700-year-old engraving by his short wings.
He leans naked against a spiral column, legs crossed and carrying a torch in one hand.
Discovered near the village of Tangley, the ring is now in the hands of the Hampshire Museums Service and will be put on display at the Andover Museum.
According to Fox Science, who quotes Roman philosopher Apuleius, Cupid was known for 'running at night here and there through homes that are not his own, corrupting marriages through indiscriminate seductions, authoring outrages on an enormous scale-and getting away with it all.'
Images of the frisky god were popular among the Greeks and Romans, and this particular design is characteristic of the fourth century A.D.
The ring was discovered in 2013 and turned in to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, an organisation that was established in 1997 to facilitate reports of artifact discoveries by amateur metal detectorists.
While amateurs are allowed to search for antiques with metal detectors, so long as they remain outside of protected areas, it is required that certain finds be reported to the antiquities authorities.
Writings about Cupid dating back to the second century A.D. and describe him as mischievously seductive, wielding torches, a quiver, a bow and arrows.
He was commonly naked, and any woman pricked by his arrow would fall deeply in love with him.
The story by Apuleius tells of Cupid's love interest, Psyche, who is human and becomes impregnated by the god. Rejected by Cupid's mother, Venus, Psyche takes on impossible tasks to eventually be made immortal.
Artistic depictions of the lovers can be seen dating back 2,500 years.
Sally Worrell, national finds adviser with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, and John Pearce, senior lecturer in archaeology at King's College in London have written about the ring in an article published recently in the journal Britannia -Daily Mail
CUPID, SON OF VENUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL HOMEWRECKER
Tales of Cupid date back to the second century A.D, and tell of his mischievous sexual adventures.
Cupid was commonly naked, to the distaste of his mother, Venus, and was often pictured holding a torch or a bow and arrow.
A story by Apuleius tells of Cupid and his love interest, Psyche, who is deemed unworthy by Venus.
Artistic depictions of the lovers can be seen dating back 2,500 years.
During the Renaissance, Cupid morphed into the cherub-like image that is widely known today.
