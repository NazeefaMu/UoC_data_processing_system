Fury of a woman scorned


	



 

Two Diyawanna members – an Adam and an Eve - are in the habit of breathing fire at each other whenever they come face to face these days.

 


The root cause for the bad blood between the two is traced to the incident where the fair one was hooted at when she visited an area affected by the flooding of Kelani River recently. 


The fair one had been blaming the Diyawanna colleague for being the author of this incident which caused her loss of face.


During a heated exchange, the fair one had accused the male counterpart of staging the ‘boo protest’ in a bid to defame her and increase his vote base. 


Vehemently protesting his innocence, the Diyawanna member had said that he had nothing to do with that incident. “What am I to do if people on their own decide to boo at you?”


She had replied: “I have no intention of contesting again. So there is no cause for you to worry about your ‘manape’ vote any longer.”
