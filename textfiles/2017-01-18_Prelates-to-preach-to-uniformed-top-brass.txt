Prelates to preach to uniformed top brass


	



 

The prelates of the two leading Buddhist temples in Kandy have received several complaints against the uniformed top brass regarding the ‘shabby treatment’ meted out to the monks who spearheaded the recent protest in Hambantota. 

 


A video footage showing a uniformed bigwig issuing specific instructions as to how the monks participating in the protest should be handled had accompanied one of these complaints. The highly perturbed prelates had later brought this matter to attention of the highest echelons in yahapalanaya.
Meanwhile, the two prelates have decided to summon the uniformed bigwig to Kandy to tell him how the uniformed ones should treat the Maha Sangha, they say.
