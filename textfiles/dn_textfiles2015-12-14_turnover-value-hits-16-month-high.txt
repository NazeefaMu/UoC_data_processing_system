Point of view
Significant foreign activity dominated market turnover this week, boosting turnover value to a ~16-month high. TPG Growth III SF Pte Ltd acquired 27.87% of Asiri Hospital Holdings from Actis Investments Holdings SL Ltd, dominating the week’s turnover.
The transaction (LKR 7.6bn) which accounted for approximately 94.2% of the day’s turnover helped push daily average turnover value to LKR 2.32bn and the Y-T-D average to LKR 1.09bn (cf. LKR 1.06bn last week).
The significant foreign turnover stemming from the transaction boosted both foreign purchases and sales due to both parties being foreign firms. Foreign purchases increased to LKR 9.38bn (+172.96% W-o-W) while foreign sales too increased to LKR 9.65bn.
The net foreign position for the week however, remained in negative territory as net outflows of LKR 0.41bn on Thursday and Friday offset net inflows over the remainder of the week.
The ASPI meanwhile declined 37.21 points W-o-W despite the significant volumes as retail activity remained dull. Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Trade Deficit narrows in September 2015
Sri Lanka’s external sector strengthened in September 2015 helping improve the country’s international reserve position. Gross official reserves rose to 4.2 months of imports from 4.0 months in August 2014, while tourism earnings (+35.9% Y-o-Y) and worker’s remittances (+1.6% Y-o-Y) too gained in September.
The B-o-P meanwhile, recorded a deficit of USD 2316mn between Jan-Sept 2015 (cf. surplus of USD 1996mn in Jan-Sept’14). The country’s financial account was supported by net inflows into the Colombo Stock Exchange which amounted to USD 5.4mn as at end October 2015.
The trade deficit meanwhile, narrowed for the 3rd consecutive month declining 4.1% Y-o-Y in September 2015 as import expenditure declined 5.1% Y-o-Y.
The drop in import expenditure was led primarily by lower expenditure on Investment goods, particularly Transport Equipment (-47.9% Y-o-Y) although this decline was mainly due to a higher base effect in September 2014.
Earnings from exports meanwhile, declined 5.9% Y-o-Y in September 2015 as Industrial Exports – particularly Rubber products, Gems and Printing Industry products – recorded a significant Y-o-Y decline.
