Former Opposition Leader of the Matala Muncipal Council Duljith Aluvihare - the brother of UNP stalwarts MPs Ranjith Aluvihare and Wasantha Aluvihare, said he and his mother received greetings for the Sinhala - Tamil New Year from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa , but no leader of his own party contacted him and extended greetings.

He said though he was critical of the UNP as one of its district level leaders, no one in the party asked why he did so. He said the party has launched a disciplinary inquiry against him as he criticized the party at the meeting of electoral organisers held in view of May Day preparations.
"I earnestly request the UNP Working Committee to conduct an inquiry against me for criticizing the party. I am not scared to tell the truth. I criticized the UNP on behalf of its supporters . Matale remained as a UNP stronghold for 70 years. Only the Aluvihares ensured it for the party," he said. (M.W. Somaratna – Matale )
