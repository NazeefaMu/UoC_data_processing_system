Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ajith P. Perera said today the ministry was taking every possible move to bring back Sri Lankans stranded in Yemen as Saudi-led airstrikes had been increased on Houthi rebels who had begun advancing on the capital Sanaa.
According to the Deputy Minister, the government could contact United Nations and some other humanitarian organisations requesting their assistance to evacuate 120 Sri Lankans who had been stranded in Sanaa.
“We are waiting for a response from the UN now. We came to know that Indian government has sent ships to Yemen to bring their nationals back. We have contacted Indian High Commission in Yemen too since we have no representatives in Yemen,” he said.
Mr. Perera said that at the moment, all the 120 Sri Lankans are staying in Sanna and needed precautions would be taken to save the Sri Lankans by bringing them safely to the motherland.
Houthi rebels are seeking to overthrow Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi while advancing to capital Sanna.
Meanwhile, in a BBC report, Saudi Arabia had said military intervention in Yemen would continue until the country is "stable and safe".
However, continuous airstrikes has hit cities across Yemen while a considerable number of civilians have also been killed.  (Piyumi Fonseka)
