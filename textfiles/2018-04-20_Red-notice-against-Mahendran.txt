A red notice was issued against former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahandran by the Interpol today, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told Daily Mirror a short while ago.

He said the notice was issued in connection with the CID investigation into Central Bank bond scam.

Mr. Mahendran was directed by Court to report to the CID by February 15 to record statements in connection with the magisterial inquiry into the bond auction held on February 27, 2015 however he had failed obey the Court's directive.

On March 29, the Fort Magistrate re-issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Mahendran but the warrant could not be served because he was not at the given address in Singapore.

However, the red notice on Mr. Mahendran is not visible in the Interpol's official website on the basis that they are restricted to law enforcement use only. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
