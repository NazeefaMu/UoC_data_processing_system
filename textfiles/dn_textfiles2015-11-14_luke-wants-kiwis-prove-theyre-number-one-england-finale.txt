Luke wants Kiwis to prove they're number one in England finale

London, Thursday: New Zealand have worked hard to establish themselves as the number one team in the world and Issac Luke is adamant they have no intention of relinquishing that title any time soon. Saturday's decisive third and final Test against England provides the Kiwis with the chance to justify their position at the summit of international rugby league.
The series is delicately balanced at 1-1 heading to the north-west town of Wigan, one of English rugby league's heartland clubs.
England scored four tries in a 26-12 victory in the first Test in Hull before the Kiwis fought back in a tight 9-2 win at London's Olympic Stadium last weekend.
New Zealand gained the number one ranking after winning the 2014 Four Nations and the 2015 Anzac Test against trans-Tasman rivals Australia.
And with England not having won a Test series since 2007, Luke is desperate for the Kiwis, coached by Stephen Kearney, to finish off the series in style.
"We've been battling with Australia for quite some time to be able to get the tag off them as the best team in the world and we want to hold on to that as long as we can," said the 28-year-old Luke.
"We've got 80 minutes to play this weekend and we want to show we are the best in the world, capable of beating anyone," he added.
"We came over here to do a job. Unfortunately we didn't manage to do that in the first week but we've managed to turn things around to give ourselves another opportunity to build again this weekend.
"It's a massive game. Both teams have won one each so it's evenly poised. Both teams will definitely be up for it this weekend, there won't be any holding back."
After their impressive defensive showing in London, Kearney has named an unchanged Kiwi squad for Saturday's Test.
- England changes -England coach Steve McNamara, however, has made a couple of changes to his 19-man squad as half-back Matty Smith and winger Jermaine McGillvary are included for the first time in the series -- the latter having been the top try-scorer in Super League last season.
Now McNamara hopes his tweaks to the squad will release the handbrake in attack after England failed to score a try in the second Test. "We should have attacked a little bit better than we did. We didn't score enough points," McNamara said.
"We had a whole lot of work to do in defence but we still needed to put more pressure on New Zealand. We did that the week before pretty successfully."
But while the attack is struggling, England's defence is looking better and better, according to prop Mike Cooper.
"There were a lot of positives from last Saturday," Cooper said.
"I'd say we're even more confident from that game than we were from the first because of the way we defended everything that they threw at us. "It probably took a bit of sting out of our attack so, if we can fix a few things up, we should be all right." AFP
