The Police used water cannons to disperse the Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) who were staging a Satyagraha in a temporary shed at the Lipton Circus a short while ago following a court order.

A large number of Police personnel gathered at the place later completely demolished the temporary sheds put up at the Lipton Circus by the students.

The Police Riot Control Unit had fired the water cannons until the students retreated.

MFSAC had started the Sathyagraha on Saturday (22) at the Lipton Circus demanding the Government to safeguard the country’s State education and to halt the move to establishing SAITM and other private medical colleges in the country.

Fort Magistrate issued an Order preventing the Satyagraha however, the MFSAC had ignored it. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
