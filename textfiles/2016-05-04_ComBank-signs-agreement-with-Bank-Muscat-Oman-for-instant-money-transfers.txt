Commercial Bank of Ceylon recently formalised its tie-up with Bank Muscat Oman to facilitate remittances to Sri Lanka via the latter’s new feature-rich mobile banking app, with the signing of an agreement in Muscat.
The mobile app makes it possible for users to send cash remittances to recipients in Sri Lanka or transfer money to accounts at Commercial Bank 24/7. They may also transfer funds to accounts at other banks in Sri Lanka via Commercial Bank. 
The agreement between the two banks was signed by Bank Muscat Deputy General Manager Institutional Sales and Products Development Abdullah Tamman Al Mashani and Commercial Bank Assistant General Manager Operations Palitha Perera (second left) in the presence of J.H.
