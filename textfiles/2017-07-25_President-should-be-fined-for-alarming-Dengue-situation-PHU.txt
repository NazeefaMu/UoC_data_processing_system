The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today as the head of state, President Maithripala Sirisena should be fined for the increasing number of Dengue breeding grounds in the country.

Addressing a news conference, PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said the government took legal action against those who failed to clear Dengue breeding grounds.

“If house and factory owners and school principals are fined for having Dengue breeding grounds at their premises, then who else should be fined for having Dengue breeding grounds in the country other than the president himself? We hereby call for the government to declare a state of emergency as it has failed to control the epidemic for over three months,” he said.

Meanwhile, MP Gammanpila said the government should divert its attention to Ayurvedic medicine to treat Dengue patients.

“Western medicine cannot treat Dengue, but Ayurvedic medicine can. I am aware of Dengue patients who were cured from Ayurvedic treatment. The lives of hundreds and thousands of Dengue patients could be saved with Ayurvedic treatment,” he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)
