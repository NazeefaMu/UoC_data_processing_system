Deputy delays flight by one hour


	



 

A deputy who was due to accompany a leading politician on a flight to attend an opening ceremony at a distant place had got a tongue-lashing from the latter when he turned up at the helipad one hour late.

 


The helicopter was due to take off at 9.15 am, but the deputy had turned up at only 10.15 am.
The leading politician known for his punctuality, had berated the errant deputy saying: “Don’t waste others’ precious time by being a laggard! You have placed me also in an embarrassing position!”
