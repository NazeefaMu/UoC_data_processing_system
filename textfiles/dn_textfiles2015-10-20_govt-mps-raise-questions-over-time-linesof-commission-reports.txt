Govt MPs raise questions over 'time lines'of commission reports

The Government MPs Group yesterday raised a question as to why the Udalagama and Paranagama Commission reports were not tabled in Parliament before the adoption of the UNHRC resolution over Sri Lanka.
They had raised questions over the timelines of the release of the documents when the group met at the Parliamentary premises yesterday.
Responding to their questions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said tabling the Udalagama and Paranagama reports in Parliament after the UNHRC resolution was strategically advantageous to the country.
The Prime Minister has also told the Government MP group that these reports have extensively dealt with individual cases and made recommendations. Meanwhile, Minister Rajitha Senaratne, speaking at the group meeting, had said that the public should be made aware of the parametres and the composition of the war crimes inquiry mechanism.
"If there is an involvement of foreign judges and prosecutors," the minister said, "that should be done in line with the country's existing laws."
