National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera said yesterday the police attack on students of the Higher Diploma in Accountancy showed the government’s suppressive reaction to the people’s demands.
He said by yesterday’s attack on the students, who were only asking for their reasonable demands to be granted, the government had laid the foundation for police rule in the country.
“The government has proved it was not interested in good governance but in ‘Yama Palanaya’ in the country,” Mr. Samaraweera said adding that instead of assigning such a vital portfolio to the minister of highways the government should have appointed a Higher Education Minister who would be sensitive to the demands of students.
He urged the students to join hands with the progressive forces of the people to win their demands rather than protesting on their own.
“Only thorough a joint struggle can the students ensure their rights are safeguarded,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
