Bank of Ceylon (BoC) recently joined with the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) to upgrade the medical interns’ website www.medicalinterns.lk.
The said website facilitates medical interns to enhance their knowledge and skills. This also lays a platform for the members to communicate concerns that arise on the job and to obtain the guidance and support needed.  
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was singed recently at the BoC head office Colombo 1, to extend bank’s sponsorship to develop the website. 
The bank’s Chief Marketing Officer Dr. Indunil Liyanage and Assistant General Manager Marketing K.P. Anandanadeeshan signed on behalf of the bank and Assistant Secretary Dr. H.N.D. Soysa and Treasurer Dr. W.I.N. Wijesooriya signed on behalf of the GMOA.
Dr. M.L.D.S. Saman Abeywardena, Dr. E.K.G.D. Chandika Epitakaduwa from the GMOA and BoC Chief Manager Consumer Credit Mahinda Hettiarachchi also participated in the event.
The bank has established a good working relationship with the GMOA and its members over a period of time. The bank also has its Regent Street branch to cater to the needs of the Colombo General Hospital doctors, medical staff and in coming patients. 
The GMOA Sri Lanka was established in 1926 and currently has over 16,000 members. It provides extensive support to medical professionals in the country in terms of knowledge and skill development. 
The GMOA has also initiated the interns programme as a preparatory course for doctors who were awaiting internship. Consultants of major disciplines, medical administrators and legal officers participate as resource personnel in the programme which addresses both theoretical and practical aspects. BoC is proud to have sponsored this website in aiding doctors to update their knowledge, sharpen their skills and align their attitudes in rapidly changing medical science.
Recognizing the value of members of the GMOA, BoC offers special personal loan facilities for its members. With a minimum security and attractive interest rate and flexible repayment period the doctors can avail themselves a personal loan facility up to a maximum of Rs.6 million for maximum repayment period up to seven years. 
However, this special benefit is offered only for medical professionals as they can obtain personal loans up to a maximum of Rs.10 million depending on their repayment capacity earned from their professional income. Doctors can also obtain a special housing loan facility in collaboration with the Health Ministry for a low interest rate. BoC recognizes the GMOA members with a specially endorsed ‘GMOA affinity credit card’ that is linked to amazing seasonal offers provided by exclusive service providers. 
BoC’s Prestige Plus current account also provides tailor-made facilities to suite the busy schedule of professionals. Those benefits include a personalized cheque book, no joining fees involved for BoC credit cards, BoC Internet banking facility and special rates when applying for air tickets via BoC Travels (Pvt.) Ltd. BoC also offers leasing facilities for doctors at a special concessionary interest rate.
BoC earned global recognition as one of the top 1000 banks in the world, (country rank No.1) as listed by ‘The Banker Magazine’ (UK) in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The bank claimed its award as the only Sri Lankan brand recognized as one of Asia’s Best Brands in 2013 by the Chief Marketing Officer’s Council (CMO Council) based in Mumbai, India. Brand Finance Lanka ranked BoC as the country’s No. 1 brand for the last seven consecutive years. 
The bank has passed exceptional milestones in recent years such as becoming the first to earn over Rs.1.0 trillion assets and over 1,000 customer touch points covering all parts of Sri Lanka. Focusing on the banks achievement, Fitch Rating Lanka ranked BoC at AA+(lka), which is the highest rating awarded to a local commercial bank and AAA from ICRA (lk). BoC maintains international presence with branches in Chennai, Male, Seychelles and a subsidiary in London.
