Comebacks of the year 2015

Grant Elliott

When the year began he was not in New Zealand's ODI squad. When it ended, he was the team's fourth-highest run-getter in the format in 2015. Since he played his first ODI in a year and a half on January 11, the 35-year-old Elliott averaged 44.73 across 27 matches, scoring a century and four fifties.
Against Sri Lanka in Dunedin, he and his Wellington team-mate Luke Ronchi smashed the record books in an unbeaten stand of 267 in 180 balls. Against Pakistan, he eased New Zealand home in a chase of 211 with 64 not out from 68 balls. There have been other plucky, crucial contributions. A series of 20s that allowed others to score quicker.
Then came the World Cup, where after a series of aborted starts Elliott captivated a nation on March 24 at Eden Park, filled to the brim with 41,279, when New Zealand faced South Africa in the first semi-final. Elliott entered at 128 for 3 and finished the job by swinging Dale Steyn for six to remain unbeaten on 84 from 74 balls with one delivery left in an epic match. That innings propelled the co-hosts to their first World Cup final, but the MCG threw up a mismatch. Elliott again stepped up with 83 from 82 balls out of a dismal total of 183.
Nothing he did after that could match the Eden Park high, but with 850 runs and 16 wickets in 2015, Elliott represented a memorable cricketing comeback at the age of 35.
Amit Mishra
23
The need for a legspinner during India's Test tour of Sri Lanka was what appeared to tip the scales in 33-year-old Mishra's favour when the BCCI selection committee picked the squad. His recent first-class record had been far from eye-catching - ten wickets in six Ranji Trophy matches in the last season - and his most recent competitive cricket was in the IPL where he took nine wickets in 12 games, average 34.34 and economy 7.71. What happened next was memorable.
Mishra played all three Test matches and turned up his best series, statistically. He took 15 wickets, had the lowest average (15), strike-rate (31.6) and economy (2.84) of all India's bowlers and his lower-order batting repeatedly helped the team's cause. Recalled after four years, Mishra fit into the first Test as the third spinner, but by the second was rightfully the second choice. He took five wickets in Galle to compliment R Ashwin and out-bowled Harbhajan Singh, then had a fine outing at P Sara with seven wickets and ended with three wickets and, crucially, innings of 59 and 35. His wickets were mostly that of bowlers, but played a big role in the overall outcome.
After that series in Sri Lanka, Mishra would have expected to play more against South Africa. In the end, he featured in just the Mohali and Nagpur matches, where the pitches were tailored to assist spin. While R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja hogged the limelight, Mishra claimed AB de Villiers twice in Mohali and JP Duminy, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis in Nagpur. Should have played in Delhi, but was rested for an extra fast bowler. Didn't do much with the bat. Didn't bowl nearly as many overs as Ashwin and Jadeja, but with big wickets each time he bowled, Mishra really didn't let his captain down. With India scheduled to play 14 Tests over the next 12 months - nine at home - Mishra could prove to be a vital cog for India.
Shoaib Malik

Not the first Pakistan player to make a surprise comeback, but the 33-year-old allrounder's latest recall proved his most successful. Malik's first internationals since the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were two Twenty20 internationals at home against Zimbabwe, which produced just 14 runs and two wickets, but he found himself in Pakistan's ODI squad.
Playing his first ODI since the 2013 Champions Trophy, he marked the occasion with 112 from 76 balls, his eighth century in the format and first since September 2009. In the second ODI, Malik slammed an unbeaten 36 from 20 balls to hasten a six-wicket win. He made 3 in the abandoned final match.
After the Zimbabwe series, Malik flew out to the West Indies where he represented Barbados Tridents in the CPL, contributing 209 runs (average 52.25) to the runner-ups. Linking up with Pakistan's limited-overs squad in Sri Lanka, he again contributed to series wins in the ODIs and T20Is: scores of 55*, 51, 42*, 29* and 11 in five ODIs and Player of the Series in the two T20Is for three wickets and 54 runs, of which 46 came in the first game. Apart from his batting, Malik kept runs down with his offspin, which Azhar Ali used in short spells.
During Pakistan's limited-overs tour of Zimbabwe, Malik turned in impressive all-round performances in all three ODIs. In the first match he made 31 to help revive the innings from 35 for 3, then took three wickets in a 131-run win. In the second, Malik's unbeaten 96 hauled the tourists from 17 for 3 and almost to victory, with the umpires eventually calling off the game due to bad light.
Less than 24 hours after Malik hastened Pakistan's series win with an unbeaten 34 from 28 balls, the PCB announced that he had been added to an existing 15-man Test squad to face England "given his present form in T20Is and ODIs". With Azhar injured and Mohammad Hafeez unable to bowl because of action issues, Malik was drafted into the XI for the Abu Dhabi opener. In his first Test match since August 2010 - and 33rd overall since his debut in 2001 - he produced a career-best 245 from the No. 3 spot.
However, as his form faded dramatically, Malik announced he was quitting Tests at the end of the series. His final act as a Test cricketer was taking a seven wickets as Pakistan sealed the series 2-0. All in all, a key figure in the revival of Pakistan as an ODI force with 607 runs in 15 innings at an average of 67.44, apart from 27 wickets across all formats in 2015.
Usman Khwaja
The 28-year-old New South Wales batsman's third coming as a Test cricketer was his most successful by leagues, even factoring in a hamstring injury that ruled him out of two Test matches. Where he previously managed 377 runs at 25.13 in nine matches across two stints in 2011 and 2013, with just two fifties, at the end of 2015 the recalled Khawaja was mesmerising.
Batting at No. 3 in the first two Tests versus New Zealand he produced attractive centuries of immense confidence and crispness. In the first innings in Brisbane, Khawaja entered at 161 for 1 and stroked his way to a maiden century, 174 off 239 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. In Perth, he took guard at 101 for 1 and was next out for 121 at 403 for 2. Not surprising, then, that Khawaja remarked during the New Zealand series that he was "finally starting to enjoy" playing at Test level.
Having missed Australia's next two Tests - one each against New Zealand and West Indies - Khawaja proved his fitness with a Big Bash League century and slotted back into the starting XI for the Boxing Day Test. It was back to business, with a pleasing 144 from No 3 helping the team to 551 for 3 declared in its first innings and then in the second, cracking 56 from 61 balls before falling to a lap-sweep off Jason Holder with a declaration looming. In five innings since return to the team, Khawaja made 504 runs at 126. Talk about making it large.
Nick Compton

When in the second half of 2013 Nick Compton was seen on American celebrity news channel E! dancing on a Los Angeles soundstage in his underpants, it appeared his England career was over. At the time, Compton - grandson of England legend Dennis - was five months out of the Test team following a falling out with then coach Andy Flower and found himself in LA to support the Compton Cricket Club. In the time since he was dropped in May 2013 until his comeback to the Test squad in late 2015, England had tried out seven batsmen at the top alongside Alastair Cook.
In his time outside of the team, Compton put in solid performances for Somerset which, following Adam Lyth's horror Ashes series and the failed Moeen Ali experiment, forced the ECB think-tank to go back to the 32-year-old. Playing his first Test since May 2014, and in the city of his birth, Durban, Compton put in a fine effort in seeing his team through a tricky first day of the Boxing Day Test. He displayed commendable application to hold the first innings together - perhaps the reason the selectors recalled him from county cricket - and his partnership of 125 for the fourth wicket with James Taylor (70) steadied England from 49 for 3.
Compton ended a truncated opening day on 63 and then added 22 on day two before walking when he nicked a pull shot off Morne Morkel, a dismissal that triggered a collapse of four wickets for 20 runs in the span of 29 deliveries. His 85 lasted 236 balls and 383 minutes.
When England batted again, Compton found himself at the crease in the tenth over with England's lead at 101. When he departed 116 balls later for 49, the lead was 206. Two solid innings in his comeback Test sends Compton, and this England team, into 2016 with plenty of promise.
