The nomination list of the SLFP had not been finalised even though nomination papers were signed, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said today.
 “They might be changed,” he said speaking at the weekly Cabinet briefing.
The nomination list must be signed by President Maithripala Sirisena as the leader of the SLFP to finalise it.
Senaratne said a report had been submitted to President urging that nomination should not be given to those who were charged with various allegations.
When asked if former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be entitled to privileges granted to a former President if he was elected to Parliament as an MP, he said that Rajapaksa could not enjoy two privileges at the same time- that of an ex-president and of an MP.
Minister Senaratne said in lighter vein that Mr. Rajapaksa would get only two security personnel, if he was elected as an Opposition MP.
At present Rajapaksa is given a contingent of more than 200 security personnel as a former President.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
