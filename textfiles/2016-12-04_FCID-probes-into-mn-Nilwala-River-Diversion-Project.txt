The FCID had sought a court order to obtain a detailed report from a State Bank on release of Rs.4, 012 million for the Nilwala River Diversion Project.

The Financial Crimes Investigations Division said they needed this information to conduct an investigation under the Money Laundering Act to ascertain any misappropriation of public money by not commencing the work on the project.

The FCID also said that the project was also an unsolicited project, despite the total cost amounting Rs. 4,012 million had been paid two years ago.

The Ministry of Irrigation and Water Management had made this payment of Rs. 4,012 million to China CAMC Engineering Company. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)
