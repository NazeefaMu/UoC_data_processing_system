Emirates SkyCargo's Freighter Terminal inaugurated

Emirates SkyCargo's state-of-the-art cargo terminal at the Logistics District in Dubai South was officially inaugurated by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive of Emirates Airline and Group, further establishing Dubai as a leading global air cargo and logistics hub.
Named Emirates SkyCentral, the cargo facility is the home of Emirates SkyCargo's fleet of 15 freighter aircraft, and was officially opened on the side lines of the Dubai Air Show.
The event was attended by a number of dignitaries, including members of Dubai's Executive Council, representatives from various local authorities, members of Emirates' senior management, as well as local and international media.
"The opening of Emirates SkyCentral is an important milestone for us, as it represents our vision for future growth and firmly establishes Emirates SkyCargo as the world's leading air cargo carrier across all its operational areas. The space it currently occupies on the land allocated to us at Dubai South is part of a much bigger area, which we can develop over time to increase our cargo handling capacity to achieve our vision of 12 million tonnes annually by 2050, from the current 2.3 million tonnes," said Nabil Sultan, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Cargo.
Mohsen Ahmed, Vice President of Logistics at Dubai South, said: "With the launch of the Emirates SkyCargo facility, Dubai South begins an exciting new chapter in its journey towards establishing Dubai's excellence as a logistics hub. Dubai South offers the ideal connection point for sea and air cargo, which calls for rapid movement to the markets of the Middle East, Asia and Africa."
Emirates SkyCentral is located 77 kilometres from Dubai International Airport (DXB) - a convenient location with factories and forwarders in the surrounding areas, and in close proximity to a dedicated corridor to the Jebel Ali Port and Free Zone.
Emirates SkyCargo has 47 trucks that ply the virtual corridor between the two airports, with each truck being equipped with satellite tracking to ensure the safety and security of cargo and staff.
Emirates SkyCentral is a dedicated freighter facility, and with 12 aircraft stands directly in front of the terminal, one of its key features is the close proximity of aircraft to the receiving docks, which enables quick movement of goods.
The freighters that operate from Emirates SkyCentral fly to more than 50 destinations around the world.
