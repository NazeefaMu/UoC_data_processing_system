They complain about criteria being ignored


	

The august tradition of giving due consideration to merit and seniority is not always observed when granting promotions to the employees of the august assembly, they say.

 


There have been instances where certain employees falling short of required qualifications have been promoted to higher grades, inside sources say.


Meanwhile, some X-ray technicians counting more than 20 years of service have not been considered for promotion to a higher grade. Some of these officers are currently discharging clerical duties.

Although there is provision for promoting these officers to the Assistant Parliamentary Officer grade, the authorities concerned seem to be unaware of it, they say.
