	Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya has given instructions to all electronic media institutions to refrain from repeat telecasting the special message of President Maithripala Sirisena.
	The UPFA had complained that due to the many repeat telecasts of this special message (of last Tuesday) over the state's TV channels, the UPFA and its candidates were facing a grave injustice. Consequently the Commissioner of Elections had issued the above instructions.
	The Elections Secretariat had further stated that, during the run up to the elections, it was illegal to promote any candidate or political party by repeatedly telecasting or broadcasting any speeches or statements detrimental to another party. (Ranjan Kasthuri)
