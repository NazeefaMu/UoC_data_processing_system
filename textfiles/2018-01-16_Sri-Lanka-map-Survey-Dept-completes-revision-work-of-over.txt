The Survey Department has completed revision work covering over 60% of Sri Lanka’s geographical map, Surveyor General P.M.P. Udayakantha said yesterday.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Mr. Udayakantha said the department had completed re-drawing 65 parts of Sri Lanka’s geographical map which consists of 92 in total in the 1: 50,000 (1 centimeter = 0.5 kilometer) ratio category and the rest of work would be completed by the end of this year.

The final map was drawn in 2000 and since then the country had undergone many changes including expansion of land masses during the past18 years due to the mega scale infrastructure development projects.

Mr. Udayakantha said 2.6 square kilometers had added to the country’s topographical details with the land reclamation to the new Colombo port city enhancing the country’s land area recently.

He explained that the Moragahakanda, once marked as a forest in the map had now been changed entirely due to the multipurpose irrigation project.

Further he said the satellite technology were used in mapping the country and later the department officials conducts a field study to confirm the data.

The department is hoping to conclude the entire mapping by the end of this year. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
