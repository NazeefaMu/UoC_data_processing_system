Blood tie overcomes party rivalry


	



 

One may react with surprise to a report from the upcountry about a strange case of two rival parties operating their election campaigns from the same residential premises. One campaign is led by a paternal uncle and the other by his nephew.

 


What is more amazing is that they belong to two parties embroiled in a cobra-mongoose-type feud. The paternal uncle is leading the Blue party campaign in the district while his nephew is deeply involved in the Pohottuwa campaign there. 


Activists of both parties are reportedly conducting their respective party activity in a spirit of give and take.


Blood is thicker than water, they say.
