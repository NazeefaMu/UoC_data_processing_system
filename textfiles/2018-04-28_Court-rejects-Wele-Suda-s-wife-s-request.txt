Court rejects Wele Suda's wife's request


	

Senior State Counsel Thusith Mudalige yesterday objected to the State releasing jewellery of sentimental value to notorious drug dealer Wele Suda’s wife, who the Attorney General had indicted on 57 charges for laundering money to the tune of Rs.190 million in 2006.

Gampola Vidanage Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda’s wife had filed a motion in the High Court requesting for the release of certain pieces of jewellery that were recovered from her as it had a sentimental value.

The applicant had further claimed a property at Karagampitya, Dehiwela and a BMW vehicle that belonged to her that was taken into police custody to be used as productions for the case.

Yesterday when the case was taken up for inquiry prosecution Counsel Thusith Mudalige objected to the release of those assets to the owner as they were purchased funds earned illegally and furthermore were now productions used in the case.

Hence, the Court, overruling the request, fixed the trial for July 18. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
