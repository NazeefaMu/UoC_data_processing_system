President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has had a lengthy discussion on the political developments on Thursday night, sources close to the Prime Minister said yesterday.

The meeting has taken place at Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s residence in Colombo. The meeting had lasted four hours, past midnight, according to sources.

The duo had discussed about the no confidence motion brought against the Prime Minister and on how they could continue the unity government after April 4, 2018.

This development comes despite statements made by some SLFPers including Minister S. B Dissanayake that it is difficult for the party to oppose the no faith motion while some UNPers have expressed concern about the conduct of Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala during the past few days.
