A kid brother from the gem-rich district who got set for a pole-vault called on Number One to strike a deal first.

 


The man put forward two demands to be met before he could throw in his lot with the Betel leaf faction of Yahapalanaya. One demand was that be offered a purohita office at some level and the other that be provided with an easy way out of a pending court case against him. Number One who gave him a patient hearing expressed his regret that he was not in a position to grant either demand. 


Highly disappointed by the negative response, the kid brother left the place wondering as to how he could make the best out of a bad situation. 


Soon after, he made a statement scotching rumors that he was about to join yahapalanaya. “I would rather go to jail than join this this corrupt and utterly inept regime,” he said in his statement.
