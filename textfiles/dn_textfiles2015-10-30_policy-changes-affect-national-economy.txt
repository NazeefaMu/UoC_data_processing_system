'Policy changes affect national economy'

Policies relating to the economy keep on changing from time to time. The policy adopted at the time of signing an investment agreement has changed by the time funds are released. This has a negative effect on the country's economy, said Former Presidential Advisor Mano Tittawella.
He was addressing a press conference themed "what is expected of the Budget" at the SLFI recently.
He said constantly changing policies created many problems. Attention should be drawn towards adopting policies for a long time.
Tittawella said if there are policies to promote industries and services, investments could be raised from within the country. It is by expanding such policies that we should attract foreign investments. An environment should be created to draw funds from foreign countries and invest them in Sri Lanka. This required sustainable policies which do not change at every turn. Policies should remain intact at least for 10 years, he said.
"We should certify that policies would remain the same without changing unless there was a guarantee that investors would be reluctant to come here. If the policy is sustainable, there was no need to provide tax relief to attract investors. The foundation must be made in this direction from the budget," he said.
Tittawella said the budget should take steps to transform loss making state institutions into profitable institutions. If state owned ventures were not made profitable, it was the people who had to pay to make up such losses. Nearly Rs. 300 billion was spent to maintain loss making ventures. If this sum is saved, expenditure on education could be increased by another two percent.
Executive Director CAFFE and Sri Lanka Human Rights Centre Keerthi Tennakoon said under the present government, environmental policies have changed in recent times.
"There was no proper policy regarding fuel. We could not attain economic development unless there was a sustainable policy on environment. There was a wide sector connected to it and that was transport," he said.
Vehicle speed in Colombo city has dropped to 12 kmph. If the problem was not resolved, it may drop to 8 kmph within the next two years according to specialists who had paid attention to the issue, Tennakoon said.
