He laughed off their request


	

Providing accommodation and other basic facilities to dozens of purohitas at various levels has set a poser to the yahapalanaya government. 

 


A group of purohitas recently called on a high political authority to make representations about the difficulties they were undergoing for want of basic facilities to carry out their official functions. 


The purohita who led the delegation presenting their case to the high political authority told him. “None of us have got office accommodation at council complex. “Why do you want office rooms here?” the high authority asked with obvious levity. 


“Sir, we have to have a place where we can attend to our official functions!”


(The political authority points to a purohita in the delegation). “You speak to this colleague. He knows well about the office rooms available here. The other day he dashed into a room here and later found himself in hospital...” 


They all laughed, but their problem remained unsolved.
