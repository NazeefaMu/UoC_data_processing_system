	The National Eye Hospital yesterday warned the public about a breakout of an eye disease called ‘Conjunctivitis- pink eye’ and advised them not to touch the eyes during their stay in public places including public transport soon after their return at home.
	They also advised the public to wash their hands soon after returning home from any public place and to refrain from using towels other than their own and handkerchiefs in order to prevent the spread of the disease.
	However, they said that the disease was not a serious one and there is no danger of other complications due to ‘Conjunctivitis- pink eye’ disease. The eye hospital has advised the people to follow the advice of doctors in case of sighting of the symptoms.
	Redness in the white of the eye or inner eyelid, increased amount of tears, thick yellow discharge that crusts over the eyelashes, especially after sleep are the symptoms of the disease, health authorities say.
	A statement issued by the Government Information Department states that a similar eye disease spreads during the months of May, June and July every year. Around 100 patients are now being treated at the National Eye Hospital each day.
