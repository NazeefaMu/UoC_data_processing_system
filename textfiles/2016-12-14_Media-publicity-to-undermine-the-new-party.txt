Media publicity to undermine the new party


	



 

A very high Blue party political authority had somewhat surprised the state media heads by instructing them to give maximum possible publicity to the livewire of the new political party formed by a splinter group. 

 


The high political authority explaining the rationale behind his proposition to the media heads who listened to him with raised eye brows had said: “True, this grouping is a challenge to our party. But the best way to overcome this challenge is to blow up the main character of the party. Because, the more prominence this worthy gets as its organizer, more supporters are sure to veer away from it in disgust!”


All media partial to yahapalanaya are now expected to go all the way to elevate this organizer sky high, they say.
