Disciplining rowdy bus operators a pressing need


	



Some private bus operators simply don’t respect commuters. Bus conductors don’t ‘conduct’ themselves because they don’t know how to.

 They don’t carry ticketing machines, don’t follow traffic rules, aren’t attired in their uniforms and forget to return the balance 
money until asked. 


They are not only rude to commuters but keep insulting them, especially ladies. To add insult to injury, they play blaring music that damages the eardrums of passengers. The National Transport Commission (NTC) and other relevant authorities should seriously consider displaying a list of rules on conduct and discipline in all private buses.
