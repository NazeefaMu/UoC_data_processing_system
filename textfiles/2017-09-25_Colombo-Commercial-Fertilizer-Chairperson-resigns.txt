Colombo Commercial Fertilizer Chairperson resigns


	

Chairman of the Colombo Commercial Fertilizer LTD Thusitha Halloluwa today tendered his resignation letter to the Minister of Agriculture Duminda Dissanayake.

Mr. Halloluwa said he tendered the resignation because of undue pressure.

The Colombo Commercial Fertilizer LTD is an entity which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture.

He said that several illegal requests had been made to him to authorize a payment of Rs 1.5 million to the National Food Promotion Board

“The request was turned down by me and three directors of board members.  Even the minister himself made the request later on but I rejected the request as it was against the financial regulations,” he said.

Mr. Halloluwa said he had told the minister that the state sector depends on public funding, therefore an immense responsibility lies on the authorities to properly manage those money. (Thilanka  Kanakarathna)
