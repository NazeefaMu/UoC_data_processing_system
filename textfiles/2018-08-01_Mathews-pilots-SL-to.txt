Mathews pilots SL to 244


	



 

Despite losing Shehan Jayasuriya, Thisara Perera and Lakmal, Mathews played a calm hand of 79 not out to steer his side to a competitive total in the Sri Lanka vs South Africa, 2nd ODI held in Dambulla. South Africa did a good job at the back end of the innings by giving away just 51 off the final 10. But the track is offering enough purchase for spinners. On a used-up surface, Sri Lanka would fancy their chances.
