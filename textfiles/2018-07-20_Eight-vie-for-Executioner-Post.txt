Eight applications had been received by the Prisons Department for the post of Executioner by yesterday, the Department said yesterday.

It is said that all these applicants had expressed their willingness to perform their duty with great commitment.

Although the minimum qualification for the post is six passes at the GCE Ordinary Level Examinations including two Distinctions, three out of eight applicants had not even sat for the examination, Department sources said.

An official of the Prisons Department said that almost all applicants were from distant areas from Colombo and there were no female applicants.

In the meantime, a Spokesman of the Department said that the vacancies for this post would be Gazetted on July 27, 2018.

“Accordingly, the above applicants also can send their applications for the relevant post,” the Spokesman said.

The vacancy for the post of Executioner in the Prison Department exists since 2013. (Jayantha Samarakone)
