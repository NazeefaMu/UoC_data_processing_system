Celebrating two years Halloween style

The Nail Anatomy (TNA), located in the Lakpahana building at 14, Reid Avenue, Colombo 7, recently celebrated its second anniversary by inviting their customers to a Halloween themed party.
The Nail Anatomy has gained a reputation for delivering a standard of service that is on par with international nail bars, thanks to its high standards of hygiene, well trained technicians, use of the latest technology, an unparalleled range of colour options and a philosophy that is all about feeling good, loving yourself and showing yourself the respect you deserve.
These are the highlights of the night captured by Lalith C Gamage.
