DecentLanka 2015 wants Marapana removed from portfolio

 
DecentLanka 2015 in a letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with a copy to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday appealed for the immediate removal of Minister Thilak Marapana from his portfolio.
The Organisation stated that Marapana's own admission he was legal advisor to Avant Garde chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi and the strong defence made in Parliament as a Cabinet Minister on November 4 on behalf of Senadhipathi makes the government culpable in all crimes, violations of law and corruption that the company and its chairman is accused of.
The letter signed by attorneys at law Neville Ananda, Sujeewa Dahanayake, Srinath Perera, social activist Muditha Karunamuni, journalist Kusal Perera and trade unionist Anton Marcus demanded the Prime Minister to remove Marapana from his ministerial post and all other responsibilities in the government as an effort to at least arrest this slide back to a typical Rajapaksa era.
Excerpts of the letter:
"Appeal for immediate removal of Cabinet Minister Thilak Marapana from portfolio appointed to
We note with much dismay and disgust that President's Counsel Thilak Marapana who was legal advisor to Nissanka Senadhipathi, Chairman of Avant Garde the company embroiled in controversy over the floating armoury and heavily loaded with allegations on illegal weapons deals, violation of law on explosives and firearms, on money laundering and bribery is a Cabinet Minister in your government as a member of your political party brought to Parliament on the National List.
With the January 8 presidential elections that defeated President Rajapaksa labelled and stamped as "dictatorial, nepotistic and corrupt" in your election manifesto and then the defeat of Rajapaksa leadership in August elections, there is no ethical or moral right for you and your government that was voted in with the promise of a "New Country in 60 Months" on a five point programme to include a persons who accepts he was legal advisor to Chairman of Avant Garde, Nissanka Senadhipathi as an important minister in the cabinet of ministers.
Senadhipathi is a businessman accused of serious crimes and corruption and known to have been very closely associated with the Rajapaksa regime. In fact a report attributed to an Additional Solicitor General Vasantha Navaratne Bandara infers charges can be filed against five persons including Nissanka Senadhipathi and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for 01. Unauthorized Importation of Fire Arms to Sri Lanka under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Fire Arms Ordinance
02. Possession of fire arms and ammunition without valid licenses under the Fire Arms Ordinance and Explosives Act and then 03. Conspiracy, aiding and abetting to commit the above offences.
Although the AG opted to decide otherwise, President Sirisena was compelled to re start investigations on Avant Garde through PRECIFAC under heavy pressure from many quarters.
It cannot be out of ignorance that Marapana was brought to Parliament through the national list and made the Minister of Law and Order and Prison Reforms. In such context, Minister Marapana's own admission he was legal advisor to Senadhipathi after the January 08 "change" for Yahapalanaya and the strong defence made in Parliament as a cabinet minister on November 4, 2015 on behalf of Senadhipathi then as his client makes your government culpable in all crimes, violations of law and corruption the Avant Garde and its Chairman Senadhipathi is accused of."
