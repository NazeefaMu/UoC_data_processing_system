UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa today said the Joint Opposition had not appointed a shadow cabinet but assigned its members ministries to observe the activities and shortcomings of the ministries.

Speaking to the media after attending a ceremony held in Kegalle today, the parliamentarian said the government was blowing the concept of a shadow cabinet out of proportion.

"This is not a cabinet as the government claims. They are just afraid of us and keep attacking us without fulfilling their duties," he said.
