Hidden threats of antibiotics


	



 

  Powerful antibiotics are prescribed for trivial illnesses. Some doctors love to cure their patients fast to maintain a high profile in the medical profession. They prescribe powerful antibiotics for children as well. The long - term effect of this is that those children develop the “resistance” to antibiotics. This leads to the condition where more powerful medicines have to be prescribed to cure the simplest of diseases. 


Antibiotics are mostly used to treat bacterial infection - related diseases. Antibiotics can control the multiplying growth of bacteria or destroy it. Therefore, it is significant to take the prescribed dose of antibiotics during the due time span to experience the best results.  


Antibiotics should be taken only with a doctor’s prescription. This type of medicine isn’t suitable to treat influenza, Diarrhea or other virus - caused diseases. Antibiotics don’t fight viruses and many virus-caused diseases. It is the immune system that fights and cures this type of disease automatically.  


Using antibiotics inappropriately will cause “antibiotic resistance” - which builds the resistance to viruses. If antibiotics are used long-term the drugs will have less effect in the fight against viruses. This antibiotic resistance has become an uprising and a common issue globally. Patients themselves are requesting powerful antibiotics from doctors.   


Therefore, these advices should be followed when taking antibiotics.  


Use antibiotics only when it is necessary.  


Avoid having antibiotics without the doctor’s recommendation.  


Follow the doctor’s advice when taking the dosage of antibiotics during a recommended time span.  
Do not stop taking antibiotics before controlling the disease completely.   


Do not keep the unused tablets stored at home and do not pass your medicine to others. 

 
Check for the expiration date of drugs   
It is advisable not to have antibiotics without a doctor’s prescription when dealing with a virus infection.  


Antibiotics like Penicillin could cause highly sensitive allergic reactions.Those could be severe to mild in intensity. Itching, swelling around the eyes and rashes in the skin are the symptoms of a mild allergy. If any allergic reaction appears, it’s advisable to stop continuing the medicine and seek medical assistance immediately. If the reactions are severe, like anaphhylaxis, one’s life would be in danger. During instances like that, the patient should be hospitalized soon and be treated fast.

Breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure, vomiting and fainting are common symptoms during such situations. If there has been a reaction to Penicillin or any other antibiotic, one must inform the doctor. It will be easier for the doctor to prescribe the suitable antibiotic then. Inquiring from the doctor about the complications and side effects of medicine brings good advice.  


According to the severity of the infection, antibiotics could be given via the mouth or in the form of  an injection. If the patient is a child, medicine can be given in the form of a syrup. Syrup is made by  pharmacists with given powder provided. If the powder is provided by the pharmacy, in place of the syrup, ask for directions as to how to make the syrup.  


The absorption of some antibiotics could be controlled by some food. The absorption would be immense if Erythromycin or Oral penicillin is given before the meal. Let the doctor define the dose and time of taking medicine; whether it is to be taken before or after the meals.  


Some antibiotics aren’t really safe for pregnant women. Certain other drugs might be unsafe for the foetus as well. No drugs should be taken without the recommendation of a doctor during pregnancy. Informing the doctor of a pregnancy is a must during any situation that you visit a doctor.   


Amoxicillin, Cloxacillian, benzylpenicilln, Co - amoxiclav, erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Cefalexing and tetracycling are among common antibiotics.
