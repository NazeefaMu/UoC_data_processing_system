Four out of the ten spill gates of the Parakrama Samudra were opened today by a foot each, due to the heavy showers experienced in the catchment areas, Polonnaruwa Divisional Irrigation Director S. K. Hewagama said.

He said due to the heavy showers, the water level of the reservoir reached the spill level and more spill gates would be opened if the rains prevail. A water capacity of 560 square feet per second is being released from the spill gates. (K.G. Karunaratne)
