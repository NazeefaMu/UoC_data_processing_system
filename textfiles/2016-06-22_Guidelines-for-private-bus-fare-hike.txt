Guidelines for private bus-fare hike


	

In response to the request made by private bus operators to increase bus fares from July 1, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday appointed a high-ranking panel to prepare the criteria for such increaments.

At yesterday's discussions held with the minister at the transport ministry, the private bus operators insisted that they be permitted to increase bus fares from July 1 in the wake of the sharp increase in the price of tyres and spare parts and the increase in leasing charges and salaries of the bus crew.

The minister said a panel of high-tanking officials had been appointed by the cabinet in 2001 and 2002 to prepare a criteria for increasing bus fares and as such any increase in bus fares had to follow the guidelines approved by the Cabinet.

“However, in 2007 the cabinet appointed another committee to submit a report on increasing bus fares with amendments to the criteria prepared by earlier panel. But the Cabinet had not approved the report because of several grey areas and the difficulty in implementing the recommendations,” he said.

However, the minister admitted that the demand to increase bus fares was reasonable in the backdrop of the price increase in consumer items, increased leasing charges and the price increase on tyres and spare parts. He said bus fares could not be based on the views of the private bus operators or the National Transport Commission.

A final decision on increasing bus fares is expected to be taken on the recommendations of the panel appointed by the current minister and with the concurrence of the Treasury, Consumer Affairs Authority, transport professionals and all stake holders connected to the transport sector. The recommendations will have to be approved by the Cabinet as well. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
