Voucher programme: Action against principals, teachers who sabotage


	

Education Ministry will consider taking disciplinary action against principals or teachers who refuse to support the cash-voucher-distributing system which has been nationally approved, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
“We are glad to say that 95% of the cash-voucher programme has been completed. A majority of principals and teachers have supported the programme, but very few of them who have not realized their responsibility and duty are not supporting the voucher programme. There had been some practical problems in several places too since it was the first phase. However, those who try to sabotage the programme purposely might be having different political agendas,” the minister said.
The cash voucher system has been implemented recently after obtaining Cabinet approval.
The minister said the programme is productive and effective and as such there should be no difficulties as claimed by some teachers’ unions.
"The national programme to distribute cash vouchers to students instead of school uniforms cannot be stopped over allegations by a few and therefore the ministry will take action against any principal or teacher who purposely tries to sabotage the programme," he said.
“The uniform material distribution programme launched by the previous government in 2014 is only 35% complete by the time of the school vacation. But, 95% of our voucher programme, has been completed by now. I think I should not talk any further about the difference between the old system and the new one."
However, responding to questions asked by journalists, he said he would definitely pay attention to persistent problems within the voucher system and pledged that the shortcomings which have been already identified will be resolved in the next year’s voucher programme.
All the principals and teachers in government and semi-government schools were requested by the minister of education to comply with the guidelines given in the ministry’s circular on the voucher system and fulfill their responsibilities.  (Piyumi Fonseka)
