UNP grassroots members want leadership change: Mayantha


	

Grassroots members of the United National Party (UNP) want a leadership change in the party but it couldn’t be done instantly, MP Mayantha Dissanayake said yesterday.

The UNP MP told journalists that grassroots level members have informed them that the recent restructure of the party had not met their expectations as they expected a leadership change.

“Most of the grassroots members say the recent restructure of the party had not met their expectations as they wanted a leadership change. However, it cannot be done instantly. I also feel that the party should be restructured effectively so that it could be successful at the Provincial Council Elections,” Mr Dissanayake said.

However, he said expectations of party men, who had undergone much suffering for 20 years, should be met sooner or later.

Asked whether there was any move by UNP backbenchers to function as independent members in Parliament if no effective changes were made in the party, Mr Dissanayake said his position was that effective changes in the party should take place. (Yohan Perera)
