Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry rejects MR's objections

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa arrived at the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry today, as the Commission rejected objections from former president's lawyers and decided to continue it's mandate. He was summoned to appear before the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry yesterday to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges. However he raised a preliminarily objection yesterday on appointing High Court judges to the commission.
The proceedings were postponed till today due to this objection.  According to the lawyers of former President, the President does not have legal authority to appoint High Court judges to a Presidential Commission.
