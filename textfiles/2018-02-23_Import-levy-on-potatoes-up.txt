The special commodity levy on imported potatoes has been increased by Rs. 29 per kilogramme from midnight today, the finance ministry said.

The ministry, in a statement, said they had decided to increase the levy to provide a relief to the local farmers since their harvest is reaching the market.

Accordingly, the levy which was Rs. 1 would be increased to Rs. 30. The new levy revision will be effective until March 31. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama and Kalathma Jayawardana)
