Jeb Bush spent $US130 million running for President

 
US: When Jeb Bush formally entered the presidential campaign in June, there was already more money behind him than every other Republican candidate combined.
When he suspended his campaign in South Carolina at the weekend, Mr Bush had burnt through the vast majority of that cash without winning a single state.
His spending on valets, pizza and clubbing - in addition to the usual consultants and advertising - might go down as one of the least successful campaign binges in history. Here is Mr Bush's story, as told by his ledger:
Donors' cars don't park themselves. With an aggressive fundraising schedule and several major donor gatherings, Mr Bush and the super PAC, Right to Rise, incurred a proportional parking tab.
Instead of spending last winter on the hustings of Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr Bush held off, instead using the first half of 2015 to raise money in places such as New York, Chicago, Texas and Florida. His goal: to raise enough money for a super PAC to scare other candidates - especially those with a similar political profile - out of the race. Over the entire campaign, his team racked up tens of thousands of dollars in dinner and event tabs at the Yale Club, the Union League Club of Chicago, Nantucket's Westmore Club, and more than two dozen other haunts of the well-heeled and racquetball-inclined.
When Bush finally did get in the race, he needed to reintroduce himself to the Republican electorate. After all, it had been eight years since the end of his final term as Florida's governor, and he had spent the intervening period as a philanthropist, consultant and investment banker. His campaign and a super PAC supporting him spent heavily on sunny advertising spots in the hopes of announcing Mr Bush to the post-Tea Party Republican Party as a credentialed conservative.
As the Bush campaign matured, he and the group supporting him built one of the largest organisations of any candidate in either party, banking that his superior fundraising would sustain his high overhead costs, which in turn would yield him wins or near-wins in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where organising is critical. But Mr Bush's message - experience, civility and technocratic competence - did little to win over voters mesmerised by billionaire provocateur Donald Trump, who outshone his rivals with a bare-bones organisation and millions in free media exposure.
Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting the Bush campaign, and then his campaign directly, retained 30 Point Strategies, a public relations company in Bethesda, Maryland, specialising in "thought leadership" and "brand journalism", according to the firm's website. But in the end, the most lasting label for Mr Bush was supplied by Mr Trump: "low energy".
Bush and his staff racked up sizeable travel bills, including $US3.3 million in airfares and hundreds of thousands of dollars at hotels, ranging from a Best Western in Phoenix to the Biltmore in Coral Gables, Florida. But what stands out is the Bush team's taste for the Vegas Strip, where aides and allies patronised the Bellagio, the Wynn and the Venetian, owned by Sheldon Adelson?, the Republican mega-donor.
A well-funded candidate tends to attract hordes of consultants, and Mr Bush had plenty. All told, his team paid consulting fees to about 140 companies or individuals, including senior campaign staff members, opposition research firms, and get-out-the-vote operatives in Iowa and South Carolina.
As his fortunes declined, Mr Bush sharply pared back employees' salaries and consulting fees, even laying off some campaign staff members to bring down costs. But let it never be said he allowed his team to go hungry. His campaign and super PAC were particularly fond of the pizza, whether from Domino's or from Pizza Ranch, the Iowa chain.
