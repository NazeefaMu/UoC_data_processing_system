Posters appeared in the Jaffna town yesterday calling for a Hartal today demanding legal action against all those who attempted to protect the murderers of schoolgirl Sivaloganathan Vidya.

The posters carried pictures of State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran and Attorney Thamil Maran who appeared for Swiss Kumar.

The posters claimed that when the first accused Swiss Kumar was in custody, it was the state minister and the attorney who assisted in getting him released.

The posters had been put up by a group calling itself the, People of Jaffna and several women’s organizations.

Meanwhile, the traders organizations and civil society groups said they did not want a Hartal because justice had been meted out. (Romesh Madushanka)
