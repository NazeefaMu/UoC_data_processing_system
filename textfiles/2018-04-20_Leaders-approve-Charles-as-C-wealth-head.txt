The Commonwealth leaders have agreed the appointment of Prince of Wales Charles as the next head of the Commonwealth, the BBC reported a short while ago.

Queen Elizabeth II had said it was her "sincere wish" that Prince Charles would succeed her in the role "one day".

Leaders of the Commonwealth have been discussing the issue at a meeting behind closed doors at Windsor Castle.

The non-hereditary role would not have automatically passed to Prince Charles, with some suggestions it might rotate among the 53 leaders.

Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had earlier given their backing to Prince Charles.

The meeting during a two-day summit involved 46 heads of Commonwealth governments and foreign ministers from the remaining seven countries.
