Northamptonshire have re-signed Sri Lanka international spinner Seekkuge Prasanna for the T20 Blast.

The 31-year-old leg-break bowler played 11 times in the competition for Northants last season, taking 12 wickets at an average of 24 runs.

Prasanna has appeared in 34 one-day and 14 Twenty20 internationals, including February's series against Australia.

"The more match-winners on your teamsheet the better," head coach David Ripley told BBC Radio Northampton.

"It's his consistency with the ball, he's been bowling the power-play against Australia and doing a good job of that.

"There's some Sri Lankan cricket but at this stage it looks like he can pretty much do the whole competition, which is positive for continuity."(BBC)
