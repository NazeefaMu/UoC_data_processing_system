The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) is continuing to enroll students for the new academic year, SAITM Registrar Husni Hussain said yesterday.

She told Daily Mirror that SAITM had not still received any directives from the Government asking it to suspend student enrollments.

“We have been enrolling new students as usual soon after the Advanced Level (A/L) results were released and SAITM is functioning without a hitch,” Ms. Hussain said.

She said the students were attending lectures and clinical practice and added that it was the State universities which were not functioning properly.

“Several discussions and a court case are ongoing on the SAITM issue. We are awaiting a final ruling,” Ms. Hussain said.

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has also pointed out that SAITM was enrolling students for the new academic year by violating the government’s ruling on the private medical college announced by the presidential secretariat. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
