The Wildlife Department found the largest crocodile in Welegoda, Matara this morning. The croc believed to weigh close to a ton and 17 feet long was found stuck in a canal leading off the Nilawala River. The crocodile had attempted to enter the canal in search of food as the water levels in the river had risen. The giant reptile was released back into the river by Wild life officials at Mirissa and Kalawetiya.(Pics by Krishan Jayaruk)
