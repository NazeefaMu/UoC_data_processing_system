A local politico eyeing a chief purohita’s post had reportedly accompanied a high political authority on an official foreign visit at his own expense. 

 


The politico had purchased his air tickets and personally borne all other expenses in his bid to be in the company of the high political authority during the latter’s sojourn abroad. Our country’s envoy in the host country is said to be an in- law of this local politico and he had facilitated this arrangement.


The local politico had later confided to his buddies that the foreign trip he made was worth the money spent on it as it provided him with ample opportunity to be very close to the big man during the visit, a chance he could not dream of while being here.
