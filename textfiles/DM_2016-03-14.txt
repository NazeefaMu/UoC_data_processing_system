## Title: Debt trap not from loans obtained by my Govt: MR

Debt trap not from loans obtained by my Govt: MR
	
In the wake of the Government proposing to increase taxes, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the country was now facing an unprecedented economic crisis and it should be examined how and why things came to such a pass.
In announcing increases to VAT and income tax and the reintroduction of the capital gains tax the Prime Minister said in his special statement to parliament last week that the Government has been compelled to increase taxes in this manner because my government had got the country into a debt trap.
In a statement Mr. Rajapaksa said, After coming into power, the present government obtained 400 million USD under a currency swap arrangement with India in March 2015. It obtained another 650 million USD through a sovereign bond issue in May 2015. Another 1,100 million USD was obtained from India in July under a currency swap agreement. A further 1,500 million USD was obtained through a sovereign bond issue in October. Between March 2015 and March 2016, the government issued short and medium term Sri Lanka development bonds on 12 different occasions borrowing over 2,711 million USD. Thus in the 15 months they have been in power, the present government has obtained 6,361 million USD in foreign loans. 
"To put matters into perspective, this is enough to meet the entire foreign loan components of the Mattala airport (190 million USD) the Hambantota Port (426 million USD) Norochcholai Coal Power plant (1,340 million USD), The Colombo-Matara Highway (630 million USD), The Colombo-Katunayake Highway (248 million USD) all put together, and there would still be enough money to build not one, but two Port Cities (1,400 million USD each) one 500 megawatt Sampur Coal power plant (500 million USD) and yet another Mattala airport with the final leftovers.
"This government enjoyed foreign exchange savings of around USD 2,500 million in 2015 due to the precipitous drop in oil prices after they came into power. But they could not build up foreign exchange reserves or even make the Petrolem Corporation and the Electricity Board profitable. All these colossal borrowings including the massive savings from petroleum imports have been spent on consumption. It is because of the almost comic fiscal irresponsibility shown by the government that Sri Lankas credit rating was downgraded by Fitch and Standard and Poors recently.

Islandwide blackout due to burst transformer at Biyagama
	
An unusual burst at the major electricity transformer yard in Biyagama caused a nationwide blackout plunging the country into darkness yesterday for eight hours in some areas --such as Colombo,and even longer in some other areas,a Deputy Minister said. This is the third blackout within six months and the second in two weeks.
Deputy Minister of Power and Energy Ajith Perera,who rushed to the scene,told Daily Mirror last night that a key transformer at the Biyagama Grid Station had gone up in flames,and a team would be dispatched to the scene this morning to investigate it.
He said the Government Analyst would also visit the scene to ascertain whether it was an act of sabotage or not.
This is an unusual situation. We have doubts about it. We want to ascertain whether it is an act of sabotage or not, he said.
Earlier, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, at a hurriedly summoned press conference in his constituency of Kegalle, apologised to the nation for the second outage experienced this year.
The minister,however,said it had happened before the committees appointed to look into the previous such incidents had submitted their reports identifying the cause.now,he said,the scope of these committees would be extended to examine yesterdays incident as well.
Apart from natural and technical reasons, he said, his ministry would investigate whether there could be some other reason for the blackouts. The minister had called for a special meeting with the relevant officials.
Ministry Secretary Dr.suren Batagoda said the blackout was experienced from about 2.15 pm.
He said the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had restored the power supply twice but it had tripped on both occasions.the supply was restored by 10.00 pm in Colombo and some other areas.dr.batagoda said power had been restored to 80 percent of the country by 10.00 pm. We are doing it gradually,he said. Due to the power failure,the water purification plants in Ambatale and Biyagama were at a standstill for several hours, restricting water supplies to the Colombo and Greater Colombo areas.(Kelum Bandara)

Kelaniya Uni suspends lectures for senior students
	
Kelaniya University lecturers have decided to refrain from teaching second, third and fourth year students until further notice as a mark of protest against the students' alleged misconduct including the ragging of freshers, officials said today.
Kelaniya University Student Affairs Director Dr. Chaminda Abeysinghe said the decision was taken by the university administration because of the repeated misbehavior by senior students who continue to ragging first-year students and intimidate the lecturers.
Resulting from this decision, all lectures for second, third and fourth-year students will be suspended from today until the senior students stop their acts of unruly behavior within the university premises.
Dr. Abeysinghe said the senior students who appear to be led by politically-affiliated elements were attempting to cause chaos for the first-year students by interrupting their lectures.
He said some senior students had even threatened the lectures who intervened to resolve these concerns and took steps to advise them to desist from disturbing the lectures of the first year students by ragging them.
When we came to know about the harassment on first-year students, I and all the academics intervened to solve these issues by speaking to the senior students. At that point, we were threatened. This is not the first time that such incidents had happened in the university,Dr. Abeysinghe said. The senior students treated the lecturers in an indecent manner. As lecturers, they have to maintain their professional respect and independence and a healthy atmosphere should prevail for first-year students to continue their studies without unnecessary concerns or distractions. Until they stop these unwarranted acts, their lectures will be suspended.
He said lectures would be continued for first-year students at the Kelaniya University, though however exams would be held for senior students on the due dates.
Disciplinary action is be contemplated by the university administration against the senior students found guilty of such offences. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)
