MILITARY ETIQUETTE!

 
The military services have a long history in which many traditions have become an established norm. These traditions can be broken down into various customs and courtesies. A custom is a way of acting in a manner that has continued consistently over such a long period that it has become a sort of unwritten law. And it becomes a usual way of acting in given circumstances. It is a practice so long established that it has the force of law.
A courtesy is a form of polite behaviour and excellence of manners. You will note that military life gives rise to many situations, not found in civilian life, that require special behaviour. Customs and courtesies that help make life orderly and are a way of showing respect.
These old customs are regular, expected actions. They have been constant sources of disciplined and civilised behaviour and passed from one generation to the next. The exercise of customs, courtesies, and ceremonies helps keep discipline and order in a military organisation.
The keywords in military etiquette are discipline and honourable conduct, the hallmarks of an officer and gentleman. Every officer is expected to conduct him/herself in the highest ethical manner in all relationships with peers, superiors, and subordinates. Such upright behaviour is expected of them both in and out of uniform.
Courage is another watchword in the armed services lexicon. In acknowledging their commitment to courage, they accept that courage is the value that gives them the moral and mental strength to do what is right, even in the face of personal or professional hardship.
Their commitment to these core values acknowledges that they will obey orders, while demanding respect up and down the chain of command. As services personnel all military men and women are supposed to be proud professionals.
It is their duty to always work as a team. But they cannot achieve this type of professionalism without maintaining a mutual level of respect for one another. Their job will be made that much easier if they observe the principles of military etiquette and courtesy.
The day-to-day duty of every soldier, sailor and airman and woman is to work together as a team to improve the quality of their work, their co-workers and themselves.
Saluting is very much a part and parcel of military a tradition and a rule. It is perhaps one of the oldest signs of respect leading back to the Romans whom all armies and navies adopted this practice from. All officers largely regard the salute as a very basic measure of a person's level of professionalism and sense of respect toward a Commissioned Officer/Warrant Officer.
It is indeed a required act of military courtesy. Regulations governing its use are founded on military custom deeply rooted in tradition. The salute is a symbol of respect and a sign of comradeship among all services personnel. The salute is simple and dignified but there is great significance in that gesture. It is a time-honoured demonstration of courtesy among all military personnel that expresses mutual respect and pride in the service.
All military personnel are advised to never resent or try to avoid saluting persons entitled to receive the salute. The most common form of salute is the hand salute. However, there are other types, such as gun and rifle salutes.
Every officer is expected to obey certain unwritten laws. There are no regulations or written instructions to assist the newly commissioned officer in most of these matters. If an officer seeks guidance from those in authority he will usually receive the unsatisfactory reply that this is "done" or "not done" because it is the "Custom of the Service."
A newly enlisted officer is liable to make many unfortunate mistakes before he/she learns from experience the numerous un-written customs he is expected to comply with.
Lectures will undoubtedly be given in these subjects at the beginning of their training, but there is so much to learn in the early days and so much to interest them, that it is not to be wondered at if the importance of this aspect of their training is not realised by the majority until it is too late.
It would be best for everyone to remember that in the armed forces, the various grades of colonels, generals, and admirals are addressed simply as Colonel, General, or Admiral. Their surnames can be added, but during a drawn out conversation the title alone is the simpler accepted choice. In the Army and Air Force, non-commissioned officers are also addressed officially by their titles, although they may also use "Mr." or "Ms." socially. Warrant officers are called "Mr." or "Ms." both officially and socially.
Naval officers who rank from lieutenant commander up are called 'Commander.' Officers below that rank are called 'Mr.' in conversation but when introduced are referred to by their titles.
But the immediate responsibility for the care and preparation of men for battle rests on the shoulders of the junior commander - a responsibility that he must take control of eagerly and tackle firmly in the knowledge that the officer who measures up to his job has no more loyal supporters than his own men.
The future of the Armed Forces lies with its officers, and, in particular, with its junior officers. It is their contribution that will determine the morale and fighting spirit of the troops in battle.
The junior officer should also remember that his personal bearing will exercise a dominating and permeating influence not only with his own men but with the general public and that the tone of an army is set by its officers.
In public, therefore, as on parade, he must conduct himself in such a fashion that the uniform he wears is regarded by the general public less as a uniform than as the hallmark of that great profession of arms to which he belongs - a profession whose prestige in time of war is vitally bound up with a nation's destiny. Such admirable and exemplary behaviour would obviously prompt a snappy salute from an admiring public.
