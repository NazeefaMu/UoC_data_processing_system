Clearance given to transfer Tea Board cess fund to Treasury


	

The Cabinet Sub Committee on Economic Affairs has given clearance to transfer the Cess Fund of the Sri Lanka Tea Board to the Treasury, a move which was opposed by Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake.

The sub committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken this decision. However, Mr. Dissanayake is reported to have opposed the move at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting.

This is one of the largest funds with as much as Rs.5.5 billion accumulated by way of a tax called ‘Cess’ meant for the development of the tea industry.

Following the objection by the Minister, the Cabinet deferred the final decision to be taken upon the return of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. (Keum Bandara)
