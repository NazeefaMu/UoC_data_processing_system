AIA Vitality, a new and rewarding platform for healthy living


	



 

Traditionally, insurers provide financial assistance when things go wrong. For example, if you pass away, your death benefits will be paid or if you are hospitalized, your bills will be compensated. AIA Insurance’s game-changing approach is intended at turning this convention around and making the experience a positive one. Instead of the usual ‘if you die-we pay’ model, AIA has found a way to motivate you to get fit, stay healthy and live life to the fullest. 
The AIA Vitality programme, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, is a science-backed wellness programme that provides participants with the knowledge, tools and motivation to improve their health. It’s an easy-to-use application which you can download for free from the Google play-store or the Apple app-store. 
It gives you weekly targets, which can be achieved by staying active, such as working out in the gym, running or quite simply, just walking. If you achieve the weekly targets, you get rewarded with a choice of exciting rewards, including mobile top-ups, movie tickets, discount vouchers from e-tailers and taxi vouchers. 
AIA CEO Pankaj Banerjee emphasized, “AIA Vitality uses extensive science-backed research and behavioural economics, which shows that incentives can work to encourage people towards adopting and sustaining healthier behaviours.” 
He added, “AIA’s mission is to help people live, longer, healthier, better lives. We really want to focus on the customer—on helping them in taking care of their health and wellness. 
Adding on to that Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani said, “Life insurance has always been associated with, well, death and claims. But that’s exactly the perception we want to change. We’re changing the message of ‘you die, we pay’, to ‘we’ll help you live a better life’. The programme has been tremendously successful in other AIA markets and we are excited to launch it in Sri Lanka.”
