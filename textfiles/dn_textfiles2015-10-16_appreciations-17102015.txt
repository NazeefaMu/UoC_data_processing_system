[Appreciations]-17.10.2015


Professor A. V. Suraweera:
A great scholar
Prof. A. V. Suraweera was one of the greatest scholars who rendered an immense service in Sri Lanka in the 20th century. Among the great literary scholars, Professor Suraweera's name shines brilliantly in the field of Sinhala literature.
He was born to a middle class family in a small village known as Korase near Udugampola in the Gampaha district. He was the eldest in a family of five brothers and two sisters. He received his secondary education at Gampaha Government English school. He had shown his scholarly talents even in his young age.
I remember my father speaking proudly of him when he got double promotions every other year. After passing the Senior School Certificate (SSC), he was lucky to gain admission to Royal College. During that period, most Royalists were from affluent families. It was rarely that a child from a remote village entered Royal College.
My parents were not very rich. We had financial difficulties. But my father, being an educated and intelligent person, realizing the value of education, left aside all prospective avenues of money making and spent everything he had on the children's education.
My mother always encouraged this great endeavour. Not only that, he encouraged other parents also to provide their children a sound education. As a result, the poor village named Korase, was lucky to produce doctors, engineers, government servants and teachers in a short period.
Suraweera passed his university entrance examination in 1950 and entered the University of Ceylon, Colombo. In 1952, he shifted to Peradeniya University with the first batch of students. Close association of great scholars in Sri Lankan history such as Prof. D. E. Hettiarachchi, Prof. Gunapala Malalasekera, Dr. Saratchandra and Prof Paranavitana must have helped him in his literary success in later life.
He obtained his BA (Hons) and MA Degrees from Peradeniya University. After five years of teaching at Sri Rahula Vidyalaya, Katugastota, St Joseph's College, Colombo and Ananda College Colombo, he joined Sri Jayawardenepura University in 1961 as a lecturer.
During his university career he spent his first sabbatical year of leave on an Asia Foundation grant at the University of Iowa, USA.
The second at the University of Canterbury, UK on a Full-bright scholarship and finally as a guest professor of Sinhala and Cultural Studies at the SOAS London University.
In 1964, he passed his PhD examination. At the university, he served as Head of Department of Sinhala for 20 years and as Dean of the Faculty of Arts in addition to other responsibilities. He founded the prestigious program, 'Writership and Communication' and served as the first director.
Being a versatile writer both in Sinhala and English he contributed over 60 books on Literature, Culture, History and critical editions of classical texts. He wrote a number of novels, translations, short stories, children's books and numerous scholarly articles.
In 1994, he resigned from the Jayawardenepura University as the Senior Professor of Sinhala after 35 years of service to contest the general elections. He was elected to Parliament and he held the post of Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs for six years, successfully. In recognition of his exceptional literary and cultural achievements, he was awarded the Degree of Dlit (Honours Causa) title of Emeritus Professor by the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, the Presidential National Honour 'Kalakeerthi' and the state literary award 'Sahitya Ratna'.
He served as Director General of the Central Cultural Fund for two years and as Chairman of the National Education Commission for seven years.
He was the Chancellor of the Rajarata University until his demise.
He was 'Lokuputa' to his parents, 'Loku Ayya' to his brothers and sisters, 'Loku Mama' and 'Loku Thatta' to his sons and daughters, 'Loku Seeya' to his grand children and 'Mahacharya' to the whole world.
He was an honest, ardent and true Buddhist who lived according to the teachings of the Buddha. He was kind, loving, simple and honest.
Hatred, ill will and jealously were not in his thoughtful mind.
His demise is an irreparable loss not only to family members but also to the educated society. But even with uncontrollable grief and sorrow, we should admit that life is uncertain and death is certain. He lived peacefully and passed away peacefully.
May he attain the eternal bliss of Nirvana.

Lionel Mendis:
Unforgettable 'sir'
It is with profound sadness I pay tribute to this fine gentleman, coach and inspirational guru to his students, Lionel Mendis.
I recall the fond memories at our Alma Mater - Ananda College and a few individuals who went the extra mile beyond books and studies to instill qualities and moral values in us and molding us to be good human beings.
Our late Principal were Col. G. W. Rajapakse, Lionel Mendis, Eddison Silva, Bandula Galappatti, Tilak Wijesuriya, Ven. Habarakada Indraratne Thera, Ven. Kahatuduwe Hemasiri Thera, Ven. Divyagaha Yasassi Thera to name a few. To date, I firmly believe they had a tremendous influence in our lives and that period was the golden era of our Alma Mater.
I was only an average member of the cricket pool in the different age groups but what Mendis taught and instilled in us was not only cricket. It went leaps and bounds beyond. To be honest and fair, how to dress smartly and walk straight with the chest forward, to share and care for others, to have pride and self respect were some of the things he taught.
I still remember how Mendis used to stand in front of the Shrine Room during daily assembly, immaculately dressed either in white or off white, swede shoes and sporting a copper bangle. He paid attention to minute detail so much so to have the maroon caps with the Ananda crest in the identical colour and boots with special emphasis on crape souls, sweaters etc. He was very particular as to how the team would go out to the field in rows: Captain followed by the Vice Captain, then the players in rows and the keeper. He believed in class and uniformity in everything.
During net practices in 'galoya' (far end of Ananda), he would take the bat to demonstrate the correct way of playing a stroke and get a good bowler to bowl at him and would instruct where to pitch the ball too. For whatever reason if the bowler is able to take his wicket, he would insist that the ball was pitched at the wrong spot creating amusement and laughter in silence among ourselves.
This highly respected coach sacrificed his whole life to cricket and produced some of the finest cricketers Sri Lanka had ever seen in the likes of the stylish and technically perfect opener Charith Senanayake, 1996 World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunge and Brendon Kuruppu to name just a few of the never ending list.
He had been felicitated a few days before his demise and I am more than certain it would have given him a great sense of satisfaction, knowing his commitment and effort was recognized and appreciated.
On behalf of all his students, I sincerely thank the organizers for this noble and timely deed.
I personally know that Anandians scattered the world over are mourning his demise in silence and I for one decided to pen my thoughts of our beloved sir, as the guilt of not keeping in touch with him and not even being able to pay him my last respects, would not have left me for the rest of my life.
We cannot repay you sir for the yeomen service rendered towards Ananda Cricket and for inculcating true values in your students.
You will be fondly remembered by all of us always.
May you attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana, our beloved sir.
