A Pohottuwa Diyawanna politico at a political meeting held on his home turf had reportedly faulted the way his party boss had secured a high office


After making this public statement the politico had held himself incommunicado. He had avoided answering telephone calls by keeping his cellphone switched off.

However, about a week later had called at the party head office with his wife in tow to formally receive the party membership from the boss himself, they say.
