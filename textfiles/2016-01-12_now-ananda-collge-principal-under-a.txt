	Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today ordered that a fresh investigation be launched into allegations made against Ananda College Principal Kithsiri Liyanagamage that he had violated ministry circulars on grade-1 admissions.
	He also confirmed that Royal College Principal Upali Gunasekera had been transferred to the Education Ministry pending an investigation.
	Several complaints had been received that a large number of grade one applicants who were admitted to Ananda College were not from Colombo or the suburbs.
	One of the complaints was that children with adequate qualifications including the distance between home and school have been disregarded by the principal.


	Meanwhile, the minister said a new principal had not yet been appointed to Royal College though there are rumours that Thurstan College Principal B.A. Abeyratne might be appointed as the new Principal of Royal College. (Piyumi Fonseka)Video by Richan
