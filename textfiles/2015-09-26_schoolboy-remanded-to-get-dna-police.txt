The two suspects including the 17-year-old schoolboy who were arrested on suspicion in connection with the rape and murder of Seya Sadevmi were remanded to produce them before the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) and get the DNA test done, police said.
Western Province senior DIG Pujitha Jayasundera said this in response to a question why they were remanded without being questioned in police custody.
We hope to obtain the DNA report carried out on the two suspects who were previously arrested. No one is guilty until they are proved in court,” he said.
 Responding to a question, DIG Jayasundara said any one could take legal action against the police if any injustice had been caused to the suspects.
DIG Jayasundara said the investigations so far have been successful and questioning of the recently arrested suspect Dunesh Priyashantha alias ‘Kondaya has revealed some positive evidence.
He said the suspect Dunesh Priyashantha alias ‘Kondaya will be produced before the court today and subjected to DNA test. (Ajith Siriwardena and Sanath Desmond)
