Buddy is in trouble because he is in double trouble!


	



 

A factory belonging to a thick chum of a onetime powerful politico was sealed some time ago by the authorities for defaulting on tax payments amounting to some Rs.150 million.

 


The factory high-ups are said to be now going after the Provincial Chief to get the factory re-opened without paying the due taxes.


However, the Provincial Chief had put his foot down that the factory would remain sealed until the full tax payment was settled.


Reacting to the Provincial Chief’s firm response, the politico now mud on his face had reportedly told his buddy, “If I were in the saddle, an occasion for you to go after various people with ‘offerings’ would never have arisen!”
