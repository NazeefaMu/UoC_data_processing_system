Ex-Maldives President sentenced to 13 years in prison
	
		 		 
		 
			
Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed has been found guilty of terrorism and sentenced to 13 years in prison for the militarys detention of Criminal Court Chief Judge Abdulla Mohamed in January 2012.
Delivering the verdict at the final hearing of the trial on Friday night, Judge Abdulla Didi said the prosecutions evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that Nasheed ordered the chief judges arrest or forceful abduction.
Nasheed was the architect of the atrocity, Judge Didi said.
The chief judges detention on Girifushi Island was unlawful and unconstitutional, he continued, noting that the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) defied orders from the Criminal Court, High Court and Supreme Court to release the judge.
Judge Didi also said the former president has a criminal record for theft, terrorism, false testimony and disobedience to orders.
While state prosecutors presented closing arguments tonights, Nasheed asked for 20 days to prepare his closing statement, stating he was unable to communicate with lawyers and examine evidence while incarcerated at Dhoonidhoo detention centre.
The former president asked to be transferred to Mal for better access to his lawyers.
He also objected to the hearing taking place on a Friday, noting that it was a public holiday where Muslims were enjoined to worship and spend time with family.
Tonights hearing was scheduled to begin at 8:30pm, but started around 9:15pm. After closing arguments, the judges adjourned proceedings and reconvened around 11:00pm.
Nasheed was smiling when the verdict was read out and shook hands with three of his family members while he was escorted out.
The opposition leaders lawyers have said they intend to appeal the verdict at the High Court. If the lower court ruling is upheld by both the High Court and Supreme Court, Nasheed would not be able to contest the 2018 presidential election.
Home Minister Umar Naseer meanwhile tweeted saying he has asked police to hold [President] Nasheed in Dhoonidhoo Detention Centre until a special unit is constructed in Maafushi Prison.
Nasheed was charged with enforced disappearance under the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1990, which carries a jail term of between 10 to 15 years.
Prior to a hearing on March 9, all four of Nasheeds lawyers quit in protest of the Criminal Courts refusal to grant sufficient time to examine the prosecutions evidence and mount a defence.
The presiding judges had denied the lawyers request for adequate time, stating the legal team has had the case documents for three years.
Judges also insisted in tonights verdict that Nasheed was offered both enough time to prepare his defence and access to lawyers, claiming he refused the opportunity to appoint new lawyers.
Nasheed was first charged in 2012 with arbitrary detention under article 81 of the penal code, which carries either banishment or a jail term of up to three years.
On February 15, Prosecutor General Muhthaz Muhsin withdrew the charges filed at the Hulhumal Magistrate Court. Nasheed was arrested on February 22 shortly after the PG filed terrorism charges at the Criminal Court.
At the previous hearing, Judges Didi, Abdul Bari Yousuf, and Shujau Usman dismissed the opposition leaders repeated requests for legal representation. The judges also refused to hear defence witnesses, claiming they could not negate the prosecutions evidence or witness testimony.
I want a lawyer. This is not a court of law. This is injustice. This is the biggest circus this country has seen in its constitutional history, Nasheed said.
Sit-in
Continuing its daily protests since Nasheeds arrest, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) began a march at the Usfasgandu area of Mal around 4:30pm today with thousands of supporters.
After walking down Majeedhee Magu, protesters split into two groups and staged a sit-down behind police barricades at Orchid Magu and Fareedhee Magu. Both roads lead to the Criminal Court building.
Police escorted Nasheed to court around 8:00pm for the last hearing of his trial. The opposition leader attempted to talk to journalists assembled outside the building, but was blocked by police.
Nasheed told the journalists to stay strong.
Around 8:40pm, according to a live blog on the police website, police said the Criminal Court complained to police of loud noise from loudspeakers on a pickup used by the protesters.
Police said protesters were repeatedly advised to turn down the volume, but refused to comply.
Specialist Operations (SO) officers confiscated the loudspeakers after giving a last warning.
Moreover, police said protesters threw objects at riot police and some people who obstructed police duty were taken into police custody.
A Minivan News journalist near the Salsa restaurant on Orchid Magu observed police using pepper spray indiscriminately and arresting at least six protesters.
When SO officers pushed back protesters with their shields and attempted to take over the pickups, protesters threw bottles at the riot police.
Violent clashes erupted between SO officers and protesters.
One protester was seen bleeding from the head after the clashes. However, SO officers took the pickups away, pushed back protesters and withdrew behind barricades.
Meanwhile, a group of about five young men hurled crude oil at a protest pickup at Fareedhee Magu and vandalised equipment. Police have also confirmed the incident.
The five men were reportedly arrested at the scene.
Police also said a protester was taken to hospital after being pepper sprayed and released after treatment. Police did not specify the nature of the injury.
According to an update on the police blog at 11:40pm, two police officers were attacked near Salsa restaurant and their vehicle was damaged during the assault. A cameramen was also injured and protesters threw bottles at journalists, police said. (minivannews)

Lanka anticipating new governing system: PM
	
Sri Lanka is envisaging a new governing system based on cooperation of all political parties, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told the Indian Premier who addressed the Sri Lankan Parliament that our country was looking for something more than the Westminster System of Governance.
We are looking towards adopting a cooperative style of governance where each political party cooperates in the governance while maintaining their own identities, he said.
He said Sri Lanka had a long history of democracy which dated back to the state council days in 1835. Referring to Resettlement Minister D. M. Swaminathan, Mr. Wickremesinghe said a descendent of a member of the first state council in Sri Lanka was serving as a member in the Sri Lankan Parliament today.
He also said Prime Minister Modis visit to Sri Lanka was a long overdue one and would be a beginning of a new chapter in Indo-Sri Lanka relations. In saying so the Prime Minister ran through the history of Indo Sri Lanka relationship going down to the days of Cholas and Pandians, whose action he said had affected both nations.(Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
