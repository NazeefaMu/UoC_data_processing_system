On the eve of the no confidence motion, a leading purohita in yahapalanaya along with his wife reportedly attended a lime-cutting ritual at a popular devalaya to dispel malefic influences afflicting him. 




The purohita had spent about one hour participating in the ‘Shanti-karma’. Although some newsmen had come to the devalaya on hearing about his presence, the purohita had rushed back to Colombo giving them the miss. 


The purohita is said to be under the strong belief that he is going through a bad spell these days, they say.
