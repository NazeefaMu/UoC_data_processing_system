REUTERS, 05th JUNE, 2017- A prominent opposition leader jailed in Venezuela, Leopoldo Lopez, urged more street protests against the “tyranny” of President Nicolas Maduro, in a video message made in his cell.


Lopez, 46, however stressed several times that he backed only “peaceful” demonstrations.


Prosecutors in Venezuela say 65 people have died since April 1, when near-daily pro- and anti-Maduro rallies turned more violent, with protesters and security forces targeted.


The opposition and anti-Maduro protesters are demanding early elections to force out the widely unpopular president, who has ruled over the country’s sharply declining economy.
