Pakistan players return home with bitter memories

KARACHI: Many of the Pakistani players who went to Bangladesh to appear in the Bangladesh Premier League return home with bitter memories and unhappy at being sidelined by the team owners and management.
Foremost among them is Pakistan's test captain Misbah-ul-Haq who was sidelined by the Rangpur Riders management for his team's last seven matches while preference was given to other foreign signings including Afghanistan's little known Muhammad Nabi.
"I can't say much on this but I guess the team owners and coaches know what is required. But it is not easy sitting on the bench for so long," Misbah said just before his team's knockout game on Sunday night.
Misbah clearly looked upset at his continued exclusion even for the knockout match against Barissal Bulls. His omission has surprised many in the Pakistan cricket circles while others like Kamran Akmal, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Akmal and Wahab Riaz have also returned home not happy at being given the cold shoulder treatment.
"I had made it clear to my franchise owners and management that I wanted to open in the BPL but after just two matches I didn't get any proper response," Kamran said.
"I didn't go there only for the money I went there as I thought the BPL would allow me to further remind the selectors I am doing well," he said.
Pakistan's fast bowler Wahab also decided it was better to return home midway through the BPL and walk the ramp in Lahore than sit and waste his time in Dhaka.
"Obviously it is not easy to be ignored like this for majority matches. It has been tough on Misbah but he has handled himself well," Wahab who also appeared for Rangpur said.
Wahab had joined the BPL on December 1st after the Pakistan and England series along with Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Akmal, Sohail Tanvir and Muhammad Hafeez.
Fast bowler Sohail Khan also got just one match for Dhaka Gladiators during his three week stay in Bangladesh while Pakistan's spin stalwart Saeed Ajmal was also played in just two matches and then dumped on the sidelines.
A total of around 17 players from Pakistan were signed by the BPL franchises but only left arm pacer Muhammad Aamir enjoyed himself playing in all their matches for Chittagong PTI
