Sustaining its recognition as a knowledge partner for its stakeholders, DFCC Bank is proud to be the Exclusive Banking Partner and Platinum Sponsor for a full-day programme by Harvard Prof. Boris Groysberg, which is scheduled to take place on 24th April 2018 at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand. 

As the exclusive banking partner for this globally significant event, DFCC Bank takes pride in being a part of this knowledge transformation drive. The Bank’s focus on creating value and growth opportunities for its employees echoes the objectives that this high profile event will achieve. 

The Bank has always been an advocate of building people and their management capabilities and it has a strong belief that good leaders can get the best from their people.

Titled ‘Best of Harvard for Sri Lankan CEOs and their Executive Teams’, the programme features keynote speaker Harvard Business School Professor Boris Groysberg who will share secrets of success of world-class business leaders and the skills required for great leadership. 

A total of twenty six handpicked key talents from the Bank who have the potential to become future leaders have been identified to participate in order to provide them with new perspectives and tools to lead more effectively. Participants will be able to explore the latest business theories and strategic tools through hands-on exercises, interactive lectures and dynamic discussions and master the fundamental thinking that will set them apart as strategic leaders. 

Commenting on the partnership, Lakshman Silva – CEO, DFCC Bank, said, “We are pleased to add value to Sri Lanka’s corporate leadership by supporting this laudable leadership programme. DFCC Bank is also delighted to welcome reputed Harvard Professor Boris Groysberg to Sri Lanka. We believe this session will be extremely insightful for the employees of DFCC Bank. At DFCC, we believe in creating growth opportunities for the future leaders of this county and we believe our association of this high impact programme will infuse greater value to enhance business dynamics in the country. We are proud to facilitate this fantastic learning opportunity for our selected staff and for the rest of Sri Lanka’s corporate leaders.”

DFCC Bank believe that a programme of this nature is essential for their future leaders. In a dynamic and challenging industry such as banking, learning new leadership and management practices that impact organisational effectiveness can help support strategy and improve organisational execution and performance. Hence, this programme will facilitate the staff to provide sustainable solutions to the customers guided by the Bank’s core values of being innovative, customer centric, professional, ethical, accountable, team oriented and socially responsible.

Customer horizons will be enhanced and the trained staff will be able to deliver highest service quality through hard work, financial advice and business ethics and disciplines which will help customers reach their goals and aspirations.

In addition, inculcating the culture of accountability is a challenge for most leaders which is why DFCC has been investing in programmes of this nature to build accountable leaders who will serve the customers with the utmost professional financial advice. With this in mind, the Bank is hopeful that knowledge shared during the programme would result in building a long standing partnership with the Bank’s key stakeholders, the valuable customers. 

DFCC Bank also has in place a series of customised in-house programmes to continuously improve the leadership and managerial capabilities of the Bank’s talent pool. The Bank recently held a large-scalelong-term in-house programme customised specifically for 23 members of the leadership team. The programme included one-on-one 360 feedback surveys based on which individual development plans were prepared and a formal coaching process with internationally renowned coaches were assigned to each participant
