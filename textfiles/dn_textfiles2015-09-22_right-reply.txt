Right of reply

In a response to our lead story on Tuesday titled ‘SLFP Rebels Accept Sampanthan’ UPFA MP Prasanna Ranatunge said he only described the reasons why his group was not opposing the appointment of R. Samapanthan as the opposition leader, in the current context.
Ranatunge said his comments did not mean that the group had decided to accept Sampanthan as the opposition leader.
According to Ranatunge the group’s request was to appoint Kumara Welgama as the opposition leader. The SLFP MP in statement stated that as the Speaker had already appointed Sampanthan as the opposition leader, what he meant was that a tussle for the post would only convey a wrong message to the international community.
Corroborating other details in the story, Ranatunge stated that his group will closely monitor the conduct of the opposition leader and if Sampanthan fails to fulfill his duties, the group will make a decision on the matter.
Ranatunge stressed that Sampanthan should fulfill duties as the opposition leader in Parliament without just confining himself to the affairs of his own party.
