“Teaching isn’t merely a profession; rather it’s a service to the country.” However, it’s very rare to see the  teachers being felicitated for their services. There’s no other big pleasure for teachers than to see their students become illustrious people. Teachers make a vital contribution in identifying and honing the talents of their students. These teachers are leaders and tailor-made for this task.  Teachers always inspire, empower and guide their students. As such, it’s always essential to felicitate the shepherds of our lives at least once a year.   


Mahanama College, one of the leading schools in Colombo, gave a great example last Sunday (July 29) with regard to honouring its teachers. This event was titled  ‘Mahanamabiwandana’. At the event the founders of the school, principals, teachers and parents were  commemorated.   


The event, organized by the Old Boys Association (OBA) of the school, was held under the guidance of OBA Chief Executive Officer Indunil Silva. This event is a concept of one of the school’s past head prefects Kumara Galhenage   

The agenda at the event also included an alms-giving for 100 Buddhist monks


The school teachers who were dedicated and committed in their service were admired and presented with gifts and souvenirs by the old boys.   


The agenda at the event also included an alms-giving for 100 Buddhist monks and a lunch for the entire school its teachers. Meals were prepared by 13 chefs who are alumni of the school.

A health camp was also organised by the OBA with the participation of 28 medical officers, past students of Mahanama College. Nutrition guides, medical checkups and essential medicines were provided to the teachers in the staff and those who had retired.   


In addition, a blood donation campaign was organised thanks to the initiative of the 2004 batch. It was held at the school premises. The purpose of this ‘Amisa Pooja’ was to bless the late, retired and present teachers of the school. This event was conducted with the support of the Blood Bank of the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital (SJGH). The organisers of the event donated 100 pints of blood to the National Blood Centre.   


Mahanama College, founded in 1954, has produced many intellectuals and professionals.
