But he got no answer.


	


	
	They shy away from him in day light! The deposed strongman participated in a series of religious ceremonies held in Polonnaruwa last week under the ongoing the image refurbishing program organised by his political well-wishers.

Despite there being a few black flags flying here and there, all ceremonies organized had been held as planned.  When arrangements were being made to hold a Pinkama under this program at a leading Buddhist temple in the district, a politico at the provincial level had advised the chief monk against holding the Pinkama at the temple and suggested that venue be shifted to his party office.
Later the chief monk had arrived at the new venue carrying a Buddha statue where a large group of devotees were waiting. And the Pinkama had got underway after the participants performing the customary religious observances before the Buddha statue placed on an improvised stand.  The deposed strongman also had attended the Pinkama, but only one Diyawanna member from the province was present, they say.
Pinkama over, the deposed strongman had checked into a hotel owned by a former Deputy for the night.
A number of Diyawanna members who were conspicuous by their absence at the Pinkama are said to have called on their former boss at the hotel under the cover of the night.
