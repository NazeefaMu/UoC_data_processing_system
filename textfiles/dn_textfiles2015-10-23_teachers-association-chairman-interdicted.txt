Teachers' Association Chairman interdicted

Sri Lanka Guru Sangamaya Chairman Priyantha Fernando has been interdicted from the Teachers Service for travelling abroad by obtaining leave approved in contravention of the AR and FR Regulations.
He had been interdicted from service twice earlier for not performing his duties as a teacher even for a single day. It is also alleged that Priyantha Fernando's wife who is also a teacher had stuck to a single school in Anuradhapura town continuously for nine years without getting transferred by allegedly misusing the trade union powers of her husband.
Other Principals and teachers in the area had been critical about the arbitrary actions of these two people. They alleged that Priyantha Fernando spearheaded protest campaigns to sabotage the education development plan initiated by NCP Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne when he was Provincial Education Minister.
Although he was under interdiction and a disciplinary inquiry he had been reinstated by the new Provincial Education Minister K.H. Nandasena notwithstanding opposition from teachers and many other quarters.
Anuradhapura Zonal Education Director Kumudini Ariyawansa could not be contacted for her comments on the interdiction of Priyantha Fernando.
