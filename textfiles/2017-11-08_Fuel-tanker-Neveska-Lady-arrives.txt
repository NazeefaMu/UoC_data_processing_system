Bringing a ray of hope to those inconvenienced by the ongoing fuel shortage, the fuel tanker ‘Neveska Lady’ entered Sri Lankan territorial waters carrying a stock of 40, 000 metric tonnes of petrol a short while ago, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage told Daily Mirror.

She said that soon after the quality checking process is over the stock of fuel would be unloaded and distributed to filling stations.

Further, she said that although panic had been created among the people due to false propaganda, ministry officials and those from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) had managed to successfully deliver the emergency stocks available with the government to minimize the inconvenience caused to the public.

According to her the shipment that had arrived contained 32, 750 metric tonnes of 92 Octane petrol and 7,500 metric tonnes of 95 Octane petrol.

According to sources at the CPC the quality checking process needed around 10 hours to complete while unloading the fuel stock would take a minimum of 18 hours to complete.

Meanwhile, it was reported that the stock that had been received was only sufficient for 15 days. However, another fuel tanker would be arriving from Singapore in the next couple of days. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
