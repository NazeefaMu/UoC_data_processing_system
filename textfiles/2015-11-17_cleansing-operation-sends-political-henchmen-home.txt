Cleansing operation sends political henchmen home


	


A cleansing operation is underway these days in a Ministry tasked with playing a major role in shaping up the country’s economy, they say.
The operation is being directed by the country’s administrative nerve centre itself. Orders have already been issued for the removal of certain unqualified political henchmen appointed to high positions in the statutory bodies coming under this Ministry. The purohita holding the portfolio is said to be highly perturbed over the removal of his appointees even without intimation to him.  By the way, while assigning the highly responsible key portfolio, the new strongman had told this purohita that he could opt for any other portfolio if he so desired, they say.
