HSBC Sri Lanka has once again been recognised for its digital capabilities by winning the Best Consumer Digital Bank Country award by Global Finance at the Best Digital Bank Awards 2017, and this is the 11th time that HSBC has won this prestigious award.
Currently, around 77 percent of the total Retail Banking transactions of HSBC Sri Lanka are being performed through its automated channels including HSBC Online Banking, HSBC Easy Pay and ATM network. 


HSBC’s Online Banking platform is built on world-class technology with high security and equipped to perform a range of banking services such as balance enquiries, online statement viewing, transferring of funds between own or third party accounts to bill payments and management of personal accounts (i.e. canceling any direct debits, amending standing orders and other). These capabilities were further enhanced with the launch of HSBC’s Mobile Banking App earlier this year, enabling customers to access their accounts on-the-go. Through the Mobile Banking app, HSBC has introduced a Digital Secure Key and access through Touch ID. HSBC is one of the few banks to provide biometric authentication through the Touch ID feature for Apple iPhone users and to facilitate two-factor authentication using the Digital Secure Key, which is a 
first in the market.


Furthermore, through the launch of the HSBC’s Mobile App, the bank provides an extra layer of security for mobile banking customers with features such as transaction data signing for third party payments. These features also allow HSBC customers the convenience of banking from anywhere at any time with peace of mind.


“Safety is of paramount importance to our customers, as they share a lot of personal and transaction information with us and trust us to keep it safe. 


As their banking partner, we have a moral obligation and responsibility towards this and this is why we apply the highest security standards. HSBC’s online banking is a safe digital platform that offers convenience and ease of use for customers to bank from anywhere in the world. 


Similarly, our online banking platform is built with safety features that enables customers to transfer money securely and conveniently between bank accounts at ease. Thus, we are honoured to have been recognised by Global Finance yet again and take pride in knowing that this gives our customers the added trust to bank with us through our digital channels.” stated, HSBC Sri Lanka Retail Banking and Wealth Management Country Head Nadeesha Senaratne.
