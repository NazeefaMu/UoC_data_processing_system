A flop at a cost!
	

A fair member of the Northern Council took the initial steps to launch a new radical political party. Later making a public announcement about her decision, she also called upon the Tamil diaspora to extend financial assistance to lay a strong foundation for the new party.

Her appeal for financial backing had received a ready response from the diaspora and monies she had received, according to Northern sources, had exceeded Rs. 20 million.
Inspired by this encouraging response, the council member had made elaborate arrangements at a considerable cost to hold the inaugural meeting of the political party at a spacious hall in Jaffna.
However, the number of people that turned up at this inaugural meeting organized at a high cost had been less than 25!
The highly dejected fair member is reportedly looking for ways and means of winning the public support for her new party, they say.

A grand lunch in vain!
	

There is a top team member known to be vying for the leadership of his political party. All in the party concede that he is a hard-working politico.

By the way, despite having his roots in the city, this top team member has chosen to represent a remote area in the country.
The Politico recently attended a series of public functions in Rajarata and later in response to an invitation to lunch accepted earlier, arrived at the residence of a party activist in the area along with all guests from Colombo.
The party activist, who considered it a great privilege to host to lunch a distinguished VIP- possibly a head of state- in- waiting, had prepared a sumptuous meal of over forty delicious dishes  a feast good enough for a king. So, it was a glorious moment for him and his family members when the political stalwart sat down to partake at the meal.
However, what happened next gave them a shock.
When others began eating, the most distinguished guest made a signal to one of his security guards, who soon produced a plastic box and a bottle of water in front of him.
The political stalwart opened the plastic box, took out a sandwich and started eating.
The lunch over, the politico said goodbye to the sad-looking host and his family members, profusely thanking them for their hospitality, they say.

A young Green with a chip on his shoulder!
	

A young Green Diyawanna member is said to be in a sulk these days for failing to get the electorate organizer post he had been asking for, for a long time.

This young Colombo District member had long been aspiring to be the Chief Organizer of an electorate North of the Metropolis, which had once been a stronghold of his father. However, the party leadership has reportedly turned a deaf ear to his persistent request.
Adding insult to injury, an organizer from another electorate had recently opened with much fanfare a road stretch he himself had developed utilizing his budgetary allocation.
The party leadership, according to him, had even ignored the complaint he made to them regarding this injustice.
Now the Diyawanna member is said to be going around telling all and sundry, that he would have been a happier man if he had stuck to his profession, the practice of medicine.

Advice leads to more quibbling!
	

The Pohottuwa mastermind is said to be giving pep talks to members of local bodies these days.

He is reportedly drawing an analogy between himself as the partys guiding light and the position of a school Principal by way of offering important advice to these members.
At these meetings the Pohottuwa boss would tell them:
I am like a Principal managing a school with over 3,000 children on its roll. One child might complain that someone had forcibly taken something he owns. Another child would accuse yet another of beating him up for no reason. Practically every child would have some complaint to make against another child. I do not want you people to make complaints against one another like school children. Hereafter, dont come to me to make any allegation against another member. You ought to know how to work together in a spirit of give-and-take!
There are some members, they say, who even after listening to this advice, would pick up a row with another member saying:
Lokka, no doubt, meant that advice for me because you must have carried a tale against me to him!

Afghanistan army helicopter crash kills all 25 on board
	
Officials say an Afghan army helicopter carrying senior officials has crashed, killing all 25 on board, Aljazeera reported.
Naser Mehri, a spokesman for the governor of western Farah province, said two army helicopters were on their way to neighbouring Herat province when one lost control.
Among the dead were the deputy army corps commander for western Afghanistan and head of the Farah provincial council, Mehri said.
Provincial council member Dadullah Qaneh said the helicopter hit a mountain peak in poor weather en route to neighbouring Herat province.
A Taliban spokesperson said fighters belonging to the armed group shot it down.
Senior Afghan government and military officials often travel by helicopter in regions where the Taliban has a large presence.

Air pollution kills 600,000 children each year: WHO
	

Hindustan Tim es, Oct 30, 2018- Exposure to toxic air both indoors and out kills some 600,000 children under the age of 15 each year, the World Health Organization warned Monday. 
Data from the UN health body shows that every day, 93% of children under the age of 15 -- a full 1.8 billion youngsters, including 630 million under the age of five -- breath dangerously polluted air. 
This has tragic consequences: In 2016 alone, some 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air, the WHO report found.  Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. This is inexcusable. Every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfil their full potential. 
According to WHO data, more than nine out of 10 people on the planet breath dangerously toxic air, causing some seven million premature deaths each year.

aircraft had instrument problems on previous flight
	

An Indonesian passenger jet which crashed into the sea with 189 people on board had logged unreliable readings of altitude and airspeed on its previous flight, according to an aviation safety website.
The Boeing 737 MAX 8, operated by budget carrier Lion Air, crashed on Monday about 13 minutes after take-off from Jakartas Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.
Officials have said they are not expecting to find any survivors.
Website aviation-safety.net said the previous flight of the aircraft, from Denpasar to Jakarta, showed erratic values in altitude and airspeed immediately after take-off.
A technical log for that flight, obtained by the website read: Airspeed unreliable and alt disagree shown after take off.
Lion Air chief executive Edward Sirait confirmed to dpa Tuesday the plane experienced the issues reported by the website on its previous flight, but the problems were resolved overnight. Asked by dpa whether the plane experienced the same issues on the doomed flight, Sirait said: Lets wait for the investigation by KNKT, referring to the National Transportation Safety Committee.  
Aviation-safety.net said the Lion Air flight that crashed also showed similar erratic values. Altitude data sent via ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) continue to show an erratic pattern, varying roughly between 4500 and 5350 feet. The values then rapidly decline until contact is lost at 06:32 hours, it said.
Sirait said on Monday that the pilot, an Indian national with 6,000 flying hours, requested to return to the airport because of an unspecified problem.

CHANGE IS UNCOMFORTABLE
	

A senior and experienced SC Judge has been appointed Chief Justice



For most of us, change is uncomfortable but more often than not inevitable!!! Change is uncomfortable but that does not mean it is not worth it, we find our President and Prime Minister both urging a change in almost every area of our lives!!!
For a change, a senior and experienced SC Judge has been appointed Chief Justice and we pray the wheels of justice will NOT GRIND EXCEEDINGLY SMALL ANY MORE!!! Starting with school children, Ranil urges everyone to shed political differences and work together to face the economic crisis which, according to him and the President is global!!! In the context of the economic crisis, it would be good to see the President, Prime Minister and other Ministers cutting down on their foreign trips and the size of their entourage!!!
It would be a lesson well accepted by the people who are being asked to tighten their belts!!! No matter how bad the economy is, the jet-setting never ceases!!! Why should only the people be asked to tighten their belts, shouldnt an example be set by the hierarchy With everyone talking about the two vehicles at 600 Million each for the President and Ranil and the latter using a helicopter to jet himself to Parliament; these accusations should be countered when they are made in Parliament!!! Ministers have a right to bring them up and Ranil has an equal right to defend himself!!! Why doesnt he Change is definitely uncomfortable and inevitable but we would like to see those who are advocating change institute the changes themselves first!!!



Who is Mr Clean
Our President had asked a very astute and worthwhile question in Mahara  How Many Politicians Can Truthfully Say They Are Clean We are all waiting with bated breath to hear the reply to that!!! Will it ever come we wonder It will be very interesting if it does, but the common man may never hear it, you should have asked it on a different platform, Mr. President!!!



Who are the Angels
Talking of change, our President has indeed demonstrated radical change, he is all over like a rash these days!!! Inspecting this, touring that, openings here and there, functions everywhere!!! We cannot, however, call for changes only in the hierarchy; we have also got to think in terms of change as a nation!!! There is so much change that can be effected in our lives; our outlook on life, the way we act and react, our concern for others, especially the poor and underprivileged; all this could contribute towards making us a great nation!!! In the Health Sector have we ever heard of any one of our surgeons performing a life-saving surgery or an operation to help a crippled FREE of Charge
It happens in other countries and these surgeons are looked on as angels and miracle workers for the concern they demonstrate to humankind!!! In our country you not only have to pay to see them but you have to pay to show them the reports of the tests they ordered!!! In the housing sector, we have seen only Sajith Premadasa involved in low-cost housing for the desperately poor and homeless. How many of us volunteered when 57,000 were left homeless with the recent floods Did we spare a thought, a meal, make a contribution They are our people after all!!! When houses in Castlereagh collapsed like a pack of cards, did anyone show concern



Rewarded
Now we have one of the greatest cricketers of our land joining the criminal brigade, but then again he is innocent till proven guilty!!! Namal Kumara alleges that there is a lot more to be exposed and we can certainly hope he does!!! No matter what, wrongdoers must be brought to book. Not allowed to escape; as is happening so often in this country!!! The wanted DIG failed to appear but is finally behind bars and we wonder how many more will go into the already boiling pot of intrigue and deceit At least one man was rewarded for his courage in standing up to his superiors when the lorry driver he arrested was released due to pressure from above!!! The President awarded Sergeant Sanath Gunawardena and his family Rs. 1 million in recognition of his services though he went berserk in Thebuwana when his superiors released the lorry driver!!! He showed his contempt and anger at the injustice of what they had done



Decadent, Decadent
What is our Educational System coming to when parents and a student from a well-recognized college were assaulted in the Principals Office Is there no law-and-order in the system to prevent this kind of decadent behaviour Who can they complain to Will the culprits be dealt with and how



Congratulations CJ
Our new CJ certainly seems to be heading in the right direction, affirming that no personal favours will be encouraged in his office  Congratulations, and more power to you Sir for taking serious note of the plight of the poor whose cases have dragged on and on!!! What an infinitely praiseworthy Judiciary it would be if more Judges actually took note of the sorrows and hardships of the poor man!!! We can only hope that the shining example you set will be followed by one and all, adding lustre, not heaping condemnation on the most sacred office  the Judiciary!!! May your shadow never grow less!!!

Conservation Biologist says Sri Lanka is off-track
	
Dr. Eric Wikramanayake, Chair of the Environment Foundation Ltd, is a Conservation Biologist with over 25 years of experience throughout Asia working on ecosystem based approaches to reducing climate change vulnerabilities and assessing e-flows. He was a senior conservation scientist with the World Wildlife Fund. He was also a senior advisor with the Biodiversity and Wildlife Programme at RESOLVE and consultant conservation advisor to the Asian Development Banks Greater Mekong Subregion Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Project (GMS-BCC project). In an engaging interview with the Daily Mirror he aired his views on some of the crucial environment issues that affect the planet. Excerpts.
Sustainable development is also predicated on environmental and ecosystem resilience
	Instead of having a monsoon spread out over several months we now have very intense rainfall events that are experienced within a short period of time
	Filling of wetlands is illegal. Its ironic that many of the Government buildings in Colombo are built on wetlands.
	We need education and awareness for us to be more responsible and civic conscious.
	Coral reefs are extremely important in terms of coastal defense, resilience building against climate change, sustainable livelihood and contribution to the economy.
Q What are the main environmental issues that affect Sri Lanka 
We are losing our natural resources. We are losing our forests and coral reefs. There is conversion in a very ad hoc and unplanned way which is going to threaten the future of the ecosystem services that support people and the development agenda. This is not just about forest conservation. This is about ecosystem degradation. Unless we plan our development in such a way that we integrate ecosystem conservation into the development plans, development is going to be unsustainable especially because climate change is also being felt. Its going to be worse and even more intense in the future which is going to effect the people. The conservation message now isnt about elephants, leopards or bears. Its about protecting ecosystems and ecosystem functions. If you do that you will take care of all the species. So we need to think about systems now and not just species. 
Q Do you think Sri Lanka is on the right track when it comes to conserving the environment 
We arent on the right track. Our priority is all mixed up. We are still focusing on species. If you open a newspaper and look at what the conservation messaging is, its about species. No ones talking about whats happening in terms of what the consequences of the degradation and conversion and loss of ecosystems and ecosystem functions will be, not just to species, but also to people- their livelihood, their lives and economic goals of the country. We are living the conservation paradigms of the past. 
The world is changing. The threats have changed and are changing. No ones addressing those issues. 
We arent on the right track. Our priority is all mixed up. We are still focusing on species. If you open a newspaper and look at what the conservation messaging is, its about species. No ones talking about whats happening in terms of consequences of the degradation and loss of ecosystems
Q In terms of climate change, where do you think Sri Lanka stands 
Sri Lanka is very vulnerable. The World Bank has released a report on climate change hot spots and Sri Lanka is one of them. There are large areas of land especially in the North, North Central and North Western provinces which are considered hot spots. The general prediction for Sri Lanka is that there will be an increase in temperature. The wet zone will get wetter and the dry zone will become drier. We are seeing the impact now. There has been a very acute drought in the dry zone. People in Anuradhapura dont have water. Farmers have lost their crops for four years in a row. 
The predictability of the monsoons is now being lost. Farmers need to know when to plant. They have been dependent on knowing when the monsoon will set in. When they dont know that, there is trouble. Fishermen dont know when to go to sea. Think about large sports events like a Test match. There is a huge investment in terms of money. If you cant predict when there will be rain or when the monsoon will end, how can you do it with any kind of accuracy Plants and animals depend on seasonality to reproduce. Now they dont know when those seasonal triggers will occur. 
Q Most often than not development projects affect the environment. How do you strike a balance between development projects and protecting the environment 
Thats exactly the point. We have to be able to strike that balance. The development organiaations, agencies and the ministries that are tasked with the development project have to work with ecologists. Sustainable development is also predicated on environmental and ecosystem resilience. In fact ecosystems are much more important now to build climate resilience. Unless you take care of that, any kind of development that you do, is going to be vulnerable. Look at whats happening now. There are express ways and large infrastructure. They drown every time there is a flood. Theyve not considered the root causes that are creating the problems. 
We have a National Climate Adaptation Plan. We are on our third plan. But its not being implemented. Its not being adapted. The adaptation plan includes ecosystem based adaptation as a strategy to increase resilience and reduce vulnerabilities. Just take the past few years as an example. When there were floods what was the Governments reaction Its basically to provide food, water and clothing to people affected by floods. What have they done since then Basically nothing. So we dont have an adaptation plan (put into practice), when in fact there is a plan. 
Q What loopholes do you see in Sri Lankas Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 
One of the biggest problems with the EIA is that the EIA is commissioned by the developer. The developer pays the consultants. So obviously they will do an EIA that suits the developer. Ideally the developer should bank the money with the CEA for instance, and the CEA should hire the consultants. Then the EIA can be done in an independent and impartial manner. 
Q Deforestation is one of the most pressing issues. What are the consequences of deforestation and encroachment 
If you take deforestation in mountain areas, and remove the forests those slopes are going to be vulnerable to erosion and landslides. Climate change has given rise to a pattern of intense rainfall. So instead of having a monsoon thats spread out over several months we now have very intense rainfall events that are experienced within a short period of time. All that rainfall causes floods downstream. If you have forests much of that rainfall is absorbed into the ground. 
The predictability of the monsoons is now being lost. Farmers need to know when to plant. They have been dependent on knowing when the monsoon will set in. When they dont know that, there is trouble. Fishermen dont know when to go to sea. Think about large sports events like a Test match. There is a huge investment in terms of money.
We need to take very careful stock on what were doing with our forests. We need to be very strategic about what kinds of development we can initiate. If you want to build a road, you can build a road. There are now engineering designs and techniques that allow you to do it with the minimum impact. So you can maintain both human connectivity and ecological connectivity. There are designs where you can build elevated roads so that wildlife and water flow can take place under, and people can drive their cars or walk over. So it accommodates both human connectivity and ecological connectivity. And it makes the infrastructure more resilient. You wont have a flood that wipes that entire road or expressway. Yes. It does cost a bit more. But it costs even more to go back and repair it. 
Q Our mangrove forests are depleting. What is the importance of mangroves 
A lot of mangroves in Sri Lanka are being cleared to build aqua culture prawns. Historically we have seen that prawn farms are short lived and not sustainable. Within five years disease sets in and the prawn farms are abandoned. If you look at the coastal landscape from Mundalam to Puttalam for instance, the mangroves were cleared back in the 1980s. They started prawn farms. They did not last long. This is a phenomena not only in Sri Lanka, but elsewhere in Asia too. So prawn farms are not sustainable. 
Once you clear the mangroves you lose an important nursery where you have the shrimp, the crab and the fish. If you have the mangroves youre sustaining the fishery off-shore. If you google search the mangrove protection programme in Fiji for instance, they are very strict about conserving mangrove because the communities have realised the importance of having those mangroves to sustain the fishery. We went to Vidattaltivu which is a nature reserve near Mannar. There is a plan to clear 3000 hectares of mangrove. This is our largest mangrove forest. If you talk to the fishermen, there is an artisanal fishery just off-shore. They have realised that it is those mangrove areas that sustain the fishery. So they wont touch the mangrove. If some company comes and clears the mangrove and pitch in prawn farms, in five years thatll be ruined. The viability of those ponds will be lost in about five years. That company will make money and leave while those poor fishermen will be left stranded with no livelihood. That entire ecosystem is going to be destroyed. The reason they want to clear that mangrove and put in prawn farms is to increase productivity, so they can tap into the European market which has increased our fish quota after the GSP + restrictions were lifted. But if you read the GSP+ regulations it says that you cannot violate any international covenants and conventions. Clearing those mangrove forests will be a clear violation of our commitments to the Convention on Biodiversity. 
Q How do you conserve coral reefs which are considered precious 
Way back in the 1960s and 1970s when you went down Galle Road to Hikkaduwa, you saw large piles of corals stacked along the roadside. People used them to make calcium carbonate for the building industry. All these coral reefs are gone. They are also a big tourist attraction. There was potential to have a sustainable and highly lucrative tourism industry. Coral reefs and mangroves are the first line of defense against storm and wave surges which are now going to increase with climate change. We see an increase in the number of high intense cyclones, tornadoes and hurricanes with climate change. Its a pattern that is very clear. 
After the coral reefs, mangroves and sand dunes were removed there is now coastal erosion which affects many people. Sri Lankas coast lines are highly populated. So coral reefs are extremely important in terms of coastal defense, resilience building against climate change, sustainable livelihood and contribution to the economy. 
Q What are the possible adverse consequences of coastal degradation 
First and foremost were losing land. The infrastructure along the coast such as the railways are now threatened. The coastal areas are some of the densely populated areas in Sri Lanka. Those people will be displaced. Where are they going to go Most of them are fisherfolk. They cant go very far inland because they lose their livelihood. Then there are hotels along the coast. Sri Lanka is still promoted as a sun and sand, beach kind of destination. So we are losing that opportunity as well. 
Q Wetland areas in Colombo are decreasing. What is the importance of wetland areas and what are the consequences of losing wetlands 
Wetlands have its own biodiversity. Wetlands serve a really important ecological service by helping to ameliorate the impacts of floods. When you fill the wetlands, those flood waters then spread out across the city and affects much of the urban infrastructure. Theres a huge economic cost as well. Wetlands are extremely important, but they also have to be managed because they are dynamic systems. The Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation (SLLDC) has proposed that the Colombo wetlands be declared a Ramsa site (Ramsa is an international covenant to protect and conserve wetlands). This is commendable. But they are also allowing others to fill lands illegally. This should be condemned. There was also a Cabinet Paper recently to conserve all the wetlands in the Colombo Metropolitan area and have the Department of wildlife take them over and protect them. Filling of wetlands is illegal. Its ironic that many of the Government buildings in Colombo are built on wetlands. 
After the coral reefs, mangroves and sand dunes were removed there is now coastal erosion which affects many people. Sri Lankas coast lines are highly populated. So coral reefs are extremely important in terms of coastal defense, resilience building against climate change, sustainable livelihood and contribution to the economy
Q What are the sustainable ways in which urban and industrial waste can be disposed of 
Plastic has to be recycled. We have to reduce, reuse and recycle. There are innovative ways to recycle and reuse plastic. We need to learn from other countries and come up with our own ideas. There are many innovative people here who can come up with ideas. But implementation and enforcement are problems. The CEA brought a ban on the use of polythene. They have not been able to implement its enforcement very effectively. We need education and awareness for us to be more responsible and civic conscious. 
Q What role does the public play regarding decisions made by politicians which affect the environment 
A section of the public tries its best to lobby and object. I think our messaging needs to be clearer and must be tailored for the policy makers to understand as well. There has to be a dialogue. There needs to be a forum for that dialogue. Right now there is no forum because politicians dont listen to the public. Politicians need to understand that there are fairly decent strategic plans, work plans and action plans usually done by competent technical people. So follow those plans instead of catering to a few voters. They are basically putting the entire country in jeopardy in an effort to gain votes. This is not fair.

Constitutional Crisis: The Selfie of a corrupt, putrid and nauseating political culture
	
The Constitutional and political deadlock engendered by the sacking of the Prime Minister of the Republic by the President by Extra Ordinary Gazette and naming former strongman as new PM shows all the omens of blowing in to a crisis leading to bloodshed and long term turmoil for a country already reeling from low economic progress, problems of governance, accountability issues , rule of law, etc. The initial reaction, on my part at least, being suddenly startled by firecrackers last Friday Night was that the President was still having an old copy of the Constitution - pre 19th Amendment. Later it turned out that it was not the case and whoever had given legal advice to the President had intimated that it was lawful and Constitutional to sack the Prime Minister, in a jiffy, just like that. 
Now that we are reassured that it was not indeed an old copy of the Constitution sans the 19th Amendment that President had, the legality behind the move comes under scrutiny. It is common knowledge that the notorious 18th Amendment heaped up unbelievable and fearsome power on the President, making it simply a matter of inking a few words by the President in terms of appointment as well as removal of the PM, a mere constitutional scarecrow. But when the Constitution was amended for the 19th time, it pruned most of the draconian powers concentrated on the Executive President, making the seat of the PM relatively powerful with appointment as well as the removal of the PM, thereby, not dependent on the arbitrary decision of the President. One hardly needs to enter the constitutional legal melee as the situation was very clearly portrayed by none other than the President himself, a few weeks ago, when he said that what people had to watch for in a future election was not the Presidency but the Premiership as that was where all the power was. 
Yet, a few weeks is a long, long time, isnt it 
Back-stab politics
The apologists of the Presidential move say it is both constitutional and ethical that the hitherto PM was sacked. Yet the manner in which the UPFA broke ranks with the UNP is startlingly similar to the Maithri crossover in November 2014. For a consensual or national government , which was based on an MOU, it was nothing but a Coup that the Maithri faction broke away from the deal, writing a letter to the Speaker with a copy to President and not to the leader of the main party of the Unity Government. It sheds light on a dark and shady side of politics that has now become the rule rather than the exception, where betrayal, backstabbing, discourtesy and down right trickery are the arts to be mastered for success. It did violence to the very norm of coalition governance where a constituent party if it desires to leave a coalition, has the courtesy of informing the other as to their intentions. Such universally accepted conduct which is part and parcel of modern democratic governance holds no attraction to those who are hell bent only on power. 
The ugly scenes unfolding right in the middle of the capital city, push to oblivion the salutary and progressive ideals that the 19th Amendment as well as many other progressive measures in terms of guaranteeing adherence to representative democracy instead of whims and fancies of despots; it screams at the collective conscience of the law abiding and progressive minded people telling them that Democratizing a tribalized nation is now as elusive as a mid summer nights dream! 
Standing judgement
Ranil Wickremesinghe and his cohorts hardly championed the aspirations of the January 8 mandate, which now they say was brought about by a sacrificial handing over of Presidency to the common candidate. We agree; but what for To allow chums to rob the Central Bank To allow plunderers from the former Bosss bandwagon to go scot-free To enter in to deals with the corrupt and the crooked Not at all. To democratize a society ruled under an iron fist in keeping with the exigencies of a brutal and bloody war! To bring in integration of and reconciliation with the minorities alienated themselves from the majority due to the scars of civil war! To build a society and a mode of governing based on universally accepted norms of good governance. They did not do that. On that account they deserve a thumping kick in the back and out of power. 
Yet it is at an election that the Yahapalana click should stand judgement; not by the whimsical fancy of one person under the pretext of escaping assassination by changing PMs. Or it is with the ability to command support in the Parliament. Lenin once referred to the Parliament as the pig sty; indeed a pig sty the Sri Lankan Parliament is in every sense! The ugly horse trading of MP s during the No Confidence motion bears testimony to the putrid nature of Parliamentary politics. Yet it is better than the whim of a despot, at least! 
Constitutional framework
The pillage, plunder, looting and murderous deeds of the dark decade as well as the roguish deals of the post 2015 rule are anti-democratic, unethical and criminal! Mahinda Rajapaksa paid the price for his misdeeds. Ranil should, in the same degree face final judgement at an election. Yet it has to be in accordance with the constitutionally allowed frame work and in keeping with the long-standing norms of government change that this country has manged to keep alive amidst insurgency, civil war, assassinations, violence, communal hatred etc. and not by doing violence to such core values. 
Political culture of this country is ugly , stinking and putrid; none of the three national leaders has embarked on a crusade to rectify it. In fact they are keen reapers of the benefits of such decadence for their politics. The Ousted PM too inspired little confidence in terms of his modus operandi in dealing with the Bond Scam, prosecution of plunderers of Public coffers or even in taking necessary steps of establishing rule of law. He too, is only the latest , if admittedly the most high profile , victim of a back stabbing , deal making and shameless politicking. 
It is only the arbitrary , vicious and cut throat modus operandi of the incumbent President that makes us even whimper in protest. It is a betrayal of mandate of the forces who rallied on January 8. It is a relapse in to the deal politics with billions of Rupees thrown about to fish peoples representatives for numbers. 
Colombo has become the backdrop of two, equally corrupt and power thirsty political centres; one at the Temple Trees and the other at Wijerama. The unclean hordes on both sides are sharpening their knives for a final battle till death to grab power
The Selfie
Colombo has become the backdrop of two, equally corrupt and power thirsty political centres; one at the Temple Trees and the other at Wijerama.
The unclean hordes on both sides are sharpening their knives for a final battle till death to grab power. For the time-being a victory for the Temple Trees could be seen as a victory for democracy and norms of parliamentary politics. Yet whoever comes tops at the end of the tunnel, it would be with irreparable damage to the political morality of the country. 
Filthy lucre is the determining force in deciding who holds the mandate to govern us. It is the bundles of millions and millions of rupees that is doing the talking now. It is a selfie of the shameful, nauseating and disgusting political culture of Sri Lanka. An unedited selfie of the so- called Sinhala Buddhist Society.

Did he want to be dramatic
	

It is no longer news that there was a recent move to lease out part of the Colombo Port to a neighbouring country in a bid to ease the countrys foreign debt burden.

The series of events behind this story make up an interesting drama, they say.
While the proposed move was still a talking point, a powerful nation wanted to know for sure whether this was going to be a reality. So, deciding to take the bull by the horns, a diplomat of that nation met the purohita handling the subject  a kind of lion by name. Niceties over, the diplomat inquired from the purohita whether there was any truth in the story making rounds.
The way purohita reacted to the mere mention of the subject showed that the diplomat hit hard a raw nerve of his.
If anyone wants to lease out the eastern part of our main port, he could do it only over my dead body! As long as I am in charge of this subject, I will not let anyone however big he is to do it! he angrily blurted out, they say.

Employees being assaulted at Temple Trees: PM Office complains to IGP
	
The Prime Ministers Office has lodged a complaint with the IGP over the alleged assault and intimidation of State officials by a mob at Temple Trees today.
New Prime Ministers Secretary Sirisena Amarasekara said they had transferred many officials from Temple Trees and as required, the employees were in the process of handing over their items and equipment during the last few days.
The employees have to return their items and handover the inventory. For the past few days they have been doing that. One officer is in charge of the check-list and others report to her with their items which are being returned.
When the officials went to do the same today, a mob of about 200 to 300 men have obstructed their duties, assaulted them and threatened them, he told the Daily Mirror.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Heart Age: A Wake  Up Call
	

Heart, the most romanticized biological structure of the human body, is in reality a hollow muscular organ that constantly pumps blood through the circulatory system to fulfill the oxygen and nutrient requirements of the body. Being one of the earliest organs to develop, differentiate and function, the heart first begins to beat in a human embryo as early as 5 weeks into pregnancy and in an average adult, the heart beats about 60-100 times per minute. This amounts to almost 115,200 beats per day.
Organs are a group of tissues that are specialized to perform a specific set of functions. One would naturally assume an organ to age at the same pace as the organism itself, both having the same chronological age. However it has now been identified following extensive study, that even though the heart muscle is equipped to function in an indefatigable manner, it is prone to aging at a faster pace, making the heart age precede a persons actual biological age.
An online quiz tool to assess the heart age of any individual over 30 years of age has been unveiled by the National Health Service, UK and is being backed by the British Heart Foundation and the Stroke Association. According to the BBC, Public Health England is urging people older than 30 years of age to take an online test to find out their respective heart ages which indicates the risk of suffering a heart attack or a stroke in the near future.
Even though the heart muscle is equipped to function in an indefatigable manner, it is prone to aging at a faster pace, making the heart age precede a persons actual biological age
The quiz consists of 16 simple questions based on lifestyle, biometrics and medical history of an individual. According to NHS UK, the heart age test tells you your heart age compared to your real age, explains why its important to know your blood pressure and cholesterol numbers and gives advice on how to reduce your heart age.
Though this test is not diagnostic, it offers an estimated 10-year risk prediction. The heart age is calculated based on the risk factors for heart disease an individual possesses. This quiz can be found at the following link: 
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/for-your-body/check-your-health/heart-age-test/
Heart is a highly fatigue-resistant vital organ and is made up of cardiac myocytes (heart muscle cells). These cells, upon receiving electrical stimuli from the cardiac pacemaker, contract in a synchronized manner to effectively eject blood with every heart beat. The amount of blood pumped by the heart in a minute is known as the cardiac output.
Heart first begins to beat in a human embryo as early as 5 weeks into pregnancy and in an average adult, the heart beats about 60-100 times per minute
When subject to stressful conditions, the body releases adrenaline, a hormone that temporarily causes the breathing and heart rate to speed up and the blood pressure to rise. When stress is constantly experienced by an individual, the constant switching of these regualatory mechanisms, take a toll on the overall cardiac health. Cardiac output also varies widely with the level of activity of the body. The basic level of body metabolism, whether the person is exercising, the persons age, and size of the body, are among some factors that significantly alter the cardiac output. For young, healthy men, resting cardiac output averages about 5.6 L/min. For women, this value is about 4.9 L/min. 
Lifestyle risk factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, cigarette smoking and binge drinking contribute to the additional burden placed on the heart, as do factors such as poorly controlled high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Diabetes, and a family history of cardiovascular diseases.
The National Health Service UK has reported that almost 2 million individuals have taken the heart age test and it was noted that almost 78% of the participants have a heart age higher than their actual age, putting them at greater risk of morbidity, or an early death. According to heart.org, obtaining less than ideal results on your heart age screening test, doesnt mean you are destined to develop serious cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular illnesses, on the contrary, this may be looked at as a chance to begin changing your health habits in a positive way.
Non communicable diseases, especially Ischemic Heart Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke) and Diabetes continue to be among the top causes of morbidity and mortality both internationally and in Sri Lanka. 
Consultant Cardiologist at the National Hospital Sri Lanka, Dr. Gotabhaya Ranasinghe welcomed the idea of risk prediction in individuals as early as 30 years of age, while noting that rapid urbanization of Sri Lanka in the recent years has fuelled unhealthy food habits and sedantary lifestyles among a majority of the people. Food items that are cleverly disguised as healthy often become a trend, and ignorant, uninformed youth are easily lured. Making conscious decisions on food preferences could be a start, as many are ignorant regarding the ingredients involved in the making of their favorite food items.
As non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases can be controlled and prevented with early risk factor identification, Dr. Ranasinghe stressed the importance of lifestyle modification and urged the public to reevaluate their lifestyles before resorting to medical solutions. Making adequate dietary changes and incorporating excercises to their daily routine, would bring about paramount changes in cardiac health, over time.
Stress management is one of the most overlooked aspects of cardiac health. Even in individuals who are otherwise healthy, stress continues to be a hidden factor that puts them at a silent risk of acquiring cardiac diseases and stroke. Most Sri Lankan youth, especially those who are overworked in the corporate sector are easily susceptible to stress. Unfortunately, mental health seldom receives the attention and spotlight that physical health does. Educating the youth on effective methods to combat stress is the need of the hour. Ideally, practical methods such as meditation could be included in the curriculum to ensure implementation. 

For young, healthy men, resting cardiac output averaagesabout 5.6 L/min.
	For women, this value is about4.9 L/min.
	In an adult, heart beats about60-100times per minute
	Avg. heart beat is around115,200 times per day
Although inherent contributing factors of heart disease such as family history, age, and gender cannot be altered, maintaining optimum weight, consumption of healthy, heart-friendly food, moderate exercises for at least 30 minutes per day, and cessation of smoking in cigarette smokers can significantly affect quality of life and will exhibit positive outcomes once implemented.
Knowledge of ones Heart Age serves as a wake up call to those of us who may have been ignoring their health thus far, and prompts the quiz taker to be proactive about improving their overall heart health.

His suggestion goes a-begging!
	

A set of khaki high-ups was having a good time at a bash when one of them suddenly remembered the plight their Lokka was placed in, these days.

Machang, he addressed them all in general. It just occurred to me a fine idea as to how we should help our Lokka in his hour of need. We should launch a well- planned campaign on Facebook to convince the people what a great man he is!
He added after a brief pause:
If he continues in the job, we also can go ahead with a good time enjoying an occasional good time like this. After all, isnt he himself a jolly good fellow
This suggestion had drawn a quick response from another one at the party.
I say, we didnt invite you to this party to give you a chance to whitewash anyone! Dont get mad at us. We are not interested in whitewashing anyone. We are interested only in safeguarding the honour of our department, which we highly esteem!
Having said his piece, the high-up had left the place. And his departure had appeared to be the signal for others to follow.
Finally, the supporter of their Lokka had found himself left with one colleague, a pensioner no longer in service, they say.

IUSF break into UGC
	
University students led by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) today forced into the University Grants Commission (UGC) at Ward Place in Colombo breaking its front gate.
They marched to the UGC in a protest march which started in front of the Fort Railway Station demanding authorities to resolve several issues pertaining to University students in the South Eastern and Rajarata Universities.
The protest march reached the UGC around 3 p.m. and by 3.30 p.m. the gate was broken down by angry protesters.A Police officer sustained injuries when the students attempted to break the gate.
Police Riot Control Unit, including four water cannon trucks, were at the scene to control the situation.
The protesters who entered the UGC premises, however, did not enter the building, but were shouting slogans demanding to lift the suspension given to several students attached to the Rajarata University.
The employees of the UGC were evacuated by the time the protesters reached the premises.
The students showed their displeasure to the Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stating that he had not taken sufficient measures to resolve their issues.
Tear gas, water cannon or any other force was not used to disperse the protesters and the protesters did not show any violent behaviour, a Police Spokesman said.
Speaking to the media IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said the Police didnt receive any order to attack them.
He said that IUSF didnt care of who was the countrys President, Prime Minister or who would be next but the students issues should be resolved under any administration.
The agendas of Mahinda, Ranil or Maithri is the same. They have to send one letter to resolve all these matters if they really want to solve the problem.
Because the Vice Chancellors of all these Universities are their henchmen it can be done easily. What we should understand is that all these leaders doing nothing, even they had enough authority to do so, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Jail term suspended, ex-President Nasheed set to return home
	
Ending his exile from the Maldives, the countrys Supreme Court Tuesday suspended a 13-year jail sentence handed to former President Mohamed Nasheed who now plans to return to Male as early as Thursday. Maldives President-elect Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who defeated President Abdulla Yameen in the recent elections, is expected to accompany Nasheed from Colombo to Male.
Speaking to The Indian Express from Colombo, Nasheed said it was very satisfying to hear the news of the suspension of his jail term. I am going back to my country after three years to see a democracy that is showing signs of strength. Of course, this is a transition stage, it is a long process. But I would say that Maldives democracy is getting strengthened now, he said.
Nasheed said Solih is expected to reach Colombo Wednesday. Yes I might travel with him. It is so happy to meet everyone after a long time, our leaders, party men. Moreover, mine is a typical South Asian family, a large extended family with a lot of relatives, so many uncles, cousins. I am happy I will meet all of them after a long time, he said.
In the absence of Nasheed and top Opposition leaders, who were either jailed or forced to flee the island nation after President Yameen came to power, it was Solih who coordinated and led the Opposition. In the Presidential poll held last month, Yameen conceded defeat to Solih after attempts to remain in power.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ordered the government, police and prison authorities to implement the suspension of Nasheeds 13-year jail term.
The order followed a move Sunday by the Maldives prosecutor generals office which asked the Supreme Court to review the conviction order against Nasheed. The order, based on an anti-terrorism law, had been passed against Nasheed for allegedly ordering the army to detain a top judge when he was President in 2012. (Indian Express)

Lankan sniper detainee tortured and beaten in Maldives: Amnesty
	
Amnesty International on Tuesday condemned the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of a Sri Lankan detained in the Maldives, saying he has been beaten and tortured.
The rights group says the prisoner, who was charged almost three years ago for knowingly taking part in a conspiracy to murder President Abdulla Yameen, has also been denied a fair trial.
Lahiru Madhushanka has suffered vicious police beatings, prolonged solitary confinement and beatings with cables that caused him to temporarily lose hearing in one ear, Amnesty said in its report.
From the moment he was arrested, to his interrogation, to his imprisonment and his trial, his family and lawyer say he has been subject to a catalogue of serious human rights violations, including torture, that need to be independently investigated, according to a press statement.
Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnestys South Asia research director, said the case raised alarming questions about the Maldivian justice system and how the authorities treated detainees.
It is also a test for the Sri Lankan government, which has only provided limited consular services and failed to adequately respond to the desperate appeals of Madhushankas family and ensure a fair trial and humane detention conditions for him.
Madhushanka was arrested in October 2015 on a different charge, with the assassination allegation and charge following months later. His remand hearings and interrogations were in Dhivehi, which he does not speak, and he was not given legal aid.
In July, Amnesty accused prison authorities of breaking the law and expressed concern over his possible loss of eyesight. Authorities were also accused of coercing him into following Islamic practices and barring him from following his Buddhist faith.
Madhushanka was in the Maldives for a job as a driver that fell through, the rights group said. The job had been arranged by another Sri Lankan, who was in contact with a group close to ex-vice president Ahmed Adeeb who was convicted of plotting to assassinate Yameen.
No human being should be treated in this way, said Dissanayake of Madhushanka. All the more reason why a thorough investigation should promptly be launched by the Maldivian authorities.
She said the new president of the Maldives, who will be sworn in next month, must ensure that all prisoners are treated humanely and tried in courts where justice is worthy of its name.
The Maldives Independent contacted police and prison authorities for comment on the Amnesty report, but there was no response at the time of going to press. (maldivestimes)

MAKE SRI LANKA GREAT AGAIN
	

The relevance of Donald Trumps patriotism to Sri Lanka

A small book of about 150 pages containing complimentary comments by others about Presidential hopeful Donald Trump and quotable quotes from Trumps own speeches, ambiguously titled TRUMPED (New Holland Publishers Pty Ltd, London, 2016) has this mocking Trump quote in small letters at the top of the cover page just above the capitalized title:
Sorry losers, but my IQ is one of the highest  and you all know it! Please dont feel so stupid or insecure, its not your fault.
The subtitle of this pro-Trump propaganda publication is:
The wonderful world and wisdom of Donald Trump.

Making the country great again slogan is not entirely without relevance when it is applied to post-2014Sri Lanka

Mind you, this was pre-election time. Most people, especially the media, expected him to be trumped at the Presidential Election, hence the title that would fit whatever outcome hed get. The short description on the title page says that he is A self-made billionaire, reality TV star, GOP candidate and 2016 Presidential hopeful. These claims are true. However, not all quotes given in this article are from this book.
Trump (b.1946) was sworn in as the 45th President of the US on January 20, 2017. By now, he seems to have trumped (done better than) his predecessor Obama in both the domestic and foreign affairs departments. In The Art of the Deal (1987) that he co-authored with Tony Schwartz, he says:
You cant con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you dont deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.As a successful businessman turned politician, he knows how to achieve success in whatever he does.
That demands vision, intelligence, creativity, and in a politician in power, a sensitive heart that responds to the needs of his people.
When a president delivers the goods by meeting these needs without compromising the broader national interest of the country, we can call such a President a Patriot or a nationalist, not a populist.
Trump once said: When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.

Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves

A minority of Sri Lankans seem to equate nationalism with what they wrongly call populism to condemn both.To them, Trump is a populist. The following Trump quote mentions some of the populist demands he focuses on as president:
Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.This is what the unashamedly populist Trump thinks about taxing people:If you reduce tax rates and allow people to spend or save more of what they earn, theyll be more industrious; theyll have more incentive to work hard, and money they earn will add fuel to the great economic machine that energizes our national progress. The result .. more prosperity for all. And more revenue for Government.
Whats the relevance of Donald Trumps patriotism/nationalism toSri Lanka
The USA, which tabled Resolution 30/1 against Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in October 2015, has by now left that body in disgust.Sri Lanka co-sponsored this resolution against itself to its eternal shame. President Donald Trump, addressing the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly in New York in an upbeat hour-long speech charged that the UNHRC had become A massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations.
He described it as a cesspool of political bias. Probably, Sri Lanka has more reasons to make that criticism of the UN human rights body.
Of course, Trump was not indulging in self-blame. He was pointing accusing fingers at others, such as Cuba and China.
He expressed some smug self-satisfaction about the American economy booming under his stewardship. He vowed that the US would not return to the UNHRC unless it was reformed and that they would provide neither support nor recognition to the International Criminal Court on similar grounds.
He further said,We will never surrender Americas sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy. Sri Lanka did just that by unnecessarily succumbing to pressure exerted by vested interests inimical to the country.
During the last Presidential Election which he won, his campaign slogan was Make America Great Again.
Making an unmistakable allusion to that evocative phrase, Trump, a patriotic politician who puts the US national interest at the top of his priorities, as shown above, observed that the global migration crisis (Which negatively affects his country) can be resolved by encouraging every country to be great again.
(Never mind that hardly any country in the world including ours exploited by Western Imperialism was ever so great in the last half a millennium as to be talking about becoming great again without an acute sense of embarrassment!).


However, making the country great again slogan is not entirely without relevance when it is applied to post-2014 Sri Lanka, considering the relative greatness it steadily achieved in terms, for example, of a high growth rate, restored national security, near-complete elimination of the underworld, etc in the five years since the defeat of separatist terrorism in 2009.America was not going to sign onto a global migration pact. His stand was that individual nations should set their own policies to achieve this status. He declared: Only by upholding national borders, destroying criminal gangs, can we break this cycle. Trump said that the US would recognize (the) right of every nation in this room to set own policy.The only way to stop people from leaving their countries in search of greener pastures elsewhere was to make their countries great again.How can we be great again by doing the exact opposite of what Donald Trump is advocating here
His Sri Lankan counterpart quite justifiably urged an end to external interference in our domestic affairs at the UN General Assembly, but his swinish foreign affairs panjandrums were content to wallow in the UNHRC cesspool in Geneva.
While the UN General Assembly was meeting in New York, the delegates of the non-governmental organization known as the World Patriotic Lankan Forum (WPLF) was attending parallel events at the Geneva UNHRC Sessions in a heroic attempt to defend the country unofficially as best they could in the absence of anyone from the Sri Lankan Government to do so.
Professor Channa Jayasumana, who played a leading role in this endeavour is currently in the news after having made a startling revelation that might someday lead to a reversal of the world bodys policy regarding false war crimes allegations against Sri Lanka.
The delegates of the WPLF claimed that the Sri Lankan embassy entertained some leading pro-separatist Tamils, who were protesting against Sri Lanka that very day in thousands, to dinner, whereas those patriots themselves were not given even a cup of tea as a sign of welcome at least.
The embassy officials had told the WPLF delegates that they were following instructions from Colombo. (The hosting to dinner of leading anti-Sri Lanka demonstrators from the so-called Tamil Diaspora was denied by the ambassador later.)
A Tamil woman, who had gone there to help urge war crimes allegations against the Sri Lankan Army, charged that just ten days previously some Sri Lankan Soldiers had raped eleven young Tamil women in the north!

You cant con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do a wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press

This was a monstrous lie. Though she was making this false allegation in the presence of a female officer from the Sri Lankan embassy in Geneva, that woman didnt lift a finger in defence of the country.She kept silent. The WPLF member, a lady, was almost in tears when she revealed this and made an emotional appeal to the Sri Lankan President, Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to look into this treacherous conduct of the embassy staff in Geneva.


She also referred to the Tamil racists attempt to introduce a false history in order to justify their separatist claims and urged Sri Lankan parents and educational authorities to resuscitate the teaching of history in our schools as in the past.In this context, the unwavering nationalism of American leaders-that is currently exemplified in Donald Trump-shows the people of Sri Lanka the way out of the present crisis. (The foregoing part of this article was written a couple of weeks ago.)
At the time the WPLF activist made her cogent appeal, it fell mostly on deaf ears. But with the unexpected change of Government on October 26, 2018, a conducive environment has begun emerging for such calls for the implementation of nation-centred policies to be actively heeded.
The architect of the post-2009 greatness, which was conspiratorially scuttled in 2015, is back in the saddle and is sure to be overwhelmingly confirmed in his position at future Parliamentary Elections.

Media freedom at a time of crisis
	
While Sri Lanka faces a political crisis, the United Nations on Friday marks the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists worldwide.
The UN says that for the past twelve year, 2006-2017, close to 1010 journalists have been killed for reporting the news and bringing information to the people. In nine out of ten cases the killers go unpunished. Impunity leads to more killings and is often a symptom of worsening conflict and the breakdown of law and judicial systems.
The United Nations Education Science and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) says it is concerned that impunity damages whole societies by covering up serious human rights abuses, corruption, and crime. The UN General Assembly proclaimed November 2 as the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists and in a Resolution, it urged Member States to implement definite measures countering the present culture of impunity. The date was chosen in commemoration of the assassination of two French journalists in Mali on November 2, 2013.
This landmark resolution condemns all attacks and violence against journalists and media workers. It also urges Member States to do their utmost to prevent violence against journalists and media workers, to ensure accountability, bring to justice perpetrators of crimes against journalists and media workers, and ensure that victims have access to appropriate remedies. It also calls upon States to promote a safe and enabling environment for journalists to perform their work independently and without undue interference.
According to the UN, besides about 1000 journalists who were killed from 2006 to 2017, many more journalists on a daily basis suffer from non-fatal attacks, including torture, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, intimidation and harassment in both conflict and non-conflict situations. Furthermore, there are specific risks faced by women journalists, including sexual attacks.
Worryingly, only one in ten attacks committed against media workers over the past decade has led to a conviction. This impunity emboldens the perpetrators of the crimes and at the same time has a chilling effect on society including journalists themselves. Impunity breeds impunity and feeds into a vicious cycle. When attacks on journalists remain unpunished, a negative message is sent that reporting the embarrassing truth or unwanted opinions will get ordinary people in trouble. Furthermore, society loses confidence in its own judiciary system which is meant to protect everyone from attacks on their rights. Perpetrators of crimes against journalists are thus emboldened when they realize they can attack their targets without ever facing justice, the UN warns.
In Sri Lanka one of the trying periods for journalists and the free-media was during the war as in any armed conflicts around the world. In Sri Lanka 16 journalists and media workers were killed from during that period since 2005, according to the International Committee to Protect Journalists. Though trials were held in certain cases they have dragged on and no one has been convicted. The case that got the widest prominence was the brutal murder of the Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga in a high security zone near his newspaper office at Ratmalana on January 8, 2009. Lanka-Enews journalist and cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda disappeared on the night of January 24, 2010 and he is feared to have been killed. This case has also dragged on though in 2015 the Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government promised to bring to justice those involved in these and other killings. On the night of April 5, 2005, widely respected newspaper analyst Dharmarantam Sivaram was abducted and found dead the next morning with gunshot wounds in the head. Four unidentified men are reported to have forced Sivaram into a jeep as he left a restaurant opposite the Bambalapitya police station. News websites reported that his body was found in a high-security area behind a parliament building.
In addition to the killings, several journalists were abducted or assaulted and tortured. Prominent among them was investigative journalist and political analyst Keith Noyahr who was abducted and brutally beaten up for about seven hours on the night of May 22, 2008. There were also several attacks on Udayan Newspaper in Jaffna, the MTV Group, the Siyatha and others. Since 2015 there have been no physical attacks or killings of journalists. We hope media freedom would survive through the current political crisis.

Nissanka taken to hospital after blow to head
	
A nasty incident marred the second day of the first warm-up match at the Nondescripts Cricket Club when fielder Pathum Nissanka was taken to hospital after being struck on the head by a pull shot from Jos Buttler.
The incident occurred at the start of the 56th over of England's innings. Off-spinner Nishan Peiris dropped a ball in short that Buttler, on 44 at the time, hit powerfully at Nissanka, who was stationed at short leg, wearing a helmet and bowed his head as he braced for the impact. After a few moments, Peiris went to the ground, with Buttler, his batting partner, Joe Root, and the rest of the Sri Lankan fielders worried bystanders.
Immediately, there was assistance from the sidelines. The Sri Lankan team physio came on, flanked by a trio from England's medical team: team doctor Moiz Moghal, physio Craig De Wyman and masseuse Mark Saxby. Nissanka was put in a neck brace and remained on the floor until a stretcher was brought out.
Nissanka was conscious throughout but complained of pain in his neck which, as a result, meant the process of putting him on a stretcher was meticulous. Once securely on, he was carried off the field and into an ambulance to take him to a local hospital. Oxygen was brought onto the field to assist him but was not needed.
The delay took England to tea on 220 for four rather than three as the deflection from Nissanka's helmet carried to Angelo Mathews at leg slip, which meant Buttler was dismissed for 44. In September 2017, the ICC amended their laws so that a batsman could be caught out or even stumped even if the ball had come into contact with a fielder's helmet.
Play resumed at 14:57 local time with England due to bat until the close of play, regardless of wickets loss, with Moeen Ali the new batsman at the crease.
Earlier, Ben Stokes retired hurt after being struck above his left elbow by a short-ball from Lahiru Kumara. While there was only bruising, he was given precautionary treatment and is expected to bat again should the opportunity arise.(cricbuzz)

No evidence of foreign power: Ranil
	
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said that there was no evidence to believe that a foreign country was behind the crisis situation in Sri Lanka.
He said this to journalists attached to the Foreign News Agencies at the Temple Trees last morning.
The allegation that some foreign country is behind the crisis in Sri Lanka is only a piece of information published in some social media, he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Wickremesinghe, who divulged details on negotiations that took place with regard to the fielding of a common candidate for the last Presidential Election, said that incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena was chosen as the candidate, despite some parties and civil groups proposed the name of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
He told the journalists that he got UNP to pass a resolution backing Mr Sirisena as per the agreement reached by the parties. (Yohan Perera)

Political Crisis Continues Breaking the good in governance
	
Ranil Wickremesinghe addresses supporters at a rally which was organised by his party in Colombo yesterday in protest against his removal as Sri Lankas Prime Minister of Sri Lanka (Pic by Nimalsiri Edirisinghe)
Much has been spoken and discussed about and debated on regarding the existing political quagmire. With many ifs and buts, the President has started to act in such a manner that the entire nation is confused at the moment. While many took to rejoicing on the streets, the prevailing situation doesnt seem to be a reason to rejoice at all. One life was already taken away. Legal experts claim that the move to remove the existing Prime Minister was unconstitutional and taking another dangerous step forward, the President also prorogued Parliament till November 16. The Cabinet too is in the process being subject to change in a possible move to manipulate the majority vote. Those who voted in favour of the Yahapalanaya regime on January 8, 2015 wouldnt have expected this turn of events. But the damage has already been done and whether it is reversible or not remains the question. Hence the Daily Mirror spoke to several experts to shed light on the prevailing situation.
Proroguing is an anti-democratic move
Actually this should be decided by the Parliament, said Lal Wijenayake Attorney-at-Law and Chairman of the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform. Therefore the Presidents decision is illegal. If President Sirisena had a doubt about Ranil Wickremesinghes majority he should have asked him (RW) to show his majority in Parliament. That would have been the proper way to do it. In fact this is how it is being done in most democracies including India when major crossovers take place. Even now its not too late to summon the Parliament. This is because the Parliament is the most supreme institution in the country. Proroguing is an anti-democratic move. After taking such a step he has even decided to prorogue it for two or three weeks. This is actually a crime. The Presidents actions have divided the society, public service, Police, armed forces and if further delayed the situation will worsen, said Wijenayake.
He further said that Mahinda Rajapaksa does not have the majority. By proroguing the Parliament they are trying to manipulate the majority. We are well aware of how a majority could be manipulated. The President acted unconstitutionally by removing the Prime Minister and again suppressed democratic rights by proroguing the Parliament. Therefore there should be an impeachment order against him since he has violated the Constitution. This damage has grabbed international attention as well. But the damage could be minimised if he summons the Parliament immediately, he added.
President himself made a U-turn
According to Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya, civil rights activist and convener of the Movement for a Just Society, the Presidents decision is a deathly blow to democracy. The country has experienced a divide and the poor people have begun to fight. This is not a good sign. If MR (Mahinda Rajapaksa) has a majority of 113 then why are they proroguing Parliament What they are trying to do now is appoint a miniature Cabinet and convince people to crossover.
The President initially said that he would abide by the law, but it doesnt seem to be the case anymore, Prof. Wijesooriya continued. He got rid of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Ven. Sobhitha Thera and others who helped him to acquire the hot seat and he himself made a U-turn. The President himself claimed that MR has threatened to kill him five times and here he is joining hands with MR once again. This is undemocratic and the only solution is to convene Parliament immediately, said Prof. Wijesuriya.
Climate ripe for political horse-trading
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) a National chapter of Transparency International and the leading global movement against corruption- also expressed its concerns regarding the prevailing constitutional crisis. In a statement issued they stated that the TISL wishes to state that its imperative that Parliament is convened immediately to resolve the political instability that has arisen. TISL is concerned that the prorogation of Parliament until November 16 has created a climate that is ripe for political horse-trading leading to the corruption of the peoples mandate.
The statement also quoted TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere as follows saying, In the context of the prevailing political culture and past experiences, closing the doors of Parliament to enable deal making has already led to allegations of monetary inducements for loyalty. This will further undermine public trust and the mandate of good governance which President Sirisena pledged to uphold in his address to the nation on Sunday. Given the atmosphere of uncertainty that has currently engulfed the political systems of the country, it is of utmost importance that Parliament as the apex representative of the people, should be given the opportunity to be open and accountable to the public.
All parties must recognise that sovereignty is in the people and is inalienable (Art. 3  Constitution). TISL calls on all political stakeholders of the country to protect democracy and resolve this crisis in the best interests of the people, upholding the spirit of transparency and accountability.
No necessity to convene Parliament
Former State Minister and member of the Liberal Party of Sri Lanka Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha said that he doesnt see a necessity to convene the Parliament. There has been a practice to prorogue Parliament especially like during the time of Premadasas impeachment motion, then in 1964 during Sirimavo Bandaranaikes regime and in 2001 during Chandrika Kumaratungas regime.
Since the President has prorogued parliament its now a matter of waiting till November 16. When you have an ambiguous constitution on the dismissal of the Prime Minister there are three alternatives as solutions.
Either go to courts, seek a Parliamentary vote or allow the people to respond. But by now Ranil Wickremesinghe must have realised that the country is not in his favour. In fact the President should have taken this decision after the Local Government Elections back in February. I also think that the rest of the UNPers must be seeing this as a opportunity to bring about Party reforms as it is important to maintain inner party democracy, said Prof. Wijesinha.
There has been a practice to prorogue Parliament especially like during the time of Premadasas impeachment motion, then in 1964 during Sirimavo Bandaranaikes regime and in 2001 during Chandrika Kumaratungas regime
Everything has happened according to Constitutional provisions

Airing his views General Secretary of the United National Freedom Front and attorney-at-law Maithri Gunaratne said that the previous Government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe was a coalition Government.
Therefore they were able to limit it to 30 members with an exception that if a coalition Government or a national Government was brought in that the numbers would exceed. When the Sri Lanka Freedom Party pulled out of the coalition Government the Cabinet that has been appointed ceased to exist. Then the PM also ceases to exist. Then the President could appoint a capable person who has the ability to command the Parliament at his discretion.
He further said that once Parliament has been summoned and if the incumbent Premier cannot pass a Budget or a no confidence motion then he ceases to exist. Until then he can function. Thats how Ranil functioned from January 8, 2015 till August. Each and every member of the Parliament will support the incumbent Prime Minister on a case-by-case basis.
When the Sri Lanka Freedom Party pulled out of the coalition Government the Cabinet that has been appointed ceased to exist. Then the PM also ceases to exist. Then the President could appoint a capable person who has the ability to command the Parliament at his discretion
So theres no way that Wickremesinghe could hold on and say that hes the premier. Everything has happened according to Constitutional provisions. I think the best thing he should do now is to leave without pushing the Government to bring an eviction order on him.
A call for democratic action during a moment of crisis
A group of academics, religious leaders, professionals, civil rights and human rights activists have issued a statement that reads as follows:
We are alarmed by the recent turn of events, where Maithripala Sirisena has called upon Mahinda Rajapaksa, who does not command a majority in the Parliament, to form the Government. In 2015, the country voted in Sirisena, on the promise of change and good governance. The majority of people voted in the Coalition Government too, in the General Elections, with Ranil Wickremesinghe at the helm. Neither Wickremesinghe nor President Sirisena has kept the promises made to the people.
We wish to call upon all those in positions of power, particularly all political actors, to pledge their support for democratic processes
The past three years have seen manoeuvres between warring factions and divided loyalties while self-serving opportunism ruled the day. The current move is simply a culmination of these acts. Although there have been some positive changes during this period of rule, such as the opening of space for civil discourse and freedom of speech, the legislation of the Right to Information Act and the return of some military-held lands, the Yahapalana regimes neoliberal policies, not to mention the impending Counter Terrorism Act (CTA), built on similar policies of the previous regime, provided little relief to the people. With a global economic crisis looming large, the country is facing challenges all round.
The announcement of the President calling upon Rajapaksa to form the Government, and then proroguing the Parliament, makes us think that Rajapaksa doesnt have a majority at this moment. Such a postponement also signals a time of political manipulation of a precarious situation and warns of a premeditated and near autocratic take over. It weakens the already fragile fabric of democracy and spells further danger to dissent, protest and peoples collective action.
The past three years have seen manoeuvres between warring factions and divided loyalties while self-serving opportunism ruled the day.
The struggle for democracy is not just about the Constitution. It resides in economic, social, and individual welfare, the right to dissent, and a commitment to pluralism. Although its important to consider the unconstitutionality of the Presidents act and the precedence that it sets, our concerns go beyond those of a constitutional crisis. We want to stress that a democratic process needs to be cherished and upheld at all times. Rather than continuing to support the lesser evil, lets work towards bringing all people together as a citizenry to build hope for our collective futures.
We wish to call upon all those in positions of power, particularly all political actors, to pledge their support for democratic processes. At the same time, we wish to pledge our support for democratic action. This is the moment to begin a collective action by students, teachers, workers, womens groups, religious groups, and others working toward social justice, to form a coalition and a counter force against authoritarian reaction.
We want to stress that a democratic process needs to be cherished and upheld at all times
Country cannot afford another crisis : NCCSL
It is with a sense of shock and dismay that the people of Sri Lanka received the announcement on Friday evening on October 26 of the swearing-in of Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of our country by President Maithripala Sirisena, and the removal of the serving Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe from such office.
We are a wounded nation recovering from war and violence and amidst severe economic burden on the people, cannot at any cost afford another crisis which can plunge the country into further chaos.

The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) takes serious note of this political development and considers this unprecedented move which is questionable in terms of the accepted norms of democratic principles and the provisions in our Constitution. It is our belief that the matter should have been best resolved in Parliament in a transparent manner with adherence to stipulated and clear procedures.
The turn of events, shrouded in secrecy and surprise, which we regret, have raised many questions in the minds of our people instilling fear and uncertainty as we witness two competing Prime Ministers together with their respective parties jostling for power, authority and legitimacy for state rule. In this process, whilst noting with sadness the subjection of state institutions to force and intimidation for political control, we also admire the patience of the general public who await a solution to this prevailing crisis within constitutional and judicial formalities.

Hence, the National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) as a religious entity with no affiliation to any political party or personality, appeals to the President to uphold the democratic traditions and the sanctity of our Constitution bearing in mind the mandate he received from the people when he was elected into office and calls upon its people and leaders of every sphere to act with prudence to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of the nation. In the meantime a petition has also been circulated by the Citizens Movement which condemns the Presidents actions and calls for Parliament to be convened.
The turn of events, shrouded in secrecy and surprise, which we regret, have raised many questions in the minds of our people instilling fear and uncertainty as we witness two competing Prime Ministers together with their respective parties jostling for power, authority and legitimacy for state rule.

Simplifying taxes, changing fuel pricing formula in cards: MR
	
Assuming duties as the Finance and Economic Affairs Minister, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa today said collecting taxes from the people should be simplified and the fuel pricing formula should be changed.
Making a speech after assuming duties at the Finance and Economic Affairs Ministry in Colombo, the Prime Minister said the Government should not burden the people by heaping taxes on them.
We need to collect taxes like a bee taking nectar from a flower. We need an economic mechanism which provides economic benefit to all.
Peoples ability to pay taxes should be considered prior to imposing taxes. The fuel pricing formula should also be changed. The formula was introduced to give the benefit of reducing international oil prices to Sri Lankans but since the month it was introduced, prices only keep going up.
We need money yes but not at the expense of the public. They should be compensated, Prime Minister Rajapaksa said.
He said the foreign exchange should be stabilized and an economic policy which preserves Sri Lankas foreign reserves should be adopted.
He said the economic policy should ensure the inflow of exports, tourism, foreign employment and foreign earnings.
The Premier also said the Government must desist from the presumption that the Public Servant was a thief, fraudster or burglar and that he would propose a new mechanism to President Maithripala Sirisena and to the Cabinet to ensure the protection of the Public Servant.
In monetary and economic affairs in governance, the public servant commands a huge responsibility. For a people friendly and efficient public service not depending on market economy or privatization, respecting the dignity of the public servant was a sine qua non, he added.
He said:
Despite, there was a total collapse of the global economy during 2008  2009 periods, he said his Government was able to face all these setbacks successfully and maintain a sound economy.
Our policy was to develop domestic industry and increase national production and thereby fatten the pocket of people. As a result, we maintained an extremely satisfactory growth rate of 6%. Rural roads, highways, expressways were built in rapid phase and electrification programme was a huge success. Small, medium and mega water supply projects, irrigation projects multipurpose development projects were to see in any part of the country. All these development programmes were carried out while keeping the national debt ratio and budget deficit at a manageable level, the Prime Minister emphasized.
The interest rate for Treasury Bills dropped to 6% by 2014 from 20% in 2007. The foreign reserves rose to 8.2 billion by 2014 from 2.73 billion in 2005 thanks to the sound economic and monetary policies of the government, he added.
But what is the scenario today I am sad to realize that the GDP growth has come down to 3 per cent by now. The Cost of Living is rising rapidly and the people have been burdened with various taxes, levies and rates. The entire business community is totally disappointed, dejected and devastated. The interest rate is extremely high. The imbalance in the foreign exchange rates has heightened the economic and political uncertainties. The national economy has not benefited from the low prices remained in the global fuel market from 2005 to 2017. The budget deficit remained at 5% as a result of cutting of capital expenditure.
The country seems like a rubbish dump with solid waste piling up in cities and roadsides in all parts of the country. The government has miserably failed to protect the voting rights of the people because the government has failed to hold polls to 6 PCs of which term of office expired.
Fortunately, the country has received a good rainfall and the coming Maha season would get a bumper harvest. Almost all reservoirs are full. All signs are in place for a prosperous and happy future. The government would put an end to the import of all unnecessary goods like kites, joss sticks, maize, Kurakkan, onion etc. As declared by President Sirisena at the Wapmagul ceremony at Tissamaharama on last Monday, the government would bring an era of happiness to all people in Sri Lanka with the assistance and cooperation of the public and private sector, the Prime Minister said.

The SLASSCOM AI Asia Summit 2018
	
The Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) is pleased to announce the first-ever SLASSCOM AI Asia Summit to be hosted at The Kingsbury, on Wednesday 7th November from 8:30 AM  5:30 PM. This is Sri Lankas first conference dedicated to the topics of Data Science and Machine Learning with many acclaimed international and local speakers addressing the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence(AI)across application, research and adoption.
Key international speakers include Timothy Kooi - Head of Data Analytics at DHL Asia Pacific, Dr. Yasantha Rajakarunanayake - Senior Director Technology at Media Tek, Dr. Adam Easton - Chief Executive Officer at Sim Centric Technologies, Dr. James Shanahan - Founder and Principal of Boutique Data Consultancy, Dr. Rukshan Batuwita - Applied Machine Learning Scientist, Dr. Chrisantha Fernando - Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind among others.
Jeevan Gnanam, Chairman SLASSCOMin his vision for an AI Nation, identified Sri Lanka as the island nation that punches above its weight in many categories and the need to add Data Science and AI to that list. He further stated, Sri Lanka for the last two decades has relied on two main pillars for its IT/BPM export; that is Software Development and Finance & Accounting. This strategy has served us well as we grew 23% CAGR year on year for the last decade. However, times are changing. As a middle-income country we need to shift gears and look at increasing the diversity of our export-based basket of goods while climbing up the value chain. Its time to introduce a new pillar, one that offers exponential gains, the third pillar of Data Science and AI as this provides Sri Lanka with the opportunity in the next few years to lay the solid foundations of being an important thought leader in the South Asian context.
Jeevan Gnanam added that Sri Lanka should strive to replicate these solutions as exports to other similarly placed developing countries. This provides Sri Lanka with the opportunity once againto move beyond providing labor arbitrage solutions to becoming a true, value-added knowledge provider for clients and stakeholders. The AI Asia summit will be a catalyst for this vision and raise awareness across industry, government, universities and private institutions of the opportunity ahead and what must be done now, in order to make this a reality. This event will culminate with the release of a Proposed AI Policy which will outline Sri Lankas vision for the next five years. Im elated to find so many Sri Lankans who are leading the research and development efforts ofcorporates and technology companies in the Data Science, Analytics and Machine Learning space Jeevan commented.
SLASSCOM is also pleased to host Dr. Yasantha Rajakarunanayake at AI Asia 2018 to deliver a keynote on Inspirational Applications of AI for Sri Lanka.He was recently recognized by Jeff Bezos, Founder/CEO of Amazon,for his memorable accomplishments while at Princeton University.

## Title: UoM hits scalable autonomous farming robot

UoM hits scalable autonomous farming robot
	
The latest addition to the long record of innovations by University of Moratuwa, the university pioneer in technological innovations and advanced engineering implementations in Sri Lanka, is the farming robot  SAASbot (Scalable Autonomous Agronomical Smartbot). SAASbot is a fully autonomous robot, which is capable of maintaining home gardens to medium scale farms from the point of planting seeds, up to the point of harvesting. 
The robot was designed and developed by three undergraduate students, Achala Athukorala, Kosala Herath and Nipuna Ranasinghe, from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering of the University of Moratuwa, under the guidance of Dr. Peshala Jayasekara and Dr. Thilina Lalitharatne, senior lecturers of University of Moratuwa, from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, respectively. 
Dr. Peshala Jayasekara, the one whos behind the idea of Scalable Farming Robot, states that, The focus is not on the automation of farming activities, but on changing the whole culture of agriculture. Present day world is heavily dependent on large scale farms to fulfil agricultural product requirements for daily consumption. Almost all the agricultural products are grown in remote large-scale farms, which are then transported to markets, to be purchased by consumers. With the rapid increase of world population in the past decades, centralized supply chain of agricultural products forces remote large-scale farms to increase their supply continually.
The robot was designed and developed by three undergraduates, Achala Athukorala, Kosala Herath and Nipuna Ranasinghe, from the Dept of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering of the University of Moratuwa
As a result, the artificial chemical (insecticides, pesticides) usage in farming has been increased drastically with the aim of increasing the yield. Furthermore, the use of chemical preservatives has also been significantly increased to reduce the wastage occurring during transportation and storage of agricultural products. Due to these factors, the agricultural products in present markets pose a serious threat to the health of consumers. Moreover, despite the use of chemical preservatives, there is a significant wastage of agricultural products presently, due to inefficiencies in large-scale farming, transportation and storage.
According to the belief of the young innovators from University of Moratuwa, the solution to this crisis lies in the decentralization of agricultural product supply, through motivating consumers to engage in personal or medium-scale farming. However, people are demotivated to engage in farming mainly due to the time constraints as well as the tiresomeness of conventional farming activities. This is the core problem for which SAASbot was built to solve, thereby facilitating anyone to engage in farming without additional effort or time, and thus changing the whole culture of agriculture, as envisioned by Dr. Jayasekara.
Currently, there are only a very few agricultural robots available for purchase for consumers, for personal farming or medium scale farming in the world. However, all of these available robots have either fixed farming areas (max. ~ 8 square metres) or can only perform a specific farming activity only (seeding, watering, fertilizing). SAASbot provides functionalities such as planting seeds, watering and fertilizing, surveillance, automatic weed elimination with the added unique feature of scalability. The SAASbot can be used in a farming field of any size or shape, making it superior to all the presently available commercial robots for personal to medium scale farming. Looking at the sales data of currently available personal farming robots in the market, it is evident that SAASbot is capable of securing a huge market share globally, if commercialized. 
The whole mechanical system of SAASbot was developed from scratch in Sri Lanka, under the supervision of Dr. Thilina Lalitharatne, at a fraction of the cost of existing commercial robots for personal farming. SAASbot system consists of not only the SAASbot mobile farming robot but also a stationary home station and its mobile application. The robot comprises a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) gantry and a mobile platform with Mecanum wheels. The CNC mechanism allows the robot to carry out farming operations within its dimensions, which is called a Cell, whereas the mobile platform allows the robot to move to another cell. The use of the hybrid actuation system of Mecanum wheels and the 3-axis CNC mechanism allows precise and faster end effective movement while facilitating scalability. Additionally, the actuation architecture used in SAASbot allows the robot to plant different plants in the same farming field, and treat individual plant separately; a unique feature which is not present in mobile farming robots. The robot has on board seed, water and fertilizer storage and an on board rechargeable battery.
The SAASbot mobile app developed by the team provides an easy and powerful interface for the users to control the robot. The mobile app can be used to perform all the aforementioned robot functions (planting seeds, watering, fertilizing) and also it can be used to create custom profiles for each plant type (i.e. the daily water/fertilizer requirement for a specific plant, crop harvesting time etc.). SAASbot will automatically carry out watering and fertilizing daily, according to the profiles created by the application.
SAASbot provides functionalities such as planting seeds, watering and fertilizing, surveillance, automatic weed elimination with the added unique feature of scalability
University of Moratuwa undergraduates are diversely skilled. Our engineering graduates possess general engineering knowledge relevant to numerous engineering disciplines, not only constraining themselves to their majoring field. All the three members of our team majored in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, however, we developed the whole SAASbot system from scratch in Sri Lanka including the mechanical design, electrical and electronic design, control system design, networking and mobile app development. Nevertheless, we had to face many difficulties regarding the mechanical system design implementation, due to the lack of access to manufacturing technologies and resources in Sri Lanka. Looking back, we recall the immense support and resources provided by Dr. Lalitharatne in implementing the mechanical design. Furthermore, we must thank Dr. Jayasekara and Prof. Rohan Munasinghe, the former Head of the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering for their immense support throughout the development of SAASbot.  Achala, the team leader expressed his thoughts.
The methodology and the results of the SAASbot have been presented at the 14th International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which was held in Finland this year. SAASbot system is undergoing further developments currently, to increase its effectiveness in different environments and to make the robot compatible with a wider variety of crops. We are inviting researchers in agricultural robotics as well as potential investors to join us. The team leader, added.
Information regarding SAASbot can be found on IEEE Xplore and Youtube.

West upset its SL agenda thwarted: Prelate
	
The International Community, mainly the Western Countries, was worried that their agenda in Sri Lanka was no longer operative and therefore, kept interfering in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka, Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said today.
Addressing a news briefing of the Yuthukama Organisation, the Thera said the International Community shed more tears than the people of Sri Lanka over the change of premiership.
The interference of Western Countries is so vast that we wonder whether the President, the Prime Minister and the Speaker of Sri Lanka were elected by us or them, he said.
The US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and the European Union have expressed their concerns. They are simply worried that their Sri Lankan agenda has come to an end today, he said.
The Thera said the Government headed by Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe continued to act on a foreign-agenda rather than on a national one.
The Government put forward many Acts and Bills, which are detrimental to the country. It also attempted to dilute the capacity of the armed forces. It is a blessing that the term of the previous Government has ended, he said.
He also said foreign countries should learn to respect Sri Lankas sovereignty and Sri Lankan leaders should not rope in foreign countries into domestic affairs. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Who cooked up the story
	

The Betel Leaf Secretarial one himself has now gone public that four top team members had taken the initiative to cook up and release to media the sensational story about the RAW being behind the conspiracy to bump off two prominent public figures here.

He also claimed that they had already identified two of the culprits adding that he would come out with the four names once the other two were identified.
When the RAW story was spreading like wildfire, a diplomatic mission representing a powerful nation in this region had reportedly launched an investigation to ascertain the origin of this story.
They, in fact, had made it a point to make inquiries mostly from the top team members. Of the top ones, they had contacted, twelve of them had reportedly given the same reply. The compendium of information thus gathered from the Yahapalanaya Bigwigs themselves has now become a precious possession of the mission in question,
they say.

Won't resort to legal action, but we urge RW to leave: PM Sec
	
Legal action will not be instituted against UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe for not vacating Temple Trees to date, new Premiers Secretary Sirisena Amarasekara said.
The Secretary to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, however said it was the duty of the former Premier to vacate the premises and leave immediately.
Addressing a news briefing, he said a government official could use an official residence for sometime even after they cease to function in their office, but said there was no provision for politicians to overstay official residences.
He also said an officer could use an official residence with the approval of his or her successor.
"Mr. Rajapaksa has not yet commented on this issue. It is my responsibility as his secretary to ensure he has access to his official residence. I have assigned an additional secretary to sort out the issue and convey our views to Temple Trees. Therefore, we hope Mr. Wickremesinghe will leave Temple Trees immediately, Mr. Amarasekara said.
He pointed out that the use of an official residence without the approval of the successor to that post amounted to misuse of public property. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
