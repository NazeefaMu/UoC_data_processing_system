The occasions arise for the people in a predominantly agricultural area in the country to seek the services of a certain state body looking after the activity of a river-based development project.

 


Despite this State body coming under the purview of a very high political authority, who has vowed to eradicate bribery and corruption, the hoi polloi cannot obtain any service from the white-collar ones attached this State body without offering them a santhosham, they say.


Even the high political authority is said to be aware that the white-collar ones are a corrupt lot, who do not move a finger to help a poor peasant without their palm being oiled, he has turned a blind eye to the situation as they are his own appointees.
