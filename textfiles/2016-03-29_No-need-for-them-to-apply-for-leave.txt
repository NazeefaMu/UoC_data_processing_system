Sports instructors at the sports division of a higher education institution in the city have hit upon a novel ruse to mark their attendance even when they keep away from work. They resort to this ploy with the connivance of the acting head of their division who has risen from their ranks, they say.

 


Employees in all sections of this institution ‘finger-print’ their arrival and departure accept these sports instructors who mark their attendance in a separate register.  These instructors reportedly mark their times of arrival and departure as 8.00 am and 4.15 pm respectively no matter what time they report for work or leave the workplace. Some instructors who may fail to report for work on one particular day, would conveniently sign the attendance register for that day when they come for work the following day with no questions asked. So according to official records of the institution, these instructors are not on leave, even when they are not working and given this ‘privilege’ there is no need for them to apply for leave either.
