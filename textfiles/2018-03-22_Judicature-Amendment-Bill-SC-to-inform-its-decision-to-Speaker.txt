The Supreme Court today announced that the decision  on seven petitions over the draft Judicature (Amendment) Bill to set up Permanent High Court of Trial at Bar would be informed to Parliament in future.

The SC today concluded the case on petitions filed by seven individuals including the leader of the Joint opposition Dinesh Gunawardena, Professor G L Peiris, Bar Association President Udaya Rohan de Silva.

Supreme Court ordered to submit the written submissions on petitions and intervening petitions by March 26.

Those petitions alleged that certain sections of the proposed draft bill would enable the government to execute the powers of the judiciary and that certain selected individuals would be targeted to take revenge through the Special High Court to be created by the bill. 

The petitions were taken up before a three-member judge bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Buwaneka Aluwihare and Nalin Perera, who today concluded the proceedings after hearing deliberations for four days. (Thilini de Silva and Ranjan Katugampola)
