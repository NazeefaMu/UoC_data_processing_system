Ms. Daisy Forrest Wickramasinghe, the great aunt of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, was released on bail by the Colombo Magistrate’s Court today over the controversial land case in Mt. Lavinia.

She was released on a cash bail of Rs.25,000 and two sureties of Rs.1.5 million each. The FCID has informed the court that the investigations into the case has been finalised but they were yet to record a statement from Ms. Wickramasinghe.

The Magistrate, who said if the investigations are completed there is no need of questioning the suspect again, released her on bail.

Yoshitha volunteered as one surety but it was refused by the court.  The land which was owned by Ms. Wickramasinghe and valued at Rs. 34 million had been purchased by Mr. Rajapaksa for Rs. 24 million. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
