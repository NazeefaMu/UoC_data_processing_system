UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake today scoffed rumours that he was originally planning to shift sides and had later changed his mind.

“I am not an item that could be auctioned,” he said.

“I was always of the opinion that appointment of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister was unconstitutional and still holds the idea,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
