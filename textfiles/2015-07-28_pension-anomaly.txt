PB pensioners request President to appoint Independent Committee of inquiry. Pensioners Association of the Peoples Bank has appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint an Independent Committee of inquiry to examine the long outstanding issue of a pension anomaly affecting pensioners who retired after 1966.
District organizations of the Pensioners Association have made representations to the Governors in the 9 provinces soliciting their intervention to present the appeals in the same regard made by the members living in the various districts.
The membership of the Association exceeding 6,000 pensioners are confident that an independent examination will reveal the injustice caused to them and are hopeful that the matter will be resolved under the good governance approach of the new government.
