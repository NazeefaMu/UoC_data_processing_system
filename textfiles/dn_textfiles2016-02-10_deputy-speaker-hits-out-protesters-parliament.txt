Deputy Speaker hits out at protesters in Parliament

Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday condemned the use of Parliament for protests by the Joint Opposition as Parliament is an august assembly.
He said the disruption of Parliament sessions by the Joint Opposition yesterday was an act of terrorism.
The Deputy Speaker made these remarks commenting on a protest staged by the joint Opposition in Parliament yesterday urging the Speaker to enable them to sit as an Independent Group, during a press conference held at his office in the Parliamentary Complex.
The Deputy Speaker said terrorists used to disrupt Parliament by shooting and bombing. Today, the Joint Opposition
disrupted the session. The objectives of both of them were the same, he said.
He said they can not endorse the protest which violated the democratic traditions of Parliament and disrupted its day-to-day proceedings.
He said accepting the Joint Opposition as an independent group was an internal problem of the Opposition. They should sort it out within the Opposition. Asking the Speaker to sort it out is getting him to commit the mistake of dividing the UPFA. That is why the Speaker made it clear that he could not be a party to the division of the UPFA, he said.
Parliament is neither the Lipton Circle nor the Fort Railway Station. It is not a place where one would resort to street fighting tactics, the Deputy Speaker said, adding that it was against principles of democratic struggles.
He said many MPs have one foot in the government and the other in the Opposition. This double standard policy does not suit Parliamentary democracy, he said.
Some members want to be identified as independent MPs in Parliament while remaining in the SLFP. They also hold positions such as SLFP organisers and positions in the district development committees. They should decide where they stand first, Deputy Speaker Sumathipala said.
An MP could stand up in Parliament and announce that he would act independently. That is a right of the MP. But a group coming together and calling themselves independent without making a declaration officially is not acceptable, the Deputy Speaker said.
He said the issue at hand is an internal problem of the UPFA and asked the MPs of the Joint Opposition to sort it out within the UPFA. They should first take a political decision on whether they should resign from the party first, he said.
Increased political representation key to women’s success - PM
The issues faced by women cannot be solved by way of commissions, but by increasing their representation in politics, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He said although the government works hard to increase women representation in politics, some opposition UPFA members, including female members attempt to disrupt the endeavor.
“Their attempts show who are against increasing women representation in politics. Women in the country should know as to who stands for their rights, the Prime Minister said.
He made these observations yesterday commencing the second reading of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill in Parliament.
He said Sri Lankan women obtained the opportunity to vote with the Sri Lankans being given the Universal Franchise in 1931. Sri Lanka elected the first woman minister in 1956, he said.
“We had the privilege to elect the first woman Prime Minister in the world in 1966. She was Sirimao Bandaranaike. I am appreciating her. But some UPFA members are criticizing our attempt. We could elect the first woman Executive President in the World in 1994," he said.
The Prime Minister said the government sought the support of the opposition to increase women's representation. He questioned if Pavitra Wanniarachchi opposed the move. He said there had been a woman Chief Justice, Supreme Court Justices, an Attorney General, Solicitor Generals, Vice Chancellors, Ministry Secretaries. Their representation in politics should be increased, he said.
A Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman raped 100 women during the previous regime. A foreign woman was raped and killed in Thangalle. The suspects have been brought before courts, the Prime Minister said.
He said attempt is to increase the women representation at local government institutions to 25 percent.
Women and Children's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said 53 percent of the population in Sri Lanka are women. They are contributing to the economy of the country. They should be given a prominent position in politics, she said.
TNA MP Mavei Senathirajah said the TNA supports this motion and would agree to increase the women's represenatation even to 30 percent in politics.
Petroleum Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage also joined the debate.
‘Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill, Constitutional’
The Supreme Court has decided that the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker making a Speaker’s announcement said the Supreme Court has decided that the inconsistency in the second section of the English and Sinhala copies of the Bill could be amended during the Committee Stage Debate. The Speaker said the Supreme Court order of the case that challenged the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill under provisions of 121 section of the Constitution has been received by him. He said the Supreme Court had decided the section 4 of the Amendment Bill was inconsistent with the section 12-1 of the Constitution.
It could be made non inconsistent by making amendments proposed by the Court.

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was sworn in as a new MP from the UNF (United National Front) for Good Governance told the Media yesterday at the Parliamentary Complex that he will do his utmost to prevent the rise of a faction which does not respect law, order and democracy in the country.
He said a certain fraction intending to sabotage the Yahapalana government has emerged. “We saw this faction behaved in an unruly manner in Parliament. I will take steps to prevent the rise of this faction,” he said. “I sworn in as a new MP from the UNF (United National Front) for Good Governance with the blessings of UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,” he said.
He paid gratitude to former Minister M.K.D.S Gunawardene who was his predecessor in his seat. “President Maithripala Sirisena also invoked blessings on my appointment as an MP. I will make my maximum contribution to make the Yahapalana government a success.

Govt ready to conduct national level inquiry into kidney racket - Kiriella
The government is ready to conduct a national level inquiry with the assistance of the relevant authorities with regard to the kidney racket revealed by the Indian Police recently in Sri Lanka, Chief Government Whip and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
Responding to a special statement made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, he said the government would pay special attention to the issue.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the government should take action on the kidney racket reported in the Indian media and table the report presented to the Health Ministry in this regard.
He sad it has been revealed that six local doctors had involved in the kidney racket in four private hospitals in Sri Lanka.
Making the special statement under Standing Order 23/2, he said a three-member committee and a five-member Committee had been appointed by the ministry to investigate the kidney scam.
He said a kidney racket was uncovered in 2012/2013. The then Health Minister appointed a committee to compile a report on the matter, but what happened to the report is a mystery.
He requested the government to submit the report of the 2012/2013 investigations as well as the recent report submitted to the Health Minister, to Parliament.
Deputy Health Minister Faisal Cassim said although a report by the five member committee was submitted to the minister on February 5, the report could not be tabled in the House as investigations were still ongoing.
He said the present system of organ donations and transplants would be regulated. “We should use diplomatic link between India and Sri Lanka to resolve the issue,” he said.
Decision on Attorney General today
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that a decision on the appointment of the Attorney General (AG) would be made today by the Constitutional Council (CC) when the President forwarded his nomination.
The Speaker replying to a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said there is no political interference into the appointment of the AG.
“The Constitutional Council met on Monday to discuss the appointment of the Attorney General as the President had forwarded three names. However, we decided to seek a clarification from the President because as of the Constitution, the President should only forward one name. The Constitutional Council will meet on Wednesday again to discuss the matter,” he said.
The Speaker said the Constitutional Council follows the set of criteria adopted in 2002. He said a report on the proceedings of the Constitutional Council was handed over to the President. It would be presented to Parliament shortly, he said.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena sought to know whether the most senior member of the Attorney General’s Department would be appointed to the vacant post.
“Even the Bar Association has made a request in this regard. We want to know whether the most senior member, who is acting in the position and whose name the Constitutional Council had approved twice as the acting AG, will be appointed or whether there will be any other decision made to the contrary,” he asked.
“Don’t make the appointment of the Attorney General a political matter. Appoint the most senior and qualified person. A member of the Constitutional Council has asked whether this person can be trusted. The purpose of the independent commissions is to ensure the independence of these sectors,” he said.
MP Gunawardena also requested the Speaker to give a ruling on the matter of divulging the information discussed at the Constitutional Council to the media by a member of the council.
“The Constitutional Council should have kept whatever decision taken by it as confidential. How can a member of the Constitutional Council address the media without the permission of the Speaker who is also the chiarman of the council? It is not a positive procedure to adopt. As of the 19th Amendment, the Constitutional Council should present a report to the President every three months. Such a report has not been presented. The criteria the Constitutional Council adopts in its work should be gazatted and presented to Parliament. Over five months have passed since the appointment of the council, but this gazatte is yet to come. Without such a gazatte, how can the Constitutional Council proceed?” he queried.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe replying to the concerns of MP Gunawardena said he was happy that the members in the Ppposition have come forwarded to safeguard independent commissions.
“When the Constitutional Council was appointed, we decided to go by the set of criteria adopted in 2002 as transitional provisions, until we discuss and bring amendments to it.
“None of us in the government look at this problem in a political angle. For me, I don’t have personal friends or enemies in the Attorney General’s Department. It is the duty of the Constitutional Council to decide on the appointment of the Attorney General considering relevant facts. We have not decided whether to appoint somebody from wihin the department or consider somebody from outside as in the case of Mohan Peiris,” he said.
However, he said time is ripe to think again on re-establishing long held traditions in appointing the Attorney General and Chief Justice. “Otherwise, we will have to go by the individual all the time,” he said.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the Constitutional Council should first adopt a set of criteria in keeping with the tradition, adding that the council’s activities would not be valid if proceeded without such criteria.
MP Gunawardena said the set of criteria adopted in 2002 would not be valid as of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. However, the Prime Minister replied stating that those criteria were adopted temporarily to speed up the functioning of the independent commissions, adding those criteria will be amended in the future, he said.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said, “there is no need to hide the three names nominated by the President. Our politics is not to satisfy those in Walauwas, but answerable to the public.
“We will not hide anything happened at the Constitutional Council. The people have a right to know them and the activities of the council must be transparent. We will continue to inform the public over the council’s work.”
