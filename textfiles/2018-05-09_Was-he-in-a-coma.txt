Was he in a coma?


	



 

Green party’s businessman-politico from Digamadulla was among the top team members sworn in, the other day.

 


However, he was in for a big disappointment when he did not get the portfolio he expected, they say. 
When his name was called, he came forward and signed the appointment letter after being duly sworn in. However, to everyone’s surprise, he walked away without receiving the appointment letter from Number One. 


An obviously disconcerted Number Two had to call the newly sworn in purohita by his name several times before the latter turned back to receive the letter of appointment. 


Most of those present at the event shared the view that the disappointment that the Digamadulla one suffered was so severe that it may have sent him into a coma, they say.
