Joint Opposition (JO) MP Namal Rajapaksa today said he was against the decision taken by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to support the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in appointing a SLFP mayor to Hambantota Municipal Council.

“I am against and deeply concerned regarding the decision taken by the Senior Leadership of the SLPP in Hambantota to support the SLFP in appointing a mayor there,” the MP said in a tweet.

Beliatta SLFP organizer Eraj Ravindra Fernando, who was involved in the “toy pistol’ case two years ago, was appointed as the Mayor of the United National Party (UNP)-led Hambantota MC with a majority of two votes on Thursday.

He received 11 votes from the SLFP and the SLPP, while the UNP candidate received only nine votes.
