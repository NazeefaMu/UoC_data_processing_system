Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned on Thursday a string of murders targeting minorities under the pretext of protecting cows, which are considered sacred by many Hindus, after critics accused the government of turning a blind eye.  


Modi’s remarks --his first on vigilantism in nearly a year-- come days after a Muslim teenager was stabbed to death on a train after being accused of carrying beef.   


India has been reeling from a spate of vigilante murders in recent months, targeting Muslims and low caste Hindus accused of killing cows or consuming beef.
