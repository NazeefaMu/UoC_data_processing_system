Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL), which opened in Matara on April 4, 2006, upgraded and relocated the branch to a spacious new premise in Nupe Matara last Saturday. 


The relocated branch was opened by MBSL Chairman Dr. Sujeewa Lokuhewa in the presence of the bank’s management, staff, invitees, customers and well-wishers. 


The relocated Matara branch is the second in MBSL’s model branch concept, the first being the Gampaha branch, which was upgraded last week.


MBSL was incorporated in March 1982 of which the state-owned Bank of Ceylon is the major shareholder to provide corporate advisory and capital markets, leasing, trade and repayment finance services.


“MBSL has assets valued at over Rs.30 billion and deposits which exceed Rs.20 billion and serves over 200,000 customers through a network of 49 branches. It is with pride that I inform you that while providing optimum service to our customers we were able to increase our profits by 5 percent last year. MBSL received three international awards last year and we are to receive another next September. In keeping with our vision to be the most innovative business solution provider to the nation the bank has decided to upgrade its branch network to serve the public more efficiently,” said Lokuhewa at the opening ceremony.




Branch Manager Shyaman Karunanayake in his brief address thanked the bank’s management and said that by moving to the spacious new model office, the branch would be able to serve its customers more efficiently.


A large number of customers were present to make the first deposits while others who had obtained leasing facilities were presented with keys to their vehicles while holders of children’s accounts were presented with gifts.


MBSL Chief Executive Officer Nishaman Karunapala, Chief Operating Officer Dulip Daluwatta, Senior Assistant General Manager Shamali Amarathunga and Deputy General Manager Jude Gamalath attended the opening ceremony.
