He is back at ground zero


	

It is not something unusual for politicos at every level in the polity to change their political party allegiance from time to time to suit their personal purposes. 

 


This well-known Betel leaf party politico hailing from the Matale district was keeping a low profile in the recent past, not because he lost his seat at the last general polls, but because he had to bide his time to decide as to which faction of the splintered party would serve his personal ends better. 
Having decided finally that time was opportune for him to throw in his lot with the JO, the politico swung into action. He organized a JO branch (balamandalaya) in his constituency and invited a vociferous JO stalwart in the district to attend the inaugural meeting as the chief guest.


The politico’s opportunistic move angered the genuine JO activists in the area who immediately made representations to their leadership about the new development and the latter lost no time in exposing the politico.


Back at ground zero, the dejected politico remains confined to home these days, they say.
