Prelate’s request goes unheeded


	


	This popular Buddhist monk virtually blazed the trail for the new government to come to power. He is now highly disillusioned with the doings of the new authorities whom he once backed with all his might.

Recently, this hamuduruwo heard that a certain female medical officer, a daayika of his temple, serving at a hospital located in a distant place – a highly uncongenial station in the official parlance -- had fallen victim to a chronic disease. She had told the monk, that if she were transferred to a hospital close to Colombo, it would enable her to readily obtain the specialized medical care and treatment for her illness.
The monk thereafter had asked the authorities to give this female doctor a transfer to a hospital in Colombo considering her plea on humanitarian grounds.
However, the request by the monk is said to have fallen on deaf ears, they say.
