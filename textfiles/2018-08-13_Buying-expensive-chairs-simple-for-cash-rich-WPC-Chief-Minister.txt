Buying expensive chairs 'simple' for cash rich WPC: Chief Minister


	

Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said it was nothing out of the ordinary for a rich governing body like the Western Provincial Council to import chairs for the use of provincial legislators at a cost of Rs. 640,000 each.

He however reiterated that the decision to import these chairs at such a cost was not his alone. He was addressing the electoral organization meeting of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in Chilaw which was initially scheduled to be conducted at the Chilaw Urban Council premises.

Yet, the UNP-controlled Urban Council did not grant permission for it. Finally, it was held at the SLFP office in Chilaw. “Ours is a provincial council that is housed in a modern 15-storey building. It has modern facilities. If you ascend to the top floor of the building you will be able to see just how affluent our province is,” he said.(Lalith Nawaratne)
