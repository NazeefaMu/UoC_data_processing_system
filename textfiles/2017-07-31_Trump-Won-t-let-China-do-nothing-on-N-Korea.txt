Trump: Won’t let China ‘do nothing’ on N. Korea


	



 

WASHINGTON AFP July30, 2017  - US President Donald Trump warned Saturday that he would not allow China to “do nothing” on North Korea, after the hermit state launched an intercontinental ballistic missile it boasted could reach the United States.   


North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un boasted of his country’s ability to strike any target in the US after the ICBM test that weapons experts said could even bring New York into range --in a major challenge to Trump.   


In his critique of Beijing, which came in two tweets, Trump linked trade strains with the Asian giant --marked by a trade deficit of $309 billion last year-- to policy on North Korea, after South Korea indicated it was speeding the deployment of a US missile defence system that has infuriated China.   
 “I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do nothing for us with North Korea, just talk,” Trump wrote.   
 “We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!” Trump, who is at loggerheads with Beijing over how to handle Kim’s regime, has repeatedly urged China to rein in its recalcitrant neighbour, but Beijing insists dialogue is the only practical way forward.   


The tweet storm coincided with a bilateral mission led by US strategic bombers on Saturday that flew over the Korean Peninsula in a pointed show of force in response to the latest ICBM tests.
