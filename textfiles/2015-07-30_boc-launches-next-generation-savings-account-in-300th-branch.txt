Bank of Ceylon (BOC) had earlier this year introduced its revolutionary new savings account whose objective is to offer its valued customers unparalleled customer convenience. Since its launch, the next generation offering has been witnessing unprecedented customer adoption at all its branches. Given the tremendous customer response, the bank is currently rapidly rolling out the product islandwide and recently has launched the product in its 300th branch. The product will be available at all BOC branches islandwide by the end of August to ensure customers islandwide can enjoy its multiple benefits. 
The monumental launch was held at BOC’s Independent Square branch yesterday and the event was graced by the presence of BOC Chairman, President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera and General Manager D.M. Gunasekara. In addition, multiple customers were present at the event, all of whom were eager to open their BOC SmartGen Savings Account.
BOC SmartGen is the first step taken by the bank as it pioneers a range of new digital offerings to its valued customers over the next few months. This product boasts of several new age features, all of which are designed to ensure maximum convenience to BOC customers. The new generation product is a passbook free account and provides customers free access to Internet banking, free SMS alerts on transactions and free monthly email statements. 
BOC SmartGen has been carefully designed keeping in mind that today customers value time and convenience over all else. The product is the country’s fastest savings account, which is fully active instantly. It offers customers instant account opening, instant debit card issuance and instant access to Internet banking. Further, BOC SmartGen offers customers the ease of transacting seamlessly from any BOC branch as the customer’s photograph and signature will be captured digitally at the time of account opening. 
This product has been developed as part of the bank’s ambitious large-scale transformation project named ‘Wenesa’, which is being run in partnership with the world’s leading consulting firm, The Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The key objective of this programme is to offer customers across the nation a world-class banking experience.
