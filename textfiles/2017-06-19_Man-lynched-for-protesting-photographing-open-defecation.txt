 Jaipur, (Hindustan Times), June 18, 2017 -  Click a photo of people defecating in the open, and name and shame  them. For the officials involved in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, this is  the simplest and the most effective way to make people give up the habit  of reliving themselves in the open.  The “simple act”, however, has not gone down well with those at the end. 


A  man who protested against civic officials clicking photographs of some  women defecating in the open in Jaipur was brutally beaten up, resulting in his death.


The locals are angry at the death of Zafar Hussain. They are also  angry at the approach that the officials have taken to deter them from  defecating in the open.  It’s not a matter of choice for them, they say. The toilets were in bad shape earlier, and although they have been  renovated recently, they are still unusable.  When  HT visited the community toilet, the centre painted bright yellow, all  10 were found far from being in usable condition.
