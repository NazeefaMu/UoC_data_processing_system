Request to sell Sicille's jewellery to pay depositors


	

Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya yesterday ordered the CID to submit a report to Court on the feasibility of auctioning the gold and gems belonging to Sicille Kotelawela (the wife of Lalith Kotelawela, the former Chairman of Ceylinco group) which are said to be lying in a local bank -- and paying the depositors with the money so obtained.
This order was made by the magistrate when the magisterial inquiry into the wrongful use of Rs 4.3 billion deposited at the Finance and Guaranty Private Company (Fingara) was recalled.
The attorneys representing the aggrieved parties requested Court to issue an order to the CID to take the necessary steps to auction the gold and gems, and, with the funds released, pay off the depositors.
The magistrate accordingly made the order and directed the attorneys to submit this request in writing and also ordered the CID to follow it up. (Thirangi Abeywickrema)
