The wreckage of the passenger ferry ‘Valampuri’ which was destroyed by a LTTE suicide boat in 1998 in the seas off Point Pedro, was discovered by the Navy yesterday.

‘Valampuri’ was destroyed by a suicide boat of LTTE on February 23, 1998 while returning from Trincomalee.
Twenty naval personal were killed during the confrontation and there was not a single survivor in the incident.

“The attempts to search for the vessel were not successful due to rough sea conditions and the volatile security conditions prevailed during that time” Navy said.

They said the wrecked passenger ferry ‘Valampuri’ was recovered on information received from a civilian diver after being located 8 nautical miles North of Point Pedro at a depth of 15 meters.

The wreck was lying on the sea bed for years and one fifth of the keel was buried under the sand. The wreck was covered completely with a distinct level of marine growth and it has become a ground for fish breeding.
