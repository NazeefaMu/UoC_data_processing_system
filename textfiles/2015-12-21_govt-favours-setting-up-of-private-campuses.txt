	The government has decided to encourage the establishment of private universities in the country, while giving the fullest possible autonomy to State run universities, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
	Minister Kiriella said the government had made sufficient allocations in the budget for the development of the university sector. Alongside, he said the government would encourage the private sector involvement in the development and expansion of the higher education sector.
	Asserting that only 20 per cent of Advanced Level qualifiers could enter the State Universities, he said more and more opportunities should be made available in the higher education sector.
	“We won’t interfere with the university affairs. The Vice Chancellors are given a free hand to run them,“ he said
	The Minister said a number of foreign universities had expressed willingness to put up their branch campuses in the country.
	The previous government also sought similar agreements with foreign universities at that time. Then, Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake even tried to amend the present laws to provide for the establishment of non-state universities. (Kelum Bandara)
