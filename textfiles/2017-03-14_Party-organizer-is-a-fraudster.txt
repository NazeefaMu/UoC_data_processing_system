An organizer of a main political party in the upcountry is reportedly making lots of money by selling lands using forged title deeds. Most parcels of land he had been selling on forged title deeds had been state-owned properties.

 


Numerous complaints have been made to authorities against this racketeer whose main accomplice is a personal secretary of a powerful politician, but so far no action has been taken to bring him to book. 


This party organizer is said to lost the post he once held following conviction in a court case. 


Some people are buying lands from this fraudster without any suspicion because of his standing as an electorate level organizer of a main political party in the country, they say.
