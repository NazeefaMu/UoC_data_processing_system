Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said he was ready to take over the Kelaniya electorate and serve the people there.


“Although I was offered the Kelaniya electorate by the UNF, it has not materialised yet. If I get a chance I don’t have any issue with working for the people of Kelaniya,” Fonseka told the media after visiting the Kelaniya temple. (Lal S Kumara)
