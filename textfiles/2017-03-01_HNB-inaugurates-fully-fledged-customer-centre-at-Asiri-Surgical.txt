Delivering an unprecedented new level of banking convenience to patients, visitors, and employees, Sri Lanka’s largest private sector bank, HNB PLC in partnership with the Softlogic Group’s healthcare arm, Asiri Health, opened its newest fully-fledged customer service center at Asiri Surgical Hospital.  
Offering a comprehensive list of banking products and services, the new branch will be open from 9 am to 3 pm on weekdays, and will be operated under the supervision of HNB’s Narahenpita customer centre.
The branch was jointly inaugurated by HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking, Thimal Perera together with Assistant General Manager – Network Management, Nirosh Perera, Senior Regional Head – Greater Colombo Region, Neil Rasiah, Asiri Surgical Hospital Director Operations, Dr. Samanthi De Silva, Director – Marketing, Rochelle De Silva and Medical Director Dr. Harsha Baranage. 
The inauguration function was also attended by other dignitaries including high-level officials from the bank and the hospital as well as consultant medical practitioners. With this opening, HNB’s distribution network now stands at 252 customer centres and 465 ATMs island-wide.
Addressing the gathering, HNB DGM – Retail and SME banking, Thimal Perera said: “At an organizational level, we take great pride in HNB’s ability to clearly differentiate itself from the competition through our service offering in order to provide an unmatched level of customer convenience. 
“Our superior service delivery is an integral part of HNB’s strategy to leverage technology to bring our Bank closer to our customers instead of them having to sit through traffic and get to a branch to carry out their banking. So while our newest branch at Asiri Surgical may be small in its physical size, it is packed with the same powerful modern functionality that is driving a new wave of growth for HNB. In that regard, we wish to express our gratitude to the Softlogic Group and Asiri Health for their vital support in establishing our new branch which we are confident will serve the needs and urgent requirements of our esteemed customers.”
“We are very happy to have HNB as our official banking partner”, said Dr. Samanthi De Silva. “With over 1,000 staff, 360 specialist consultants and hundreds of patients and visitors to the hospital each day, we have seen an urgent need for the development of banking services to support our patients. Therefore we are confident that our latest partnership with HNB, which is one of Sri Lanka’s largest and most respected private commercial banks, represents another significant value addition for Asiri Surgical,” she noted.
