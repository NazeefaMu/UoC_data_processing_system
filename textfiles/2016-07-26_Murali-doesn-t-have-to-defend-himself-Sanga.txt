Former Sri Lanka cricket captain Kumar Sangakkara said that spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan doesn't have to defend himself as ‘Murali is a great son of Sri Lanka’.


“Murali is a great son of Sri Lanka and he doesn't have to defend himself. He love his country. He is free to consult or coach anyone,” Sanga tweeted.


 “If there are any major issues I am sure that @OfficialSLC can sit with Murali and iron them out,” he also said.
