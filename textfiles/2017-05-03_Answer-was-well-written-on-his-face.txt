A prominent Buddhist monk residing in Narahenpita area, on a request by a high political authority called on him at his palace in the city the other day. This monk is well known as a loyal supporter of the former strongman. 

 


Civilities over, the political authority broached the subject of the future of the Blue party now in turmoil. He also explained that the future of the country too was at stake due to the crisis in the Blue party.


After convincing the monk of the gravity of the developing situation, the bigwig requested him to undertake the mission of conveying a peace message containing several proposals to the former strongman.


The message to be delivered also emphasized the point that the party would have no future unless the two warring factions united to continue as a one single entity and also reminded the former strongman of a promise already held out to him: that he would be elevated to a very high office in the country if he opted to quit politics. 


As the former strongman was on a tour in Rajarata, the monk helicoptered there to meet him given the urgency of the matter.


After warmly welcoming the loyal monk, the former strongman gave an attentive ear to the political high authority’s message being unfolded before him.


The monk carefully read the changing facial expressions of the former strongman as he was narrating the message. 


By the time he finished explaining the message, the monk had read the answer well written on the former strongman’s face. And without further ado, he flew back to Colombo to report the failure of his peace mission, they say.
