The President assured that he would not allow the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) to ally with the United National Party (UNP) to form a government again, UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said the President expressed these views during a special meeting held with the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at the Presidential Secretariat after the Supreme Court ruling today.

Lakshman Yapa said President Maithripala Sirisena reiterated that he will not form Government with Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Daily Mirror learned that the President is reported to have said at the meeting that he would be committed to protect the UPFA from the UNP and requested the UPFA MPs not to ask UNP to form a coalition government.

“The reason as to why I dissolved parliament was to put a full stop to the undemocratic tactics of the UNP. I would take all possible actions to prevent UNP from coming to power again,” the President said.  

Meanwhile, another meeting between the president and the UPFA is scheduled to be held tomorrow night following the Supreme Court ruling that of Mahinda Rajapaksa's appeal against the interim order given by the Court of Appeal barring him and the cabinet from functioning.
