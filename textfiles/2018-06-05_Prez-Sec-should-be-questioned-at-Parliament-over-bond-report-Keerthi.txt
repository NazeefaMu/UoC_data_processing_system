President’s Secretary Austin Fernando should be summoned to Parliament and questioned over the missing part of the Presidential Commission Report on the Central Bank Bond Scam, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) and Centre for Human Rights and Research Sri Lanka (CHR) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said yesterday. 

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said all the MPs had been inconvenienced and were facing embarrassment due to Austin Fernando’s move to prevent a vital part of the report from being exposed to the public domain. 

"Fernando's move to seek the Attorney General's opinion on releasing the full report is the attempt to defend the individuals, who have obtained funds form Arjun Aloysius,” Tennakoon said.

“He has misled everybody by not allowing the annexure of ‘C 350’ which contained some vital records related to the bonds fraud to disclose to the public access," Tennakoon said.     

 "Citizens of this country have the right to get to know as to what really happened in the bond scam. Although most of them are not knowledgeable of the bond scam, at least they should know who the perpetrators are," Tennakoon added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
