Control of fuel distribution from the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela refineries was taken over by the Army at midnight in order to restore fuel supply in the country, Army Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne said.

"The distribution of fuel will be restored within hours and discussions are underway to gain technical support from the management and the workers who did not support the trade union action,” Brigadier Seneviratne told Daily Mirror.

The workers who wished to work were prevented by those who were on strike. “Distribution of fuel should take place in a peaceful manner despite ongoing union action,” he said.

The army will take over the distribution of fuel until issues are resolved between the government and petroleum trade unions, the Spokesman said.

Brigd. Seneviratne said they expected to release the first bowser by 10.00a.m. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
