The National Audit Bill was passed with amendments in Parliament without a vote a short while ago.

The enactment of the National Audi Bill is an election promise made by the government to be implemented during the 100-day programme of its rule in 2015.

However, it remained shelved due to differences of opinion among various stakeholders. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardane)
