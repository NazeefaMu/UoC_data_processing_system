Delhi bans Chinese kite string


	

A day after two people, including a three year old girl, died after getting entangled in the ‘maanjha’ (sharp string used for flying kites), the Delhi Government on Monday banned Chinese ‘maanjha’ in the capital. The move comes after Independence Day, when kite flying is practiced throughout the city. The sharp string is often coated with glass or metal to make it sharper, causing deaths of birds flying in the sky as well.


A 22-year-old man died Monday after his neck got entangled in the kite string, making him take a fatal fall from his motorcycle. The incident happened in west Delhi’s Mianwali Nagar area.
In another incident, a three-year-old girl Saanchi Goyal died when she was returning home with her parents after watching a movie in Naraina. The girl was looking out of open sunroof in the car when suddenly her neck got slit by a ‘manjha’ as they were passing through Rani Bagh area, a police officer said.


Animal rights organisation PETA had also last week filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal demanding an immediate ban on use of the string ahead of Independence Day on August 15. The organisation had said that the string can cause serious injuries, sometimes fatal, to birds, animals and also humans.


“Manja is a menace to public safety,posing a life-threatening risk to humans and birds alike. PETA India is calling on authorities to make kite-flying enjoyable and safe for everyone by banning manja from the activity,” said PETA India Government Affairs Liaison Nikunj Sharma.
