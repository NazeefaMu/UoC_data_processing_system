16 Indian fishermen to be released: Minister
	
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today that sixteen Indian fishermen arrested recently for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters will be released tomorrow (14).
Meanwhile, Indian media reported that the Indian fishermen will be released in as a goodwill gesture to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's first foreign visit to India.
The reports said quoting Prime Minister's Office that a fishing organisation in Tamil Nadu had made an appeal to the government to consider the medical condition of the arrested fishermen.
The fishermen are to be released on humanitarian grounds, it further said.
However Minister Amaraweera said there was no special reason. The released is not related to the PMs visit to India. The process to release the Indian fishermen has been taking place several times and this is just one of them he said.
In March, Sri Lanka ordered the release of 86 Indian fishermen arrested for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters as a goodwill gesture to mark Modi's visit and after, President Maithripala Sirisena ordered the release of 54 Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu in April. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

No CEPA with India: Minister
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will not be finalising or discussing a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India during his visit to New Delhi tomorrow, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said today.
In a statement, he rejected claims made by certain politicians that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and his Indian counterpart would finalise the agreement and that it would adversely affect the country.
The minister said before signing such an important agreement, there were many aspects that needed to be carefully scrutinised.
He said, through such baseless claims and empty rhetoric on the CEPA and the Indian visit, some bankrupt politicians were attempting to misinform the people.
Mr. Samarawickrama said the present government would not allow any international agreement to fill the pockets of politicians instead of the benefits trickling down to the people. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Don't rush into CEPA: JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today warned that the local industrial sector would be adversely affected by granting more access to Indians via the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Hearth said they had information that the CEPA would be a main focus during talks between Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Indian counterpart.
Mr. Herath said if the CEPA which was first mooted some 15 years ago was signed it would mean a severe blow to our local producers and market stakeholders because the CEPA opens the doors for Indian traders to ply their trade without any let or hindrance in Sri Lanka.
The CEPA is extremely favourable to Indians and impact negatively on the local business sector. Sri Lanka's exports to India have been estimated at US$580 million while Indian imports to Sri Lanka had increased from US$600 million to US$3,730 million and such a situation is not good for our economy, he said.
Mr. Herath claimed that if the CEPA was implemented, an increasing number of Indian professionals such as doctors, engineers and labourers would come over to Sri Lanka thus dealing a severe blow to our professionals.
He said the CEPA should not be signed without a thorough and realistic reassessment of the agreement and that above all the economic and other burning problems of our people should be resolved on a priority basis before taking it upon itself any other issues based on regional of political considerations.
