If Speaker Karu Jayasuriya constantly refused to recognize the Joint Opposition (JO) as the Main Opposition in Parliament and MP Dinesh Gunawardane as Opposition Leader, the JO would stop recognizing him as the Speaker, MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.

Addressing the weekly news briefing of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, the MP said that all points why the Opposition Leader Post should not be given to him had been proved wrong with evidence.

“We have a strong case in our favour. But still, the Speaker refuses to recognize us, since he has been advised to do so,” Gammanpila said.

“The Speaker seeks approval of the Prime Minister before making a decision. If he is not ready to recognize us, we will have to in turn stop recognizing his position. We can stop addressing him as Honourable Speaker or stand up when he enters Parliament. We can even disobey his orders,” he said.

He said they would make a decision on their next move in the struggle to get them the Opposition Leader Post, at the party leaders’ meeting, which is to be held tomorrow.

A decision whether to be independent of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) would be taken at the meeting, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
