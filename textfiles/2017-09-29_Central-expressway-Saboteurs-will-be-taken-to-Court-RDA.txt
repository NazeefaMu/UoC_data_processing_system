Legal action will be taken against those who obstruct the construction work of the Central Expressway, the Road Development Authority warned today.

RDA Chairman Nihal Suriyaarachchi said that the RDA had been informed that some group was planning to carry out a protest campaign in Kurunegala against the construction of the expressway. He said a complaint was lodged with the Kurunegala police regarding the disruption to the construction work on the expressway.

Mr. Suriyaarachchi asked the people not to be misled by bankrupt politicians because the project was beneficial to those living in the area and the road users. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
