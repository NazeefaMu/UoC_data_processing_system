Spain, (Daily Mail), 26 October 2017 -  
Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has suspended a speech where he was expected to announce a snap election and dissolve the Catalan Parliament.   


Puigdemont was scheduled to speak at midday but will now address parliament this afternoon where he is still expected to make the announcement.   


It’s believed he suspended the announcement while he tries to grapple with divisions within his pro-independence coalition government.   


One of the parties that make-up his coalition has said it would leave the regional government if he calls the election.Meanwhile, La Vanguardia newspaper reports Spain’s government is ready to suspend the application of direct rule from Friday if Puigdemont does promise an election.
