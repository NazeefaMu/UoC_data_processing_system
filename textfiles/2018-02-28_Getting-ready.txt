Large number of elephants has been brought for the traditional Perahera at the Gangaramaya Temple, Hunupitiya Colombo.  The elephants were stationed at a ground near the temple. They were seen enjoying their Kithul palm and coconut palm leaves. They will be dressed for the Perahera later in the evening. The elephants are being used for the Peahera amidst a shortage of tame elephants in the country.  Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
