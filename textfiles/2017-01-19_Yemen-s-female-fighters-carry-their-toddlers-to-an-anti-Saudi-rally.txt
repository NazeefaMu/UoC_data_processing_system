Daily Mail/ 17 January 2017-  Yemeni female fighters took to the streets carrying their toddlers, rocket launchers and machine guns to send a powerful message to the Saudi-led coalition who have played a part in a two-year war that has claimed 10,000 civilian lives.   


A day earlier, a UN envoy held talks with Yemen’s President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi in an attempt to return to a ceasefire and for political talks to end the brutal conflict.  The United Nations said the civilian death toll in fighting since a Saudi-led force intervened in March 2015 had reached 10,000, up from the previous figure of 7,000.
