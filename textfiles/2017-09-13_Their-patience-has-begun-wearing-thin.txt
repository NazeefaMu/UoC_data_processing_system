Purohitas and the members reportedly set to cross the great divide are said to be receiving phone calls from the palace almost on a daily basis. 

 


And all these calls convey an earnest request to them: Be patient at least for another three months.  These calls have produced some effect on at least three purohitas for they have decided to rethink the decisive step they were about to take and have stopped spitting venom at the government, they say.


However, according to informed sources, all others in the dissident group stand firm on the decision to quit


Meanwhile, the JO members waiting with open arms to welcome the defectors have got irked by the latter’s dilly-dallying. For instance, the fire-breathing lady from the gem city area has insisted that she be given the party’s district leadership for they have waited long enough for the senior one from the district to take the plunge, they say.
