A group called the Sinhalaye Api Jathika Sanvidanaya yesterday lodged a complaint with the National Police Commission against Terrorism Investigations Division DIG Nalaka de Silva alleging that he had allegedly misused his powers to engage in corrupt activities seeking higher ranks in the police department.

Sinhalaye Api Jathika Sanvidanaya President Jamburewela Chandrarathana Thera said the TID was in charge of the investigations into the Digana communal riots and added that DIG De Silva had capitalized the situation in expectation of the IGP's post.

“Some innocent people are still in remand prison over the Digana incident. The TID refuse to grant bail to them. We doubt if the TID had purposely created the Digana riots,” the Thera told the media outside the NCP today.

During a media briefing in Kandy yesterday, Anti Corruption Force director Namal Kumara had allegedly accused DIG in charge of TID Nalaka de Silva had tried to use him to frame Commandant, Senior DIG M. R. Latheef and also to use underworld figure Makadure Madush against some VIPs.

Mr. Kumara had said he was introduced to DIG Nalaka de Silva by the IGP Pujith Jayasundara a year ago.

He alleged that DIG de Silva was a corrupt police officer and was dreaming of becoming the IGP and Director of State Intelligence Service (SIS).
