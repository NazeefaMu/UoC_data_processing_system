MS-MR meeting creates rumblings within UNP
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa still has a say in whether the joint opposition should agree to forming a caretaker govt.
All hell broke loose in the Government after the news spread that President Maithripala Sirisena met with his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Colombo residence of MP S. B. Dissanayake ostensibly to discuss the formation of a new Government. 
In this instance, it created rumblings within the United National Party (UNP) which is the main constituent of the national Unity Government. The UNP MPs started harbouring fear whether their Government would be unseated under the developing circumstances. Of course, they have valid reasons to believe so, though. First and foremost, the political relationship between the UNP and President Sirisena has soured beyond redemption at the moment. At such a moment, any communication between the President and the former President definitely fuels speculation that a new political formation is in the making to dislodge the UNP from office at the earliest. 
It is learned that Dissanayake got a rap from the President for leaking out information
	Rajapaksa categorically said that there was no reason for him nor his party to take the initiative to form the interim govt.
No sooner did the news appear to this effect the UNP backbenchers conducted press conferences to announce that it would opt for the formation of its own Government casting aside the Presidents Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in such an eventuality. UNP MP for the Kurunegala District Thusara Indunil Amarasekara said that his party could rope in six SLFPers to ensure the 113 seats required for the simple majority in Parliament to run the Government in its own. 
Likewise, the UNP MPs started making subtle salvos at the President for such inclination towards the political opposition. Deputy Minister of Law and Order Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, who is a regular holder of press conferences on behalf of the party, said he hoped the President would not throw his lot behind a cabal of persons who worked against him at the Presidential Elections in 2015. 
All these are indicative of the UNPs fear that the President would discard them to form a new Government ahead of major elections due next year. 
Secrecy
However, what transpired during the meeting at S.B. Dissanayakes residence is shrouded in secrecy. In fact, the participants themselves did not want it to be leaked to the media that even such a thing happened. Things got out of their hand finally. It is no longer a secret that the meeting took place. It is learned that Dissanayake got a rap from the President for leaking out information to the press in this regard. 
Against such developments, the MPs, who identify themselves with Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), converged at the residence of its Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris on Tuesday evening for what they called a frank discussion with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Though the meeting was supposed to commence at 7.00 am, the deliberations really got off at 7.30 pm because some MPs were late to arrive after parliamentary proceedings. 
The event drew much attention from the media and politically savvy people given the political context in which it took place. Rajapaksa presided over the meeting. In his address, Rajapaksa categorically said that there was no reason for him nor his party to take the initiative to form the interim government, as it was squarely with the President to act upon if he was genuine. 
He said it should be formally initiated by President Sirisena as the person with authority at the moment. He said the SLPP or the Joint Opposition could respond only in the event of such formal initiative by the President. 
Until such times, there is nothing for us to do, he said. 
MR says he cant be intimidated
Alongside, he said he could not be intimidated into forming such an alliance by threatening to put his family members behind bars through legal action. 
Some people say I am going to join the government to cover up legal cases pending against my family members. There are others saying that I seek to join hands with the President fearing electoral defeat otherwise. This is not the case. I cannot be intimidated by any of these acts to join a new alliance, he said. 
The upshot is that if and when there is an invitation from the President, the SLPP will consider its response. 
Also, Rajapaksa requested everyone present not to comment on this matter publicly any further as otherwise it could lead to confusion. 
The participants expressed their views both for political understanding with the President and against it. Responding to them, Rajapaksa said that there was scope for interpretation of it in different ways. 
There is nothing for us to do now. It has to come from their side, he said. 
Also, they were to have a meeting with the other parties aligned with the Joint Opposition yesterday evening. For that, it was decided to invite the 15 members who defected from the Government. At the moment, S.B. Dissanayake and a few others were mediating between Rajapaksa and President Sirisena. 
The Rajapaksa camp is dealing with the subject with skepticism because it believed the President let them down during the vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 
Meanwhile, Rajapaksa, at Tuesdays meeting, stressed that his MPs should make it a point to maintain quorum in Parliament. Some MPs also expressed views in this regard and stressed the need to take up their parliamentary businesses seriously. 
At Tuesdays meeting, former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who spearheads the SLPP, admitted that he met with President Sirisena. He did not elaborate much on what was discussed. He said he requested the President to ensure safety of the members of Rajapaksa family facing threats at the moment.
Mahindananda, Keheliya for new Govt,
At the meeting, Kandy District MPs Keheliya Rambukwella and Mahindananda Aluthgamage pressed for the need to establish a Government before the elections in understanding with the President. Nevertheless,  Kalutara District MP Kumara Welgama was vehemently opposed to any such governing arrangement with the current President.
Hambantota District MP Chamal Rajapaksa, who is also the elder brother of Mahinda Rajapaksa, also took a similar stance. To drive home his point effectively, he said people would boot out all of them in the event of  forging ties with the current rulers.
Ratnapura District MP Ranjith Zoysa was yet another MP who stood against the formation of a Government.
Anuradhapura District MP Shehan Semasinghe showed some flexibility in this exercise. He opined that though he was opposed to the idea of forming a Government, he would fall in line with the final decision of Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
These arguments and counterarguments left Mahinda Rajapaksa in a difficult position in making a decision. Finally, everyone agreed  that the Joint Opposition should not commit towards anything unless a formal request is made by the President. All in all, it means the move to form an alternative government remains open.

No provision in Constitution for Interim Govt- UNP
	
In response to the speculation of moves being made by the Joint Opposition members to form an Interim Government, United National Party MP Mujibur Rahman said the Constitution had no provision with regard to a formation of an Interim Government.
Addressing a news briefing, he said nobody could do anything outside the provisions of the Constitution of the country.
The Constitution wont let them form an Interim Government. Therefore, all of these talks are of no value and just pipe dreams. It is pointless to speak of something, which has no sign of becoming a reality, the MP said.
The JO members time to time come up with topics to cover up their wrongdoings. This is another attempt to distract people, he added.
He said that the JO used such tricks trying to topple the Government.
First they must show a two-thirds majority in Parliament and then think of toppling the Government, he said.
When a journalist asked whether President Maithripala Sirisena would continue to stay in the coalition Government, he said that they did not think he would quit.
He cant quit this Government because the mandate given in January 2015 belongs both to the UNP and the SLFP. Neither of them secured the majority. Hence, he has to stay until the term expires, the MP said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Notes for a Manifesto: Sports
	
Those who encourage children to take up a sport often speak about the virtues. Sports build character. Sports teach many things, we have all heard: courage, teamwork, determination and the ability to be gracious in defeat and humble in victory, fairness, integrity, responsibility and respect. Not all of these can be taught or learned in a classroom, obviously.
Now almost all children engage in sports and games, either in a formal, structured setting (in a school or club) or informally (in the back garden, village commons, paddy fields, reservoirs or shrub jungle). The question is, if playing with and against others is such an important part of growing up, how is it that the associated values have not got ingrained into the worldview and practice of the collective Indeed, how is it that the opposite attributes (timidity, crass individualism, sloth, arrogance, bitterness, unfairness, deceit, irresponsibility and disrespect seem to have triumphed at every turn in every sector
Getting these things right alone wont sort out the issues at the macro level, obviously. However, when sports is such an integral part of school life, and when sport can do so much, we need to ask why the yield is so meager.
We need to recognize, though, that the word sports is for the most part about honing talent, improving skills and winning. Apart from M.J.M. Lafir winning the World Amateur Billiards title in 1973, Nishantha Fernando winning the world title in carrom in 2012, Sri Lanka winning 5 world championships in carrom, the Cricket World Cup in 1996, the T-20 title in 2014 and a couple of Olympic medals, we havent really produced world beaters on a consistent basis.
Efstratios Grivas, Chess Grandmaster and one of the most respected authorities on coaching chess, a coach himself who helped Sri Lanka win a category gold medal at the 41st Chess Olympiad in Tromso, Norway in 2014, has an interesting take on talent. The following Facebook post contains a lot of lessons, and not just for chess.
Principles of good governance such as transparency and accountability are severely compromised. People with competence and integrity keep away or are hoofed out
In 1984, just before the Thessaloniki Olympiad, a match between Greece and China was played in the Greek town of Kavala. Both countries were considered weak at those times, without any GM in their line-ups. The Scheveningen format match was played only in men boards, as the Chinese didnt line-up a womens team. Greece won by 19 to 16 and both teams performed nicely in the Olympiad: China was 12th and Greece 31st. In the coming years China became a super power and especially in women where a lot of World Champions were produced. Finally, in the last Olympiad China hit a duo, winning both sections, crowning the development program which started in the early 80s. What we can learn from these facts is that Geniuses are made - not born and as I have repeatedly written, Talent is the excuse of the failed. Do not let yourself carried away by destiny - try to have quality work with an expert and you will reap success.
Thats for the sportsmen and sportswomen. Its not just about them working hard, though. About 15 years ago local rugby legend Chandrashan Perera related an interesting story about the skills of Sri Lankan children. Apparently some sports outfit in Australia had done a worldwide study on hand-eye coordination. It was found, he said, that it was Sri Lanka children (up to the age of 15) who had the best hand-eye coordination in the world. Thats it. Only until 15. He opined that identification of the truly gifted, picking the right discipline for the particular child and systematic training are lacking. Naturally, our children dont do too well at international events after a certain age.
Systems. Thats key. The issue is not that we dont have systems, but they are either riddled with holes or are peopled with corrupt or incompetent or both. Most sports bodies are plagued with controversy with allegations of financial mismanagement as well as tinkering with the selection process and effectively sidelining and demoralizing the most deserving.
The principles of good governance such as transparency and accountability are severely compromised. People with competence and integrity keep away or are hoofed out of organizations. Sports bodies, from the National Olympic Committee to the apex and regional organizations are veritable fiefdoms. Elections are stage-managed. Theres give and take. Much of it passes under the radar of those concerned, i.e. if they are actually interested in observing what happens.
Money is part of the problem of course; there are perks involved and there are ample income-earning opportunities for those who are corrupt. Oversight, then, is lacking. A culture of corruption has outlawed all that is good, decent and civilized in sports. It is even apparent in the junior levels in the schools. Much of it has little to do with the particular sport, per se.
In schools, for example, theres a certificate mania. Parents are more interested in their children obtaining certificates than learning basic skills. Certificates are valuable. They can help children make a case for being appointed as prefects. Those who dish out such titles dont seem to be interested or have the ability to identify and reward the much vaunted virtues of engaging in sports in the first place. Selections are rackets. There is favouritism. Coaches offer private classes and this forces parents to pocket out more bucks because they are naturally persuaded to think that their children could get the short end of the stick if the coach were to be displeased.
Children naturally pick up on all this. Rules can and will be bent, they learn. Its sanctioned by one and all. Its part of the story. Conflicts of interest abound. Administrators, referees, umpires and arbiters, coaches, parents and players have tainted themselves. Money talks. Power talks. Even those who are really good at what they do, come to believe that performance alone wont help. And so it grows.
Too often, we put all this down to the fact that we are not a rich country. Then again, there are countries who manage sport much better than we do, even though they are not exactly rolling in gold. Its all about doing the best we can with the resource complement we are endowed with.
Systems. Personnel. Processes that ensure that the right people occupy the right positions. Sri Lankas sports sector urgently requires systems, personnel and processes that privilege a commitment to fundamentals, discipline and hard work even as they together operate as a bulwark against corruption and incompetence. We may not taste victory immediately, but if we get the fundamentals right, we would be giving it our best shot. Right now, sports is business and a useful tool in furthering other interests unrelated to the sport. This must change.
Over to you, Messers Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.

PM visit to UK: Four arrested during protest in Oxford
	
Four men were arrested under the Terrorism Act while protesting against the Sri Lankan Prime Minister's visit to Oxford.
The men, aged 28, 34, 50 and 54 were arrested on Monday during Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to talk at the Oxford Union off St Michael's Street.
They were held on suspicion of being members of and displaying an article of a proscribed organisation under section 11 and 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
The Sri Lankan leader joined other speakers at the Union this week including Jo Malone and the former president of Botswana.
Oxford Union wrote online: Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is one of Sri Lankas most decorated politicians.
Thames Valley Police said the arrests were made at 11.16 pm on Monday by officers from the force.
They have since been released under investigation and no further information by police can be given whilst the investigation is continuing.
Section 11 explains that a person commits an offence if they belong to a prohibited group.
Section 13 states that an offence is made if a person wears an item of clothing, or carries and displays items that arouse suspicion that they are part of a forbidden organisation. (Oxfordshire)

RDA, Coca-Cola and Eco-Spindles launch the Give Back Life PET recycling project
	
Mr. Asoka Wickremesinghe - Chairman, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd addresses the gathering
Demonstrating its commitment to Give Back Life to PET plastic bottles, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. along with the Road Development Authority (RDA) and Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd. ( part of BPPL Group) recently launched an initiative to place Collection Bins and Educational Signage at strategic exit points along the Colombo - Katunayake Expressway for the convenience of motorists to dispose PET plastic bottles for recycling, without littering public spaces. 22 Give Back Life collection bins for PET plastic products were placed by Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola has custom-made these Give Back Life PET plastic recycling bins especially for the use of expressway passengers and plans to follow this up with the distribution of educational material about recycling to the public in partnership with the RDA. Present at the official launch were Mr. Asoka Wickremesinghe- Chairman, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd., Mr. SamanOpanayake - Director, Expressway Operation & Maintenance Division, Road Development Authority and Dr. Anush Amarasinghe - Managing Director, BPPL Holdings PLC.
Coca-Cola is committed to achieving high volumes of PET recycling in Sri Lanka by focusing on PET recovery and recycling as part of its commitment towards environmental protection and societal well-being. The beverage company is promoting the recycling habit amongst the public by providing easily accessible Give Back Life collection bins as an effective, permanent solution. The initiative is part of The Coca-Cola Companys commitment towards help creating a World Without Waste. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Companys global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centrepiece of the companys new packaging vision in Sri Lanka as well. Through this the Coca-Cola system in Sri Lanka intends not only to make packaging 100% recyclable but also collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging in the country and work towards a cleaner and better environment. All the PET bottles will be collected and recycled by Eco-Spindles (Pvt) Ltd. to produce yarn, brushes, etc.
Stake holders from Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd., Road Development Authority (RDA) and Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd
Commenting on the initiative, Eng. A.D.K. Mannapperuma - Deputy Director, Expressway Operation & Maintenance (EOM & M) Division, Road Development Authority said, This collaboration between the RDA, CCBSL and BPPL reflects the importance of public-private partnerships to help improve public infrastructure and promote a change in public habits to enhance waste management. This Give Back Life initiative is also aligned to RDAs vision to enhance the environment by launching this and its recent national tree planting programme, which are creating a new civic paradigm for people to follow.
Mannaperuma added further, CCBSLs Give Back Life PET plastic recycling initiative is also enhancing the RDAs vision for a Green Expressway that has been beautified with plants and foliage. Now, people have the opportunity to dispose PET plastic waste in the custom designed bins and feel proud that they are making a valuable contribution towards maintaining an environmentally-friendly expressway by not littering.
Furthermore, Dr. Anush Amarasinghe, CEO of BPPL Group said, I commend this initiative by the Road Development Authority, Coca-Cola and its partners because the importance of recycling needs to conveyed strongly across our nation. Not only does it keep our public spaces clean, but it also stimulates business. For BPPL, one of whose businesses is recycling, PET plastic forms the raw material for manufacturing brushes and yarn. PET plastic can be turned into garments, shoes, brushes and much more.
Mr. Mayank Arora, Managing Director, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd disposes a PET plastic bottle at the Give Back Life collection bin
Expressing his views, Mr. Mayank Arora, Managing Director of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. said, We are pleased to sustain the momentum of our Give Back Life initiative with the support of our partners from both public and private sectors and the public. The launch of Coca-Colas Give Back Life recycling bins along the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway will ensure a pristine expressway for users and create the right impression for first-time visitors to Sri Lanka. Coca-Cola is proud to engage in such critical partnerships to ensure our recycling initiative reaches critical public threshold and successfully changes consumer habits to support our objective to improve waste management in Sri Lanka. A goal of this magnitude cannot be achieved by Coca-Cola alone; it needs the cooperation and commitment of one and all to come together as one to create a clean and litter-free nation.
Around the globe, the Coca-Cola Company is working with a host of partners to deliver its World Without Waste packaging vision while renewing its focus on the entire lifecycle of packaging used.

Right of Reply  female genital mutilation
	
This is with reference to the article titled Female Genital Mutilation by Professor A.H. Sheriffdeen and Dr Ruvaiz Haniffa published in the Daily Mirror of September 28, 2018. With due respect to the learned writers of this article, it must be pointed out in the public interest that there are many fundamental and factual errors in their article.
Religious Argument
Firstly, this is an issue concerned with the Islamic faith, and as the authors themselves admit: We are not qualified at all to contest the religious scholars on the finality over this heading and we seek their learned guidance. However, towards the end of the article, they have already passed judgement by comparing female circumcision to female infanticide practised during the Jahilliyyah or pre-Islamic days of ignorance. They state: During the times of ignorance before the birth of Islam, as propagated by Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), female children were often killed soon after birth or even buried alive. Female circumcision too was a cultural practice prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia. One of the proud achievements of Islam is the banning and stopping of these barbaric practices.
It is highly unethical to state in the first place that one seeks guidance from the religious establishment on this issue and in another place condemn it as an un-Islamic practice. The doctors concerned should ask themselves how Islam totally eliminated the practice of female infanticide but kept the practice of female circumcision to the present day. They also need to ask themselves why every school of Islamic law accepted the fact that female circumcision was Islamic. The only difference of opinion was whether it was obligatory or recommended, with some schools holding to the view it was Wajib (obligatory) and others Sunnah or Mustahhab (recommended). Thus, how could a practice, accepted by all classical scholars of Islam as an Islamic practice be condemned as un-Islamic as concluded by the doctors
They also point out that nowhere in the Quran is female circumcision mentioned. Surely, the doctors, being Muslims, must know that nowhere in the Quran is male circumcision mentioned either
They also point out in support of their contention that nowhere in the Quran is female circumcision mentioned. Surely, the doctors, being Muslims, must know that nowhere in the Quran is male circumcision mentioned either. Both male and female circumcision is mentioned in Ahadith or sayings of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) and in fact, female circumcision is specifically mentioned more times, in the sayings of the Prophet and in the actions of his closest companions including his wife Ayisha (Peace Be Upon Her) and his son-in-law and third Caliph of Islam Uthman as recorded in Adab Al Mufrad compiled by none other than Imam Bukhari, the greatest compiler of Islams canonical literature known as Ahadith.
Besides this, one can point out several errors in the article including the fact that the hadith they cite about the Prophets (Peace Be Upon Him) daughter, that he once looked at his eldest daughter Fatima and tears poured from his eyes and that moment later he had looked at her again and smiled. When questioned as to why he wept and smiled soon after, he had said that a vision had appeared to him of her funeral and that tears had come to his eyes and that soon after a vision had come showing him meeting up with her in paradise, which had brought the smile to his face.
The learned doctors think it is relevant to the discussion to show that female circumcision is Islamic. The fact, however, is not only is it totally irrelevant to the discussion, but the hadith cited is a fabricated one. Besides, Fatima (Peace Be Upon Her) was the youngest daughter of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) and not his eldest daughter as claimed by the authors of the article. Even a third grader knows this. It speaks so much of the learned doctors religious knowledge.
Medical Argument
Now to the medical argument, they have presented to show that the Islamically-prescribed form of female circumcision (removal of the clitoral prepuce known as hoodectomy) has no health benefits.
One fundamental error they make is categorizing female circumcision as FGM (Female Genital Mutilation). Surely, they should understand that there is a significant difference between hoodectomy which removes the clitoral hood and FGM which removes the clitoris itself. Hoodectomy is a relatively minor procedure which involves removing the clitoral prepuce to ensure better genital hygiene and enhance womens sex lives, which even Western women are increasingly choosing to undergo nowadays. In contrast, FGM has exactly the opposite effect, which is to curb sexual pleasure in women. This type of procedure is totally prohibited by all Islamic scholars agreed on this.
The doctors then state female circumcision plays no part in protecting a female from diseases. They also state that the smegma originating from the uncircumcised clitoris and it leading to unpleasant and other more serious health consequences pale in comparison as in the female more smegma is produced under the labia and that no amount of hoodectomy or washing the clitoris is going to reduce this.
However, this is far from the truth. It has been found that the genital hygiene of women is, on the average, poorer than that of men because of numerous folds and the semi-hidden position of the clitoris. Lets see what Dr Edwin D. Hirsch had to say about it in his book titled Sexual Fear on how to conquer frigidity: The buried or concealed clitoris is a common anatomical cause of sexual anaesthesia. Frequently, this is due to the lack of clitoral hygiene. We know this to be a causative factor, for when the buried glans clitorides is elevated out of its bed by separating the strands of tissue which have grown over it, clumps of stale, foul-smelling secretion (smegma) surround this structure. Periodically the hood or foreskin of the clitoris should be retracted so that the accumulated secretions that collect thereunder may be easily removed by soap suds and a slight amount of friction. When the fear of this hygienic process is done away with, a large number of frigidity cases will be automatically corrected. Whether we like it or not, its easier for males to retract and clean their foreskins of the regular buildup of smegma than women to clean theirs due to the obvious anatomical differences as shown above. It would be necessary to retract the hood each day or every other day, in order to prevent adhesions from forming and smegma collecting beneath the prepuce.
Some leading Western physicians in the early part of the last century, prompted by the benefits of male circumcision did not take long to realise that smegma might cause medical problems in women. In 1922, Austrian doctors Clodi and Schopper in Wiener Klinische Wochenshrift (1922) revealed that the germ that caused Gonorrhoea, gonococci thrived in the prepuce of the clitoris. They found that gonococci were found under the prepuce in 74 per cent of cases. This finding they observed had great importance in regard to infection and re-infection of the genitals, thereby delaying a cure. To promote a cure of the disease, it was necessary to cleanse this region and treat it with antiseptics, they concluded.
A year later, I. Pilot and A.E. Canter (Studies of Fusiform bacilli and spirochaetes. The Journal of Infectious Diseases. 1923) examined the smegma of over 30 women which they obtained by pushing back the clitoral prepuce. They found pyogenic organisms, including staphylococci and concluded that these organisms may be primary and secondary infecting agents causing ulcerative and gangrenous processes. Unfortunately, the further study of the detrimental effects of smegma in women was neglected for some time until the 1950s when C.F. McDonald argued in his paper Circumcision of the Female published in the General Practitioner of September 1958 that: If the male needs circumcision for cleanliness and hygiene, why not the female and concluded that The same reasons that apply for the circumcision of males are generally valid when considered for the female. Mc. Donald identified a number of conditions caused by contaminated smegma, retained smegma or smegmaliths in women that cleared up when the cause was removed by circumcision. More recently, Dr Royal Benson found that urinary tract infections (UTIs), an all too frequent complaint in women even more so than in uncircumcised boys was very likely being caused by smegma buildup beneath the clitoris. He lost no time advocating hoodectomy to permanently prevent smegma accumulation.
Heres another finding relevant to our discussion. A team led by Maura Gillison recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that HPV infection was the strongest risk factor for oral cancer. The team found that oral sex including cunnilingus was the main mode of transit for oral HPV infection. Cunnilingus refers to the oral stimulation of a womans sexual organs with the particular focus on the clitoris. The researchers found a 225 per cent increase in oral cancer cases in the United States from 1974 to 2007, mainly among white men. Maura Gillison of Ohio State University said: The rise in oral cancer in the US is predominantly among young white males and we do not know the answer as to why. Dr Dennis Kraus, director of the Centre for Head and Neck Oncology at North Shore- LIJ Cancer Institute in Lake Success had this to say about it: Its most likely transmitted from females to males.
Now, it is obvious that the only way men can acquire the HPV virus is through the oral stimulation of ones partners clitoris which allows the virus to enter the mucosal cavities of the mouth where it causes cancer. HPV finds a congenial sanctuary and breeds in the prepuce of the clitoris just as it finds refuge in the foreskins of males, through the transmission of which cervical cancer occurs in females. Thus, a hoodectomy might provide a solution by removing the area in which the virus thrives, thus safeguarding their male partners from the risk of oral cancer.

## Title: SLs Maritime Affairs  in Changing Indian Ocean

SLs Maritime Affairs  in Changing Indian Ocean
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for the Hub of the Indian Ocean concept to be adopted as the policy platform for Sri Lankas maritime cooperation. This concept has become the ideal platform to address many policy bottlenecks that Sri Lanka encounters today, be they related to transportation, trade, foreign direct investment, security, or even issues of urbanization and environmental degradation. This article covers some of the vital changes in the Indian Ocean that will prompt Sri Lanka to drive its economic and foreign policy towards a new direction emphasizing maritime cooperation.
Sri Lanka, situated at the centre of the Indian Ocean, has a geographically advantageous setting that can make strategic use of Indian Ocean maritime trade links, thereby placing the island as a potential beneficiary of the current global shift of power from West to East. According to the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) -Sri Lankas leading foreign policy think tank - the population in the 28 Indian Ocean states earning less than USD 1 a day (the international poverty line) is estimated to decrease from 12% in 2017 to 7% by 2025. Such poverty reduction is, of course, dependent on these economies continuing to benefit from open maritime trade. Is it any wonder then, that the Indian Oceans maritime relations could be considered an archetype for how freedom of navigation and maritime trade can shape regional prosperity Sri Lanka is indeed blessed to be at the centre of this thriving maritime environment, which has created enduring links between the Indian Ocean and its economy. Sri Lanka only stands to progressively benefit from the continuation of such peaceful maritime links into the future. On the other hand, with the recent global shift in power, with the US seeking to re-balance towards Asia, there is also an impetus for Sri Lanka to carry out some serious maritime policy planning.
The Indian Ocean: Defining Our Future Track 1.5 International Conference will be held on October 11 and 12 in Colombo.
Amidst the growth of such geopolitical and economic dynamics, this article details some of the opportunities that Sri Lanka successfully exploited in the past, which can inspire its future course on maritime policy. The key historical lesson from the Indian Ocean is its tremendous importance to global trade and economic cooperation, going all the way back to the second millennium BC. In this narrative, Sri Lanka played a major role, and arguably continues to do so. By building itself up as a transit point in the trans-continental sea trade connecting Europe, the Middle East, East Africa, India and Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka became a significant player in the Indian Ocean. This great trading legacy dating brought great wealth to the country.
Indian Ocean is its tremendous importance to global trade and economic cooperation, going all the way back to the second millennium BC
As the Mahavamsa indicates, the diffusion of Buddhism from India to Sri Lanka was primarily facilitated by ancient maritime trade routes. Many other forms of evidence have shown that Sri Lankas strategic geographic centrality enabled maritime transactions in terms of both trade and cultural exchanges since at least the 2nd century BCE. The countrys significance in the global trade of the time is apparent in Ptolemy of Alexandrias world map. Many other seminal research works on Sri Lankas ancient maritime trade have pointed out the flourishing trade based on the maritime silk route that connected Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Chinese. This body of research has also referred to the excellence of ancient Sri Lankas maritime engineering relating to the construction of ships, ports and other maritime infrastructure. In addition, during the entire period of colonial rule under the Portuguese, Dutch and British, respectively, Sri Lanka played a tremendously important role in regional maritime trade.
Post-independence Sri Lanka made a clear stand for the openness of the maritime domain and for maintaining the status quo in the Indian Ocean. At the San Francisco Conference in 1951, Sri Lankas Finance Minister at the time, J.R. Jayawardene, declared We are not concerned about favouring this bloc or that bloc. We are concerned about maintaining peace in the world. Later, in 1971, the worlds first female Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, tabled the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace (ZoP) proposal at the United Nations, which was adopted as UN General Assembly Resolution 2832. Since then, Sri Lanka has made a case for the strategic independence of the Indian Ocean. JRs government made efforts to maintain the status quo in the Indian Ocean; as he stated We are not concerned about favouring this bloc or that bloc. We are concerned about maintaining peace in the world. Sri Lanka therefore upheld a non-aligned approach towards the Indian Ocean for many years. In addition, by signing theSri Lanka-India Agreement on the Boundary in Historic in 1974,Sri Lanka succeeded in demarcating its maritime boundary in the Palk Strait, Gulf of Mannar and the Bay of Bengal, endowing the country with a legally grounded maritime security. With the acquisition of a territorial sea area of 21,500 km2 and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of nearly 517,000 km2,Sri Lanka has succeeded in obtaining a significant resource base that can strengthen the countrys economy and broader security.
Given this history of maritime trade, strategic location and vast maritime entitlements, Sri Lanka should naturally play a greater role in the Indian Ocean. As explained by the Executive Director of LKI, Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja maritime trade has the potential to transform the Indian Ocean into a new global growth pole. At present, the region is host to 35% of the global population, but only accounts for 13.1% of global trade. This reinforces that argument that a countrys economic growth is heavily dependent on its trade. This argument is especially valid for Sri Lanka, since some of the most successful sectors of the Sri Lankan economy are based on maritime trade, especially port services relating to container cargo shipment, trans-shipment and related services. In addition, the Colombo Port is ranked 13th in the world according to the Drewry Port Connectivity Index. Sri Lankan port development has also expanded to Hambantota with the joint venture with China Merchants Ports Holdings and will potentially expand to Trincomalee with Japanese development assistance.
Sri Lanka also took over the chairmanship of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in 2018
Sri Lanka also took over the chairmanship of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in 2018. This has provided an opportunity to develop economic ties that can benefit maritime industries and boost cooperation on protection of the marine environment. In addition, as a member state to the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Sri Lanka can also play a vital role in promoting strategies for maritime cooperation that would seek to maintain the Indian Ocean status quo and create win-win outcomes for both regional and extra-regional states. Another important strategic direction that Sri Lanka could engage in is the rapidly developing marine-city concept, which would significantly boost trade and tourism by marketing itself as an attractive destination with incentives for foreign businesses.
Looking beyond Sri Lanka to broader geopolitical developments in the Indian Ocean, Senior Professor in International Relations at the University of Colombo, Nayani Melegoda explains that the Indian Ocean is experiencing complicated geopolitical changes. In this context, the balance of power between small states and large states becomes of paramount importance for regional stability and peace. This elaboration is in line with the global power shift evident from various strategic developments in the maritime domain. There is of course the question of whether these developments can help South Asian states overcome the effects of the big-brother syndrome in relation to India. To tackle this issue prudently, Indias Neighbourhood First policy has been carefully crafted to minimize strategic mistrust among its neighbours. Another important power change is the growing US interest in the Indian Ocean, evident from the coining of the Indo-Pacific term. This shift has led to increasing security cooperation among US, Japan, Australia and India, and to stricter surveillance of the Straits of Malacca and Straits of Hormuz to ensure the security of these choke-points. At the same time, it is impossible to forget the continuing role of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has already invested billions in the region and carved out a Chinese strategic presence in the Indian Ocean.
The enormous economic potential of the Indian Ocean and these growing strategic developments have prompted SL to begin working on a well-planned maritime policy
The enormous economic potential of the Indian Ocean and these growing strategic developments have prompted Sri Lanka to begin working on a well-planned maritime policy. Such policy is essential to safeguarding Sri Lankas national interests as it faces strategic competition between the great powers in the Indian Ocean, and considers ways and means of maintaining regional peace and stability to ensure its economic growth and future prosperity.

The shrewdest  shall survive
	

It seems that Sirisena might not survive on the good work he has done
The United National Party (UNP) led by Ranil Wickremesinge is hellbent on finding stability at present. Its the UNP that calls the shots in the Government and also takes the blame for much of the mess that the regime is in now.
As much as its focused on brainwashing the people to believe in what it preaches on public forums, the Government these days is also keeping an eye on the dissident former ministers and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) marshaled by Mahinda Rajapaksa. This is largely due to talks about the former president and the present head of state Maithripala Sirisena showing interest to form a caretaker Government.
The Yahapalana regime resembles a boat in mid-sea which is fast running out of fuel
	Sirisena, it seems, is likely to tie up with a flexible Rajapaksa and not with a straight-jacketed Wickremesinghe
	Wickremesinghes economic brain has failed to bring financial stability to this Government and the ever depreciating rupee
	But it seems that Sirisena cant survive on the good work he has done. People are demanding a stable economy
If we rewind the clock back to 2015 it was a time when Sirisena and Rajapaksa fell out in their relationship as politicians. Sirisena took on the much popular Rajapaksa at the presidential elections and recorded a shock win. There was bitterness between the two for many years after this election. Both took swipes at each other when speaking at public platforms. Sirisena hated Rajapaksas culture because it bred thuggery and corruption. Sri Lanka entered a healthy phase in its political history and people enjoyed a large dose of democracy more than anything else. At the beginning of Sirisenas tenure as president it seemed that democracy would infuse fresh blood into industries and state institutes, which needed to be reformed.
At the beginning Sirisena found an ally in Wickremesinghe and the two began laying the platform for the Yahapalana Government to play a long innings. And more importantly the two managed to build up a majority in Parliament.
However Sirisenas focus on the downtrodden masses and Wickremesinghes vision for the country, which demanded high spending, brought about a clash of ideas. Now it seems that this gulf between the two can never be bridged, despite the Yahapalana regime depending heavily on the duos union.
Wickremesinghes way of thinking probably annoys Sirisena. Just a few months ago the premier proposed the increasing of ministers salaries by over 200% His proposal came at a time when the country was struggling to deal with its debt commitments. President Sirisena shooting down this proposal also exposed the fact that the UNP is not farsighted; mainly in remaining in power. Economic experts state that the Government was warned about the impending financial crisis when this unwanted proposal was made with the intention of fattening the purses of ministers.
Another condition laid out by Rajapaksa is for the SLFP to server ties with the UNP if the Blue Party intends receiving the support of the newly formed SLPP
The Yahapalana regime resembles a boat in mid-sea which is fast running out of fuel. Now even the promise of a larger dose of democracy wont help take this Yahapalana regime forward. It needs politicians to form the majority in parliament and money to settle debts. Wickremesinghes economic brain has failed to bring financial stability to this Government and the ever depreciating rupee.
Rajapaksas conditions
In this wake we hear of Sirisena showing desperation more than a keenness to forge allies with his former boss and rival Rajapaksa. According to reports the two were scheduled to meet during the past few days for discussions. This is for the purpose of forming a caretaker Government. But the former president has underscored that he would not form a caretaker government with those who have sold the country. Another condition laid out by Rajapaksa is for the SLFP to sever ties with the UNP if the Blue Party intends receiving the support of the newly formed SLPP.
The people of this country are frustrated more than being confused. Its likely that Sirisena would join hands with Rajapaksa. This arrangement would mean that Sirisena remains as president and Rajapaksa gets the premiership; a post which the ousted former president, many say, is clamouring for. If this happens it would mean that the Yahapalana regime that the people voted for will die a natural death; taking the democracy that it gave the people along with itself to the grave. This could bring real frustration to the minds of the people who value reconciliation, fair play, peace and religious harmony among communities.
But it seems that Sirisena cant survive on the good work he has done. People are demanding a stable economy and it seems that Sirisena sees a way out of all his miseries by forging a working relationship with Rajapaksa. Thousands of people lost their jobs and many private sector institutes have collapsed due to an unstable economy and lack of opportunities.
Viyathmaga press conference
Recently some academics who spoke at a Viyathmaga press conference had indicated that there was deterioration in economic, social, judicial and cultural spheres. They have also pointed out that the debt rate as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product has risen to 102%; which was 71 % in 2014 under the previous regime.
Sirisena, it seems, is likely to tie up with a flexible Rajapaksa and not with a straight-jacketed Wickremesinghe. Sirisena emerged as a man possessing a clean sheet. But there have been reports of the president directly intervening and delaying or preventing the arrests of certain suspects.
The decision he took recently to de-gazette some parts of the Muthurajawela wetland has come under fire by critics, largely because of his role as the minister of environment and wildlife. Sirisena has shown during the recent past that he has the will to bend and change to suit the occasion, if it serves him well.
Its a long way to go if at all this caretaker Government comes into being. But it happening is quite a possibility given that Rajapaksa still loves power and the support bases of Sirisena are fast falling apart!

Three-wheeler fares to go up tonight
	
The fare for the first kilometre in a three-wheeler taxi would be increased to Rs.80 and the second kilometre to Rs. 60 from midnight today, Lanka Self-Employed Professionals' National Three-Wheeler Federation Sunil Jayawardana announced.
He said the decision was taken after the Governments fuel price revision with effect from last night and for not consulting them in the price revision and the Government not regulating the three-wheel taxis.
Three-wheeler taxi fares have not been increased for the last six years and I, as a union leader, was against increasing three-wheeler fares. We charged Rs.60for the first kilometre which now becomes Rs.80. The cost for the second kilometre will be Rs. 60, Mr Jayawardana said.
The three-wheeler fare revision will apply to all nine provinces.
Accordingly, Western Province and Southern Province Rs.60 would be charged for the first kilometer and Rs.50 would be charged for the second kilometer, he said.
The three-wheeler fares in the Eastern, Northern, North Central, North Western, Uva, Central and the Sabagamuwa Provinces would be Rs.80 for the first kilometer and it would be Rs. 60 for the second kilometer.
The reason behind charging cheaper rate for the first and the second kilometer in the Western and Southern Provinces was because of highest number of hires, Mr Jayawardana said.
There are 228,000 members registered islandwide in our association and the decision was taken to protect our livelihood and the three-wheeler service, Dharmasekera said.
We have nothing left to do except increase the minimum fare. We do not have any support from the Government. We earn our living by what we get from our customers. We are sorry for inconvenience caused to the people in this manner, he said.
Meanwhile the All-Island Three-Wheeler Drivers' Union President Lalith Dharmasekera said that they had decided to increase the fare of the second kilometer by Rs. 2 for the three-wheeler drivers.
The first kilometer was at Rs.60 and the second kilometer at Rs.40. We cannot increase the taxi fare as we want as fuel price is increased every month. Therefore, we had discussions with the taxi meter issuing companies and came to a decision to increase only the second kilometer by Rs. 2, Mr Dharmasekera said.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Tragedies on railroad tracks Methods proposed to  curb jumbo deaths Authorities still at discussion
	
A railway system which spans over a 100 years still doesnt have the capacity to adopt new technologies to track and save elephants
A cartoon of an elephant, stranded between the gates of the Sri Lanka Railways and the Wildlife Conservation Department done by our own staff cartoonist Gihan De Chickera very aptly describes the prevailing jumbo crisis. Within a period of three weeks, eight elephants succumbed to their injuries as a result of train collisions. Following up from the previous article titled Rumble of death on the railway track the authorities seem to have turned a blind eye to the issue in terms of producing a solution. As mentioned in the previous article, a railway system which spans over a 100 years still doesnt have the capacity to adopt new technologies to track and save elephants. While authorities stay put, more incidents are likely to occur resulting in the further declination of the elephant population. 
Given the present scenario, the Daily Mirror spoke to those responsible regarding what could be done while also shedding light on a few suggestions pointed out by experts to curb this issue in the long-run. 
50 out of 80 locations critical
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Chandana Sooriyabandara, Director of the Wildlife Conservation Department said that 80 locations have been identified so far. Out of them, 50% have been identified as critical including Habarana, Manampitiya and Welikanda. The Railway officers have inspected the place and certain structural changes need to be done, said Sooriyabandara. 
But we will have to have another round of discussions
Not a usual elephant corridor
According to Dilantha Fernando, General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways said that the place where the recent incident took place is not a usual elephant corridor. The elephant corridor is located one and a half kilometres towards Colombo. We havent installed any boards since it is not a usual elephant corridor. There is an elephant fence on one side and a village on the other. 
Advanced warning system needed
Subject minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said that an advanced warning system needs to be installed. But we will have to have another round of discussions. It may not happen immediately. Right now we dont have a system to give any warning, but we are working on it,said Fonseka. 
Thermal sensors
In his comments regarding this issue, Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, Chairman of the Centre for Conservation and Research (CCR), who has conducted extensive research on wild elephants in Sri Lanka, said that an initially study has to be done regarding these locations. Unfortunately nobody is interested. Thermal sensors could be part of the solution, but installing them without knowing the exact locations will create bigger damage. It takes some effort and money. But if done that way we can use the data to install these thermal sensors.said Fernando. 
When inquired about elephant corridors, Dr. Fernando explained that elephants may use certain areas to travel on. We need to collar elephants and find these areas. Elephants do use particular routes to travel, but they dont use them over long distances. There are many locations such as Habarana which go through the Gal Oya reserve. Then again theres Galgamuwa and other locations frequented by elephants. On the other hand, just because these areas are earmarked we cant expect these accidents not to happen,he said. 
According to Dr. Fernando, putting barriers along tracks preventing elephants coming onto the track, without assessing movement patterns based on tracking data, is likely to cause the death of many more elephants. This will be due to starvation caused by loss of range, than those that die collidingwith trains. 
Suggestions
A few suggestions by Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando may help identify landscape alterations which could be done to decrease incidents : 
Conduct a study of the train accidents during the past 10 years or so and see if there are particular patterns including: 
A map of locations - May help identify locations where trains need to go slow 
	Dates of accidents - Whether there is any seasonality - identify periods when trains may have to go slow 
	Times of accidents - Identify the time of day when trains should go slow 
	Whether train was a regular train/off time - More vigilance on off-time trains 
Assess accident points on the ground to see whether there are any landscape features that cause/increase such accidents
Slope of railway line embankment 
	Surrounding vegetation 
	Area clear of vegetation on either side of track 
	Lay of the track - bend/straight 
Collar elephants in areas where train accidents occur and identify crossing areas/points 
Evaluate if the areas/points can be decreased by electric fencing to minimise locations where trains have to go slow 
	Evaluate possibility of under/over passes for elephants at crossing points and funnelling them to such with electric fencing 
	Evaluate reaction of elephants to passage of trains 
	Evaluate reaction of elephants to any mitigation methods 
Thermal sensors could be part of the solution, but installing them without knowing the exact locations will create bigger damage
Beehives
Another possible solution includes putting up beehives, which is an eco-friendly and a sustainable method of keeping elephants away. This method was implemented after researchers observed how elephants keep away from bees.
They are not only irritated by the buzzing sound, but a group of bees could also sting on an elephants skin rather nastily. This method is already implemented in Africa and could be a potential income-generator for locals. 
The incident
Three jumbos succumbed to their injuries when they were hit the Meenagaya Night Mail train in Namalgama, Welikanda last Saturday. The postmortem report revealed that out of the three, two were females and one was a male. Among the two female elephants, one was a pregnant female. As in the previous incident, the foetus was thrown out due to the impact of the collision.

  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

26 year old Ishan Malith, is a young Sri Lankan travel blogger from Avissawella. A marine engineer by profession, Ishan has a fascinating feed on instagram where he posts breathtaking photographs from his visits to various places across Sri Lanka and around the world.

There are many interesting places in Sri Lanka waiting to be discovered

When you scroll through Ishans blog, it is no secret that he is a devoted lover of the environment. Ishan started to travel when he was just 19, but hadnt thought of documenting his travels until recently. The international travel blogger Jackson Groves inspired me to step up my blogging game he says. Ishan has visited 28 countries so far and hopes to visit many more. Asked of how many treks he has taken across Sri Lanka, he says he hasnt really kept a record. There are many interesting places in Sri Lanka waiting to be discovered, according to Ishan.

But what makes Ishan different from other young social media influencers, a fast growing tribe inSri Lanka
The young traveller is also very vocal about environmental pollution. He regularly posts pictures, vidoes and shares accounts on pollution. One of the most disturbing sights he has witnessed during his travels is the polluted stretch of beach in Kalpitiya. The Kalpitiya area is so polluted and so many sea creatures are in danger because of plastic and other pollutants, he says. But Ishan doesnt just stop at sharing photos. The young sailor makes it his personal goal to clean the places where he sets up camp, as much as possible.
Ishan however is not alone in his mission. He has a faithful assistant to help him out, Caesar a German Rottweiler. Asked of how he trained his pet to help him, Ishan says smart Ceasar just picked up on Ishans queues. I didnt teach Caesar to clean. When the both of us were walking alongside a river during one of our adventures, we came across a load of plastic collected on a little delta. I waded across and started throwing them on to the river bank so that I can collect them and try to dispose of it in a less harmful way. It was then that Caesar started to swim across the river with a plastic bottle in his mouth. This was followed by a few more repetitions of the same, Ishan recalls.
After 5 years of travelling and with around 3 years of documenting his trips, Ishan has a message for young Sri Lankans. There has been so much interest for trekking and camping recently. As a result the environment is threatened with so many pollutants. My advice is to travel responsibly and to study sustainable travelling before you do, Ishan suggests.

Turkish video shows Khashoggi plotters
	

A Turkish newspaper has released CCTV images of a group of men police are investigating in connection with the disappearance of a Saudi journalist. 
The Sabah newspaper identified fifteen men who flew into Istanbul on the day journalist and critic Jamal Khashoggi went missing last Tuesday after walking into the Saudi consulate. 
They were pictured arriving at Ataturk airports border control on Tuesday last week having allegedly flown into Turkey in two private jets from the Saudi capital Riyadh. 
Turkish officials believe Khashoggi may have been murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and then taken out of the country by private jet. The group of men identified by Sabah reportedly included Salah Muhammad A Tubaigy, 47, the head of the Saudi Forensic Medicine Institute. 
An expert on forensic evidence, he is known to have trained a large number of police officers in crime scene investigation. 
Mugshots of the middle-aged men, who flew into the country by private jet, were released alongside details of their ages and travel itineraries. 
Turkish television also revealed CCTV footage of them arriving at Istanbul airport and making their way through the streets of the city around the embassy.

UN gives 12 years to curb global-warming catastrophe
	
With Sri Lanka again being devastated by floods and landslides with about 60,000 people left homeless and at least nine dead and with hurricane Michael hitting Florida and the adjoining areas -- the worst in their history -- the United Nations has warned that the world has only 12 years to limit the climate change catastrophe. 
The United States impulsive and dangerously unpredictable President Donald Trump is still rejecting climate change or global warming as a hoax made in China and boasting of his economic achievements such as the lowest unemployment rates in recent decades. But the worlds leading climate scientists have warned there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people, the Guardian newspaper reported. 
According to the newspaper, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released on Monday says urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, which is affordable and feasible though it lies at the most ambitious end of the Paris agreement pledge to keep temperatures between 1.5C and 2C. 
The half-degree difference could also prevent corals from being eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, according to the 1.5C study, which was launched after approval at a final plenary of all 195 countries at Seoul in South Korea. The meeting saw delegates hugging one another, with some in tears. 
Its a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now, said Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the working group on impacts. This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency. 
The Guardian says policymakers commissioned the report at the Paris climate talks in 2016, but since then the gap between science and politics has widened. The US President has pulled his country out of the Paris accord though the US is known to be the worlds biggest polluter. Last Sunday the first round of Brazils presidential election put Jair Bolsonarointo in a strong position to carry out his threat to do the same and also open the historic Amazon rain-forest to agribusiness. 
The world is currently 1C hotter than pre-industrial levels. Following devastating hurricanes in the US, record droughts in Cape Town and forest fires in the Arctic, the IPCC makes clear that climate change is already happening, upgraded its risk warning from previous reports, and warned that every fraction of additional warming would worsen the impact, the Guardian added. 
Scientists who reviewed the 6,000 works referenced in the report, said the change caused by just half a degree came as a revelation. We can see there is a difference and its substantial, Ms. Roberts said. 
In Sri Lanka though, priority has been given to environmental conservation and a eco-friendly green economy, we have seen during the past few years some of the worst-ever droughts and floods in recent decades. Even today hundreds of thousands of people have been affected by the heavy rains and strong winds in several districts while in other districts droughts still continue. For instance in one district the farmers are reported to have lost their harvest of big onions and the government is paying compensation to them. President Maithripala Sirisena is himself the Minister of Environment and has repeatedly said he specially asked for this portfolio because it is a subject close to his heart. Since 2015, the government has done much to control global warming and climate change, but not enough. We hope that in the next months Budget, the highest priority will be given to build a sustainable green economy, through high technology methods with an equal place and an equal say being given to millions of poverty-stricken people, mainly the youths, in rural areas.

8 year old female barber cuts hair for local children, free of charge!
	

At only 7 years old, Neijae Graham-Henries became the only girl in the class at the Junior Barber Academy in North Philadelphia to pass the junior barber training course, and the classs youngest student yet! Originally tagging along with her older brother, Neijaes mother soon realized that her son wasnt interested, but her young daughter was. After graduating from the course, and now 8 years old, Neijae is now giving free haircuts to children in her neighborhood as an act of goodwill and community service. CBS spoke to proud mother Jamie Graham as she explained  she wasnt intimidated because she was the youngest student or the youngest female. It was really exciting for me to see her go after something she really wanted to do. Im hoping she can take that same attitude and same focus and energy throughout her life.

Afghan casualties from air strikes up 39 percent: UN
	

KABUL AFP Oct10, 2018-The number of Afghans killed or wounded by air strikes rose 39 percent in the first nine months of 2018, the UN said Wednesday, as the overall number of civilian casualties remained at extreme levels. 
Air strikes killed or wounded 649 Afghans, more than any full-year period since the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) began keeping records in 2009, as US and Afghan forces stepped up aerial bombardments. 
That figure accounted for eight percent of overall civilian casualties for the January to September period, which slipped to 8,050 -- 2,798 dead and 5,252 injured -- UNAMA said. 
Every civilian death leaves a family devastated, grieving and struggling to come to terms with the loss, and each civilian injured or maimed causes untold suffering, said Danielle Bell, UNAMAs human rights chief. 
International forces accounted for 51 percent of the civilian casualties caused by air strikes, the report said. Afghan forces made up 38 percent. 
The United States is the only foreign force known to carry out air strikes in Afghanistan.

TNA MP Sivasakthi Anandan today accused Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan of violating his freedom of speech in Parliament.
As an MP representing the people of Wanni, I have a right to speak on behalf of them. But the opposition leader continuously deprived me of this right. I have written to the Speaker about this situation. I personally explained to him about the injustice meted out. But nothing has been done yet. It is surprising that my rights are violated under the Yahapalana Government which pledged to safeguard the rights of people during polls, he said.
Meanwhile, JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene said it was unfair that the MP was not allowed to speak in the House. He has the right to speak on behalf of the people who elected him, he said.
However, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said MP Anandan had to abide by the partys decision on the allocation of time for speeches. He said the MP could claim special time to speak only if he became independent.
Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri said he would refer the matter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Bangladesh opposition leader gets life over 2004 attack
	

DHAKA AFP Oct10, 2018- A Bangladesh court Wednesday sentenced a top opposition leader to life in prison and sentenced 19 more people to death over a 2004 grenade attack on the current prime minister. 
We thank God for the verdict, prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain told reporters after announcing that Tarique Rahman, the self-exiled acting head of the countrys main opposition party, was sentenced to life behind bars. 
We hoped that Tarique Rahman would get the death sentence, he said, adding the court observed that Rahman played a key role in the attack. 
Rahman, son of ex-premier Khaleda Zia, was among 49 people tried over the 2004 grenade attack that injured Sheikh Hasina and killed 20 people. 
Prosecutors have charged Rahman with criminal conspiracy and multiple counts of murder over the attack, which happened when Zia -- a former ally-turned-archrival of Hasina -- was prime minister. 
Rahman, 50, was tried in absentia after he fled the country for London in 2008.

CA dismisses bail application of Aloysius and Palisena
	
The Court of Appeal today dismissed the revision bail application of Aloysius and Palisena stating that petitioners had failed satisfy the Court to invoke revisionary powers of the Court under the Criminal Code Procedure.
The Bench comprising Justice Shiran Gunaratne and Prithi Padman Surasena (President) delivered this ruling considering the revision bail application filed on behalf of the two suspects.
The Court observed that petitioners (Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena) had failed to satisfy the Court to invoke its revisionary powers set out in the Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by proving any ground of illegality or impropriety of the previous Magistrate's order.
Considering the arguments placed before Court over the question of law under the Public Property Act (PPA), the Court also held that the current stage of the magisterial inquiry is premature to consider on charges under the PPA since still there were no specific chargers levelled against suspects in a High Court. Therefore, the ingredients to prove illegally of PPA being brought to the inquiry can be considered on a trial stage.
Thereby, the Court refused to issue notices on Attorney General as the respondent of the application and decided to dismiss the application based on the reasons set out in the judgement.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda and Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara appeared for the AG in this petition, while President's Counsel Gamini Marapana and President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appeared on behalf of the petitioners.
Earlier, the Fort Magistrate remanded the suspects considering the allegations levelled against them under the Public Property Act. And later, the suspects went to the High Court as the magistrate could not release them on bail as per the PPA, where one who misappropriated public property causing more than Rs. 25, 000 damage to the State has no bail relief, unless exceptional circumstances or by a high court judge.
However, Colombo High Court also refused to grant bail on suspects rejecting the suspects petitions.
As a result, the suspects filed a revision bail petition in Court of Appeal to revise the bail order of the Magistrate and the decision of the High Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Court refuses to release PTL's Rs.1bn funds
	
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today refused to release Rs.1 billion belonging to Perpetual Treasuries Limited(PTL), that had been maintained in the Central Bank's RTGS account prior to the controversial bond scam.
The defence earlier demanded that the sum be released for the expenses of the company as it belonged to PTL and existed in CBSL's system prior to the bond auction on February 27, 2015.
However, after perusing certain independent reports from CBSL, the magistrate said the real amount that belonged to PTL prior to the bond scam was Rs.855 million and that funds cannot be released for the purpose of company expenses as the RTGS account was not a general bank account but was incorporated for a different purpose of the primary dealers.
At the onset of the inquiry, Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appearing for the prosecution tendered a further report with a sealed envelope which according to him contained observations of the Attorney General regarding the allegation levelled against two senior officers of the AG's Department over threatening an attorney at W.M. Mendis & Company.
Kodagoda was of the view that it was for the consideration of the court to peruse the observations of the AG firstly and decide whether the document could be made available and attached to the main B-report. At this point, the defence counsel raised serious objection to the procedure in which this confidential document was tendered.
President's Counsel Wasantha Navaratne Bandara appearing for the rights of the lawyer who is alleged to have been threatened by the two officers at the AG's Department was of the view that such tendering of document was not lawful as the Attorney General cannot go beyond and practice what was not stated in the Criminal Procedure Court over producing such documents.

Subsequently, the magistrate grilled Kodagoda on questions raised by the defense as to whether it could be done lawfully.
Kodagoda explained that there were many instances where the AG had submitted documents in a confidential manner even before the Supreme Court considering the nature of the containment of those documents. He was of the view that there was a practice in court as such and the procedure would only demand from court to peruse them and decide by itself whether the document can be made available to the public.
However, considering the legal submissions made by the parties, the magistrate decided to further look into the legal aspect of the matter and deliver an order on whether such confidential sealed document be accepted by court. Thereby, the sealed envelope was returned to the prosecution till the order on it be delivered.
On an earlier occasion, some serious allegations were levelled against the AG's Department and the CIDby the defence counsel over forcefully recording statements from three individuals of WM Mendis & Company. Allegations were also made against two senior officers of the AG's Department who are said have threatened a defense counsel based on those statements.
Meanwhile, PTL owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were ordered to be re-remanded till October by the magistrate over the magisterial inquiry in which they were accused of abetting and conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds worth of Rs.688 million during the bond auction held on February 27, 2015.
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd de facto owner Aloysius, its CEO Palisena were also re-remanded by the Fort Magistrate till October 25 over the parallel magisterial inquiry conducted relating to the bond scam on deleting phone call data from the PTL voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Bond Commission.

Desperate parents of Harshani seek help
	
Once a brilliant student of Monash University now bedridden in the prime of youth
W. Nawarathna attending to Harshani Pix Sumudu Hewapathirana
On the second day after her return she began to shiver in pain while lying on her back
Studious playful, healthy and pretty during her schooldays, Harshani Kumari Nawarathna today spends her life confined to a bed since her arrival in the country in 2005 after studying in Monash University in Australia. 
She was doing her undergraduate studies in Australia successfully for years till she noticed some abnormality, first in her hand which later developed over the body, with time. 
She was born in 1981 as the daughter of W. Nawarathna (Her father) and Jayanthi Perera (her mother). 
She received her primary education at Homagama Janadipathy Vidyalaya. When she was preparing for the grade 5 Scholarship Examination her father - a police officer- was suffering for sometime from injuries sustained after falling from a storeyed building. 
Amidst the difficulties befallen on her family, little Harshani was able to succeed at the examination with the guidance of her parents; specially from her ailing father. Later she got admission to Anula Vidyalaya in Nugegoda. 
Admired as a bright and smart student during her school days in Anula Vidyalaya she was able to obtain 10 A passes at the GCE Ordinary Level Examination. 
Five foot 6 inch tall Harshani, endowed with leadership skills, was so healthy at the school. She had carried a fellow student, who had collapsed and fell on the ground, in her arms and climbed to third floor of the school building, according to her friends. She had also spent three sleepless days attending to the funeral activities when her grandmother died. These acts show her ability to endure and cope with any difficult situation. She is also an animal lover. She had often carried small biscuit packets to feed the dogs and cats she met on her way to school. Animals too are very responsive to her kindness and showed their gratitude to her. 

Her dream
As a young student Harshani had a dream to become a genetic specialist. 
Though the Nawarathnas are from a lower middle class family the parents could arrange everything to sent her daughter to Monash University in Australia mortgaging their properties and borrowing from relations and friends. 
While studying in Australia she was often thoughtful of her parents and never forget to speak to her mother every evening. She even told her mother about the young boys who had shown interest in her. 
Once her father had asked her to send him a photo of an apple flower. And soon the father received a photo of an apple flower with the verse - Oba apple malak wage - a popular Sinhala song written overleaf. 
One day when Harshani was a few months away from her final year in the Monash University, she spoke to her mother and told her about some weakness in her body. 
I dropped my pen and I could not pick it up. I also found the mouse of the computer failing to move as I wished she continued about the abnormalities experienced regarding her body. 
A few days later she told that she swayed while walking on the street with two friends and leaned against some boys. This was unintentional, but that boy said that I was a foolish girl,she recalled.
After the final examination she was preparing to return to Sri Lanka and asked the mother to arrange a Bodhi pooja with the participation of her grandmother to invoke the blessings of Gods. 
On the second day after her return she began to shiver in pain while lying on her back showing symptoms of epilepsy. 
Her condition was diagnosed to have been developed as a result of the measles germ contacting the brain cells.
Confined to a bed for 13 years
Harshani, once a brilliant student, is now bed-ridden and unable to utter a single word and take food naturally. 
For 13 she has been confined to a bed. Many certificates that tell us about her talents and skills during schooldays lie on a table in her room. 
Now only liquid food is given to her through tubes and doctors have prescribed two kinds of milk food. One is isogal produced in Germany and the other is Pro gain. Harshanis mother says they do not expect money, but if anyone can provide these milk foods and a hygienic towel for the daughter theyd much appropriate them. 
Harshanis father, now at the age of seventy, says they endure great mental pressure because of her daughters condition. After my death it would be a heavy burden for my wife to look after the daughter. And it is still worse when thinking of the future of the child after the death of both of us,said her father.
He said that they are even ready to donate their house and other properties to any individual or an institute who can assure to secure the future of this child.

The government is expected to present the Commissions of Inquiry Amendment Bill in the near future which will provide provisions for the Bribery Commission (BC) to use the same evidence utilised by presidential commissions for investigations.
Parliamentary sources said the legislation would pave the way for the BC to use the same evidence as done by presidential commissions without calling for fresh evidence.
This will expedite the probes of the Bribery Commission and make the investigating procedure less complicated. When a case already probed by another investigative body is referred to the Bribery Commission, it starts the probe afresh. Thanks to the new amendment, such time-consuming efforts wont be necessary, sources said.
Sources said the amendment would be presented by House Leader Lakshman Kiriella. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

I request that FCID carry out an investigation into this and if needed I will also give a statement on the matter. If not I will go to the FCID office and give a statement, she added.

No doubt, perception is widespread but nothing concrete as evidence that has emerged. We cannot decide on perception.
Q Under the current geopolitical developments, how should Indo- Lanka relations be shaped
There should be a comprehensive Indo-Sri Lanka Friendship Treaty covering strategic threats and joint responses.
Q India looks paranoid about Sri Lankas engagement with China even on commercial projects, and particularly, the Indian media sounds alarm in this regard all the time. Sri Lanka has joined hands with Chinas Belt and Road Initiative. How do you look at the whole picture
China is also located across our borders and hence both our countries must have mutually beneficial relations with China. Also trade with China is mutually beneficial for which we need good relations.
China is also located across our borders and hence both our countries must have mutually beneficial relations with China. Also trade with China is mutually beneficial for which we need good relations
Q India is interested to invest in Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm. What is the strategic importance of it for India
None. Trincomalee is one of the worlds natural harbours/ports, and hence, any country with global reach in the neighbourhood of South India would be interested in it. It is for Sri Lanka to decide as to which country to give access to this port.
Q Geopolitically, India is allied with the US, Japan and the west as far as maritime order in the Indian Ocean is concerned. India and China are the largest growing economic powerhouses in the world. How beneficial is it for the two countries to cooperate with each other in this aspect
India is not allied to the US. Geographically India is far away from US. But the latter shares values of democracy and competitive market system with the US. We also admire American technological progress and thus want transfer of technology and innovation culture from US. We have six million people of Indian origin domicile in US and are prosperous. But China is culturally closer to India and we share common concerns on growth and environment. 
Q When it comes to Indo-Lankan ties, a political solution to the problem in the north and the east takes the centre-stage. From your point of view, how important is it to resolve the crisis
According to me, and as former President Rajapaksa has said, Indians and Sri Lankans are relatives. We must learn to live as one family. We in India admire Sri Lankans under his leadership for your tenacity in wiping out the treacherous LTTE. In this case, not only you secured your national security but also of India. It is for your government to find ways to establish harmony. North and East Sri Lanka citizens should regard themselves as Sri Lankans first and Tamils afterwards just as Sinhalese should. 
Q What is your analysis on the current validity of Indo-Lanka Accord that provided for the establishment of the provincial councils here
The Indo-Lanka Accord has outlived its utility. All that remains is formation of provincial councils and adoption of a unitary Constitution with subsidiary federal principals (for example as it is in India).
Q What is your assessment of the strength of the main parties in Tamil Nadu now, as far as the issues relating to Sri Lanka are concerned
Anti-Sinhala and Tamil separatist movement in Tamil Nadu has fizzled out. One example is the non-existent protests and demonstrations when Mahinda Rajapaksa was in India recently.

India is not allied to US but shares values of democracy 





Q How do you assess the meeting between former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Indian PM Narendra Modi
Very cordial and fruitful. They talked alone. So I dont know anything beyond that.
Q Any idea about the duration of that meeting...
Unable to comment. Nevertheless, we are all happy that former President Rajapaksa came to India. We want more leaders to come and address public meetings here.

Indonesian teens miracle survival  of 49 days adrift at sea
	

An Indonesian teenager has beat the odds of survival after being rescued at sea after a 49 day ordeal.

Aldi Novel Aldilang, only 19 years of age, works as a lamp lighter on a rompong (a floating fish trap that attracts fish by light) in North Sulawesi in Indonesia. The rompong is built like a simple hut thats attached to the sea bed by a rope and kept afloat by buoys. Unfortunately, during the night, strong winds snapped the rope holding the romping in place and it was swept away on the northernly wind. As rompongs arent classified as a boat they do not have an engine or paddles and with only a weeks supply of food, fresh water and fuel for the small cooking stove, his provisions soon ran out.
The clever young man then caught fish and by tearing wood off the floating structure he was able to make a fire to feed himself. Ingeniously, he filtered salt water through his t-shirt which stopped him from dying of dehydration. While stranded at sea many large ships passed him but never saw him. Finally, he spotted a bulk carrier bearing the name Arpeggio. Unsuccessfully he tried waving down the ship but like ships before, they were unable to spot him. Aldi then remembered that a friend had taught him a radio frequency he could use if he was ever in trouble. Hearing his distress call, the captain of the Arpeggio turned around and spotted the rompong but with the waves so high they were unable to get close enough to the structure to rescue Aldi. It was then, in another act of courage, Aldi jumped into the ocean and was able to catch a rope tossed down by the Arpeggios crew and brought up on deck where he was given food, water and fresh clothes.
Finding out he had floated all the way to Guam, his rescuers advised him they were on their way to Japan and they would take Aldi back with them and the Indonesian Consulate would organize all the documents needed to transport Aldi back to his family.
After a brief period in quarantine in Japan, Aldi was given the go ahead to fly home and is now reunited with his family in Wori, Manado and is in good health after his survival.

Jpura to fete  journos,  writers  and artistes
	
The University of Sri Jayewardenapura is slated to felicitate the journalists, writers and artistes among its alumni who have excelled in their respective fields at a gala awards ceremony to be held on October 17 at Waters Edge, commencing at 6pm. President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to grace the occasion as the chief guest. 
Some forty members of the university alumni are scheduled to receive awards at this event titled Kalakara Abhinandana. It is the third in an annual series. 
The University of Sri Jayewardenepura has a long history dating back to 1873 when the Vidyodaya Pirivena was established by the scholarly monk Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera. It was established as a centre for learning. 
Some forty members of the university alumni are scheduled to receive awards at this event titled Kalakara Abhinandana. It is the third in an annual series
In 1956, following the policy of promoting national languages and culture, it was decided to establish two new universities by conferring university status on the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara Pirivenas. Accordingly, the Vidyodaya University and Vidyalankara University Act No. 45 of 1958 established the universities at the Vidyodyaya Pirivena at Maligakanda and the Vidyalankara Pirivena at Kelaniya. Vidyodaya was thus reconstituted as the Vidyodaya University of Ceylon. 
Professor in Business Economics Sampath Amaratunge serves as the incumbent Vice Chancellor of the university.

## Title: LET THERE BE NO MORE VICTIMS LIKE ME

## Date: 11 October 2018 12:00 am
LET THERE BE NO MORE VICTIMS LIKE ME
	
I am a victim of Female Genital Cutting some might want to call it circumcision, I call it Mutilation. Not in the way that the proponents want to depict it as what happens in Africa with horrific scars, but in the way it happened to me in Sri Lanka where there are still scars, tiny, almost unnoticeable, but in all the ways that matter, it has damaged me no less than those horrific scars one talks about in Africa.
To those who want to medicalize the procedure, let me say that I was cut by a qualified doctor, in a sterile environment when I was seven years old. I remember that day clearly and it is I who has had to live with the consequence of what was done to me in the name of religion. Not my religious leaders, not my elders and not that doctor  ME  the women, that child without a voice, grew up to be.
Let me now take the arguments Ive heard in support of the procedure and give you my perspective as someone who has first hand experience of the negative impacts of FGC. I will use the term female genital cutting (FGC) since irrespective of what one wants to call it, that is what is done to a lesser or greater degree, depending on who hold the pin, blade or knife.
I still havent come across any argument to support as to why the procedure needs to be performed on infants or seven-year-old girls
	I personally find the very idea of parents allowing strangers access to their daughters private parts for non-medical reasons an extremely discomforting thought
	Im a Muslim, but I dont believe that God who created me required any MAN or WOMAN to tamper with my body
A. Sex lives as Adults.
1. To the women who say that you have better sex lives due to FGC performed on you as a child, I ask you  what is your point of reference Have you had sex with the same partner before and after your FGC to arrive at this conclusion
Have you ever considered the possibility that you have been very lucky, and that whoever performed the FGC on you spared you any real damage
It is also very presumptuous for you to assume that NONE of the billions of uncircumcised women around the world enjoy great sex same as you.
2. To the women who dont have a horrific memory related to their own FGC and who dont understand what all the fuss is about. Let me tell you that neither do I. I dont have any horrific memories of that day when I was seven years old. My Mom who accompanied me held me gently, the doctor looked very professional and it was over before I knew what was being done. I felt a pinch, no bleeding that I can remember  just some cotton wool that smelled of antiseptic placed there after I was cut. And I walked out, in discomfort, confused but definitely not traumatized.
It was as an adult that I realized the impact of what was done to me. I feel pain during intercourse. Most of you who have been through FGC may not. But does that mean you are not damaged Have you ever considered the fact that intercourse is supposed to be more than just pleasant or something you put up with when your husband feels so inclined
In my case, I have been examined by a doctor who has seen the tiny scars and helped me understand the impact of those scars on my ability to enjoy sex.
Initially I wondered whether I was a mere unfortunate mistake by this doctor  I have since then come across stories of others who were cut by the same and other doctors who share similar tales. So no, I was not an unfortunate accident  the doctor and others like him/her knew exactly what they were doing and did it nonetheless.
B. The need to perform the procedure on a child.
All the literature shared by the supporters of this practice alludes to adult women enjoying their sex lives. I still havent come across any argument to support as to why the procedure needs to be performed on infants or seven-year-old girls who have a long way to go before they are sexually active.
So, what is effectively being promoted is in fact sexualizing children. News flash - These organs dont stay dormant and get activated only when one gets married.
I personally find the very idea of parents allowing strangers access to their daughters private parts for non-medical reasons and letting them alter her genitals, an extremely discomforting thought.
Im more inclined to believe that in their heart of hearts they know that they are in fact desexualizing her. Wanting to keep her pure and innocent until she could be given away. No thought giving to the fact that she then has to live with a damaged body and fulfil marital obligations that she may not enjoy as much in their effort to keep her pure and innocent until she was given away.
C. The Religious Argument 
There are two aspects to this debate
1. Who decides on ones religious belief  the individual or the individuals parent
Yes, the parents would bring up the child within the religious norms they follow and yes in most cases the child would continue with that belief till the end, but this is not a certainty.
Hence how do you justify altering a childs body, without any medical need, to be in alignment with the parents religious belief when that child is yet to determine what path she would take or which God she will follow once she has learned enough to make that decision
As for me, Im a Muslim, but I dont believe that the God who created me required any MAN or WOMAN to tamper with my body, with a presumption that they can make it better. I believe the Quran, when it says that all of Gods creations are perfect. I wont let any MAN or WOMAN tell me otherwise.
But my body has been altered irrevocably  its no longer the way God created it to be. My body is now in conflict with MY religious beliefs  it has ended up representing the beliefs of others and not mine.
2. This is not a belief shared by all Muslims across the world 
Much debate exists within the Muslim world as to whether FGC is even required under Islam. There is no evidence of it being required by the Prophet of his household or being carried out on his daughter/s.
The very fact that it is much debated within the Muslim world with many concluding it as not obligatory and in some cases even dissuading the practice, should lend itself to introspection among those who support it in Sri Lanka - as to whether this is a fight that really needs to be fought or whether one should focus on the greater good  protection of the rights of the girl child  a true gift from God.
D. Responsibility of the State
The questions the State need to keep at the forefront when deciding on the way forward on the issue are:
1. Isnt it the responsibility of the State to protect the girl child from any move to sexualize or desexualize her, specially by religious leaders and male proponents who should never be allowed to speak on this matter which is a womens issue  even if religious.
2. Isnt it the responsibility of the State to dissuade elders from altering the body of a child for non-medical reasons
3. Isnt it the responsibility of the State to prevent anyone from stamping their religious conviction on a childs body, when she is yet to decide on her own religious convictions In other words protecting the right of the INDIVIDUAL to their religious freedom foremost.
The response cannot be anything other than affirmative on all three questions posed above. Yes, it is the responsibility of the State, at least until she is an adult and can take all these decisions for herself depending on HER body, HER preference and HER religious convictions.

Malaysia to abolish death penalty
	
Malaysia's Cabinet has agreed to abolish the death penalty and halt pending executions, Al Jazeera reported a short while ago.
It said a proposed bill on abolishing capital punishment is likely to be discussed by the government when the Malaysian Parliament meets on Monday.
"All death penalty will be abolished. Full stop, Malaysian Law Minister Liew Vui Keong has said.
He called for a halt on all executions until the decision is in effect, saying: "Since we are abolishing the sentence, all executions should not be carried out."
"We will inform the Pardons Board to look into various applications for convicts on the [death penalty] waiting list to either be commuted or released," he said.
Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo has confirmed that the cabinet, which met on Wednesday, had resolved to end the death penalty.
More than 1,200 people are on death row in Malaysia, which mandates hanging as punishment for a wide range of crimes including murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking and treason, among others.

Malik rejects allegation of soliciting USD 25 mn commission
	
Minister of Development Strategies and International trade Malik Samarawickrama yesterday rejected the allegations made by a company that he and his State Minister had demanded a commission of US 25 million to have a project to produce and export High-Speed Trains.
Minister Samarawickrama said this in a statement made in Parliament last afternoon.
This is a totally false allegation. In fact, I have never met this party, nor have I spoken to them or even seen the colour of them, the Minister said.
At no stage do the Ministers get involved in the approval process of projects in Board of Investment (BOI). However, I have requested for and received a report of this proposal, which I will table, the Minister added.
Accordingly, the Minister said Ceylon High-Speed Railways Ltd. Nugape Pamunugama was incorporated in Sri Lanka on April 9, 2015, with two local directors.
The company had pledged to invest Euro 488 million and to maintain a working capital of Euro 2.2 billion.
The Minister said the company had demanded 2,242 acres of Crown Land in three locations through outright purchase and 1,823 acres of private land. The company had also wanted from the Government 220 prime movers, 40 excavators, 75 boom trucks, 100 land vehicles, 50 buses, 400 bicycles, 1,200 water pumps, 1,500 air conditioning units, four helicopters, 22 special vehicles for the families of investors, three 36 floor office buildings, two ships and 10,000 mobile phones.
Also the company has demanded 95 per cent tax exemption, permission to operate a private bank and licences for TV and radio channels, he said.
"However, I have written to DIG-CID, to investigate into the matter at this earliest convenience and take necessary action against any Cabinet Minister, if such funds have been exchanged. I am tabling the letter I have sent to the DIG," he said.
Last week media institutions alleged that a sum of Rs. 150 million had been received to be credited to my bank account and the Central Bank had frozen the funds.
This is also a totally false allegation. I have checked with the Central Bank and I was informed that no such funds have been deposited. Is this the media freedom we wanted This is nothing but freedom of the wild ass, he also said.
"I request you to kindly take necessary steps to prevent Members of Parliament being insulted and defamed by the irresponsible media outlets, coming out with fake news. If not, no decent person will want to enter Parliament," he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Minister Musthapha to secure release of Lankan held in Maldives
	
Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday vowed to work proactively and vigorously to secure the release of Lahiru Madushanka, a Sri Lankan man held in Maldives on charges of being part of an assassination plot on outgoing Maldivian President Abdullah Yameen Abdul Gayoom.
Minister Musthapha said Mr. Madushanka was a Sri Lankan job seeker, who went to Maldives in October, 2015 in the promise of employment but unfortunately he was arrested in Maldives for allegedly plotting to assassinate outgoing Maldivian President Gayoom.
The Maldivian authorities suspected him to be a sniper who previously worked for the military. He was arrested in 2015, and is currently behind bars on account of a much prolonged trial. Mr. Madushanka has no access to his family or a lawyer up until now, he said.
He also said the Amnesty International issued a report, which included the present condition of Mr. Madushanka, claiming that he was being tortured.
With the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena, I met Maldivian President-Elect Ibrahim Mohamed Solih - Ibu. I also took up the case of Mr. Madushanka and discussed in depth the details of his case, he said.
I informed Maldivian President-Elect Solih - Ibu that there is no record of Mr. Madushanka ever working for the military or any other security force. The evidence against him is insufficient to press further charges, he added.
He said Maldivian President-Elect had guaranteed to expedite the process and immediately grant a solution to the problem. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
