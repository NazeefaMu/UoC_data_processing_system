Don’t expect quick fixes cautions head coach Graham Ford

South African-born Graham Ford told the Sri Lankan media not to expect any quick fixes with regard to performances as he undertook his new assignment as head coach of the Sri Lankan cricket team.
“Sri Lanka is in the early part of a rebuilding phase so don’t expect any quick fixes,” Ford said addressing a media conference at SLC headquarters to announce his appointment.
“I am very aware what a huge challenge it is. Sri Lanka finds itself in the very early stages of an important team rebuilding process, a lot of hard work needs to be done so it’s very important that this team building is done on a very solid foundation so patience is required,” said Ford who has returned as coach of the national team for a second time. His first stint was from 2012-14.
“I know there is an abundance of talent within the system but it is about identifying those who have got the mental toughness to go on and become consistent players and become match winners at international level.
“It’s quite a long process which is required to be put in place, a lot of hard work and certainly not just for me but all involved particularly Jerome (Jayaratne) who has been involved in Sri Lanka cricket for a long time and knows the players so well and the wealth of knowledge technically and tactically. It’s important his input and also the selectors and the Board all working together to ensure the long term process can take place so that we can take Sri Lanka back to top of the international stage,” he said.
Jayaratne who is the head of coaching at Sri Lanka Cricket is expected to be appointed assistant coach to Ford as well as take on the role of manager of the Sri Lanka team, a position previously held by Jerry Woutersz.
The current team is going through a period of transition following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara and team performances have sunk to the level that Sri Lanka lost its top ranking in T20 cricket which they had held since 2014, slipped to seventh slot in the Test rankings and lie fifth in the ODIs. It is a far cry from where they were when Ford left them in 2014 after a two-year stint.
“It is a rebuilding phase that everybody has to go through from time to time. It is about bringing in the younger cricketers and working hard to give them the confidence to perform consistently at international level. That can take some time, you can’t put a time frame on it,” said Ford.
“Hope things happen pretty quickly it depends on the work ethic and the attitude of the players. Improvement can happen very quickly but it requires patience from coaches, selectors, board members etc.
“At times young players do make mistakes when they take a step up to international cricket. You take a couple of steps forward and then the odd step back. As long as they are making progress it doesn’t matter. There is enough exciting stuff going on in Sri Lankan cricket to make sure the team improves on those rankings,” he said.
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala revealed that Ford was one of 12 coaches interviewed by him and vice presidents Jayantha Dharmadasa and K Mathivanan.
“We have secured the services of one of the best coaches in the world. Ford is a coach who can transform our game into a different level to become the best team in the world in all three formats,” said Sumathipala.
“We have appointed Ford for 45 months so that he covers the 2019 World Cup in England where he has firsthand knowledge of the conditions there having coached the counties. We believe that we can win the 2019 World Cup in England with Ford’s help,” he said.
Sumathipala also thanked former Sri Lanka cricketing great Kumar Sangakkara for playing a pivotal role in the release of Ford from English county Surrey where he has been coaching. Sangakkara completed one season of county cricket with Surrey last year with Ford as coach and the county fared well to earn promotion from division II to the Premier league.
“We are happy that Graham has agreed to work with us. One of the key reasons for it is he believes that there is stability in Sri Lanka Cricket there’s a way forward thinking and a professional approach to cricket. The arrival of Graham is going to boost our entire campaign to secure the Asia Cup and World T20 Cup,” Sumathipala said.
“I am extremely honoured that Sri Lanka Cricket should show confidence in my ability as a coach,” said Ford. “I can’t tell you how excited I am to be back and involved with the Sri Lankan lads. Everybody knows and I’ve said it many times how much I enjoyed my first two years with the Sri Lankan team. I really believe the players have such passion and good cricketing attitude.”
