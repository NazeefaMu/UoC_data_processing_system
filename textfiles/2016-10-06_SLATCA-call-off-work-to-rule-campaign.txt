The Sri Lanka Air Traffic Controllers’ Association (SLATCA) said today it had received a favourable reply from Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and as such had decided to call off its work-to-rule campaign, SLATCA Vice President Tharindu Gajadeera said.

He said at the second round of talks held at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) the minister had assured that the demands made by the SLATCA would be granted.

Mr. Gajadeera said at yesterday’s meeting, the minister had admitted to there being an anomaly in the payment of allowances from mid-June last year.

“The minister gave us a verbal assurance that these matters will be definitely sorted by end of this year,” Mr. Gajadeera said and the minister had undertaken to inform the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) to take into account the allowances which had been paid before the anomaly came about and resolve this matter by the end of this year.

“The new allowance structure will be implemented from January next year based on the reports submitted by the SLIDA,” the Minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
