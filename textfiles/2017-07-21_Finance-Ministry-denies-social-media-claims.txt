The Finance Ministry said today dismissed social media claims that the vehicle used in the alleged failed attempt to abduct Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC) convener belonged to it.

It further said the incident which had taken place at the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) premises on Thursday (20) evening had nothing to do with the ministry.

Finance Ministry said that it denied the social media claims that the vehicle no NA-0410 belonged to it.

It said that the vehicle in question had been imported under a duty free imported permit.

However, the ministry said that it didn't mean the vehicle was belonging to the Ministry.

Therefore the Ministry said that it has no liability or a responsibility with the NA-0410 Hiace KDH vehicle that was allegedly used in the alleged attempt to abduct Ryan Jayalath. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
