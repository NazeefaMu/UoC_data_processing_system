A woman who had been arrested after knocking down a 13-year-old schoolboy and seriously injuring him while she was driving on the wrong side of the road at the Kelaniya-Waragodawatte Junction had been released on police bail within an hour or so of the accident, without being produced in court, due to the influence of a retired senior police officer, police sources said.

The accident had occurred on Tuesday evening. The schoolboy, a resident of Kelaniya had been admitted to the Accident Ward of the Colombo National Hospital as his injuries were serious.

The woman driver is a resident of Pamunuwila and employed in a private institute.

Following the accident, she had been taken into custody by the police at about 7.15 p.m. and released on the same day, under police bail, at around 8.30 p.m., allegedly due to the influence of a retired DIG and an ASP.

Acting Police Media Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said such a driver cannot be released without being produced in court if the victim has sustained serious injuries and been admitted to hospital. He agreed to look into the matter. (Indika Ramanayake)
