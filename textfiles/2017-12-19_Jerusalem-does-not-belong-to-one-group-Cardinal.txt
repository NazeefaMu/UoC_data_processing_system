Condemning the decision of Israel to shift its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which is considered sacred by the Christians, the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith today said this city does not belong to one group of people.

“The Catholic church is of the opinion that Jerusalem should not be a city which belongs to one group of people and therefore we cannot approve the recent developments with regard to this city,” he said.

USA has now accepted it as Israel’s capital. (Yohan Perera and Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana)
