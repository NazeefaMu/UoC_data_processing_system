Fast track the return home of displaced people: UNSG
	
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, today urged the Government to fast track the releasing of land while reducing the size of the military in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
I urge you to speed up the return of land so that the remaining communities of displaced people can return home. In parallel, the size of the military force in the North and East could be reduced, helping to build trust and reduce tensions, Mr. Ban, who is on a three day visit to the country, said at an event held in Colombo.
In his keynote address on "Sustaining Peace  Achieving Sustainable Development Goals", he said the need for fast tracking the process to allow displaced people to return home and help reduce tensions in the country.
Speaking of his previous visit to the country in 2009, Mr. Ban said the Government had made impressive progress and congratulated it on passing the 19th Amendment and the Right to Information Act.
I commend your efforts to move forward on a comprehensive transitional justice agenda and on a constitutional reform process, he said adding that however, much needed to be done to redress the wrongs of the past and restore the legitimacy and accountability of key institutions, particularly the judiciary and the security services.
I commend the Governments moves to restore the credibility and independence of the Human Rights Commission. Now it is important that the Commission receives the respect and resources it needs to carry out its work effectively. This is critical for reconciliation, and for ensuring respect for the human rights of all Sri Lankans, without regard for ethnicity, religion, political affiliation or any other factors, Mr. Ban said.

Fitch affirms Citibank Colombo branch at AAA(lka); outlook stable
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citibank N.A. Colombo branchs (CitiSL) national long-term rating at AAA(lka). The outlook is stable. CitiSLs rating is the highest on the national rating scale and reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Citibank, N.A. (A+/Stable).
Citibank, N.A.s rating is higher than Sri Lankas long-term local- and foreign-currency issue default ratings of B+/Negative, and as a result CitiSLs rating on the National Rating scale is mapped to AAA(lka). The rating is linked with Citibank, N.A.s issuer default rating (IDR) because of CitiSLs legal status as a branch of Citibank, N.A., which makes it a part of the same legal entity.
Fitch believes that support from Citibank, N.A. would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka.
CitiSLs strategic objectives are aligned with those of Citigroup. The branch is integrated into global operations through utilisation of common systems, such as groups core banking and anti-money laundering systems, and through regular reporting, including periodic internal audits.
As a result of CitiSLs stringent customer evaluation framework, its loan book is significantly concentrated, with the five largest loans accounting for 54 percent of total lending at end-1H16. Further, CitiSL has consistently maintained sound asset quality with zero non-performing loans since 2009.
The contribution of deposits to the banks funding mix has declined to 71 percent at end-1H16 from 86 percent at end-2015. However, Fitch believes that CitiSLs liquidity position is stable as the branch has access to intergroup funding, if needed. CitiSLs Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio remains around 46.7 percent at end-1Q16 and the branchs FCC ratio is much higher than that of its domestic peers.
CitiSL was established in 1979 and operates as a single branch in Sri Lanka.

Give me time: President to UN Chief
	
President Maitripala Sirisena said today he had told visiting UN Secretary General (UNSG) Ban Ki-moon to give him time to move slowly as the country had come out of a long conflict.
At a meeting with media heads at the Presidents House the President said following the official meeting with the UNSG on Thursday evening, he had a one-to-one meeting of about ten minutes with him as well.
He said Mr. Ban was appreciative of the efforts taken by the government to restore democracy, media freedom, establish independent commissions and the moves to bring about reconciliation and added that Mr. Ban had assured that the UN would provide Sri Lanka with whatever assistance was necessary in this regard.
The President said that releasing of land to the displaced persons living in camps was moving steadily and was confident that the process could be completed in another three months. He said there were problems with regard to surveying of land and that had caused some of the delays.
The President said he told Mr. Ban that when he visits the North some of the people there would tell him that the Government had not done anything and needs to expedite matters. He said he told the UNSG that he needed time to move slowly as the country had come out of a long- drawn conflict.
The President said Mr. Ban did not tell him to do such and such a thing within such and such a time and that his smile conveyed much appreciation of the work that the Government was carrying out.
To a question asked by the media about some of the protests that had taken place on the release of lands in certain places in the North, the President said he had actually expected more protests and fasts in the North to coincide with the visit of Mr. Ban. However, he said that though there were reasons behind the protests there were also certain extremist groups and persons who stir things up. The President said when action was taken to survey the land there were organised moves to oppose it and that when the land is given there are some who go and tell the people not to take it.
He said this was being done by persons and groups who want the problem to continue so that they can show it to the world.
On the SLFP's 65th anniversary and convention to be held in Kurunegala on Sunday, the President said it would take the party in a new direction and was hopeful that everyone close to the party would participate. He said there was public opinion in the country at times of crisis and that the all political forces should come together for the sake of the country.
The President said similarly the country was facing several issues at UNHRC in Geneva and had a foreign debt of Rs.9,000 billion. He said to face these issues the political forces in the country needed to come together but that this could done while safeguarding the identity of these political forces.
When asked what he meant when he said in Matara a fortnight ago that more secrets would be revealed if a new party was formed, he laughed and said what he meant were political secrets and not files as understood by some.

HNB strikes US $ 50mn private placement deal with Asian Development Bank
	
Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB), the countrys second largest private bank in terms of assets, has struck a private placement deal with the Manilabased development financier, Asian Development Bank (ADB), to strengthen its capital base.
To this end, HNB will issue ordinary voting shares of the bank to the value of US $ 50 million at the exchange rate existing at the time of the deal or ordinary voting shares equivalent to 9.9 percent of the total ordinary voting shares of the bank after the issue of such shares, whichever is lower, to ADB. HNB will call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to obtain the shareholder acquiescence in this regard. The shares will be issued at an average price at which the shares of HNB traded on the Colombo bourse during the 30-market day period immediately preceding the date of the EGM. The shares will be issued at Rs.220 if the average price is more than Rs.220 and at Rs.190 if the average price is less than Rs.190. The HNB share closed at Rs.187 on Wednesdays trading. The board of directors has opined that the aforesaid consideration for which the ordinary voting shares of the bank are to be issued to ADB through a private placement is fair and reasonable to the bank and to all existing shareholders of the bank, a stock exchange filing by HNB said.
The bank said the proceeds of the private placement would be utilized to strengthen its capital base and support its overall business growth. As of June 30, HNBs Tier I (core) capital adequacy ratio stood at 9.77 percent, down from 10.53 percent six months ago while Tier II capital adequacy was at 12.97 percent, slightly improved from 12.70 percent, helped by a Rs.7 billion debenture issue in March. The bank recently announced another debenture issue up to Rs.6 billion to support its Tier II capital. Apart from the shareholder nod, the private placement of shares is also subjected to the CSE approving the issue and listing of such shares and obtaining other governmental or regulatory approvals, HNB said.

Most trusted employee planned businessman's murder: Police
	
The mastermind behind the abduction and murder of 29-year-old textile businessman Mohammed Sakeem Sulaiman, was long standing intimate employee (accounts assistant) at Sakeems textile business, DIG Ajith Rohana said today.
Addressing the media at Police Headquarters, DIG Rohana revealed the information found through the investigations conducted by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) into the murder.
Sakeem Sualiman who had a wholesale textile shop at 3rd Cross Street in Pettah which imported textiles from India, China and Indonesia was abducted outside his residence at Kotelawala Avenue in Bambalapitiya on August 21 between 11 pm -12 midnight.
His partially decomposed body was recovered in Rukulegama, Mawanella on August 24 evening.
However, eight suspects including the main suspect believed to be 24-year-old Faqeer Aslam Mohammed Fazeel aka Param Shan had been taken into police custody by yesterday and interrogations were completed by the CCD, the DIG said. All suspects aged between 24 and 30 are non-relatives of the victim.
According to the Kegalle JMOs autopsy, Sakeems death was a clear homicide though the CCD investigations found that the abductors intention was not to assassinate him but to demand a Rs.20 million ransom from his family members while detaining him.
The seven suspects working as street porters were in the habit of gathering every evening and consuming drugs in some places in Colombo where they planned the abduction for ransom one and half month ago.
According to DIG Rohana, the same group of abductors had made an attempt to abduct Sulaiman on a previous occasion during the first week of August but it had failed.
He said lack of eye witnesses to the abduction made the CCD investigations tough and challenging. He further described how Sakeem Sulaiman was killed while being transported in suspects car after abduction.
Five suspects had arrived to abduct the victim in an Aqua car rented out by the main suspect from the Mattakkuliya area. The abductors had beaten Sulaiman from the top of a machete because of his struggle against the abduction.
The abductors who were shocked and shattered by Sulaimans unexpected death had then attempted to destroy evidence while another three suspects in another rented car transported Sulaimans body and dumped it in Mawanella.
The abductors had used various alternative roads to avoid police posts to transport the body of Sulaiman.
Despite the fact that the victim was already dead, the abductors had demanded ransom from Sulaimans family members to get their primary requirement fulfilled.
The victims mobile phone which was destroyed by the abductors was found in Morukada, Polgahawela by the police, he said.
He also said the victims under wear and wallet had been burnt by four abductors and dumped them in a place in Wattegama, Kandy. Police also found the vehicle used for the abduction in Kadugannawa yesterday.
He said the crime was completely solved by the CCD by August 28 pending the arrests. Nevertheless, the police did not publish any information relating to the investigation because of the arrests were yet to be made.
So many parties tried to criticize the police for its inaction over the case. No police can find an overnight solution to such crimes, he said.
He also told the business community in the country to be cautious when working with outsiders by taking this murder as an example.
We have a message for the business community. There might be honest workers working under you. But among them it is difficult to sort out such dishonest and cunning employees whom you should wary of, he added.
Incidentally, Sulaiman had offered Rs.500, 000 to the alleged mastermind Mohammed Fazeel in May, 2016 after his family was displaced by the floods. His wife had also given Rs.50, 000 more to Fazeel to repair his house that was damaged by floods.
After the unexpected murder of the victim, Mohammed Fazeel had tried to report to work at the usual time the following day. But, he had come to work several hours late.
Adding another ironic incident, Fazeel had told family members of Sulaiman that he would meet the abductors, handover the ransom and save his boss by hook or by crook. He had said he would even sacrifice his life to save his boss from the so-called abductors.
The investigations were carried out by CCD Director Nishantha Soysa, ASP Jayathilake, OIC of the CCD Neville de Silva and Sub Inspectors Nishantha Dunusinghe and Jayathilake. (Piyumi Fonseka)

National Development Bank PLC (NDB) rang the Opening Bell to commence trading at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) for the month of September and recognized the capital market as a key contributor to the growth of the Bank over the years.
Director/Chief Executive Officer of NDB Rajendra Theagarajah said, NDB is a classic example of how a privatization process has evolved with the participation of the capital market. The bank itself was formed by an act of parliament in 1979, but was actually one of the very first state owned enterprises to be listed here as early as 1993. Today, because of that participation in the CSE, the Bank has a market capitalization of over Rs.27 billion. We have around 8,000 shareholders who are given the opportunity to participate in the fruits of the performance of the Bank and in its value creation.
Theagarajah added that the role of the capital market in any economy driven by market-based principals is inexplicable and relevant and went on to commend the CSE for fostering the development of the financial sector.
Theagarajah was accompanied by the Chairman of NDB Ananda Atukorala, Group CFO Faizan Ozman and the Senior Management of the Bank.  was represented at the event by Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka, Director Moksevi Prelis, Chief Operating Officer Renuke Wijayawardhane and the Senior Management.
Sharing his remarks at the Ceremony, CSE Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka stated We understand that the stock exchange has to play a crucial role in a developing country. We at the CSE are implementing our strategic plan to grow with the country and to take the Sri Lankan capital market to a world-class level.
Kulatilaka went on to comment on the role of NDB in the context of the capital market, stating that the Bank has played an important part in developing the Sri Lankan capital market since 1979, having assisted a number of companies to embrace life as a public entity. 
NDB is one of the largest financial groups in Sri Lanka with its services spread across retail and development banking, full service investment banking, investment advisory, security trading, wealth management, private equity management & property management.
The bank is also committed to the empowerment of the Micro & SME sectors of the country through financial, technical and educational support.

Union Assurance maintains steady growth in core life insurance business
	
Union Assurance (UA) reported steady progress in the life insurance business, recording Rs. 3.9 billion gross written premium which is a 22 percent growth compared with the previous year.

Profit amounted to Rs. 119 million compared with Rs. 1.5 billion in 2015. The previous year figure was boosted by the gain from sale of 78 percent stake in the general insurance business.

Excluding this transaction, the profit for the period was lower than the previous period due to a decrease in other income resulting from fair value losses and realised losses mainly from equity investments. Profit for the period ended June 2016 does not include a surplus from the life business which is actuarially valued at year end.
As at 30th June 2016, UAs life fund stood at Rs. 28 billion with a healthy capital adequacy ratio indicating the financial strength of the business.
UA was recently recognised as a Great Place to Work by The Great Places to Work (GPTW) Institute for the fourth consecutive year. Further UA proudly acclaimed two awards for Excellence in Claims Service and Technology Innovation at the first ever Insurance Industry Awards held to celebrate the achievements of insurers operating in Sri Lanka.
In line with the companys CSR activities, Union Manushyathwaya National Dengue Awareness campaign was carried out on the 6th of August with the support of the District Ministry of Health Officers (DMHO). The objective of this programme was to raise awareness among the general public to control and prevent dengue especially in light of the high number of incidents reported following the recent rains and floods.
UA is positioned on the promise of trust and strives to deliver this promise by being transparent, convenient, and respectful when dealing with all stakeholders at all times.
