Hazlewood fit and ready for final Windies Test

 
SYDNEY, FRIDAY: Australia pace spearhead Josh Hazlewood said he was feeling fresh Friday and ready to go for the weekend's final Test against the West Indies in Sydney.
Hazlewood went wicketless and bowled a total of 41 overs in Australia's 177-run trouncing of the Windies in Melbourne to retain the Frank Worrell Trophy series ahead of Sunday's third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
There were suggestions that Hazlewood might be rested from his home Test after bowling throughout Australia's five Tests this season against New Zealand and the West Indies.
But Hazlewood said he was feeling in great shape and ready to play in his sixth Test of the southern summer, despite just a five-day turnaround from the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.
Pace partner Peter Siddle is troubled by an ankle injury and is battling to play in the Sydney Test, thrusting more responsibility onto Hazlewood to lead the Australian pace attack.
"I'm feeling pretty good. That extra day really helped, finishing (the second Test) on day four. I still got through quite a few overs but the body has pulled up pretty well," Hazlewood told reporters.
"I had a light bowl today and everything is feeling pretty good. I'm feeling as ready to go as I have for all the other Test matches this summer."
"I bowled reasonably well in different spells and not so well in other spells (at the MCG). That happens every now and then. My body is feeling as good as it has all summer and I am ready to go."
Following the Windies Test, Australia have five one-day internationals and three Twenty20s against India this month.
The Australia squad for the India ODIs is expected to be announced during the Sydney Test.
"I guess I will just play it by ear as we go along," Hazlewood said.
"It depends how much I bowl in the next Test match and how I pull up. It would be difficult to play every (limited overs) game. We will have to pick and choose." AFP.
