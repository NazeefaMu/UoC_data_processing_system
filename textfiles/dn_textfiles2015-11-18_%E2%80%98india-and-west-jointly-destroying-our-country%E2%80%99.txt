‘India and west jointly destroying our country’

India is not pleased with the existence of the Avant Garde, as it poses a threat to their naval power in the Indian Ocean. The people are frequently asking us as to what was presently happening in the country. My answer to that question is that western countries are destroying our country with the assistance of India, Ven. Bengamuwenalaka Thera said.
Addressing a media conference in Colombo yesterday, the Ven. Thera said that western countries have given a contract to destroy Sri Lanka, as at present, only two historical cultures in the world remain intact. “They being the Chinese culture and Sri Lanka’s Buddhist culture, while all other cultures in the world had already been destroyed. India plays the role of ‘Sub Contractor’ of this ‘contract,” he said.
Local agents of the contract are a popular Buddhist monk and two Cabinet Ministers. The conspirators combined with the UNP and the SLFP to eliminate an opposition. The SLFP lacked the brains to sack President Sirisena from their chairmanship he said.
“Tamil MPs travel abroad and lie about discrimination, but no Sinhala MP goes abroad and speak on behalf on their motherland and the Sinhalese. The Government blocked Wimal Weerawansa MP, when he attempted to go abroad. At present, we need more strength than we had before to face the LTTE terrorists” Ven There said.
“We need strength to face this challenge. If former President Rajapaksa contested alone, he could have won the election and become Prime Minister or at least the Opposition Leader. It was admitted by President Sirisena soon after the election. Only the United Opposition could save the country from being destroyed completely,” he said.
Maduluwawe Dhammissara Thera said that the LTTE terrorists have turned ‘political prisoners,’ while the moral of the war heroes’ have totally been destroyed. Over 100 Bodhi Poojas would be held countrywide to bless the war heroes. It is the Sinhalese who are going to lose their motherland, while their human rights are being violated, he said.
If all parliamentarians do not oppose the Geneva Resolution and if they take part in the so called ‘All Party Conference,’ mother nature would punish them severely as she punished all those who attempted to destroy mother Lanka, he said.
