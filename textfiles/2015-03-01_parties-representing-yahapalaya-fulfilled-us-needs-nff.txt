The National Freedom Front (NFF) today accused all the parties including JVP and JHU representing ‘Yahapalanaya’ to have fulfilled the American needs.
With reference to the comment made by US Secretary of State John Kerry, the NFF Media Spokesperson Mohammed Muzammil said that Kerry has said that the US was involvement on regime change in Sri Lanka. “It clearly shows the influence on the ‘Yahapalanaya government’, Muzammil charged.
According to Muzammil, TNA Leader R.Sambandan had also said that it was impossible for anybody to escape from war crimes charges and had said that the only method is to commit suicide for those who were involved in war crimes.
By taking these two statements into consideration, it is clear that the US played the main roll in regime change in Sri Lanka.
Further, they condemned the recording of statements from Former Navy Spokesman D. K. P. Dassanayake by the CID in connection with the alleged disappearances of several youths, Muzammil described it as the hunting of those who led the humanitarian mission towards victory.
“The so-called Yahapalanaya is performing what United States wants, but not the public. JVP is also staging another drama while collecting partisans into their politically bankrupt party. We are urging all the parties not to hoodwink the public like this,” Mohammed Muzammil added. (PF)
