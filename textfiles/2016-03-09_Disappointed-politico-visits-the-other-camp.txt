Disappointed politico visits the other camp


	



 

The Big Boss the other day took a firm decision to appoint a number of new electorate level organizers for the Betel leaf party. This led to the ouster of several party heavyweights.

 


Meanwhile, a local politico from the Galle area was asked to call at the party headquarters to accept his appointment as the organizer of his electorate. And he happily appeared there on the dot. He waited some time for a call from a party bigwig for the formal presentation of the appointment letter, but even his presence did not appear to have been taken notice of.  At length, a secretarial one of the party appeared before him and informed him that there was no possibility of presenting the appointment letter to him that day.


This unexpected revelation angered the local politico. “Then why on earth did you summon me here today?  Why do you want to humiliate me like this?”


The secretarial one addressed the disappointed local politico in an apologetic tone: “Malli, we have come across a problem. We cannot successfully pursue those cases without the co-operation of the sitting one. Therefore, we have to allow him to continue in the capacity of the party organizer for a short while. You may remember that he turned against the former Lokka too for denying him nomination. So Malli, please be patient until we sort out this snag…We can consider appointing you as a district organizer for the time being…”


The soothing words of the secretarial one made no effect on the angry local politico. He left the party office after giving him a piece of his mind.


The disappointed politico was seen later in the day in a happy mood at the former strongman’s new political office, they say.
