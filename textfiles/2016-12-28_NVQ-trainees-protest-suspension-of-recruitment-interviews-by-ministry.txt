The NVQ Trainees Collective today staged a protest outside the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy demanding the government fulfill its promise of recruiting some 370 trainees who had completed the four-year training at the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Even though the CEB had scheduled interviews with the trainees on December 26, after the completion of their three-year field training, the ministry had suspended the interviews, the Collective said. (Pix by Nisal Baduge)
