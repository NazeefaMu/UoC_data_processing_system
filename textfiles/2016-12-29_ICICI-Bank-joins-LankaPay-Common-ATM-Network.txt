ICICI Bank, India’s largest private sector bank by consolidated total assets, recently joined ‘LankaPay Common ATM Network’, the national payment network that facilitates high quality electronic financial services at affordable prices in a secure, reliable and convenient manner to all in Sri Lanka. 
This marks a definitive step towards enriching customer experience. The partnership with LankaPay Common ATM Network brings in synergies that provide unparalleled convenience to ICICI Bank customers by providing them with the ability to access their accounts from over 3750 ATMs island wide free of charge. ICICI Bank commenced operations in Sri Lanka in 2006.

Over the last 3 years we have grown to connect almost 99 percent of the total number of ATMs in the country, thereby enabling customers of any member bank to, literally, withdraw cash and access their account from any ATM irrespective of their bank. We are indeed enthralled by the acceptance of our services from the general public across the country, evident by the steady growth achieved in the interbank ATM transaction volumes, which now exceeds 3 million transactions a month. I believe we are well on course of overcoming the mind barrier among general public of going only to your own banks ATM”.

The launch of LankaPay Common ATM Network marked a significant milestone in the country’s banking sector through common usage of resources generating greater economies of scale whilst enhancing customer convenience. Consequently the transaction cost to the banks and customers have come down drastically by almost 10 fold, saving the country billions of foreign exchange that would have otherwise drained out of 
the country.
