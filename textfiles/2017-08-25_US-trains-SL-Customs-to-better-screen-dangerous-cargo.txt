US trains SL Customs to better screen dangerous cargo


	

The US Department of State’s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Programme trained 33 Sri Lankan Customs officials in risk management of cargo from August 21 to August 25.

Issuing a statement, the US Embassy said today that the training was conducted in Colombo and coordinated by EXBS.

“Participants learned how to identify high-risk shipments and improve cargo targeting capabilities through the use of document analysis. Customs organizations utilize finite resources to screen cargo entering, transiting, and exiting their borders and the workshop provided the participants with concrete ways to assess the potential risk cargo may pose to national security and public safety. They can now better screen shipments by identifying those that require a physical inspection,” it said. 

It said the EXBS aims to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the transfer of conventional weapons that threaten regional peace and stability.  

“The EXBS programme comprises a wide range of nonproliferation strategic trade control assistance programs, from licensing and legal/regulatory technical assistance to provision of equipment and training for seaport, border control and law enforcement officials,” the statement said.
