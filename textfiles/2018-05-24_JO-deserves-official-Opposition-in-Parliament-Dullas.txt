While saying that the Joint Opposition deserved the official Opposition in Parliament, Joint Opposition member and MP Dullas Alahapperuma said they hoped to meet Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to attain their rights.

Addressing a news briefing, he said today the Joint Opposition had further strengthened its power with the joining of the 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party members to the Opposition.

“Our main objective is to cease the majority in the government. We have already done that with these 16 members. We will make use of that opportunity to weaken the government and defeat some illegal proposals that they have anticipated to bring in to Parliament in the future,” Alahapperuma said.

“The government has used its majority to pass some illegal proposals in the past like the Bill to introduce new electoral system for the Local Government polls in Parliament. But now the government is in hot water as it has lost its majority,” Alahapperuma added.

Meanwhile, he said the government was using an inefficient move to provide assistance to the people affected owing to the prevailing adverse weather conditions.

“The Government had turned a blind eye in distributing compensations to those affected due to the natural catastrophes in the near past. We urged the government to be efficient in this moment and provide compensation to those who were not provided,” Alahapperuma added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
