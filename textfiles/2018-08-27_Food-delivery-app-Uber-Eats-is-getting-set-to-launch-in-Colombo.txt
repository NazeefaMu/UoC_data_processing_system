Uber Eats, the food delivery app by ride-hailing company Uber, is all set to launch its services in Colombo next month. Similar to the Uber rides app, Uber Eats is a food delivery app that helps bring food to consumers in a convenient and reliable manner from all the best and latest restaurants. 

Currently, Uber Eats is present in more than 250 cities across the world. It is the world’s largest food delivery network. In Colombo, the service will launch with the best and most loved restaurants that consumers can choose from for all their food ordering needs within the comfort of their home.

“It has been very encouraging to see the response from restaurant partners in Colombo in the pre-launch phase. A number of restaurant owners have reached out to partner with us. We are optimistic about Colombo and will leverage our rides network here to connect with consumers. We look forward to becoming an integral part of the food culture of the city,” - said BhavikRathod - Head of Uber Eats India and South Asia.

Uber Eats will launch in Colombo in September 2018.
