The law suit filed by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the recovery of Rs. 143 million for using SLTB buses in election campaigns of last Presidential Election is to be taken up again on January 26.

The plaintiff previously cited Mr. Rajapaksa, 2015-UPFA presidential election committee members Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa as respondents but later amended the initial plaint to exclude both Premajayantha and Yapa.

When the case was taken up today, President's Counsel Nihal Jayamanne who appeared for the defendant Mr. Rajapaksa, sought court permission to file legal objections over the previous amendment made by the SLTB to the initial plaint in court.

Acceding the defendant's request, the court postponed the case to file objections. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
