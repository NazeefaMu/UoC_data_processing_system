The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today described, the use of a vehicle belonging to MP Hirunika Premachandra to abduct a youth, as a transition from the white van culture to a black defender vehicle culture.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath told a media briefing that this kind of drama was totally unwarranted.
However, he said the issue was not with Ms.Premachandra but with the political culture introduced by the previous regime.
“The political culture introduced by the previous regime is being followed by the present government as well" Mr. Herath said. (Yohan Perera)
