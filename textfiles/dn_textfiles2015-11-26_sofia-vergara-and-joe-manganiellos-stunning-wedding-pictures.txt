Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello's Stunning Wedding Pictures

Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello tied the knot in Florida on Sunday, and the Modern Family star wasted no time sharing photos of her ceremony on Instagram. In the snaps, Sofia poses in her custom-made Zuhair Murad gown before being walked down the aisle by her 22-year-old son, Manolo, and looks absolutely gorgeous as she makes her way to the handsome groom. Loads more photos of the reception were shared from Sofia and Joe's accounts, as well as a video of the bride dancing her butt off during a performance by Pitbull.
Joe and Sofia's wedding celebrations began on Saturday: the couple, along with their family and friends, headed to The Breakers in Palm Beach, FL, and relaxed by the pool before their lavish rehearsal dinner. Joe serenaded his beautiful bride with a song in front of celebrity guests like Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Hyland, and Channing Tatum and his wife, Jenna Dewan Tatum.
The couple's wedding comes nearly a year after their December 2014 engagement during a vacation in Hawaii. Sofia was introduced to Joe by her Modern Family costar Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and the two began dating in July of that year. Keep reading to see all the sweet photos from Sofia and Joe's wedding, and then look back on more of the most memorable weddings of the year.
