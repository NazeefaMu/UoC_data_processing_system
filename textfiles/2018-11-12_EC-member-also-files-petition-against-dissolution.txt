Professor S. Ratnajeevan H. Hoole, a member of the Election Commission (EC) has also filed a Fundamental Rights petition against the gazette issued by President Maithripala Sirisena dissolving parliament.

In his petition, the Professor said that he believes that the dissolution of parliament by the President by proclamation published in the gazette unconstitutional.

He said the President had not acted on the advice of the Election Commission prior to the issuance of the gazette.

Therefore, he requested the Supreme Court to issue an order quashing and rendering null and void the proclamation published in the gazette extraordinary issued Friday night.(Yoshitha Perera)
