Emission Tests useless, says racer Dilantha


	

There is no standard on tests performed on vehicle emission for motor vehicles when obtaining the certification for the annual renewal of vehicle revenue licence, Sri Lankan racing driver Dilantha Malagamuwa said.

He also said that the Government should relax the tax on electric vehicles so as to reduce pollution instead of focusing on emission tests.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said due to huge traffic congestion billions of litres of fuel is burnt by idling engines.

“I’m totally against on Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) and it should be withdrawn because nothing towards the betterment of the environment takes place. The progress of the VET can be seen when we look at the roads,” he said.

The Government had made the VET compulsory for the renewals of annual revenue licences only to increase Government revenue, but it had not helped reduce environmental pollution,” he said.

“80 percent of the vehicles fail the VET. More vehicles should be taken out from the road as they are unfit and polluting. But so far no vehicles had been removed from the road for failing VET,” Mr. Malagamuwa said.

Therefore, the Government should take measures to relax the huge tax, is which imposed on electric vehicles, when importing them and should take measures to promote them even-though the Government incurred a loss, he said.

“Also the Government should take measures to operate a mobile service to detect vehicles with high emission and to take legal actions against them.

“The fine on traffic offences and the road rules and regulations should be increased, also the Government should take actions for vehicle drivers tooting indecently,” Mr. Malagamuwa said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
