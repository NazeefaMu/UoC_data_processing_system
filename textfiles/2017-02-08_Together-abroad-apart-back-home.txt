Together abroad; apart back home


	



 

The other day a young dashing purohita in yahapalanaya boarded a Colombo-bound plane at the Dubai airport with a fair and lovely one at his heels.

 


The cute one, they say, is a provincial member from a constituency close to the city.  The young purohita was on his way back home after a visit to the land of Kiwis. It had so happened that both of them had found themselves in Dubai at the same time and travelled back home together on the same plane.


The fair one’s pa, a former purohita and the family members were at the airport to give her a warm welcome and escort her back home. The young purohita had left for hills for reunion with his own dear ones, they say.
