Withdraw gazette declared railways as essential service: JO


	

Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane today urged the government to withdraw the gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena declaring the railways as an essential service claiming it would aggravate the issue.

The MP said the attempt to suppress trade union action would only rebound on the government as a reflection on its failure to resolve this contentious issue rather than a victory.

He said if the rights of trade unions were suppressed and if any trade union was forcibly dissolved, other trade unions too may join in the struggle to ensure their rights. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
