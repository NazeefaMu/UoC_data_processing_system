A live discussion via satellite is to take place tomorrow between officials of the Sri Lankan government and the European Union (EU) regarding the ban on fish exports from Sri Lanka, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today.

He said the Sri Lankan government will contact the EU representatives tomorrow to inquire about the final decision regarding the ban which was imposed on January 2015.

Commenting on the confusing statement issued by the Ministry stating that the ban would be lifted tomorrow, the Minister said the media secretary of the ministry had misinterpreted the statement and that the error was regretted.
