UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra said today the Jana Satana Paada Yathra would not make any impact on the government other than some physical changes on the Joint Opposition MPs who were marching from Kandy.

She said no massive crowd was participating in the protest march as expected except for people who gathered to see it.

“There had been lot of protest marches in the past like this. It would not change the President, the Prime Minister or the government when it reached Colombo. It will only change their physical appearance,” she said.

Ms. Premachandra said the motive behind the Paada Yathra was to cover up their fraud and corruption charges and to create uproar among the people if Joint Opposition MPs were arrested.

She said the government was accused of not taking action against those involved in frauds and corruption when they were not arrested and when they were arrested, the government was accused of taking political revenge.(Indika Sri Aravinda)
