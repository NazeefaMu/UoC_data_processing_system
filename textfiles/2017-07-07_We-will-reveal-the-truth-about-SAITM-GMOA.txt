The GMOA said today it had for the first time got the opportunity to reveal the true facts about SAITM in the Supreme Court, which had allowed the GMOA to intervene in the appeal filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that this decision could be considered as a victory for the forces campaigning for international standards on medical education and was a a defeat to the political forces which ganged up against it.

“We made several attempts to intervene in these court hearings on the SAITM issue, but they were in vain. On several occasions SAITM withdrew its cases no sooner we planned to intervene. We have got our chance at last,” he said.

Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA would make the best use of this opportunity to intervene when the appeal is taken up for hearing. He they were in sight of victory in the battle against SAITM.

Dr. Aluthge said the lawyers who represented the Attorney General and the government were still holding the same stance on this matter as held earlier and it was quite disappointing; “We wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday about this situation,” he added.
