The Cabinet yesterday withheld the contract to build an LNG power plant in Kerawalapitiya to a bidder following heavy criticism.

The Power and Energy Ministry had finalized the proposal to award this contract to a foreign company, bypassing a lower tariff bidder in Sri Lanka.

This proposal which was criticised on the basis that it would cause a loss of Rs.50 billion to the State was taken up for discussion yesterday.

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka proposed that it be scrutinized by the National Procurement Commission.(Kelum Bandara)
