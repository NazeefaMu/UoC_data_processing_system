Former minister Mervyn Silva said yesterday he hoped to launch a new political party which would be open for politicians who had faced injustice because of the actions of their political parties or leaders.

“If someone has had to face injustice like what happened to me, I invite them to join us. I thought of forming the party not for me but for those who faced injustices for political reasons. I will not the leader of the party. I will be the chairman. We will appoint an educated youth leader for the party,” he said.

Mr. Silva said even he did not know whether he was in the SLFP and added that he respected the UNP where everyone was treated equally without any hatred.

He said his party will not tolerate anyone who wanted to make money and that luxury lifestyles, family politics and luxury vehicles would not be allowed.

“We will not allow duty free vehicles; food from the canteen for the parliamentarians elected through our party.

Even for the president, there will be no president's houses or vehicles. Animal sacrifice will not be allowed at any cost," Mr. Silva said and added that they were working out the policies which would govern the party.

He said those who joined his party should have money to serve the people and should be willing to make contributions for social services.

Mr. Silva said the party would be launched from Anuradhapura after religious activities.

When asked about the UNHRC allegation of human rights violation against Sri Lanka, he said if they investigated human rights violations, the violation of human rights by the Portuguese, Dutch and English should also be investigated. (Ajith Siriwardana)
