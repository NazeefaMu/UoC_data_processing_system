Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando was removed from his ministerial portfolio because he criticised the government and its work , MP Namal Rajapaksa said today.

He said Mr. Fernando had attempted to put the government to the right track and as a result he lost his portfolio.

The MP said both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the ministers had a democratic right to reveal the wrongdoings of the government.

“However, the government expels those who reveal wrongdoings. They expelled Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe first and now did the same to Deputy Minister Fernando. The government shows to the international that they are democratic but remove its own ministers who criticize government work,” he said.

He said that Mr. Rajapakshe was sacked and threw-out for criticising the Hambantota Port selling and Mr. Fernando was removed for telling the government to stop revenging.

Therefore, Mr. Rajapaksa said that the entire unity government’s democracy was a lie.

Meanwhile, he said the government was attempting to survive by launching an oppressive programme.

“Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake is criticising religious leaders. He also challenges the country’s law and order,” he said.

MP alleged that both the President’s and the Premier’s actions have made the government members to criticise the judiciary and the back bench Parliamentarians are also acts with taking the law on to their hands as a result. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
