Lawmakers' role towards welfare of people

As we have our personal matters to be attended to as families or individuals, we have sought to select, elect and employ groups of people or individuals to attend to the common needs of all of us. For this purpose, as a demarche, we have delimitated our land into two hundred and twenty five divisions calling each a constituency with a constituent elected to every such constituency taking into consideration the manifestos submitted by the candidates who wished to represent us in the respective constituencies to undertake and execute the responsibility of 'serving' us.
These people designated as members and ministers have to gather at the centres at provincial or district levels and in the parliament, to discuss and attend to our needs. As we have elected them on the presumption that they are scholarly, respectable and responsible people, there is an obligation resting with them by virtue of the responsibilities vested in them to deputize us with correctness and dignity of behaviour. This little idea came to me when I recalled the boyhood days I learnt 'Civics' by S.F. De Silva, the late Director of Education.
The prospective candidates who come before us with their policy declarations to serve us as alliances or individuals have become 'rulers' and kind of an unapproachable monsters moments after they are elected.
Peacemaking government
The people's anticipation of a peacemaking government with peaceable representatives in it during every election campaign has somersaulted to become a government to keep the voter under control from the time they assumed duties. Controlling, curtailing, and creating unrest among the people casting aspersions against their predecessors posing themselves as saviours and levelling accusations leading to commotions in the parliament, throwing weight about and displaying the machismo have been the practise of a majority of the parliamentarians (except for the statesmen and intelligentsia among them ever since we began for rule our country by ourselves.
Sixty seven years have elapsed, they have not changed this stratagem and their chameleon style or masquerading and machinations of working for a selected category of people angering all others. As a result, the rest out of the 200 million neglected people in anger begin to plot to topple the government. The last such an event took place on January 8, 2015. Now again, macabre protests and violence have erupted, conspiracies are being hatched and sathyagrahas have been contemplated to disrupt and topple this government too. This is the nature of ruling in our country. However, the machiavellian politicians and their stooges and henchmen did prosperously well during every term whilst the deprived and dissatisfied ordinary citizen organized and conducted 'udgoshana' demanding what they are in need of, unsuccessfully.
Opportunistic countries
We had rulers long ago. Lastly, in the eighteenth century, ending is 1815 because of the dishonesty and disunity of the unscrupuious king and his opportunistic countries. Consequently, we became subjects of kings and queens who lived in foreign country. We reanmiated an administration of ours in 1948 after we regained the country ceded to invaders but, subject to conditions.
Annually, on February 4 we celebrate an independence beginning with razzmatazz and pomp and pageant but ending with least recognition sans the pride of place the celebrities who regained the country diplomatically deserved, namely, the Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake, our first Prime Minister honoured affectionately as "Father of the Nation" and the nationalists and patriots representing the five communities fiz., the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers, every public servant and citizen who were part and parcel of that silent victory. There are schoolchildren in the present day who doesn't know the name of the first Prime Minister which is commonplace in Sri Lanka. To that extent we have forgotten our forefathers and our gratitude to them has diminished.
'Welfare State'
What we had in mind upon liberation from colonialism with bitter experiences was to convert our country to a "Welfare State" of our won to ensure the welfare of ail citizens by means of state operated social services. Unfortunately, as an independence was given subject to conditions our leaders were compelled to continue the same way, overseen by those who gave over. Moreover, a majority of Ceylonese leaders too were in favour of Anglicism. Even after we voted to establish a republic, our Anglicized leaders were least interested about finding out a way of our won thus divisions among the communities continued to prevail as divide and rule policy continued remain. Hence, an administration to fulfil the wishes of all communities of this country has still to come their way.
Rulers have failed everywhere on earth. Not only the man but the nature also has risen against the rulers. Protests and terrorism by the man, the typhoons, tornadoes, torrential rains, deadly floods, storms, wildfires, earthquakes and man rising against the man have made all rulers innocent because of their indecency and dishonesty.
President Maithriplaa Sirisena is a person born great among the ordinary citizen. He has demonstrated his greatness at the ripe time to heal an heart. The prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is a person born with a silver spoon in his mouth to respected parents of this country. Both of them prefers simple living and recognizes and respects the cultures, customs, traditions and rule of law of this country. Suchlike persons can undoubtedly convert this administration to a 'Welfare State' beginning with the new constitution in the pipeline to go for a perestroika in close collaboration with the people to concentrate fully on communal facilities and give up "ruling" which has a bitter taste than in aralu.
The people are fed up of listening to dictates and threats. The people are fond of sincerity and faithfulness. The leaders must be friends of all the people. Then they will share and bear with them at all difficult times. Also, they will retain them with them. They will not let the worthy people go.
Functioning as an 'opponent' has become the responsibility of the 'opposition' opposing every presentation in the house. There is no constructive criticism to drive it the right way if in their opinion the ruling side is erroneous. Why cannot these constituents cooperate and join hands with the government in accordance with the will of the majority of citizens in this democracy to render the 'service' they expect of them?
Whenever we tune in to the television we see them quarreling like cats and dogs, whenever we switch on the radio we hear them shouting like lunatics, nothing is peacefully settled and, whenever we spread the broadsheets we read the same repeated in writing. What else can they do in the absence of noteworthy newsworthy material forthcoming? Prominence is given in every press to reporting murders, kidnappings, abductions, robberies, accidents, committing suicide, rapes, smuggling, drug trafficking like blood curdling happenings, the order of the day. It is an indication that our country is in a disorderly situation as our representatives have become crabs.
Can the followers go straight? When are these people expecting to give up this methodology to behave with decorum to become a gentlefolk, to be punctual, to be in their seats punctually, respect each other and their positions and deal with their subjects with due respects to the 'house' where they assemble because it is a venue provided with for a specific purpose by the people and, the exemplary.
