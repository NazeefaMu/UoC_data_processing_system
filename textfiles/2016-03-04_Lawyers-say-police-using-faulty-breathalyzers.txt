Lawyers say police using faulty breathalyzers


	

Lawyers for Good Governance have complained to Government Analyst Sakuntala Tennakoon that the measures used by the Police to identify drunken drivers were not accurate.

They said sub-standard breathalyzers were used by violating the instructions of the government Analyst on quality measurements.

The lawyers said the technical specifications issued by Traffic Police ASP W.D.A. Dananjaya on July 15, 2011 was flawed, because the expiry date must be displayed on the breathalyzer. They said such expiry dates were not seen in the breathalyzers being used by the police.

They also complained that the breathalyzers used by the police could be manipulated so as to introduce alcohol if one needs to accuse an innocent person of a traffic offence..

The lawyers for Good Governance requested the Government analyst to take steps to make necessary changes so that the rule of law could be enforced in a justifiable manner. (TFT)
