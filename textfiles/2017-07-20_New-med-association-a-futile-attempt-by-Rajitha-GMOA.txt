New med. association: a futile attempt by Rajitha - GMOA


	

Despite unlimited political sponsorships, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne was able to gather only a mere 45 members to the newly-formed medical association, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said among 18,000 doctors serving the government service, the minister was only able to recruit only a handful of those who were removed from the GMOA.

“Minister Senaratne aimed to destabilise the GMOA that has a rich history of over 90 years. He simply missed the shot. The Health Minister’s political hypocrisy is now exposed to the public. The minister should have understood by now that the GMOA is a challenge to his political career. He will never be able to challenge the GMOA,” Dr. Aluthge said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
