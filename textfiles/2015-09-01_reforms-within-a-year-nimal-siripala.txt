Extending his congratulations for the Speaker, he said a mix of the First Past the Post System and the Proportional Representation should be introduced forthwith and the preferential voting abolished .
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, as a member of the United National Party ( UNP), took a keen interest in evolving a new electoral system.
Underscoring the fact that a new role has been entrusted upon him as the Speaker, Mr. de Silva said a road map had to be worked out for the enactment of electoral reforms at least within a year.
He said both Mr. Jayasuriya and he started their political career as members of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
