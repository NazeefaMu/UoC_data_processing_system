Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanga Sumathipala said yesterday that MPs had expressed disappointment over the country’s cricket legend Muttiah Muralitharan joining the Australian team as a spin bowling Consultant.

Sumathipala, who is also the Deputy Speaker of Parliament, said the MPs had said that someone like Muralitharan who is loved dearly by the country joining a country like Australia comes as a surprise.

“However, there is nothing unethical in this move by Murali. As a professional, he has the freedom to make such decisions. And as the Board, we can’t question his move. That’s what we think,” he told a news conference held at the SLC today.

He expressed these as a response to a journalist who asked whether the MPs had objected to Muralitharan joining Australian camp ahead of the Warne–Muralidaran Trophy.  (Champika Fernando)
