"Good Governance " has not dawned yet - Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday noted that the "good governance" which people expected has not dawned yet as the present government has failed to fully defeat the corrupt political elements of the past regime.
Speaking to the grass roots organizers of his party in Batticaloa, Fonseka said that as the person who defeated former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it was no big deal for him to defeat the Rajapaksa followers.
He said that those who surrounded Rajapaksa in the past were aligning themselves with the current rulers and added that as long as the trend continues the government will find it difficult to usher the good governance which it promised to the people.
He also said that his Democratic Party will contest the forth coming Provincial Council election alone.
