Women's Affairs Minister condemns opposition conduct

Women's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara condemned the disruption caused by the opposition members when the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill providing increased women's representation in Local Government authorities was taken up for debate in Parliament yesterday.
Bandara said that the disruptions by the opposition members were aimed at all women in the country
"It is unethical for disrupting the debate on the Bill which ensures more representation for women in Local Government bodies. This group in Opposition who are talking of a royal family, does not have any regard towards the women and this is reflected by their behaviour in Parliament today," she said.
Speaking at a press conference at Government Information Department, yesterday, Bandara added that a former female minister has also joined this bandwagon.
"Her opposition towards this Bill is regrettable," she said.
Minister Bandara said that the Bill was passed despite various obstacles put in place by the opposition.
Bandara said that women receive a larger representation in Parliament.
"Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardene who strove to increase womens' participation in politics also opposed this Bill and his conduct is highly regrettable," she said.
