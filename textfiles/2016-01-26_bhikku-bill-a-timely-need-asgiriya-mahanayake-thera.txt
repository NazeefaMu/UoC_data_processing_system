While stressing that it is a timely need to have the Bhikku Kathikawath Bill, Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayake Ven. Galagama Sri Aththadassi Thera said there was a misconception in the society about the bill due to some of its contents.
“We feel the problematic situation has arisen because some of the content that should be included in each Kathikawatha of the chapters, had been included in this bill,” the Mahanayake Thera said in a statement.
The Thera also said bill is the result of the request by the Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayakes of the three-chapters from the government.
“There is a problematic situation in society because of the way the media reported it. This is not an act of the government to impose rules and regulations on the Bhikkus, but a bill to register in each chapter,” the statement said.
However, the statement said the Karaka Sabha of the Asgiriya Chapter would further study the bill and submit their views to the government.
