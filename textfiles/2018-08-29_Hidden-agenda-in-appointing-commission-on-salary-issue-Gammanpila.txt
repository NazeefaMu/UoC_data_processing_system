Hidden agenda in appointing commission on salary issue: Gammanpila


	

The decision to appoint a commission, supposedly for the purpose of solving the salary issues of railway employees, was a tactic to kill time until military personnel sent to India to be trained as train drivers, get back to fill in the void that is created when railway unions go on strike in the future, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) alleged.

President Maithripala Sirisena in his discussion with railway trade unions had assured them that the salary anomalies that exist would be rectified before October 31 by appointing a commission.

PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said this Government was fully aware that the commission was a red herring and would not produce any solution before the due date.“It is only a tactic being used until the army personnel sent to India return and are available to the government in case of an emergency,” the MP said.
