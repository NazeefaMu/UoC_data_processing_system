Independence Square /Lewd behavior not allowed: Navinna


	

Cultural Affairs Minister S.B. Navinna said lewd behaviour was not allowed in and around Independence Square in Colombo because it was a public place.

However, he said, couples who behaved could be there.

“Wedding couples also use this area for photographs after getting permission. That is alright. There are warnings against lewd behaviour anyhow,” he said.

Asked whether he had received an order from the top to take action against the two security officers who had ordered out a couple from the site, he said he was out of Colombo yesterday and, therefore, could not be contacted by anyone during the day.( Kelum Bandara)
