Finance Director of Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) and its Construction Director has been released on bail by Colombo Fort Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage today.
Finance Director Jayantha Samarasinghe and Construction Director P.S. Sudan were in remand custody in connection with an alleged fraud at RADA.
Magistrate Liyanage observed that he was ordering the suspects be released taking into consideration of the Supreme Court’s interim order issued in respect of former MP Tiran Alles.
Making bail applications in court, counsel appearing for the suspects argued that the Supreme Court held the stance that there was no justifiable and reasonable grounds to arrest Tiran Alles and argued that no such allegation was levelled against defendants. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
