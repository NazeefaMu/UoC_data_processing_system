Trail-blazing through the banking industry of Sri Lanka, Sampath Bank was recently bestowed with two prestigious international awards for its proficiencies in a wide array of facets within the banking industry of Sri Lanka.

The award for Sri Lanka’s Best Bank 2016 was received by Aravinda Perera, Managing Director and Nanda Fernando, Chief Operating Officer from Sampath Bank PLC at the Euromoney Excellence Awards Ceremony 2016 held in Island Shangri-La hotel, Hong Kong on 14th June 2016.
