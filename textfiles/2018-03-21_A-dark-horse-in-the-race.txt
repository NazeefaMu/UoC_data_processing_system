A dark horse in the race


	



 

With the no confidence motion taking centre-stage again, a race for the Number Two office has begun, they say. 

 


The runners this time round are from the Blue party.


This is a new development for in the Blue party there was only one in the running for the coveted Number Two office for a long time; he was none other than the senior- most one from Badulla and even the JO group out of respect for his seniority in the party had made no objection to his credentials, they say.


The new aspirant to this office from the Blue party is a gabby senior from the central hills who had to make it to Diyawanna through the charity list last time.   It was generally accepted that he lost his seat at the 2015 general polls because of his stand against the former strongman and this fact had worked in his favour when compiling the party’s charity list, they say.


Now a top team member deeply involved in a poverty alleviation programme, this politico’s name is often mentioned in political circles in connection with the Number Two office expected to fall vacant in the near future.
