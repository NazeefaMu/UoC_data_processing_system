Accepting UK help for military reforms dangerous: GL


	

An offer by the UK to provide UKP six million to upgrade Sri Lankan Armed forces and a move followed by the offer to appoint the Military Attaché of the UK High Commission in New Delhi to oversee these reforms were detrimental to the national security of the country, former External Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris said today.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron had made an offer to President Maithripala Sirisena six million pounds to upgrade the Sri Lankan military during his visit to Malta.
Prof. Peiris said a government which had self-respect should not accept such offers given by any country to reform its own Armed forces. He said the requirement to reform the armed forces should come within a country and not from outside.
“A government should spend for the requirements of its own armed forces. Accepting funds to reform armed forces from other countries without any prior request is very dangerous. Apart from the offer, the UK will appoint its Military Attaché of the UK High Commission in New Delhi to observe as to how the funds should be spent, when reforming our armed forces,” he told a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella (Lahiru Pothmulla)
