The joint opposition would give its fullest support in case a no-confidence motion was brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as proposed by State Minister Range Bandara of the UNP, MP C.B. Ratnayake said today.

Referring to the statement made by the state minister on Monday that a no-confidence motion would be moved against the party leadership with the support of other UNPers, the MP said they would not hesitate to extend their support in such a case.

The MP told a news conference that he appreciated the courageous statement made by the state minister that the UNP leadership should be revamped and threatened to move no-confidence motion in case the party leadership remained unchanged. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
