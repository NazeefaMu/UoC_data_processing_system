Mount Lavinia Magistrate today ordered to re-remanded former Mount Lavinia Crimes OIC Tissa Sugathapala and former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara till March 15, in connection with the killing of Sunday Leader's former editor Lasantha Wickramatunga and the concealing of evidence.

Anil Silva PC appearing for Mr. Nanayakkara requested bail for his client on the basis the charges filed by the CID was a bailable offense and that his client was suffering from a cardiac ailment.

However, Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Mohammed Mihail rejected the bail application.

The CID in its report informed Court that Mr. Nanayakkara had planned to destroy and conceal the evidence in the case.

“Even though former Mount Lavinia Crimes OIC Tissa Sugathapala wanted to continue the investigations in a proper manner he failed to do so and he was even compelled to handover Lasantha Wickrematunga’s field book which is considered to be the most crucial evidence in the case to former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara under pressure from former senior DIG Hemantha Adhikari,” a detective said.
