Early warning risk in section of Southern Expressway

An early warning system will be installed near the section between Kokmaduwa and Imaduwa of the Southern Expressway within the next couple of days due to the existing landslide risk in the area.
National Building Research Organization (NBRO) Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Head R.M. S. Bandara told the Daily News yesterday an early warning application was now being designed to suit the area and the requirements.
He said the early warning system would mostly be a combination of sirens and lights to immediately alert the public and other relevant units of the Expressway.
Bandara noted that the NBRO has commenced a detailed investigation with the coordination of the Road Development Authority to determine the measures to mitigate the landslide risk in this section of the Expressway.
He observed the study has been expedited and it would be concluded within a week, adding that there could be delays if the rainy weather prevails.
Bandara pointed out the landslide risk cropped up after the construction of the Expressway.
"The area at risk is 200 metres in length and 50 metres in height. This area shows features of an active landslide with fractures. The heavy rain is the main cause. We have to identify how deep these fractures have gone and the amount of water in the soil. Then we will design the strategies to minimise the landslide risk and accordingly the estimates will be prepared. We are doing this work with the coordination of the regional administration," he said.
Bandara said even though the section of the highway between Kokmaduwa- Imaduwa was opened for traffic from 10.00 a.m. yesterday, the NBRO would continue post monitoring, adding that if there were changes it would once again be closed.
He said residents in households near the road have also been advised to be vigilant and to shift to safer locations. However, he added the preliminary studies have shown that they were not at a higher risk.
Bandara pointed out the NBRO has identified 38 locations in Galle with landslide risk, but added these were minor.
The area between Imaduwa and Kokmaduwa on the Matara-Galle stretch of the Southern Expressway was closed time to time over the past few days after the NBRO warned that there was a risk of landslide near the 114 km post.
