People in our country like those in India, Nepal and Bhutan attach a great significance to giving a name to a newborn. In fact, they believe that giving a name to a book to be published, a new residence to move into, a business establishment to be launched or any other place or thing for that matter is as significant as giving a name to a newborn for that carries an occult power that determines not only the success or failure of the project, but also that of the person or persons associated with it. 

 

Swar Shastra in ancient times
The reason behind this deep-rooted belief among the people is the widespread acceptance that when sound-syllables of a name are in a certain pattern it would create vibrations carrying a mystic power which if properly harnessed can produce wonderful results both good and bad. 


The occult science dealing with sound vibrations has been a branch of the holistic astrological science from ancient times and had been described as Swar Shastra. Today this Swar Shastra has become part of Numerology widely practiced by Numerologists in the West. 

 

Origin of Swar Shastra
According to research done by numerologists of the West, Swar Shastra or the occult science based on sound vibrations had been in vogue as far back as 4000 BC in Sumer (once known as Babylon) and in other ancient civilizations in West Asia.  Both Swar Shastra in India and Sumerian Numerology are based on sound- syllables that create vibration patterns. Sound vibrations, according to Phonetical Astrology are divided into four patterns described as Bhumi (Earth), Jala (water), Vahni or Agni (Fire), Vayu (Air), and Akasha, (Ether).  These vibration patterns are known to people in our country as ‘Gana’.


Astrologers in our country also observe the Swar Shastra principles relating to ‘Gana’ in selecting a name for a newborn, a place or a thing.  It appears ‘Gana’ (the term used both in the singular and the plural) have been added to the five original ‘Gana’, namely Deva, Chandra and Surya. 

 

Compositions based on sound vibrations
In fact, Mantras, Seth Kavi, and Vas Kavi widely used in our country for the purpose of healing the sick, invoke blessings, causing malefic effects and also exorcising evil spirits are compositions based on sound vibrations. 


It is believed that certain sound-syllables used at the beginning of a verse – a phonetic pattern expected to be repeatedly chanted – could cause either positive or negative results depending on its ‘Gana’ or the vibrational pattern. 


Certain sound-syllables could cause harm to the composer himself.  There is a legend in the folklore that the celebrated poet monk Vidagama Ananda Maitriya Thera had to leave the shores of this country as the effect of starting the first verse of his great work, Budugunalankaraya with a word carrying the syllables of Vayu Gana. This verse:

Siyapin sirin saru
Detislakunen visituru
Sadaham gunen garu
Vandim muni utuman tiloguru
Is well known among the people in this country.
