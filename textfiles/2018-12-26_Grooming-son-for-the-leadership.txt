King Rooster is said to be pressing a party member who had been caught poised to do the somersault to the government to submit his resignation. 

 


Meanwhile, King Rooster had explained to his party stalwarts that he had decided to get the unfaithful member resign his seat to make way for the lady functioning as the party’s secretary to enter Diyawanna in his place. 


However, the Diyawanna member has confided in his intimates that he is determined not to resign as he has learnt from a source close to the leader that the latter is planning to nominate his own son for the vacancy the moment he resigns to enable him to take over party leadership in 
due course.
