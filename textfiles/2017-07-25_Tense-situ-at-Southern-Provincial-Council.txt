A tense situation arose at the Southern Provincial Council when UPFA Councilor Channa Saliya brought a donation till to the Council session this morning.

The move had set off members of the opposition who accused the Councillor of bringing in a bomb to the session.  

The tense situation arose when several councilors had attempted to wrestle the till out of Saliya’s hands.  (NIimal Algewatte)
