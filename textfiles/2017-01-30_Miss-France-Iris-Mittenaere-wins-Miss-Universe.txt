Miss Universe candidate Iris Mittenaere of France waves to the audience after winning the title in the Miss Universe pageant at the Mall of Asia Arena in Manila on January 30. Miss France was crowned Miss Universe on January 30 in a glitzy spectacle free of last year's dramatic mix-up but with a dash of political controversy as finalists touched on migration and other hot-button global issues.AFP
