The other side of Lasith Malinga

Cricket is a game that produces all kinds of characters in different shapes and sizes and moods. In this instance we refer to Lasith Malinga, a classic bowler of his own making and quite effective at that with his unusual square arm bowling action. His toe crushing yorkers and deceptive slow balls has made him a world class bowler especially in the shorter format - fifty over and twenty20 cricket. Add to this his extraordinary talent, the shocking gold locks and pierced eyebrows - you have a cult figure that every Malinga fan would want to emulate.
Fast bowlers are known to be temperamental and Malinga is no exception. He has his own way of doing things. He came up the hard way and if he has lost his temper at times trying to answer questions thrown at him by the media it's no fault of his because there has been times where he has been provoked to react in the manner he has.
To very few who understands very little of Malinga's character he is very much disliked and criticized (not that he is averse to it). But there are others who know the inside of him and have high praise for his captaincy. "Lasith thinks different to other captains and very few understand him," quipped one former selector.
The way Malinga spoke about T20 captaincy was quite amazing especially the amount of knowledge he has in this field.
Delayed by a technical fault in the plane that was to take him from Colombo to Kolkata, Malinga spent some time with the media men in Lotus lounge of the BIA freely airing his thoughts and views on the game.
Malinga was of the opinion that in Sri Lanka when a player is identified for a specific role and selected he should be given to fulfill that task. "If you pick a player for his batting in a certain position for his club or province then when he is picked for the national team he should bat in that position not elsewhere because it is in that batting position that he has made his mark. It is similar with a bowler if he is a new ball bowler and has taken early wickets he should be given the new ball when playing for the national team not brought on later. This is how I look at selections. Sadly it does not happen that way.
"There are specific roles for each individual in the team to play and it must be utilised to the maximum otherwise there is no point in selecting him."
Malinga said that T20 is a format where the game can change from over to over and the captain has to be very mindful of not letting things slip out of hand. He is in fact writing a book in Sinhala and in English largely based on T20 cricket and how best a player can maximise his talent.
Being the legend he is Malinga admitted that the expectations on him was very high and that every time he took the ball into his hands his fans and critics expected him to take wickets which he said was virtually impossible. "They expect me to bowl at 140 plus all the time and if for some my speed drops they say that I am not putting 100 percent effort or that I have lost my speed and should quit the game. I have now got used to such criticism and do what is best for the team and my country," he said.
Malinga has also been accused at times of reserving his best for the IPL tournament (where he represents Mumbai Indians) than for his country whenever he fails to produce a match winning spell for Sri Lanka.
Malinga, 32 who has been playing international cricket for the past 12 years is clearly counting the number of days on his fingers before he finally calls it quits. "I am not getting any younger and with this troubled knee of mine I don't know how far I can go. Playing in the 2016 IPL will largely depend on my fitness. If I can get through the World T20 I will be happy," Malinga said.
Players like Malinga don't come by the day. They are unique in their own ways and that's what makes them so exceptional and special so that any captain would love to have in their team. Sri Lanka are at present struggling to bridge the gap left following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. The day Malinga quits the game will be another body blow to the team. A player's value is sometimes realized only after he leaves the game and Malinga is no exception to it.
