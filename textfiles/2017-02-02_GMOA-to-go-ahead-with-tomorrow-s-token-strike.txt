GMOA to go ahead with tomorrow’s token strike


	

Despite the late-night release of the 21 medical students taken into custody, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said today that it would go ahead with its 4-hour token strike tomorrow.

The medical students were arrested today during a protest held in Colombo against the SAITM in Malabe.

Following the arrest of the students, the trade union issued a statement announcing that it would launch a strike from 8.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon tomorrow demanding the release of the students.

However, the arrested students were released by Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky late today on two sureties of Rs.200,000 each.

When contacted and asked whether the GMOA would call off its strike as the students had been released, the union said ‘no.’

“We are still going ahead with the strike, though the students were released. We condemn and oppose the brutal attack on these students during the protest,” Dr. Haritha Aluthge of the GMOA said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Shehan Chamika Silva)
