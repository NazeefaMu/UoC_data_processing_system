Ex-CJ's son Shaveen contesting as an independent


	

Former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake's son Shaveen is contesting the upcoming general election from the Colombo District as an independent candidate under the 'flashlight symbol'.
He said he had decided to contest after his involvement in a social justice movement known as the ‘Campaign for Clean and Competent Candidates.’
“My main objective is not so much to enter parliament but to canvass for the election of clean, competent, educated and honest parliamentarians. My other objective is to introduce a mechanism – a review system – to make sure that once such candidates are elected to parliament, they themselves are not tainted with fraud or corruption,” he said.
Mr. Bandaranayake said he did not view himself as a politician but more as a public servant. (Shihara Maduwage)
