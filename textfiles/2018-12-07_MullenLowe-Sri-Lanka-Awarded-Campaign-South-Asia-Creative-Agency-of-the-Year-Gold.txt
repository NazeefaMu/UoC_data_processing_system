MullenLowe Sri Lanka was awarded Gold in the ‘Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year’ category at the Campaign South Asia Agency of the Year Awards 2018 held recently in Mumbai, India.

This accolade is a result of the consistence with which MullenLowe Sri Lanka continues to push conceptual and executional boundaries to create engaging work that has helped its clients' brands receive an unfair share of attention.

Renowned for its creative excellence, the agency works with brands from 80% of Sri Lanka's top 10 most advertised categories and 50% of the top 20 most advertised categories. It has done some landmark work for brands such as Sunlight detergent, Clear shampoo, Rexona deodorant, Nations Trust Bank, Maliban Spicy Cracker, FriMi, Close Up toothpaste and Marmite during the year. Collaborating with the best local and global technical talent, the agency produced 101 TV commercials in 2017 – about 1.9 commercials a week – and is on track to produce 125 commercials in 2018. Furthermore, 4 pieces of branded digital content created by MullenLowe Sri Lanka in 2018 reigned at No.1 on YouTube in Sri Lanka.

All this has helped MullenLowe Sri Lanka register remarkable business growth. The agency saw its business growing by 27.3%, well above the industry average in 2017, with new business accounting for 22%. And it is poised to deliver similar growth numbers in 2018 too, despite trying market conditions.

Commenting on this, Thayalan Bartlett, Chief Executive Officer, MullenLowe Sri Lanka, said, “MullenLowe is a new age communications company that has produced work that has become conversational . Its idea centric media neutral approach is yielding immense value for our clients’ brands and we are thankful for their trust in us. This award has been enabled by some great relationships with clients, collaborative partnerships with our stakeholders and an immensely close working culture within our internal teams.”

We are delighted to end the year on this sweet note,” said Chandu Rajapreyar, Vice President / Executive Creative Director, MullenLowe Sri Lanka.

The Campaign South Asia ‘Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year’ Gold award comes on the heels of the agency being recognized as the ‘Most Effective Agency of the Year’ at the 2017 Effie Awards held in Sri Lanka, earlier this year.
