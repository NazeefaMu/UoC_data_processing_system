Appearing on behalf of Minister Ravi Karunanayake, President's counsel Rienzie Arseculeratne today informed the Presidential Commission investigating the Bond issue that his client is unable to appear before the Commission because the minister had to attend the Security Council meeting summoned by the President.

He also said the minister will be ready to give evidence next Wednesday (August 2).

On questioned by the Commission, PC Arseculeratne said the minister had Parliament sessions on the next two days and will be leaving to Maldives on Monday, thereby according to his instructions he will be ready to give evidence next Wednesday.

Considering the time constrains, the Commission asked the Counsel about the possibility of calling the minister on a weekend day. PC Arseculeratne said he was not instructed on that. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
