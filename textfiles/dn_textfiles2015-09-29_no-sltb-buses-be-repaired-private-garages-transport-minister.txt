No SLTB buses to be repaired in private garages - Transport Minister

Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday, said that no Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses and other vehicles would be given to the private sector for repairs from now on.
He further said that it was a crime to get SLTB buses and other vehicles repaired at private sector garages, when the SLTB was having plenty of regional workshops across the country.
The minister said that the SLTB possessed skilled engineers and technicians who could perform this task well," he said.
Minister de Silva made these remarks during an observation tour of the SLTB's Medawachchiya Regional Workshop.
Minister pointed out that the SLTB has regional workshops scattered throughout the country in places such as Medawachchiya, Kurunegala, Matale, Kaludeewala, Gintota, Pettigala, Gampaha and Keppetipola, where a large number of workers are attached to them.
"Successful results could be achieved if these regional workshops are centralized into a single location. Then we could make use of the facilities and personnel there in a better way," the Minister said.
Many SLTB workers the minister said, were attached to these regional workshops and are idling today without any significant work to do. They do not have spare parts since the SLTB was incurring losses. The SLTB today depends on the Treasury. The Treasury was in the habit of advising us to retrench excess workers. It is much cheaper to repair SLTB buses and other vehicles in its own workshops rather than going to the private sector. Therefore, I hope to centralize all regional workshops into one place which would help save the money within the SLTB.
