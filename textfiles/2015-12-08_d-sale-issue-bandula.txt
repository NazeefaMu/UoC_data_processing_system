The joint opposition would report to the newly appointed Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) regarding the controversial Central Bank Bond sale once the budget period was passed in parliament, UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena said.
Addressing a news conference today at the Dr. N. M. Perera Centre, MP Gunawardena said the Central Bank Bond Sale was the main reason for the record depreciation of the rupee against the US Dollar.
"CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran who is responsible for these outcomes is nowhere to be seen. If someone needs to meet him, they would have to travel to Singapore to reach the governor. If current economic affairs keep continuing, the value of the rupee will end up at 150 against the Dollar," he said.
He said the government was on the opinion that no outsider is aware of the economic crisis in which the country is engulfed in today and therefore keep continuing to deceive people, members of the Stock Exchange as well as the foreign investors.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
