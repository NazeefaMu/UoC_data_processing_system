Two of them burn bridges behind them!


	



 

Reports say that Esbee from the central hills and Deeje from Wayamba have now quit the Group 16 for good and marched back to the fold to throw their weight behind the Compassionate One. 

 


They have reportedly told their intimates that they had to turn back homeward giving up their peace-maker roles as they could no longer tolerate the insolent attitude of some JO colleagues.


However, the duo back in the fold, are not going to be nobodies. The Big Boss is set to offer them two important positions: the Wayamba one the Blue party’s secretarial status and the central hills one the corresponding status in the Betel leaf alliance.
