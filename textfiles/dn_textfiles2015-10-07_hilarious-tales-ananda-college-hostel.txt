Hilarious tales from Ananda College hostel

Recalling the past in the life of some reputed people it is found that the college hostel or the boarding house had played a vital role in the moulding of their character as well as their attitudes to life. They are denoted as those who come from distant places to the more suburban colleges in order to achieve a higher and better state of education.
In this climate either they have to stay in the college hostel or in the houses of their nearer and dearer relatives. But it is found that the selection on the part of parents to lodge their children in college hostels is a result of the advent of a new colonial education as versus the age old phenomenon of going to school from one's own house which is known in the traditional system of education as 'gederin gurugedarata' (from the house to the house of the guru or the teacher).
The patterns of education change and as a result the children who so attend the schools from their parental residences are perhaps forced to stay in the school hostels as an alternative measure.
This may look a global phenomenon. Quite a number of books have sprung up in this set up of staying in school or college hostels. With the passage of time some of the books have turned into films of lasting interest. One such book made into a film is 'Goodbye Mister Chips' written by James Hilton. Then comes another work titled as Blackboard Jungle, the creator of the work sadly I don't remember now.
Whether written in the form of a novel or in any other form, the recollection of hostel events as jotted down in nostalgic manner may be of interest either as fascinating historic events of the past or as personal reminiscences transformed in order to recreate the memorable past as a series of memoirs.
Such a work came to me during the Book Fair season. The title of the book goes as Ananda Bodime Sangawunu Rasakatha (The hidden fascinating stories from the Ananda College hostel) authored by Devsiri P Hevavidana [Dayawansa Jayakody publication] of Galle. Running to thirty chapters, the writer Hevavidana who lives in England at the moment, and an engineer by profession, had found time to devote on this recollection of writing notes from time to time to periodicals in his birthplace Sri Lanka. He attempts to trace a wide gamut of events and experiences from the moment of how he entered Ananda hailing from Galle where he had the primary formal education.
He writes in the form of mini narratives all about his parental heritage and the influence on him with great gratitude and honour. Then he enters the realm of teachers and friends who happened to be his close companions all throughout.
They are brought to the forefront like in a series of dramatic episodes tinged in a sense of humour enabling the reader for a non stoppable premise. Most of the material had been published as newspaper columns perhaps making his expression clearer.
It is an age old method employed by most contributors to journals and newspapers to collect and preserve thus the features thus printed into a single publication which eventually goes to prove that the materialthus printed had not gone a waste and/or lost to the posterity. Devsiri Hevavidana remembers various names of his companions and the places from which they had come to be hostellers. He also remembers the various types of advantages of being a hosteller over and above.
Then he remembers the strictness as well as the lenience on the part of the teachers supplemented with examples. Some of the present day social stalwarts like politicians, administrators and business magnates as well as diplomats have been his fellow hostellers. They have been instrumental in bringing back smiles as well as tears on account of the gone by episodes. But the writer makes it a point that he writes in a positive manner allowing the past to live in the present. He sees at times the 'practical joke' concept utilised as part and parcel of youth hood perhaps as a pardonable factor.
One such example is the incident about the good old teacher who had the habit of driving his Bug Fiat to school and used to park in a place where anybody could see.
The teacher is portrayed as one who was so fond of his car that he kept it spick and span. But one hosteller who was a bright and intelligent fellow also had a queer character about him which forced him to push the car to a remote corner in the college premises. On finding that the car had disappeared, the owner had to inevitably undergo a mental pain beyond reason before the eyes of the others who rallied round him. He had been crying that his car is lost.
The hostellers had to go in search, with perhaps to all the visible areas in the college premises. Then they discovered that the car had been pushed by someone or a group to a muddy rut.
This becomes not only a surprise but also a punishable offence and a mystery. Who could be the culprit behind the scene? And who to be punished, and how to detect the culprit to punish was a burning. This goes as a trick ending narrative where all the hostellers had been warned of the punishment issue. The innocent hostellers too may be the victims. Thus the scene develops and several suspects in the rush were taken to task.
Who pushed the teacher's Bug Fiat to this muddy rut happened to be the question. What happened in the end is the most interesting point. One hosteller came to the rescue of the others with a confession which is recorded as a mischief done with fun -all alone without much thinking about the consequences. Perhaps I presume that the reader is compelled to know a wee bit of psychology in order to understand this event.
There are moments in the life of hostellers who have seen phantoms and apparitions in the night/ The subject is taken seriously in order to create fun and thrill.
The advantages of being in company than in isolation are underlined in most pages. The challenges as well as skills encountered by young men of a particular period in their lives are recorded vividly bringing back to one's mind how down to earth events could have moulded and socialized in order to make a person fit into the future world.
Hevavidana envelopes quite a number of photographs that brighten the experiences in the pages.
