The Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne today dismissed reports cited that he would be appointed as the next Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Some reports said that the government was likely to appoint Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne as the next Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, according to political sources.

Commenting on the reports, the deputy minister who gave up his highly paid profession in private sector to join politics said, he was not aware of such decision and so far, no government official has informed him of such move.

The controversial Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran’s term is set to end on June 30 while President Maithripala Sirisena expected to announce a replacement.

Meanwhile, the President’s Media Director Dharmasri Ekanayake said even though there is a rumour that Deputy Minister Wickamaratne will be named as the next CB Governor, President Maithripala Sirisena had not yet made such decision.

However, he also said that according to unofficial sources, Deputy Minister Eran Wickaramaratne was willing to take up the position. (Piyumi Fonseka)
