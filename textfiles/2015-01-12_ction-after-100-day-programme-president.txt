	After today’s swearing-in of the Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers, President MaithripalaSirisena said it would be an interim-cabinet and that General Elections would be held after the completion of the 100-day programme.
	“This is only a temporary Cabinet appointed to ensure the successful completion of the 100-day programme. Thereafter we will go for General Election which should be kept in mind when serving the people to the best of their ability. I want all ministers to work efficiently and be always mindful that we will not tolerate any form of corruption or unethical behavior,” he said.  
	The President requested the newly appointed Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers to set a good example to the country and its people when carrying out their duties and that legal action would be taken against those found guilty of fraud, bribery and corruption.
	He said the people had elected him as the Chief Servant of the country at the January 8 presidential election and as pledged earlier they were able to appoint a new cabinet of ministers.
	“This is a step taken in keeping with our 100-day programme. Therefore, ministers should keep in mind that these posts are only temporary and that a General Election will be held after three months. We have long term plans ahead of us,” the President said.
	He said the Minister appointed at the General Elections would be permanent appointments and that the Cabinet with 27 Ministers was well within promised limit of 30. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
