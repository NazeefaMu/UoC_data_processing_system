No ban on foreign artistes


	


	The president and the government have no intention of banning foreign artistes from performing in Sri Lanka, though some have tried to give a wrong interpretation to President Maithripala Sirisena’s statement regarding the Enrique Iglesias concert, the government said today.
	Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said at a media briefing today that the president’s criticism was not directed at the singer, but rather at the organisers for the shortcomings at that particular concert, at which ‘indecent’ behaviour by some local fans was reported.
