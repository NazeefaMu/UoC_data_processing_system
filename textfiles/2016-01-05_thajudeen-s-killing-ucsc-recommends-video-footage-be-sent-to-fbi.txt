Although the CCTV footage showed a vehicle in the vicinity of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen's killing, its license number could not be matched with the licence No: WP KU6543 supplied by the CID, the Colombo University's School Of Computing (UCSC) said today.
It informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris that the poor quality of the video footage and the UCSC's limited technical facilities were the reasons for being unable to do so and recommended that the video footage be examined at a well equipped forensic laboratory abroad such as the FBI, MPS or the new Scotland Yard.
The UCSC said the CID had forwarded four DVD’s and a CD of the CCTV footage recorded in Narahenpita and Kirulapana.
It said the footage had been recorded during night and as such the strong lights from oncoming vehicles have distorted the image.
The UCSC also informed the Magistrate that it was unable to identify any human figures inside the vehicle.
Earlier, the Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris directed the USCS to examine the CCTV footage, relating to the killing of Mr.Thajudeen, and submit a report within 14 days.
The case will be taken up for inquiry on Thursday. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
