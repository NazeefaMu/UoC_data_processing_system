	When Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe, the former Minister of Health, Indigenous Medicine, Social Welfare, Probation, Child Care and Women’s Affairs in the Western Provincial Council attempted to make a statement today at the Council sessions was shouted down by both government and opposition members.
	The former minister had stood up saying that he wish to raise a matter of privilege and thereafter to make this statement, the Chairman too objected to it.
	When the Council began its sessions at the Council hall in Battaramulla, the former Minister began to express that he had been denied his privileges, by removing him from the ministerial position he held for three months without any justification. He also said that he was not informed about his removal from the post of Minister which was made by the President and accused that there had been a coup.
	However, he was interrupted by the Chairman that it was against the regulations of the Council to make lengthy speeches under the pretext of raising a privilege issue.
	Ruling party members Merril Perera, Mahesh Almeida and Gunasiri Jayanath too objected to Warnasinghe’s statement. (Diana Udayangani)
