High born Diyawanna member gets a response


	


The new Big Boss the other day made  a pointed reference to a certain clique of  Blue Party Diyawanna ‘aristocrats’  who  have refused to recognize him as the leader of the party. 
The occasion was the meeting of the Committee central making decisions. 
“I understand that a certain member from a so-called aristocratic family has said that he does not accept me as the party leader. It appears that some so-called aristocrats are averse to my leadership because I have come from an ordinary family,” the new Big Boss had said.
In a hard-hitting comment, he had added: “It is obvious these aristocrats are hurt that a non-aristocrat is the Head of State today!”
A senior purohita present at the meeting later remarked: “The aristocrat the Big Boss targeted was not present at the meeting. But the Boss effectively conveyed his message to him!”
