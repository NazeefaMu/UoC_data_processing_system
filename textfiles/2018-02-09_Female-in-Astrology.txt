Female in Astrology


	

The Astrological rules and principles enunciated in ancient works on Vedic Astrology by sages like Varahamihira or Parasara are targeted to the male, perhaps because, they have always dealt with the astrological rules and principles relating to the female under a separate branch of Astrology called ‘Stri Jataka’ or Female Horoscopy.


Although the general principles and techniques relating to making predictions, delineating character etc. in regard to horoscope reading set forth in the works of Hindu Astrology are applicable to both genders, despite the commonplace reference to the male gender, certain rules set out under Female Horoscopy are peculiar or germane to the females.

 

An imperative for selecting a female partner in life   
This means that a male partner for a female may be selected by consulting the general information and principles relating to horoscope reading, but one should necessarily consult the rules and principles given under female Horoscopy as well to select a female partner for a male. Biological factors warranting Female Horoscopy


Certain biological characteristics peculiar to the feminine sex like puberty, menses, conception, and child delivery have led to the founding of Female Horoscopy as an independent branch of Astrology.   
Attaining puberty is considered an important event for a female in Female Horoscopy. 


The first menses of a female according to Astrology marks an event of much physical, mental and spiritual significance. 


All ancient astrologers have said that marrying a VIRTUOUS WOMAN would neutralize all malefic planetary influences that a man is subject to enabling him to lead a comfortable and happy life. 


Similarly, the marriage is the turning point in the life of a female for it leads to the full flowering of her potential as the female of species.
