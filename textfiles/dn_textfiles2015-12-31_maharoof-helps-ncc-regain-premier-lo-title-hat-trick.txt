Maharoof helps NCC regain Premier l/o title with a hat-trick

Former Sri Lanka all-rounder Farveez Maharoof sounded the national selectors that he is playing some of the best cricket in his career when he performed a hat-trick to lead NCC to topple defending champs Colts by 77 runs in the AIA Premier limited-over final played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
NCC winning the toss and batting first put up a challenging total of 255-8 courtesy of an opening stand of 86 between two former Sri Lankan players Niroshan Dickwella (49) and Upul Tharanga (34) and dismissed Colts for 178 in 45 overs with skipper Maharoof all but making the final a one-sided affair by producing a hat-trick in the opening over of the innings.
He picked up a wicket off his fourth, fifth and sixth deliveries to have Colts reeling at two for three wickets. The defending champs would have been in a worse plight had Maharoof not suffered a hamstring injury in his second over and had to retire taking no further part in the game.

Colts somewhat recovered through a 105-run partnership between Hashan Dumindu (72) and Angelo Jayasinghe (50) but once the pair was separated there was no further resistance to stop NCC from pushing for a comfortable win. Angelo Perera with a 74-ball half-century, Maharoof (34) and Isuru Udana (25 off 14 balls) contributed towards NCC's total despite Sri Lanka off-spinner Dilruwan Perera threatening to run through their batting taking six wickets for 28. NCC last won the title in 2006-07.
NCC 255-8 in 50 overs (Niroshan Dickwella 49, Upul Tharanga 34, Angelo Perera 50, Farveez Maharoof 34, Isuru Udana 25, Dilruwan Perera 6/28)
Colts 178 in 45 overs (Hashan Dumindu 72, Angelo Jayasinghe 50, Priyamal Perera 23, Farveez Maharoof 3/2, Anuk Fernando 2/20)
