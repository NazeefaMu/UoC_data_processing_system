He thinks he is the best of the best performers


	

There is a certain Diyawanna member from the South highly dejected over not being picked to head the list of the best performing members. 




This member is often telling his colleagues that he deserved to be ranked first in the list adding that he may have been denied his due place because of a prevailing crisis in a certain political party. 
The member has gone into a gloom ever since the names of the 10 best performers went public.
