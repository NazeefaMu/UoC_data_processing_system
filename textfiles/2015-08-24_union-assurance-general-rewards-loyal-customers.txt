Union Assurance General has set out to reward its loyal customers through their recently initiated Customer Loyalty  Reward scheme. 
The reward scheme entails awarding female policy holders who have been with UAG for more than 6 years, a free-of-charge roadside assistance coverage for a period of 1 year. This coverage provides assistance to customers in the event of a vehicle breakdown or any type of car trouble that one may encounter. 
This initiative which was extended exclusively to female policyholders was identified to be a value addition to Female drivers who are likely to be more vulnerable in unforeseen situations that involve vehicle breakdowns, flat tires and other mechanical glitches.   
A total of 273 female policyholders who had been with UAG for more than 6 years were granted this free benefit commencing from August 7th 2015. Several customers within Colombo were given a briefing on the coverage offered and personally thanked for by the senior management at the UAG head office on the very same day. 
“It is our loyal customers who have made us who we are today, without them trusting us to serve their insurance needs we wouldn’t be able to sustain within such a competitive business environment. We therefore strongly feel it is our duty to give back to them, and that is what we intend to do with the Customer Loyalty Reward Scheme,” said UAG’s General Manger – Marketing and Distribution Nihal Handunge.
