SC dismisses FR petition against PM's request to Speaker


	

The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the preliminary objections raised by the Attorney General and the Counsel appearing for the Prime Minister on the maintainability of the rights petition challenging the Prime Minister's request to the Speaker for a ruling on the SC pronouncement in the Singarasa Case.

The Bench comprising Justices Priyasath Dep, Upali Abeyratne and Anil Gooneratne dismissed without cost the petition filed by public litigation activist and lawyer Nagananda Kodituwakku.

The petitioner in his petition sought Court to rule that the statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was wrong and that neither he, nor Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had the right to intervene in the judicial system of the country.

He said the Speaker exercises the legislative power in parliament on behalf of the people and he has nothing to do with the judicial system.

The petitioner said the Prime Minister's statement and the action proposed by him is in direct violation of the inalienable sovereign rights of the people, enshrined under Article 3 of the Constitution.

The Prime Minister told Parliament that the government re-confirms the continued validity and applicability of the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR and is firmly committed to implement its provisions. (S.S. Selvanayagam)
