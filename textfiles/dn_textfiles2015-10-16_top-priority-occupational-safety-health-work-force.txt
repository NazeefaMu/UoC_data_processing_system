Top priority for Occupational safety, health of work force

Sri Lanka's labour force which is the prime mover of the country is currently around 8.5 million, said Labour and Trade Union Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne, addressing the inauguration of the National Occupational Safety and Health Week held in Colombo recently.
He said that the labour force of Sri Lanka which is the prime mover of the country, was unable to achieve any economic development without having a healthy work force. According to Minister Seneviratne, the work place health and safety is also the responsibility of the state. Visionary and enterprising employers consider resources allocated for occupational health and safety as an investment rather than an expenditure.
Minister Seneviratne stressed that since Sri Lanka is a rapidly developing country, occupational safety and health of the work force should be given top priority.
