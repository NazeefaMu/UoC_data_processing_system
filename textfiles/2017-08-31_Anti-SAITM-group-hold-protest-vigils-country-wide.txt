An organisation calling itself Anti-SAITM people’s Front launched protest vigil last night demanding the immediate closure of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the protest campaign was launched covering fifty cities across the country from 7 p.m. Monday to 12 p.m. yesterday.

“The main demonstration was held at Punchi Borella in Colombo last night whereas two other torch-carrying demonstrations were held in Maharagama and Avissawella.

“Several thovil functions were held in Panadura, Kurunegala, Buththala and Ampara,” he added.

He said that several other torch-carrying demonstrations were launched in Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Kurunegala, Chilaw, Badulla, Moneragala, Anuradhapura and Mannar districts.

He said that a street play with regard to the SAITM controversy was staged in Ampara last night and that a lamp Pooja was held in Ruwanweli Seya.

Meanwhile, he said that President Maithripala Sirisena should reveal his stance on the SAITM controversy without further delay.

“We will be forced to take crucial decisions after September 15, if the Government would not provide us with a reasonable solution to the issue,” he said.

He added that a vehicle parade has scheduled to arrive in Colombo in protest of the SAITM on September 15 and added that they would seize Colombo on the day. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
