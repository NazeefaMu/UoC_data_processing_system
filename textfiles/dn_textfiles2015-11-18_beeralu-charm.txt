Beeralu charm

Placing her Beeralu Kottaya (Lace Maker's Pillow) made of soft wood, stored on a larger surface padded with coir, on a table and seating on a low bench Gnanawati is holding up a pair of bobbins in her hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow. She makes her bobbin lace.
At the top of the pillow there are some pins to secure the lace as it is woven. Many threads spread out from the pins, each thread fastened to one of the bobbins spread across the pillow.
Her fingers fly and the bobbins click like wind chimes as she flings them this way and that, twiddling, crossing, cording, pausing often to take one of the pins from the back of the collection and set it in a new place between the stitches she has just woven. The collection of lace products includes bookmarks, wall hangings, blouses, table cloths, cushion covers, pillow cases proving the versatility of her skills.
The process looks complex but when she works at the lace pillow she does not concentrate completely on her task. Recalling the lace-making history of her life while weaving a lace, K.A Gnanawathi Abeysiriwardane, lady lacemaker from Kithulampitiya said she learnt lace-weaving from her Loku Amma at the age of twelve. She refers to those days as the good old times when lace was popular among rich upper-class women.
"Lace-making is not hard to learn and that almost anyone can do it. Those days I sold most of my lace to 'Reinda Ammala' in Magalla and made a good living. They regularly visited our homes and purchased our products." She said.
"But today we do not receive a good price for our products as the mediators who purchase our products only pay Rs.20-25 per a yard of a lace. By spending nearly a day to wave a yard of lace, we can only get Rs.20-25. So today I am not doing this as a business. I just weave lace for my pleasure since I love this art. I really enjoy it. Weaving lace is really a meditation. I am willing to train young lace-makers without letting this art to fade away," she said.
However, for Gnanawathi the good times seemed to changed quickly. She is 72 years old today. She is weak and her eyesight is failing. The lace she produces is not as neat as it used to be. She can no longer use her skills to support herself. Without being able to make good quality lace she has no buyers and therefore no income.
Not only Gnanawathi, but most lace-makers in their old age who produced masterpieces in their glory days are left helpless. If there are training facilities where the younger generations can learn the craft and experienced lace-makers can share and improve their skills.
W I I Kumari, an award winning master lace-maker from Thilakapura, Ambalangoda, said that there is a huge demand for lace products among the foreigners. But local people do not buy our products as these products are little bit expensive. Normally we sell a hand lace blouse at Rs.3000-4000. But there are imported blouses woven by machines in the local market at a low price. So we do our products aiming at the foreigners.
Lace-making is a very delicate and difficult craft. Before weaving the lace the lace-makers need to prepare a stencil. To create a stencil the lace-maker needs to know all the different types of knots used in lace-making.
The stencil is made on a piece of card-board using graph paper. They then trace the pattern of the lace onto a piece of paper and fix the pattern onto the rotatable structure of the beeralu kotte or pillow, the wooden structure used to make lace, and create their lace weaving over 30 wooden bobbins or beeralu. They create their pattern using pins where necessary in the design to separate the different kinds of knots. The craft is so intricate and difficult that it takes an experienced lace maker about a week to create a metre of one inch wide lace," she said.
Kumari has won a number of awards and certificates including Silver Award at the Shilpa exhibition organized by the National Crafts Council. Currently she works as a training instructor at Vidatha training centre, Ambalangoda. She also trains schoolchildren.
Beeralu lace making has long been considered a traditional craft of Sri Lanka. Today a small concentration of women still continues this craft mainly in Galle and Matara. It is an art form in crisis. They fight old age, poor market conditions and poverty to keep the craft going.
D M Chithra Kanthi, one of the lace makers, specializes in bobbin lace started learning how to make lace from the age of 10, as there were lace makers in her family. Over the years, the shape and colour of the mats she makes have changed to meet modern tastes. Previously, lace was nearly always white, but now there is demand for other colours.
