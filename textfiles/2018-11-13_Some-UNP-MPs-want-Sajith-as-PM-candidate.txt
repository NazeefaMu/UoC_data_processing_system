A group of UNP MPs have reportedly warned that they would not contest the general election unless there were sweeping changes in the party hierarchy.

Some young MPs such as Harin Fernando said this at a meeting held in the aftermath of the dissolution of Parliament.

In such a scenario there is a move to nominate MP Sajith Premadasa as the UNP's Prime Ministerial candidate. However, Mr. Premadasa continues to remain non-committal on this matter.
