20A: WPC suspends session due to tense situation


	

Proceedings of the Western Provincial Council were suspended as a result of a tense situation which prevailed when the 20th Amendment to the Constitution was taken up for discussions.

A special session was convened to discuss the 20A today after the governor requested the council to convey its decision on it by tomorrow.

However, the Chief Minister had told the council after a party leaders meeting that the draft Bill would be taken up for debate at the next session on September 4.

The joint opposition members had protested at this move by the CM and demanded that the matter be discussed today and had protested by attempting to grab the mace leading to the sessions being suspended. (Muditha Dayananda)
