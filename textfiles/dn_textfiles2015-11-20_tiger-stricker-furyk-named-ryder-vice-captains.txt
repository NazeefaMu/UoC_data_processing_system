Tiger, Stricker, Furyk named Ryder vice-captains

Simons Island, United States, Wednesday: Tiger Woods, a 14-time major winner and seven-time member of the US Ryder Cup team, will be among America’s 2016 vice-captains, US captain Davis Love said Wednesday.
On the eve of the US PGA’s RSM Classic hosted by Love, he announced that Woods, Steve Stricker and Jim Furyk would join Tom Lehman as vice-captains on the US squad that tries to reclaim the trophy from holders Europe.
Next year’s Ryder Cup will be played September 30-October 2 at Hazeltine in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Americans lead the all-time rivalry 25-13 with two drawn but the Europeans have won three in a row, six of the past seven and eight of the past 10.
Woods, who turns 40 next month, is coming off two back operations and has not announced a time-table for his return to competition, but he also said he has not ruled out making the team as a player, a difficult feat given his injuries and struggles of late. “I would like to thank Davis (Love) for his confidence in me and for my selection as a Ryder Cup vice-aptain. This is something I want to do,” Woods said.
“I’ll continue to do whatever I can to help win the Cup back. Once I’m fully healthy, I would like to try to make the team too.”
If Woods plays his way onto the team or receives a captain’s pick, Love would have the option to name a replacement as vice-captain. Stricker and Furyk joined Love as three of the assistants to Jay Haas on the triumphant US Presidents Cup team in South Korea last month.
“To welcome four vice-captains of this caliber is a giant first step towards preparing the 2016 team for success,” Love said. “I am grateful for their commitment, dedication and passion to win.”
Furyk, 45, won the 2003 US Open and has played in the past nine Ryder Cups, second to Phil Mickelson’s 10 appearances in US Ryder Cup history.
