EgyptAir Hijacker arrested


	

The hijacking of a domestic Egyptian flight that was forced it to divert to Larnaca airport in Cyprus has ended with all hostages being released and the hijacker surrendering.

EgyptAir Flight MS181 was taken over by a passenger claiming to be wearing a suicide explosive belt.

In a tweet, the Cypriot foreign ministry said: "It's over. The hijacker arrested."

The motive behind the hijacking remains unclear.

Some reports saying the man wanted to talk to his estranged Cypriot wife, while others said he was seeking the release of female prisoners in Egypt.

The situation ended when the hijacker, reportedly an Egyptian, was seen walking down the steps of the aircraft with his hands raised.

It came shortly after several people were seen fleeing the aircraft. One - apparently a crew member - escaped by climbing out of the aircraft's cockpit window.

The plane had been surrounded by police since it landed at Larnaca several hours earlier on Tuesday morning. (BBC)
