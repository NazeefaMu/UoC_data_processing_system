PM, govt failed to present details of joint resolution at UNHRC

The Prime Minister and the government have so far failed to present the details of the conditions on which it had agreed to host a joint resolution at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, UPFA MP Dinesh Gunewardene said.
At a media briefing addressed by the joint opposition leaders, Gunewardena said although 15 days have passed, neither the Premier nor the government has produced any document in parliament describing the contents of their agreement at the UNHRC on carrying out investigations and prosecutions on alleged human rights abuses during the war.
He went on to say that if a Hybrid court is established as proposed in the resolution it would pose a great danger to the country.
Meanwhile, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma noted that although the government was trying to portray the Geneva resolution as a victory achieved by it, the proposals in the resolution contradicts the government claims.
Prof. Tissa Vitharana, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Raja Collure also addressed the media.
