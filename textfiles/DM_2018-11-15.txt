See SLs National crisis for what it is MS-MR alliance has to be challenged on principles of democra
	
Over the past fortnight, Sri Lanka has witnessed an escalating political crisis, with a standoff between President Maithripala Sirisena and the Parliament. After the shocking and undemocratic appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, the suspension of Parliament, and then its dissolution on November 9, President Sirisena announced snap elections 

	Presidents re-joining MR sparked reductive analysis of power play over SL involving China, India, US
	
	
	For some time, the MR loyalists have been stoking fears of international intervention
	

SCs intervention
Significantly, the Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended the dissolution of Parliament until December 7. While the power struggle will continue, it is to the credit of the democratic regime change in January 2015, ironically led by the President, that Sri Lankas governing institutions have resisted the authoritarian power inherent in the executive presidency. 
Looking back, Sri Lankas liberal democratic turn in January 2015 was too good to be true, particularly when authoritarian populist regimes were steadily rising the world over. MR, who further entrenched the executive presidency including by removing its two-term limit and later manoeuvred the impeachment of a Supreme Court Chief Justice, was dislodged by a broad array of political forces. That major democratic victory for Sri Lanka, in turn for the West, India and Japan, was met with relief over the removal of the China-leaning MR and the normalisation of foreign relations. 
In this context, President Sirisena re-joining MR has once again sparked the reductive analysis of power play over Sri Lanka involving China, India and the US in the Indian Ocean. Such lazy analysis fails to consider the political consequences of prolonged and flawed neoliberal policies and political-economic changes. Moreover, feeding into the frenzy of the international media seeing developments through a hollow geopolitical lens, the MS-MR camp claims that the sale of Sri Lankas assets to China and India and the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore over the last few years by the United National Party (UNP) led by ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have undermined sovereignty and triggered an economic crisis. 

Ideological gains
For some time, the MR loyalists have been stoking fears of international intervention  this xenophobia has been mobilised to consolidate power. In 2015,Maithripala Sirisena claimed his major achievement was rebuilding global relations severed by MRs 10-year tenure. Today, the President is loudly echoing strident nationalists, over protecting Sri Lanka from international agendas. 
The UNP claims to have a monopoly on Western friendship and bringing in foreign investors. It paints a picture of international isolation and a Western aid strike if MR returns, but does not reflect on how its own policies have led the country here. This trend plays out differently within Tamil politics. Narrow Tamil nationalists in Jaffna and the Tamil diaspora see the emergence of an anti-West government as an opportunity to mobilize international opprobrium. They continue to dream of international intervention, ignoring local realities and political dynamics. 
These fears of external intervention and trust in international support are more for ideological manoeuvring. In reality, it is national politics, power consolidation and negotiations with external actors which have determined Sri Lankas international relations. Sri Lankas tensions with external powers -- except for the Indian debacle in the 1980s -- have rarely led to punitive measures and damaging sanctions. Nevertheless, confrontational rhetoric has helped nationalist governments mobilize popular support. 

International pressures
The countrys decade-long contentious engagement, on war-time abuses, at the UN Human Rights Council is a case in point. While the US mobilised resolutions to rein in MR, who was tilting towards China and Iran, he politically gained from the condemnation in Geneva, projecting himself as a defender of war heroes from international bullies. Sri Lankas deteriorating balance of payments and external debt problems are also pertinent. While there is much talk of the debt trap by China, in reality, only 10% of Sri Lankas foreign loans are from China.
Close to 40% of external debt is from the international markets, including sovereign bonds, of which an unprecedented $4.2 billion in debt payments are due next year. Here the International Monetary Funds (IMF) vocal position in relation to its agreement with Sri Lanka from June 2016, and the rating agencies projections on Sri Lanka are crucial to roll over loans. Ultimately, the flows of such capital have little do with diplomatic relations, but depend on national stability and strength, including the political will to ensure budget cuts and debt repayment. 
During his earlier stint in power, MR called the bluff of international economic isolation after a most horrendous war. Despite Western opposition, with authoritarian stability, he had few problems mobilizing loans from the global markets and international agencies such as the World Bank, and for that matter an IMF Stand-By Arrangement. 

Rajapaksa camp claims to guard Sri Lanka from a neo-liberal attack on sovereignty. While Wickremesinghe was shameless in promoting free markets and finance capital the economic vision of MR is of a populist variety with the same substance

Neo-liberal crisis
Sri Lankas economy is not immune from global forces. However, changes to the global economic order, rather than the instrumental moves of any one global power, are what trouble the island nation. 
Declining global trade with increasing protectionism has foreclosed possibilities of export-led development. And that reality has completely escaped Sri Lankas neo-liberal policymakers, whether from the UNP, or earlier under MR. 
Next, while the US Federal Reserve for some years has been preparing to increase interest rates resulting in Western capital from emerging markets flowing back to the metropolis, measures to contain capital flight were not taken. 
It is no coincidence that the political troubles escalated with the deteriorating economic situation a few months ago. It is only after the mounting balance of payments problems that restricting imports -- taboo for Sri Lankas economic establishment -- became a reality, and even ideas of restricting capital flows were considered. The economic crisis, once acknowledged by the government, brought to the fore long-simmering concerns over neglect of the rural economy, particularly in the context of a protracted drought. The political fallout of restricting fertilizer subsidies to farmers, policies of market pricing of fuel and the rising cost of living delegitimized the government. 

Authoritarian populism
The backlash against neo-liberalism coming to the fore with the global economic crisis of 2008, and the emergence of authoritarian populist regimes shaping global politics were bound to affect Sri Lanka. The dangerous rise of a strongman leader such as MR has little to do with the manoeuvres of external powers. Rather, the political ground of MRs popular appeal is shaped by the systematic dispossession of people with cycles of neo-liberal crises. 
While many of Sri Lankas neo-liberal policies, including trade liberalization, privatizing medical education, sale of sovereign bonds and the controversial Port City-cum-international financial centre in Colombo, were products of the MR regime, today the Rajapaksa camp claims to guard Sri Lanka from a neo-liberal attack on sovereignty. While Wickremesinghe was shameless in promoting free markets and finance capital, the economic vision of MR is of a populist variety with the same substance. 
It is credible economic alternatives with a democratic vision that will arrest the slide towards authoritarian populism. During this time of crisis, the prevalent discourse of international interests deflects such alternatives. The UNP and its allies should be challenged on their blunders with the economy and failure to find a constitutional-political solution, including the abolition of the executive presidency. The MS-MR alliance, which is likely to peddle again the war victory and international conspiracies with Sinhala Buddhist majoritarian mobilizations, has to be challenged on principles of democracy and pluralism. The debate in Sri Lanka limited to personalities, corruption and geopolitics needs to shift with the public putting forward powerful demands of democratization and economic justice. Otherwise, the thin wall of defence provided by the Parliament and the courts could crumble, and the deepening political and economic crisis may pave the way for authoritarian consolidation.

## Title: Sri Lankas Democracy Deficit
## Section: Opinion

Sri Lankas Democracy Deficit
	
A cartoon that did the rounds during and after the heady days of the Arab Spring, so-called, had Uncle Sam declaring, Beware! We will give you democracy! Its a bit like someone grabbing a fish out of water and saying I want to save it from drowning! Much of the democracy angst weve seen over the past few days is like that. 
On Tuesday, November 13, 2018, the Supreme Courtgranted leave to proceed on the matter of several Fundamental Rights applications contesting the gazette notification issued by the President to dissolve parliament. What this means, in plain language, is that the court has determined that there is a legal matter that requires examination, nothing more, nothing less. 
The politicians who went to court cheered what they called was a triumph for democracy. Now, had the court determined otherwise, would they have lamented a defeat for democracy, one must ask. Anyway, such triumphalism is par for the course. So too, the cheers of the faithful. 
Whats amusing is the angst and subsequent relief of those who claim to be apolitical or at least non-partisan. They include, but are not limited to spokespersons of certain Western diplomatic missions, self-labeled civil society activists, certain academics and other professionals. They also include those outside of these circles, for examples, ordinary citizens who hold candlelight vigils and posters claiming (perhaps to alleviate embarrassment) this is not about Ranil. 
Lets nutshell it. We didnt hear no whimpers about democracy, darlings, when Maithripala Sirisena appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister on January 9, 2015 even though the man had less 25% support in Parliament. No whimpers when in April 2015, the Yahapalanists tabled a constitutional amendment drafted by a rank incompetent, Jayampathy Wickramaratne, that had more holes than Swiss cheese. The UNP either didnt see the holes or believed that the hole-guard, Maithripala Sirisena would a) not allow the opposition (the Rajapaksas, as they put it) to creep through it and indeed wouldnt himself take a crawl. That the Mahinda-Faction of the SLFP voted for it is another matter here. The point is, there were no concerns raised then. 
No whimpers when the President and Prime Minister worked to dissolve Parliament the very day the COPE report on the bond scam was to be made public. No whimpers when the democracy-champions used their respective national lists to accommodate persons rejected at the polls by the people. No whimpers when Sarath Fonseka was made an MP and given a ministerial portfolio. 
No whimpers, either in January 2015 or in August the same year when MPs crossed over to the government. But today, ladies and gentlemen, theres horror at the possible subversion of democracy. There are whimpers today. And therefore there are hurrahs at what is not an unexpected court ruling considering the fact that the architects of the 19th Amendment were incompetent and slothful.
Those who champion the cause of democracy cannot ignore the democracy-deficit in parliament. They cannot therefore hesitate on the need for correction
To elaborate, the Supreme Court pointed out points in Wickramaratnes draft that were in violation of the constitution. The dissolution clause, court determined, required a two-thirds majority plus a referendum. Wickremeratne amended it, inserting a clause which allowed an interpretation permitting the President to dissolve at will, clearly at odds with the four and a half year moratorium on dissolution in a different clause. 
Back to whimpers. No whimpers when the Yahapalana Government kept postponing local government elections. No whimpers that the terms of six provincial councils have expired and there are no signs of elections being held. 
Not about Ranil No, it is about Ranil for its Ranil that is the UNP and it is Ranil who was caught by the short-hairs by the President. If one were to be generous, one could say, alright, its not about Ranil but it is certainly about the UNP and its political fortunes. 
The constitutional crisis should be talked of as a problem of careless wording. It is also about the machinations of politicians belonging to all parties, not just the UNP. However, the root of the crisis is about true representation. In other words the issue of legitimacy. 
Sirisena mentioned a few months ago that there had been some 400 demonstrations in Colombo since January 2015.. The official Leader of the Opposition votes with the yahapalanists on a consistent basis. What he and the heenen-bayavunu prajaathanthravaadeen(democrats who seem to have woken up from a bad dream) have not mentioned is the glaring representational anomaly. 
The opposition (which is of course not coterminous with the SLPP or the Joint Opposition) does not have proper parliamentary representation. Voter sentiment as expressed in parliamentary composition was mangled in January 2015 and this was repeated in August 2015. The results of the local government elections in February 2018 are the most reliable indication of where the people stand. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna secured power in 239 local government bodies whereas the UNP got just 41 and the SLFP/UPFA led by Maithripala a humbling 10. If democracy is about people, then they have spoken. 
Unfortunately, there was a clause in the 19th that made it difficult to act so as to correct this anomaly, i.e. through the dissolution of Parliament. It took a parting of political ways for Sirisena to move on this and we know how that process is stumbling along. Whats pertinent, however, is that simple arithmetic clearly shows that the anomaly has got worse after Sirisena decided to form a political alliance with Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
The court knows best, and one should not presume here. Whatever the outcome of the litigation process, it seems sensible to proceed in a manner that resolves the representational conundrum for if left unresolved, the basic premises of sovereignty will be compromised. 
Those who champion the cause of democracy cannot ignore the democracy-deficit in parliament. They cannot therefore hesitate on the need for correction. Theres no better corrective mechanism than elections. Theres no better test of approval available in a democracy. You cant have democracy and not have elections; no elections, no democracy. The bottom line, then, is a single word: ELECTIONS.

Thewarapperuma brandishes knife in House
	
The conduct of some parliamentarians stooped down to such low levels today that, for the first time in history, there were allegations that some UNP MPs smuggled in sharp knives into the Chamber of the House for any untoward action.
The photos went viral in the internet and social media showing UNP MP Palitha Thewarapperuma brandishing a knife in an apparent brawl with UPFA MP Prasanna Ranaweera behind the Speakers Chair during commotion in the House.
UPFA MPs Johnston Fernando and Mahindananda Aluthgamage were seen trying to stop him from attempts to strike Mr. Ranaweeera who was also behaving menacingly.
Government MP Jayantha Samaraweerra also charged that MP Palitha Thewarapperuma had a knife which he pointed at the government MPs.
Highways and Road Development Minister S.B.Dissanayaka told reporters at his Ministry that he was disgusted, disappointed and ashamed of what happened in Parliament.
"They should not have behaved in this manner and degrade themselves. Some of them behaved like cats and dogs. There was blood letting as two Deputy Ministers had smuggled knives to the House, he charged.
All Members of Parliament must be determined to safeguard parliamentary tradition decorum and discipline in and out of the House, he added. (By Kelum Bandara, Sandun A Jayasekera and Yohan Perera)

 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

Mary and a female tuk driver

Women are trained at a local driving school. They are also trained to manage their own business and household budget
	Although there has been an emergence of women driving three-wheelers in Sri Lanka, the stigmastill resonates

It is quite difficult for women to make a mark in certain male-dominated professions in the world. This is quite justifiable in Asian countries. Three-wheel drivers are mostly males who dominate the streets at any time during the day. In a bold move to earn a sustainable income, several females voluntarily stepped into this profession. Before long several mobile services empowered women to drive tuks and even become commercial taxi drivers. In an attempt to empower single mothers who are at risk of abandoning their babies and children, the Rosie May Foundation initiated the Think Pink Sri Lanka initiative.
The Rosie May Foundation is an international charity helping children, mainly girls, in Sri Lanka and Nepal. Founded by Graham and Mary Storrie after the murder of their 10-year old daughter, Rosie May in 2003. for many years the Foundation operated from the familys kitchen table in Bottesford. As a response to the natural disasters that have taken place, the Rosie May Foundation initiated the Think Pink Sri Lanka  a tuk tuk scheme where women drive for women. The charity works in Sri Lanka and Nepal and identifies women and children, especially girls who are more vulnerable in the aftermath of disasters. It is vital to give women a voice and educate men to reduce gender inequality by challenging gendered roles and breaking barriers, said Mary Storrie, Director /Cofounder of Rosie May Foundation in an interview with Mirror for Hope. Think Pink tuks are a mission-driven solution and have the potential to address the grave gender discrimination of women in Sri Lanka. UNFPA Sri Lankas study found that over 90% of women had experienced sexual harassment on public transport and only 4% reported this to the police.
Although there has been an emergence of women driving three-wheelers in Sri Lanka, the stigma still resonates. Personal observations prove that they never remain at a three-wheel stand unless they are booked via a mobile app. Think Pink Tuks make women drivers visible and provide safe journeys for women and girls to work and school, Mary continued. Think Pink is facilitated by a non-profit organisation and gives single parent mums the opportunity to train as a driver. In turn they earn a sustainable income to lift themselves out of poverty by renting a Think Pink Tuk to establish their own taxi service.The vehicles are insured and maintained by the charity to ensure maximum safety for passengers and the driver.Social mobility of women is increased and positive role models in a gender biased occupation are created for future generations to aspire too.
The concept of women driving for women prevents sexual harassment, giving women the safety and dignity they deserve.Women are trained at a local driving school. They are also trained to manage their own business and household budget. Mary also said that the women drivers are taught English in order to develop conversational skills as lone female tourists would welcome these taxis.
Adding in value to the tourism industry, Think Pink tours are an additional service that will be provided for tourists to give a local authentic experience.
Speaking about its progress, Mary said that the charity has grown organically since 2004 when it first started operations. It works directly on the ground to respond to the needs of local communities. We have developed good community relationships and continue to reach out to other organisations and work with local authorities as we believe that collaboration is key to delivering high impact and sustainability.
Currently, Think Pink tuks can be found in Galle and one will not fail to recognize them with their bright pink outlook. Mary also has plans to expand the service in other parts of the country in the near future. If you happen to see a pink tuk on the streets, do not hesitate to go on a ride as you are engaging in a charitable move to empower these women.

Undergrads make century-old school overjoyed
	
At 123 years Dhammarathana Vidyalaya, Indibedda is one of the oldest schools in the country, and yet it has received minimal support for its maintenance. The school has faced many hardships over the years and at one point was exposed to the threat of closure. At this point of its history only 12 students had enrolled at this institute. However, with the support of villagers the school was able to gradually develop and sustain itself, as of today.
Located approximately 17 km away from Colombo in Indibedda, on the outskirts of Moratuwa, Dhammarathana Vidyalaya has a population of 180 students with an average of 43 students per grade. There are 8 permanent teachers in the staff. A majority of the students come from low income families where most parents work as carpenters and fishermen. The meals provided daily in the school act as an incentive for families to send their children to school. Furthermore, the school does not have a permanent English teacher at present. It had been noted that out of the 43 students who sat for the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination in August 2018, 18 students could not identify nor write letters, clearly depicting the low literacy levels of students at the school.
Seeing their need, a team of 22 undergraduates from the University of Colombo, Faculty of Management and Finance called Team Rebels set out to raise funds in order to construct a mathematical laboratory along with an area to carry out recreational activities related to the subject. They also plan to conduct an English workshop themselves, for these students. The undergraduates have been working tirelessly since August in order to raise funds, landscape and clean out the outdoor area before the laboratory was built. The community development project was taken up under the name Widumini Ahura.

As per the instructions of the Ministry of Education, a mathematics laboratory-more like an activity room-is considered to be an essential requirement in order to develop the foundational mathematical skills of students in a Primary school. As of now, Dhammarathana Vidyalaya has no such laboratory nor any equipment related to these activities. By constructing a mathematics lab along with an area for recreational activities related to the subject, the undergraduates wish to enhance the knowledge of the students and make them learn the basics of mathematics in a more interesting way, as opposed to the traditional classroom lessons.
As it is a primary school, where the students are still learning the basics of mathematics, the aim is to carry out activities in relation to mathematics in the recreational area in order to help the students have a better understanding of the concepts and theories of mathematics. In addition to this the team aims to carry out an English Workshop with a series of interactive seminars to help these students, especially those facing the Scholarship Exam next year.
After months of hard work and fundraising the opening of the mathematics laboratory was conducted on November 10 (Tuesday). The team hopes to be able to facilitate and provide support to these young impressionable students to ultimately grow into educated, multi-faceted individuals who would go on to serve our country in the future.

An unnecessary conflict had been created between the Legislature and the Executive, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena today.
The move taken by you on October 26, has created a severe instability in the country. The respect and honour acquired by you, is deteriorating, the letter said.
He said that representing the majority in Parliament was not being biased but adhering to democracy and maintaining democratic principles.
I assure you that the 122 MPs, who voted in favour of the no-faith motion against the Government and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday, were all present in Parliament.
Although I attempted thrice to carry out the voting in a proper manner, the tense situation prevailed in the Chamber prevented me from doing so, the Speaker has said. 
I urge you as the President of Sri Lanka to give heed to the majority and thereby protect the country from the prevailing peril and put an end to the current crisis, he added.

The victory that the grieved petitioners were handed by the Supreme Court ruling regarding the dissolution of Parliament was akin to the end in most movie scripts; the good triumphing over the bad. 
It seems the efforts of the democratic forces during the past few days havent been in vain. But like walking out of a movie theatre and stepping into reality again, we now have to fathom that we have three difficult customers to deal with; Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa. This in fact is the bitter reality.

The present court ruling gives some respite to Sri Lanka
	the democratic forces who are working overtime do believe in a Sri Lankan Summer
	People in the country have the habit of shelving their good-naturedness and taking on a confrontational attitude when the topic switches to politics
	Those who love democracy and fair play cant relax now and must double their efforts

The problem with the three is that they are power hungry and love themselves more than the country. Another common characteristic about the trio is that they have been the least influenced by the opinions of others. In other words they have to take responsibility for the positions they have put themselves into in the field of politics. Right now its only Rajapaksa who has some future in politics (Going purely on the peoples acceptance of him). Wickremesinghe and Sirisena have proven beyond doubt that they are spent forces in politics. But Rajapaksas ruthless past and the negativity with which the outside world looks at this man makes it real hard for him to have the same clout he had during past elections. 
The present court ruling gives some respite to Sri Lanka because the recent developments indicated that the nation was slowly moving towards becoming a pariah state. As many as eight Western diplomats shunning a scheduled meeting with the Dr.Sarath Amunugama a few days ago underscores that the international community wasnt in favour of Parliament being dissolved in an undemocratic manner. 

Lawyers for Democracy
A lawyers collective operating by the name Lawyers for Democracy voiced the biggest warning and stated that qualities of a civilised country in loving democracy, basic law, sovereignty of the people and decency in governance have been showed in the gutter. This they said was due to the dissolution of Parliament by undemocratic means. 
Whats alarming is that a nation that lit crackers and served milk rice on the streets to celebrate the dissolving of Parliament and appointing Rajapaksa after sacking Wickremesinghe as Premier didnt show enough enthusiasm to welcome this historic court ruling. It seems that a good number of the countys citizens find it hard to understand that the rule of the law is the only hope when politicians bungle after assuming power, thanks to the peoples votes. UNP Leader Wickremesinghe was quick to point out that one cant play around with the Constitution adding the president is not above the law. 
The people in this country start believing when someone goes on repeating untrue information like a mantra. Its alarming as well to note that people are quick to comment on untrue facts appearing on social media, without bothering to verify the content. Politics often takes centre stage and one can observe the fantasy worlds they live in, believing their favourites would rule the island when in reality they dont have half a chance nor the legal clearance to be granted nomination at elections. 
But on the other hand the democratic forces who are working overtime do believe in a Sri Lankan Summer saying hello soon despite it being a cold November that we are at present experiencing. 
There is much talk within the UNP that it is mulling over the prospects of appointing of a new leader. Sajith Premadasas name has come up at several forums as the possible candidate for the party leadership. Political analysts point out that the only avenue for this opening up is if Wickremesinghe moves away and assumes a consultancy role in the party, paving the way for the next generation of UNPers to take over and contribute to the decision making process. But nothing of that sort could have been even dreamed of if not for the staunch efforts of Karu Jayasuriya who maintained that he was compelled to accept the status quo prior to October 26. The same must be said about the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters of the Buddha Shasana in Sri Lanka who have maintained a stark silence regarding the dissolution of Parliament and the appointing of a new premier. This silence could be interpreted as their dissatisfaction regarding the new turn of events in politics under the Sirisena-Rajapaksa alliance. 

Internationals community
Regardless of what opinions patriotic people of this country express, the internationals community is fully behind Wickremesinghe. This (The outside world) is a force and must be considered as a force to be reckoned with. If Sri Lanka doesnt revert back to a democratic way in which it governs the country, the international community imposing sanctions on Sri Lanka is not far away. 
People in the country have the habit of shelving their good-naturedness and taking on a confrontational attitude when the topic switches to politics. This is a subject where people would go to any extremes in order to defend their views. So much hate is spread on social media during arguments about whether Sirisena did the right thing dissolving parliament. For some people dissolving Parliament, having an election and electing an efficient Government is above the law and democracy. For them Wickremesinghe stating that the court ruling in favour of the peoples franchise was a victory for decent politics amounts to rubbish. 
Those who love democracy and fair play cant relax now and must double their efforts. They cant be caught napping. Those who rule the island now have the habit of springing surprises on the people. The forces behind the Sirisena-Rajapaksa duo have vowed that they await the Supreme Court ruling on December 7 and add that they would fight hard to go for elections. 
December marks the arrival of the festive season. That much looked forward to month is just days away. But whats happening now has made the political environment rather unpleasant. The tussle between the good and the bad has never been so decisive for the islanders. Sri Lankas democratic forces are screaming for spring time despite the present environment we live in making us bitterly cold!

## Title: A call to Be Breast Aware

A call to Be Breast Aware
	

As per the World Health Organisation, survival rates are as high as 80% in the developed world

Dr. Randima Nanayakkara

Dr. Randima Nanayakkara, Consultant in Surgical Oncology, discusses why awareness is of critical importance in battling the most common cancer among women.
October is the month dedicated to breast cancer awareness worldwide. 
The importance of promoting awareness is clear when we examine some startling breast cancer statistics, between the developing and developed countries. As per the World Health Organisation, survival rates are as high as 80% in the developed world, where established state sponsored screening programmes and heightened awareness of the disease exist. In comparison the rate is as low as 40% in the developing world where such awareness levels do not exist. In Sri Lanka breast cancer is today the commonest cancer in females. As per the data reported in 2010 by the Ministry of Health, the incidence was around 18 cases for every 100,000 persons and the general consensus is that this figure has been on a steady rise since then. 
Thus explaining the significance of marking a month dedicated to awareness, Dr. Nanayakkara explains that as the number one cancer affecting women, the disease has attracted millions of dollars in research funding worldwide and this has been so for over decades. It is also a matter of high importance for the health care profession in Sri Lanka. The result is that today, the treatment of the disease follows a very streamlined and meticulous approach and the rates of success if detected early and treated without an undue delay are very promising. Sri Lanka is yet to implement a far reaching breast cancer screening programme in the country, the lack of which is certainly a disadvantage. However, this is where initiatives taken by the private, public and NGO sector such as the work done during the breast cancer awareness month of October play an important role. 
Dr. Nanayakkaras observation is that most of the female patients he treats seem to present their case too late for curative treatment. He believes this can be attributed to the fact that most frequently the clinical symptom the patient encounters is a painless lump which slowly grows in size over months. In about 10% of the cases the lump results in only a mild pain. Therefore, patients sense no urgency in investigating these lumps. However as early detection is the key to successfully treating the disease, the ignorance and inaction of the typical cancer patient stands as a huge disadvantage to them in fighting the disease. 
Dr. Nanayakkara further noted that There is also the apprehension and fear people feel about what is to follow should the lump in fact be cancerous. It is an irrational yet understandable feeling of fear which we as doctors encounter every day with patients we treat he explains. This is why a discussion about breast cancer detection and diagnosis would be of utmost importance. 

It is usually a panel of doctors comprising of an Oncologist, Radiologist, Pathologist and an Oncological Surgeon who will discuss a treatment plan for a given patient

As Dr. Nanayakkara outlines, a first stop for a female suspecting a cancerous lump is at a General Medical Practitioner who is trained to conduct a preliminary breast examination. Thereafter the patient will be referred to a surgical oncologist/ surgeon who will initiate what is referred to as the triple assessment Any breast lump irrespective of the patients age should be investigated via the triple assessment the aim of which is to establish if the lump in question is benign or malignant. 
Step one of this assessment is the clinical examination where the patients history is discussed with an Oncological Surgeon and a physical examination of the patient occurs. The Second step involves radiological imaging where a non-invasive ultra sound scan will be done. Depending on the age and specific needs of the case, a mammogram and/or a MRI scan will also be warranted. The third stage is a fine needle biopsy which is a study of the cells obtained from the lump. The procedure is a simple out-patient procedure done under local anaesthesia. The above mentioned triple assessment can diagnose a cancer with about a 97% accuracy level. 
Following the triple assessment, and if the result suggests a breast cancer, a core biopsy will be required for the final confirmatory diagnosis. Here a slightly larger needle will obtain a larger sample of tissue for analysis. This too is an out-patient procedure done under local anaesthesia. 
As cost is also a cause for apprehension, Dr. Nanayakkara highlights that the cost of the triple assessment is around Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 in the private sector. The cost of a core biopsy is also around Rs. 15,000. Of course, via the public health service all of this comes free of charge. 
Following the confirmation that it is indeed breast cancer that a patient is diseased of, it is usually a panel of doctors comprising of an Oncologist, Radiologist, Pathologist and an Oncological Surgeon who will discuss a treatment plan for a given patient. While surgery is usually the first step in the treatment of an early stage breast cancer, a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and or hormone therapy may be offered for patients with more advanced disease. 
As a surgical oncologist Dr. Nanayakkara who carries out regular breast conservation and reconstruction surgeries, he highlights that breast cancer removal surgery today is less radical and less disfiguring than in previous times. The general idea is to provide a greater degree of normalcy for the patient following the surgery. Breast conservation surgery removes a tumour along with a rim of normal breast tissue leaving the original breast largely intact. On the other hand, breast reconstruction involves recreating a breast following a removal of a breast, using muscle tissue from other parts of a patients body or artificial implants. Conservation and reconstruction both are practised by a few surgeons even in Sri Lanka and apart from being effective in removing all traces of cancer from the affected breasts it proves to provide a lesser psychological impact on the patient post recovery. 
The message during the month of awareness is clear. It is a call to women to be more breast-aware. A self-breast examination every month following the completion of the monthly menstrual cycle is a simple first step in the right direction. Seeking urgent medical attention if there is any change in a breast from what is considered normal is a must. Consider changes in the appearance in the breast, feelings of discomfort, lumps and nipple discharges as tell-tale signs of some underlying problem. Breast cancer is a surmountable challenge.

Artificial kidneys to bring hope for dialysis patients
	

Patients currently undergoing kidney dialysis while waiting for transplants have recently received some hopeful news. The Kidney Project, being headed by researchers at the University of California in San Francisco aims to perfect a bio-artificial kidney to save the lives of those suffering with end stage renal disease (ESRD).
Currently the only way to prolong the life of someone with ESRD is through dialysis which is not always accessible, in addition to being very expensive. While kidney transplantation is currently the best treatment doctors have for renal failure, there is a shortage of donor kidneys worldwide and without treatment ERSD is fatal.
Once surgically implanted, the free-standing kidney (which is about the size of a coffee cup), is able to complete the same biological functions as a regular kidney such as filtration of toxins. The procedure to insert the implant into the body is similar to that of a kidney transplant. With current estimations the cost will also be similar. The devices are expected to be permanent and should any issues arise with the artificial kidney, they are expected to be resolved with minimally invasive surgery. In the USA, clinical trials started earlier this year and researchers are expecting the first bio-artificial kidneys to be available to the public in 2020 depending on the availability of funding.The National Institute of Health (NIH) has given a 6-million-dollar funding grant in 2015. Various US federal agencies including the NIH, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defence (DOD) have also given almost 7 million worth of funding.
The Kidney Project still needs another 3 million dollars to complete the clinical trials and give hope to the estimated two million patients in the world affected with end stage renal disease.

Begging racket  on train using children
	
I came across a thin woman when travelling in a train. This woman with tear-filled eyes and carrying a baby poured out her tragic story to me. I am a resident in Mirigama. I have two children. My husband is bedridden after falling from a coconut tree. We have no livelihood. That is why we are begging in the train as a means of living. the woman said.

	There are about 20 children from both sexes, all under16 years of age. There is nobody to stop this tragedy We have no livelihood
	
The passengers in the train had made generous contributions, handing out notes to the value of Rs. 20 and 50. She bestowed merits on them and disembarked from the train. The other day, an aged man boarded the train with a baby in his hand and had a child accompanying him. The baby was the one who was with the woman the previous day. This old man also began to relate his story with tear filled eyes.
 We have no place to live. These are my daughters children. My daughter and her husband met with an accident and died. I am the one who looks after these children. Please give us some money to buy some eatables. the man said. Then, he had also been successful in collecting money from the passengers.
In the meantime, a hawker who sold apples told the people not to give him money because he was a thief. However, the so called thief left the train without saying anything in response. This writer then approached the apple seller and listened to his version of the story.
These beggars beg to earn a daily wage. One beggar earns about Rs.2500 a day. The balance is given to the person who employs them. This ring operates in the form of a mafia. The children are obtained on rent
Sir, that man is not the parent of those children. There is another woman. They have got together and continue with this business. The parents of those two children are somebody else. That man gives the parent Rs.1500 for allowing to bring the small one and Rs. 2000 for the big one. The mother of these children is a drug addict. She also begs and obtains the money given to the child to buy drugs. As a result the children have to starve. It is I who gave even an apple to them. I do not know what this man will do to these children, he went on.
He added that the person concerned was a K.G.( Kerala Ganja which is also known as Cannabis) seller. He has been arrested by the police for selling ganja to school children. One child was small and the other is said to have attained age. I do not know what will be the fate of these children who are at the mercy of this ganja seller, the apple seller said. He has alerted the train guards about the man, but his warnings have fallen on deaf ears.
Then, how do they beg in the train this writer asked in response.
He said that there is a kingpin in this racket. That big beggar plans who goes where depending on the trains that operate at night. He is the one who decides the modus operandi of all beggars. He knows that nothing will happen to him and his accomplices. He pointed out that the daily earnings of each beggar is around Rs.5000. He enjoys the time he spends with his accomplices. Outsiders cant invade their territory and if this happens there will be a tragedy, according to him.
I then contacted another person to verify the story related to him by the apple seller. He was a book seller.
He related the other side of the story.  There are no fans in the train compartments because the beggars got together and removed them with the help of the employees of the railway stations. These beggars beg to earn a daily wage. One beggar earns about Rs.2500 a day. The balance is given to the person who employs them. This ring operates in the form of a mafia. The children are obtained on rent. There is a Child Protection Authority established in this country. But, nobody comes to rescue these innocent children. There are about 20 children from both sexes, all under 16 years of age. There is nobody to stop this tragedy, he affirmed.
The other day, an aged man boarded the train with a baby in his hand and had a child accompanying him. The baby was the one who was with the woman the previous day
Whats sad about the story is that nobody is responsible to find out about this crime and the abusing of children that takes place with the connivance of the people. Nobody seems to come forward for the protection of the children. No questions are asked by the authorities as to why these children resort to begging in this manner. Train commuters request the authorities to focus their attention on these crimes and explore the possibility of controlling them by punishing the wrongdoers.

Beluga whales get new retirement home
	


Little Grey and Little White will leave their concrete tank for a brand-new sanctuary

After seven years in captivity performing tricks at a Chinese water park, two super cute beluga whales are heading to Iceland for retirement. Little Grey and Little White will leave their concrete tank for a brand-new sanctuary created by the Sea Life Trust. the process involves transforming a rocky oceanic inlet covering 32,000 square meters into what will be the worlds first open sea sanctuary for whales and dolphins. As they were both born in captivity, Little Grey and Little White are currently learning skills to help them survive in the wild ahead of their long and difficult journey. Relocating the two whales will be the first time that a captive beluga whale has ever been released to an ocean sanctuary, hopefully setting a precedent for other performing whales and dolphins inthe future.

Book Review : Avasan  Visanduma The Final Solution   (Die Endlosung) A book about Holocaust victims
	
A few years ago, a Sri Lankan photojournalist was following a course in Berlin - Germany with several other foreign journalists. At the end of the year, they had to submit a report based on their photographic skills. While his colleagues were spending time at nearby parks photographing flowers and birds, he chose a rather difficult task. He started travelling 300 kilometers each day to the then Hitlers infamous Buchenwald Concentration camp to do a documentary, and it received the award for the best piece of work by a foreign student. 
The story did not end there. After returning home with a luggage full of documents and photographs, and after five more years of comprehensive research, he has brought out a book on the subject. 

After five years of comprehensive research, he has brought out a book on the subject
	The book provides a brief background about Hitlers childhood, young days and assuming of power

Priyanjen Suresh De Silvas Avasan Visanduma (Final Solution) tells the story of 6 million Jews who were brutally massacred during Hitlers regime, known as the Third Reich. It is the first of its kind, presented to the Sri Lankan readers, with a complete narrative about one of the darkest periods in history. 
Here, the author brings out first hand information of the nature of Nazi concentration camps, how their work was carried out, by personally visiting them and interviewing the survivors and the second and third generations of people who suffered during the period, which historians later named The Holocaust. 
The book provides a brief background about Hitlers childhood, young days and assuming of power. It describes the intentions of the infamous dictator, which were clearly visible at that time, unfortunately not taken in to serious consideration by many. 

While his colleagues were spending time at nearby parks photographing flowers and birds, he chose a rather difficult task. He started travelling 300 kilometers each day to the then Hitlers infamous Buchenwald Concentration camp to do a documentary, and it received the award for the best piece of work by a foreign student

After a brief account of the early stages of the Third Reich, the book starts on the tale, how the decision was taken to terminate the existence of an entire race, which consisted of 11 million people throughout Europe. 
Having become the chancellor on 30th January 1933, Hitler gradually builds up his authority over the German parliament, and sets upon to pursue his ambitions to build Germany with only one superior race, the Aryans. His vision for Germany, as mentioned in his book Mein Kampf (My Struggle) written during his days in Landsburg prison, was beginning to become a reality. The author points out that, had the Jewish community who were compelled to buy Mein Kampf, bothered to read it, they would have realized what was in store for them in Hitlers Third Reich. 
Long before the invasion of Poland, which led to the second world war, on 1st April 1933, Hitler declared war against the Jews by bringing a law to boycott all Jewish products and services. It was the beginning of the end for over one hundred thousand Jews in Germany. By 1935, 8000 had committed suicide and 75,000 had fled the country. 
20th January 1942, happened to be the day, the final decision about the fate of 11 million Jews was taken. The Wanci Palace of Berlin, Germany, housed the secret meeting held among the members of Hitlers inner circle and bore no written evidence. The project was named Die Endlosung (Final Solution). 
The author, page after page, describes how the Final Solution was brought in to action. 
Starting from Poland, the Nazis began herding the Jewish people initially in to ghettos, small areas in towns where free movement was restricted, and then to concentration camps which became extermination camps where hundreds, if not thousands of them were either shot, gassed or starved to death each day. From Hungary to Holland and from France to Russia, wherever the Nazis conquered, they made sure that the Jews were met with the same fate. 
The reader is given a thorough description about the life inside a Nazi concentration camp. In most places, whether one should be kept alive or not was decided solely on his or her ability to work. Jewish prisoners labour was extensively used in leading German factories (some of them still existing) that supplied arms, chemicals and other machinery to the Third Reich. 
Recently, the multinational company which was to supply anti graffiti chemicals to the Berlins newly opened war memorial, was boycotted on the grounds that it happened to be the same
company which had supplied deadly Zyclon B gas to Hitlers gas chambers. 
Apart from prison labour, the 200 odd doctors who worked for Hitler, made use of the prisoners for what they called advanced medical research since prisoners were freely available as laboratory mice. The author describes the types of these tests, which no sane person would have volunteered, that ended up killing or permanently disabling most who took part. 
While providing an overall view of the Second World War, the author has successfully drawn the attention of the reader towards one of the most disturbing aspects - of it, the Holocaust victims. Out of the few publications available in the vernacular, Avasan Visanduma covers this main aspect in depth, so a reader, upon completing the book, would be in a much better position to understand why the world is still talking about these events, which happened over 60 years ago. 

Out of the few publications available in the vernacular, Avasan Visanduma covers this main aspect in depth, so a reader, upon completing the book, would be in a much better position to understand why the world is still talking about these events, which happened over 60 years ago

The final part of the book provides details about the other prominent figures of Hitlers regime such as Himmler, Goering, Eichmann, Goebbles, their conduct in the S.S. army and the fates that awaited them at the end. The reader will find how justice was carried out for those who have been trying to evade arrest, even decades after the end of World War II. 
The author mentions in the foreword, how his interest grew towards the World War II and the victims of the Holocaust, after reading the translation of Bruno Arpits best seller about Buchenwald camp Naked Among Wolves. Similarly, one can expect that Suresh de Silvas book might create the same enthusiasm among a few, that someday, would benefit other Sri Lankan readers.

Constitutional Crisis   set to deepen
	
If the crisis spins out of control, the President will opt to prorogue Parliament once again

Some people assume the constitutional impasse, triggered by the sacking of United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe from premiership, would end after Parliament was reconvened yesterday (November 14) after prorogation.
Instead, the exact opposite would happen as the crisis is poised to be compounded. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya declared that the no confidence motion against the new Government passed by voice vote. Subsequently, Wickremesinghe said that the Government, led by him before his dismissal, would stand.
Nevertheless, further political turmoil is in store for the country as the incumbent Government of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa does not accept the verdict of the Speaker on the premise that the procedure adopted for passing the no confidence motion. That is the point for the problem to take a turn for the worse.
Whatever anyone might say, President Maithripala Sirisena is the appointing authority of the Prime Minister. He would never reappoint Wickremesinghe, and it will set the stage for the crisis to balloon in the days to come, with indecision and uncertainty looming over the country.
Things will worsen if people take to the streets by and large and the police try to quell such protests.
After yesterdays parliamentary session, the UNP MPs were shouting jubilantly whereas the members of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) defied recognising the vote of no confidence on their Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Probably, these slogan- shouting UNP backbenchers have little understanding that the mere passing of the no confidence motion would not resolve the problem at hand.
Interestingly, amidst tension between the members of either side, there was bonhomie among some senior members.
International Trade Minister Bandula Gunwardane was making comments to media personnel who mobbed him along the corridors of the parliamentary complex when UNP MP for the Badulla District moved down to him.
Oh, Minister, why dont you join us he asked Gunwardane.

However, the other main countries such as China, Russia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh appear to be neutral observers without attempting to commit anything under the current developments

Gunawardane made use of the opportunity only to exchange some pleasantries with his parliamentary colleague. Otherwise, the MPs across the divide looked tense with each other in general.If the crisis spins out of control, the President will opt to prorogue Parliament once again. If that does not solve the issue, he will consider the possibility of calling for a referendum to seek peoples approval for dissolution of Parliament. According to inside sources, he is now mulling over that option.

Diplomatic community divided
The Colombo based diplomatic community also looks divided on the developments in Sri Lanka. The envoys from the western bloc including the United States were toeing a stand in favour of the UNP. In fact, these countries only sent low level representatives to the briefing by Foreign Affairs Minister Sarath Amunugama and others. These were present in the Speakers gallery or the VIP gallery of Parliament when the vote of no confidence motion was taken up in the House. Among those present were representatives from the countries and regions such as The European Union, Norway, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands.
However, the other main countries such as China, Russia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh appear to be neutral observers without attempting to commit anything under the current developments.
Indias silence is remarkable in this instance as it is a country that backed or welcomed the change in 2015. Today, India maintains silence on the issue. It is, in a way, a defeat for the UNP-led camp and a gain for the other side in diplomacy.
New political alignments In politics, there are two sayings proved against time- there are no permanent friends and politics is the art of the possible. Seemingly, these two adages are truer in Sri Lanka than anywhere else.
Crises, challenges and contradictions, often found in politics, lead to the emergence of totally new political alignments or to transform the existing ones with fresh outlooks. Circumstances even force political party leaders to reconcile their differences even with their arch rivals . The latest example is President Sirisena who forged ties with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa casting aside rancour between them. One year ago, nobody would have ever expected that these two leaders would set aside differences. But, political realism left them with no other choice.
In fact, the present climax of political developments originated from the outcome of the Local Government Elections that were conducted on February 10, 2018. Sri Lanka Podujana Pereamuna (SLPP), working under the obvious leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa, won that election.It indicated the dynamics of current political trends, and relegated the Presidents UPFA to a distant third.
Fearing a worse political predicament under the unfolding circumstances, 16 UPFA MPs who held ministerial posts in the unity Government voted in favour of a no confidence motion moved against Wickremesinghe from the premiership.
In fact, the President and Wickremesinghe were squabbling internally prior to that. They belong to different breeds of politicians. It is well understandable that they cannot remain in a political marriage for long.
And, the outcome of the Local Government Elections created an opening and gave an excuse for the President to go against Wickremesinghe in the open. That is why, he extended his discreet support to the no confidence motion. At his behest, 16 UPFA MPs voted for the motion. He even asked Mahinda Rajapaksa to ensure the support of his MPs to the motion. Wickremesinghe survived the motion, though.

After yesterdays parliamentary session, the UNP MPs were shouting jubilantly whereas the members of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) defied recognising the vote of no confidence on their Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa

The President, however, persisted with his efforts to oust Wickremesinghe. He invited then Speaker Karu Jayasuriya or former Minister Sajith Premadasa to accept the premiership. Both turned down the offer, as told by the President himself.
Still determined, the President did not stop at that point. He devised another political strategy. This time, he appeared to have come to the conclusion that it would be better to tie up with anyone to sack Wickremesinghe. So, the simmering political crisis climaxed with the President appointing Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister on October 26. It triggered a constitutional impasse, and the President went to the extent of dissolving Parliament.
There is much legal wrangling on the matter. Dissolution has been suspended by the Supreme Court till December 7.
There are no permanent enemies or friends in politics, as goes the saying. It is all the more evident in the fact that President Sirisena united with his arch rival Rajapaksa. In moving the no confidence motion, all groundwork was done by the JVP, along with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). As such, it is an unofficial political alliance of the UNP, the TNA and the JVP. In politics anything is possible and nobody would have thought of a UNP-JVP alliance several years ago. Today, they have a common political objective. It wont be surprising if the JVP contests the next parliamentary elections on the UNP ticket. Or else, the JVP would stake a credit for unseating Rajapaksa from office by moving and seconding the no confidence motion against him. It is an attempt by the JVP to carve out a niche from the anti- Mahinda vote base.

Diabetes: A concern for every family
	
While the nation focuses on the ongoing political crisis and the Supreme Courts historic verdict on Tuesday, we also need to concentrate on vital issues such as healthcare and education especially for the younger generation. Yesterday was World Diabetes Day and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in a statement says the theme for this year and next year is The family and Diabetes. 
According to the IDF a two-year time frame has been chosen to best align the World Diabetes Day campaign to the current IDF strategic plan and facilitate planning, development, promotion and participation. 
It says materials and actions that IDF will develop over the two years of the campaign will aim to raise awareness of the impact that diabetes has on the family and support network of those affected. It also wants to promote the role of the family in the management, care, prevention and education on diabetes. 
According to figures compiled by the IDF, more than 425 million people are now living with diabetes. Most of these cases are type-2 diabetes, which is largely preventable through regular physical activity, a healthy and balanced diet and the promotion of healthy living environments. Families have a key role to play in addressing the modifiable risk factors for type-2 diabetes and must be provided with the education, resources and environments to live a healthy lifestyle. 
IDF says one in two people currently living with diabetes is undiagnosed. Most cases are type-2 diabetes. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to prevent the complications of diabetes and achieve healthy outcomes. All families are potentially affected by diabetes and so awareness of the signs, symptoms and risk factors of all types of diabetes is vital to help detect it early. 
Diabetes can be expensive for the individual and family. In many countries, the cost of insulin injections and daily monitoring alone can consume half of a familys average disposable income, and regular and affordable access to essential diabetes medicines are out of reach for too many. Improving access to affordable diabetes medicines and care is therefore urgent to avoid increased costs for the individual and the family, the IDF says. 
Less than one in four family members have access to diabetes education programmes. Family support in diabetes care has been shown to have a substantial effect in improving health outcomes for people with diabetes. It is therefore important that ongoing diabetes self-management, education and support be accessible to all people with diabetes and their families because it can reduce the emotional impact of the disease. 
IDF warns that the number of people with diabetes is likely to rise to 522 million by 2030. Three out of four people with diabetes live in low and middle income countries including Sri Lanka. One in two people with diabetes, that is about 212 million remain undiagnosed. Diabetes is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and lower limb amputation. About 80% of cases of type-2 diabetes is preventable through the adoption of a healthy lifestyle. 
World Diabetes Day is a global occasion in which people with diabetes, health professionals, diabetes advocates, media, the general public and government organisations unite in the fight against diabetes.
In Sri Lanka, Dr. Manilka Sumanatilleke, the President of the Sri Lanka College of Endocrinologists, is reported to have expressed grave concern that youth in the age group of 18 to 20 years are being afflicted by diabetes. The specialist says urgent action is required to reverse this trend. Parents especially need to make their children aware of the diet and lifestyle that could prevent diabetes. For instance, some parents because of their work schedules or lack of awareness give their children money to buy fish buns or ham burghers for breakfast instead of some protein rich gram, green gram, cowpea or other grains. People say eat well but now we need to emphasize the need to eat wisely and think not only about the taste but also about the nutritional value of the meals we have.

Govt. ready to defeat NCM if UNF-led alliance adheres to protocols: SB
	
If the UNF-led political alliance follows proper Parliamentary procedures and Standing Orders when bringing in a no-confidence motion (NCM) against the government and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the government is ready to face it and defeat it, Chief Whip and Highways Minister S.B. Dissanayake said today.
He said the government would easily secure a minimum of 125 votes in Parliament to defeat the NCM.
Addressing the media at his office, the minister said the UNP-led alliance against the government could hand over the NCM to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya after Parliament met this afternoon and ask for an early date for the debate and vote.
The NCM must remain in the Order Book for a minimum of five days. The party leaders must then decide a date for the debate and vote at the Business Committee meeting. Usually, an NCM can be given an early date for debate on the priority basis and we are ready to accept the outcome of the NCM if and when it is debated and voted. EPDP leader Douglas Devananda will bring three members to the government from the North. M.L.M. Hizbullah will bring another three. There will be three others joining the government from Mano Ganesans and Palani Digambarams parties. Arumugam Thondaman will bring five members to expand the government to 125. The UNP will be reduced to 65 and will fail to garner the magic number of 113 even with the support of the TNA, JVP, SLMC and ACMC. However, we are not ready to loosen the government from our grip. We will continue to rule the country. There will be selling and buying of members in days to come once again," he said. The minister said Speaker Jayasuriya acted arbitrarily on Wednesday and violated Parliamentary proceedings and Standing Orders. He said lawyers representing the government should have asked the Supreme Court for an injunction against the reconvening of Parliament until the final determination of the case and admitted it was a mistake on the part of the counsel of the government.
"The counsel arguing the case on behalf of the government will make a request to the Supreme Court for a bigger bench of five or seven judges or even more," he said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Govt.'s request for election not genuine: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the request that is being made by the government to go for a general election is not a genuine one.
JVP MP Sunil Handunetti said if the government really wanted to go for an election, they would support to get two-thirds majority in Parliament.
There will be no free and fair general election if the election is held under the present regime, he said.
Can one expect a group who does not allow the House to be conducted in an orderly manner to conduct a free and fair election he questioned.
He charged that one MP had broken the microphone at Speakers chair during the commotion. This MP will have to pay damages to the House, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Judiciary and Legislature,  the supreme pillars of Sri Lanka
	

How Sri Lankas drop from frying-pan-to-the-fire was averted

The trouble with conspiracies is that they rot internally.
~Robert A. Heinlein

At the time this column is being penned, the Supreme Court of the land has already issued a stay order on the now infamous decree to dissolve Parliament. The Supreme Courts unanimous decision to revert the Presidents, the Chief Executives, order calls for enormous amount of inner strength on the part of all Justices of the Supreme Court on the one hand while on the other, delivers an unequivocal message to the world that Sri Lanka is still a land where the rule of law is at the core of her makeup. An enormous weight has been set aside, a sigh of relief and satisfaction is being exhaled; the ordinary people, for whom these nuanced arguments and debate about validity of Presidential decrees and sovereignty of Parliament are as alien as a glass of whiskey to a teetotaler, would unknowingly carry on with their daily chores; they were hardly aware that they had just managed to avert a fall into a cataclysmic abyss. 

AG made his obligatory submissions before a three-bench SC
	Political power being invested in one individual is simply not acceptable
	MRs walking away when NCM was submitted was a clear sign of him losing badly

Attorney General of the country, the chief law officer of the Crown, made his obligatory submissions before a three-bench Supreme Court. His arguments for upholding President Maithripala Sirisenas political decision to dissolve Parliament without allowing the Speaker of that noble house of the people to decide whether Presidents decision of replacing one Prime Minister with another (in this case the one who was soundly defeated at the last Presidential Elections in 2015) could be validated via a floor test, was not held by the Supreme Court. By the time the reader reads this column Parliament might have already voted whether the status quo of October 25 still stands. The inherent disadvantage of a columnist restricts him from giving the reader a more up-to-date live account of a days accelerated paced-life. That is entirely up to the full-time reporters engaged by the Newspaper. 
Yet, I refuse to put my pen down. Such treachery would amount to journalistic cowardice. Whichever way the decision in Parliament goes, it might lead to unprecedented chaos in the country. A total breakdown in the very trust and faith the ordinary man has in the three pillars of our democracy, namely, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary, would be incalculable. The resulting socio-political chaos will reign supreme. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court managed to restore some modicum of sanity in the overall system of governance. Whether Yahapalanaya has become another slogan or not, whether transparency and accountability are mere words which have failed to explode beyond the narrowing confines of their phonetic measures or not, people must realize that a day of reckoning has dawned. 
Political power being invested in one individual is simply not acceptable. Standing Orders were suspended.
A no-confidence motion submitted by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) when Parliament met today and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya decided to accept it and was put to a vote, a floor test and the Mahinda Rajapaksa and his unruly gang failed to secure the sufficient number of votes to survive the no-confidence motion. There were further crossovers from MR-cabal to the United National Party (UNP). Yet the mainstream medias persistence on validating the MR-led parliamentary group is confounding. Wasantha Senanayake who crossed over from the UNP yesterday decided to resign from his Ministerial post. He further said that his crossover was based on his misbelief that the MR-cabal had a majority in Parliament. Having realized that it was not so, he decided to resign from his Ministerial post. 
It is always natural that the losing side tries to spin their own stories. That political spinning machine of the MR-cabal is still engaged in that despicable job of turning a loss into a conspiracy of the West. But numbers and numbers alone will tell the story and its color, substance and veneer did not look favorable to the MR-Cabal. Who wants democracy and who wants anarchical rule is now evident beyond a shadow of doubt. The country is at crossroads. The Supreme Court spoke and it spoke in no unclear terms. Later, Parliament, the House of the People spoke. A defeated political cabal consisting of corrupt, dictatorial and conspiratorial men whose intentions and actions were more than evident could not secure a majority of MPs. A macabre conclusion of an ill-willed and ill-intentioned journey came to an astounding end. 
Politics has shown its both sides. The ugly countenance of politics was so vividly exhibited by the MR-cabal. The other side, the noble side of politics, a means for service of man and upholding the rule of law, was also predominant and pleasingly so. Democracy is not to be taken so easily. It is the most acceptable means of government; its magnificent character of majority rule with sublime sensitivity to minorities cannot be discarded by some politicians who have chosen to behave like common thugs and hooligans. 

But the rights and wrongs of the original decision, arguments for and against that decision by President Sirisena cannot be foreclosed. Having being in power for 20 long years, from 1994 to 2015

The Presidents original decision to name MR as Prime Minister is intrinsically wrong; its inherent quality is evil; it is anti-people. Such decrees do not substitute for the rule of the majority. Today Parliament, in no uncertain terms, showed that MR-cabal did not have their numbers. A joke of a Cabinet and Prime Minister so decreed by President remains such- a joke. A decision arrived with ulterior intentions and sinister objectives met its logical end today. Now the ball is back in the Presidents court. 
How would he decide now By the time you read this that decision may have already been made. But the rights and wrongs of the original decision, arguments for and against that decision by President Sirisena cannot be foreclosed. Having being in power for 20 long years, from 1994 to 2015, and then for the shortest time on our history for about two and half weeks, the MR-cabal has gone crazy; they simply cannot live without the luxuries of power and money. As per Anura Kumara Dissanayakes comments at the press conference of the JVP, a government and a Prime Minister were formed in moonlight at about 7:00 pm on October 26, 2018. His most logical and lucid explanation about the chronology of events, the way in which those events were conspiratorially executed was par excellence. How much this country does miss such brilliant speakers 
The Speaker of the House of Parliament and the Supreme Court held with the people. Of the three pillars on which a Democratic State rests, two sided with the people. The Judiciary and the Legislature chose to uphold the rule of law; both were adamantly allegiant to the service of the people. In this context the role played by the other pillar, the Executive, is bizarre and unequivocally wrong. Now the decision goes back to that pillar of the State.
The Executive has another chance to undo his wrong; he has another opportunity to show humility and greatness by accepting the overwhelming wish of Parliament. Go back to the status quo of October 25, 2018. Restore Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and ask him to form his new Cabinet in terms of the 19th Amendment. MR too has the same opportunity. He may have another chance to restore whatever dignity that is left of him. His walking away from the proceedings of Parliament when the no-confidence motion was submitted was a clear sign of him losing badly. A list of signatures containing 122 MPs was later submitted to the Speaker. Its Game, Set and Match. Match over, so MR, please resign from your post of Prime Minister so unconstitutionally conferred on you. 
Such greatness of humility and sensitive demeanor could still be assumed by those who conspired against the people of Sri Lanka. Anarchy can be averted; chaos can be forestalled and peace and harmony can be restored. Avarice for power may be too much for a mundane person to reject; yet greatness is not achieved by avaricious men and women; it is attained by those who refuse such allurements and renounce the obvious magic of such power. 
Mr. President, once again, the ball is back in your court.

MR still Prime Minister: Govt.
	
The government said that newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would continue in the post because yesterdays No-Confidence Motion (NCM) had been brought unconstitutionally.
Addressing a news briefing last night, Minister Susil Premajayantha said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya acted in a biased manner and that the motion had not even been included in the Hansard. The so-called no-confidence motion was taken up for a debate after calling for the suspension of the standing orders. Everything was done so fast. First, an MP handed over a motion to the Parliament General Secretary and the Speaker did not even look at that motion. He already had a pre-planned speech as well as a motion. All this time, the Mace was also not in its place, which is a sign the parliamentary sessions had been suspended, he said.
He said conducting a vote by voice cannot be accepted and therefore, reiterated that no proper No-Confidence Motion had been presented or passed in parliament yesterday.
The Minister reiterated that even if a No-Confidence Motion was passed, the speaker has no authority to appoint a new Prime Minister. Only the President can appoint a new Prime Minister, he said.
He said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would make a statement in parliament today, one that he was scheduled to make yesterday but couldnt. "Prime Minister Rajapaksa was not given the opportunity to speak in parliament yesterday. Therefore, he will make his statement today," he said.
Meanwhile, MP Dilan Perera said that they were still ready to show their majority in Parliament if an NCM was again brought against the Prime Minister. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa requested all 225 Parliamentarians to join hands with the Government and to go for a General Election.
In his speech at Parliament, the Premier requested the Opposition to join hands with them.
Join hands with us, don't think about the pension. Think about the election. We want an election, he said.
"Do you want an election or not Do you want it" PM asked the Opposition MPs.
"You can't pass resolutions by just shouting. The previous Government was failing. That is why President asked me to take over the Government, PM Rajapaksa said.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was appointed by the previous Government and his position should have to be neutral.
He also said the Speaker was biased towards the United National Party (UNP) and to his Western friends.
The President dissolved the Parliament to pave way for elections, which is the people's right. It was the UNP and JVP who were continuously delaying the elections, he said.
Though the Speaker did not accept it, we were the force in the Opposition. If the UNP remained in office for the remaining year, this country would have been destroyed. That is why the President made the decision, he said
"I am the Prime Minister. I have been the President as well. Premiership is not a big deal for me. I have been coming to Parliament since my childhood. The Speaker allows only Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to make the speech, not as Prime Minister, he said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rajapaksa said that there would be a price reduction on petrol from midnight today.

Petrol, diesel down by Rs.5
	
As announced by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament today, fuel prices including Petrol (Octane 92, 95), and Diesel (Auto, Super) were reduced by Rs.5 per litre with effect from midnight today, Labour, Foreign Employment & Petroleum Resources Minister Gamini Lokuge said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Labour Department, Minister Lokuge said the previous government had taken measures to put people under pressure by burdening them with heavy taxes.
Accordingly, Lanka Petrol (Octane 92) was reduced by Rs.5 per litre and the revised price is Rs.140 a litre, Lanka Petrol (Octane 95) Euro 4 was reduced by Rs.5 per litre and will be sold at Rs.164. A litre of Lanka Super Diesel four Star Euro 4 will be reduced by Rs.5 and the revised price is Rs.136. A litre of Lanka Auto Diesel will be sold at Rs.111 after the price reduction by Rs.5. However, the price of Lanka Kerosene will remain at Rs.70.
When President Maithripala Sirisena appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister, he made a statement to the people claiming he would raise the country's economy and provide facilities to them. The fuel price had been increased with the use of a fuel pricing formula. There would be no more fuel pricing formula in the future, he said.
"When Mr Rajapaksa assumed duties as the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister the fuel price was reduced. Then he had decided to reduce the fuel price from tonight," he said.
The people would be able to gain fuel price relief from all Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) filling stations. As the Ministry, we request the Indian Oil Company (IOC) to reduce the fuel price and to grant that relief to the country.
"The Prime Minister had instructed me to look on other consumer products which would grant reliefs and the Ministry is looking forward to giving more fuel price reductions in the future," he said.
"We are not misleading the people as the previous government did. We give these reliefs because we can manage the economy. Our government will not dance to the tune of foreign countries as what Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did. There will be gas price reductions in the future. During the last cabinet meeting, the cabinet Ministers had decided to re-introduce the distribution of school uniform material free of charge instead of issuing vouchers to students to purchase them in the market. Earlier the vouchers were introduced by former education minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam," he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

President rejects NCM brought against PM, Govt.
	
In a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday rejected the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) brought against his nominee for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Government.
In his letter, the President said proper procedures were not followed as was required by the Constitution and with regard to Standing Orders when submitting the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister to Parliament.
President Sirisena said the NCM was thus passed without adhering proper parliamentary procedures.
The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the Presidents opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament, the letter read. The opinion of the President cannot be questioned or tested. He is expected to evaluate the prevailing situation and decide on the person best suited for the country.
It also said that there was no requirement as part of parliamentary proceedings or on the part of the prime minister to show a majority in parliament.
The President said he had also noted an attempt by the Speaker to send the documents of the Motion which announced that the No-Confidence Motion brought against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Government had been passed in Parliament without a signature and had not been approved by Parliament.

## Title: Prophet Muhammed (Sal)s Sacred Birthday

Prophet Muhammed (Sal)s Sacred Birthday
	
With regard to the Holy Prophets Sacred Birthday, we as believers (Mumins) welcome this Sacred Day. Among Allahs creations Prophet Muhammed (Sal) is the supreme and perfect one. 
Nowadays due to lack of knowledge about Prophet Muhammed (Sal), certain misled sectarians oppose to praise Him and celebrate His Sacred Birthday by calling Him as an ordinary man. 
We can praise the Holy Prophet (Sal) and celebrate His Sacred Birthday in the light of the Holy Quran and Hadees (Tradition).
The Almighty Allah praises Prophet Muhammed (Sal) in the Holy Quran as follows: 
And recall when Allah got promise from all the prophets that the Book and the wisdom I bestow to you but then comes to you the Rasool Messenger Muhammed (Sal) who confirms what (the Book) you possess. You should definitely believe in Him and definitely should help Him. Then (Allah) said, do you agree and take this as firm agreement as binding on you They said, we agree. He (Allah) said, then be witnesses and I am also with you among the witnesses.(3:81)
It is clear that the Almighty Allah is the one who praised Muhammed (Sal) at first, according to this Divine Verse. 
(Beloved Muhammed (Sal)) surely, I (Allah) have given you in abundance.  (108:1)
Have We (Allah) not expanded Your bosom for You  (94:1)
And We sent not You, but a mercy for all worlds. (21:107)
Say - You, Only Allahs grace and only His mercy on it, therefore let them rejoice. That is better than all their wealth. (10:58)
Here the word mercy refers to Muhammed (Sal), according to the above two Divine Verses. Allah tells believers to rejoice it. The words rejoice it refers to celebrate
His Sacred Birthday, according to many interpreters of Al-Quran.
Prophet Muhammed (Sal) praised Him in the authentic Ahadis. Here are some of those: 
I was a Prophet when Adam (Alai) was between clay and water. (Authority:- Bukhari)
The Almighty Allah gives the blessings in my hand; I distribute those. (Authority:- Bukhari)
I was created in the light of Allah; All were created in my light. (Authority:- Dharami)
The Companions praised the Holy Prophet (Sal) in the authentic Ahadis as follows: 
When exalting Muhammed (Sal), Anas Ibnu Malik (Rali) says as follows: 
The Holy Prophet (Sal) was neither very tall nor very short. He was a reddish white man. He had twenty grey hairs on His beard and head.
(Authority:- Bukhari - Volume:4, Page:164)
When exalting Muhammed (Sal), Bara Ibnu Asif (Rali) says as follows: 
I have never seen a handsome person like Muhammed (Sal) in my life; His Sacred face looks like the moon. 
(Authority:- Bukhari - Volume:4, Page:165)
Presently the Mowlidhs (The time or place of birth) we recite are .similar to the above. Imaams known as our ancestors compiled Mowlidh Books to expose the love on Muhammed (Sal) and other saints. 
Celebrating the Holy Prophets Sacred Birthday by conducting Mowlidh and other religious events is not against the religion. It is a desirable act in our religion. 
Therefore, let us praise Muhammed (Sal) and celebrale His Sacred Birthday! 
(S.M. Zaheer Mowlana, Panadura.)

## Title: Remembering my brother Shibly Aziz

Remembering my brother Shibly Aziz
	
Say to my brethren when they saw me dead,
And wept for me lamenting in sadness:
Thinking ye that I was the corpse you were to bury
I swear by God, that dead one was not I
When I had formal shape, then was it my body
Served as my garment, I wore it for a while
A bird I am now; that body was my cage
But I have flown away leaving it behind as a token.
(The above is an adaptation of a famous poem written by Imam Ghazzali, one of Islams greatest Scholars, and found under his pillow, a few hours after his passing in 1111 AD.).
Three weeks before he passed away, Shibly, his wife Fathima, my wife Rezani and myself spent a relaxed Sunday evening watching the sun set over the sand mounds of the developing Port City, from one of Colombos highest points at Kingsbury Hotel. We spoke of many things: Shibly had been asked to suggest a replacement for himself in Sri Lankas Constitutional Council, a position he had held for 3 years and for which we tossed names randomly, deliberating on their credibility and ability to serve. We discussed the pros and cons of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Act (MMDA), in which he had played a pivotal role and to which he reasoned out the steps that had to be introduced slowly, in measured strides, allowing time for all stakeholders to understand and appreciate the changes. The next day he was to see an ophthalmologist regarding an issue with one of his eyes and sight. The issues of the eye and concerns connected to his heart were what lead to the next 3 weeks of him being hospitalised and ultimately to his passing away, which no one quite expected to be so soon.
The outpouring of grief by the many relatives, friends, professional colleagues, school friends, corporate colleagues, politicians, government and civil society underscored that Shiblys value transcended way beyond family and relatives to have been a vital source of life-changing moments in many peoples lives, the community and society at large. To us, he was a family man. He loved his family profoundly. He was a devoted husband, father, uncle, brother and admittedly, my late mothers favourite.
The eldest son of Senior Advocate late M.H.A. Aziz from Galle and Jiffriya Idroos of Matara, Shibly, had his primary education at St Thomas Prep School in Kollupitiya and secondary education at Royal College, Colombo at which he excelled in his studies. He is remembered for carrying away seven prestigious prizes at the College Prize Giving in 1962 - the Shakespeare, E W Pereira & 5 other coveted prizes. He completed his LLB degree passing out with Honours from the University of Peradeniya.
After a short spell at the unofficial Bar, he joined the Attorney Generals Dept as a Crown Counsel in 1968 and gradually rose up its ranks to be Senior State Counsel, DSG, Solicitor General and finally the Countrys Attorney General in 1994. He was the youngest member of the Bar to be conferred the title Presidents Counsel. He resigned from his position as Attorney General prematurely, on principle, not wanting to be unduly politicized and compromise his ethics and values. Integrity was everything to him.
Shibly married Fathima, the accomplished daughter of Late Dr. A R.M. Waffarn and Mrs. Sithy Waffarn. He enjoyed holidays with their two sons, Afdhel, an Internationally acclaimed Marketing Consultant who lives in California and Dr. Aadhil, a Consultant Physician, living in Melbourne, and their families.
He was the eldest of my siblings followed by my sister Minha, brother Imthiaz, myself and our youngest sister Ryhan (Babsy).
Shibly achieved much in his life, none of which he clamoured for, but which came his way. He accepted them with the humility and dedication that was characteristic of him. As Presidents Counsel, Attorney General of Sri Lanka, President of the Bar Association - the only lawyer to Head both the official and unofficial Bar, member of the Constitutional Council, President of the Ahadiya Schools Federation, Chairman, Civil Aviation Authority and so many other positions he held in the community and society at large, sat lightly on his shoulders.
Last year, Fathima and he were part of my family delegation to Lahore and Islamabad, Pakistan to be a part of my being conferred the highest civilian award, Tamgha e Khidmat by the Government of Pakistan for promoting friendship, trade, investments and community oriented projects between the two countries. We were given a convoy of luxury vehicles, but Shibly chose to travel in the van that my sons used and what fun they had!
That was Shibly  the essence of humble, simplicity, peaceful and unassuming, God fearing. As Attorney General, living in the Government allocated house on Paget Road, the police guards who had never seen him on one instance, stopped him at the gate to ask who he was when he drove in. In his characteristic manner he answered saying I have come to see AG Mahattaya.
The life he led was a model for all of us to emulate. Arrogance, false pride, greed, egoism and petty mindedness were traits he abhorred. Positions didnt bother him nor did recognition or fame.
Thousands paid their last respects to his remains, at his residence and at the funeral at the Jawatta Muslim Burial grounds. I have never seen such a massive crowd at a Janaza at Jawatta. Almost every person who condoled with me had something to say about how Shibly had touched their lives in one way or another - lending a helping hand, mentoring, intervening and assisting in family and financial disputes, giving a letter of recommendation, free legal advice and consultations and so forth.
I pray that my brother Shibly will be blessed with the highest place in Jannathul Firdause. Inna lillahi we Inna ilaihi rajioon - From Allah (God) do we come and to Him is our return.
To the righteous soul will be said:
O thou soul in complete rest and satisfaction!
Come back thou to thy Lord-well pleased thyself, an well pleasing unto Him!
Enter then thou among my Devotees
Yea, enter thou my Heaven.
Sura Fajr verses 27-30
(Holy Quran).

Royal Colombo Golf Club scouts for fresh talent
	
Nadiyah Akram - Founder, Limelight PR,Nimal Piyaratna - President, Royal Colombo Golf Club, Jehan De Saram - Head Golf Professional, Royal Colombo Golf Club,Shiran Fernando - Vice Captain, Royal Colombo Golf Club,Shanthi Bhagirathan - Managing Director, Capital Maharaja and Asiri Abhayaratne - Chief Executive Officer, Q&E Advertising (Pvt) Ltd
The Junior Clinic of the Royal Colombo Golf Club (RCGC) will host A Day of Discovery event to identify new golfing talent on 10 December 2018. With this program, RCGC hopes to recruit a fresh pool of budding young golfers to its existing junior clinic outreach program, which was initiated in 2011 to help the game thrive in Sri Lanka.
The target group for the talent scouting program is boys and girls aged 9 to 13 years. The program targets promising talent outside the RCGC membership. When it was first introduced in 2011, RCGC mandated that a structured, long term program was put in place to identify, train and create the future golf champions of Sri Lanka. Provisions were put in place for 20 students to receive free of charge access to training, equipment, practice facilities and access to the golf course via this program.
The timeline agreed upon was 10 years of training to create a national golf champion. Within five years, one of these students, Tania Minel Balasuriya, succeeded in becoming Sri Lanka National Ladies Golf Champion at just 15 years of age.
There is no question that this country harbors much talent, but we need to be proactive in seeking out and nurturing it, says Mr. Jehan De Saram, P.G.A. Head Golf Professional at the Royal Colombo Golf Club. As golfers, it is our responsibility to strengthen and develop the game in Sri Lanka, and endeavor to be a feature on the international stage.
Nimal Piyaratna - President, Royal Colombo Golf Club,Jehan De Saram - Head Golf Professional, Royal Colombo Golf Club, Shiran Fernando - Vice Captain, Royal Colombo Golf Club
Mr. De Saram also noted that for a country with so few golfers and limited access to opportunities in this arena, Sri Lanka has made a significant mark on golf in South Asia. Its noteworthy that many of our award-winning golfers dont fit the mould of the typical Colombo elitist that many golf enthusiasts may be perceived as, he said. This is why we started the junior clinic outreach program in the first place- to dispel this notion and create an opportunity for anyone to learn and benefit from the game. Through the generous support of the Royal Colombo Golf Club and its members, this initiative has helped to nurture the talents of many young golfers.
A Day of Discovery is powered by the generous support of MTV/MBC Channel Organisation linked to the Capital Maharaja Organization. To register to participate in the RCGC Day of Discovery, please send a WhatsApp message to 0775445153 by 5 December 2018. Early registrations are recommended in order to avoid disappointment.
