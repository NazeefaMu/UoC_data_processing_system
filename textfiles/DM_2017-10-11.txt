A & K Lit-Fest Progresses to Palacious Mt. Lovina
	
Revives Romance of Aponsuwa & King with Annasi & Kadalagotu
It was a hundred-rupee lottery with a guaranteed thousands of rewardswithin hours!
Ten score years and eleven ago a gallant military General Sir Thomas Maitland nicknamed King Tom sailed to Ceylon to assume duties as the British Governor. He built a grand country manor, an icon of command and authority, in the village of Galkissa on an outcrop overlooking the sea. A beautiful mixed blood member of a dance troupe that performed at the mansion, named Aponsuwa Lovina enticed King Tom leading to an A and K love affair. In 1813 the Kings health issues compelled him to sail to England and end his sixyear romance with Aponsuwa Lovina, Maitland, the righteous man, offered Lovina with a piece of land and named the bungalow Mt Lavinia. 
The legend of the 19th century has been revived in the 21st century by Our flyer, trainer, writer, award winning author and founder of Candle Aid Lanka, Capt Elmo Jayawardena, a man with no allegiance to anything political with his A&K iii [Annasi and Kadalagotu] on Saturday, 7, 2017 at the modern impeccable four-star venue where history and legend blended in the past. The amazing theme image, from whence a forbidden tryst began, a celebration of stories will unfold anew, of A and K III tells it all.
The Annasi and Kadalagotu Literary Festival, is a festival which conveys a message to literary enthusiasts in Sri Lanka. It is a mutually shared platform for those with a passion for literature to come together, search for new avenues in writing.
The media release said, This year, the third Annasi and Kadalagotu Literary Festival will be taking place on October 7 at the Mount Lavinia Hotel  and we promise something thats brighter, bolder, and better than ever before! Walk right in; tickets will be available at the entrance for just Rs. 100! The hundred rupee-ticket gives access to all the panels and discussions.
The panels ensured inspiring discussions spanning all three languages
	A and K, an attempt to bring together literary enthusiasts from every nook and corner of the country
A and K, an attempt to bring together literary enthusiasts from every nook and corner of the country, who seemed to share an interest in literature with the various panel discussions held, seems to have achieved just that. The three rooms in the Hotel held an assortment of segments which covered a variety of themes, and enthusiasts could decide on desired segment they want to be with or part to be. The panel deliberations also paid attention on diverse labels or types of local writers, like the Gratiaen winners talking prose, poetry and drama. 
The festival this year came alive with its pledge of promoting the Sri Lankan uniqueness through literature. Among the panellists incorporated from all walks of life included recognised elite of the literary field to the beginners, all who believes literature nourishes the soul and have made their first publication or with manuscript yet in the pipeline. The fiesta is an assortment of all, like a sachet of boiled gram, the kadala-gotta and a slice of pineapple, Annasi pettha, flavoured to suit passions of everyone through discussion on fiction both prose and poetry, and drama fit for the wide spectrum of excitement and literary entertainment. The panels ensured inspiring discussions spanning all three languages.
A workshop for children conducted by Prashani Rambukwella, the award winning author and specialist in child literature Created Fun for Young Ones at Empire Room, taking the kids on a magical journey.
The not so welcoming weather delayed my arrival by half an hour, missing the first part of Romancing the Pen moderated by Lasith Gunawardena with the participation of Malinda Serneviratne, Krishan Mahesan, Suresh Jayawickrema and Chandra Fernando, parallel to Howard Martenstyn speaking on how his book, A Whale of a Tale on Sri Lankas marine life which helped him further the cause of conservation in conversation with Keith Wijesuriya. Held in three different locations for obvious reasons, I missed a couple of interesting panels that I fancied.
Laughter the Best Medicine: How we dispense it was the next that drew a fair crowd with well known dramatists Indu Dharmasena with Nafeesha Amurdeen and moderated by Adrian Ferdinands. The creation of a so well written and acted, so perfectly pitched hilarious act in an imaginary stage by Indu and an actress who played the role of a journalist [the name resembling Frederica] interviewing a politician was most heart-warming, hilarious and inspiring. 
The authors were given an opportunity, a very generous one, to launch their books by merely purchasing 50 tickets for distribution as invitations for the launch; where can anyone do a book launch forRs. 5,000
Aman Ashraff moderated Drawing Stories; where islands well known picture story [chitra katha] artist like Jagath Kosmodera, Anura Srinath made their appearance also attracted those with a passion for the unique age-old art. They say, Pictures worth a thousand stories. The Evolution of Online Writing or Paperless Creativity by Nalaka Gunawardene led panel included professionals in the field namely, Dr Nadeesha Chandrasena, Dr. Bodhini Samaratunga and Pethum Punchiheva.
Separate sets of panels focused on The Story behind the Story with authors, Mahinda Masimbula, King Rutnam and Ameena Hussein, discussing the insights and motivations behind crafting their finest known creations in Sinhala Tamil and English respectivelyIn The Story Behind Story panels, Ameena Hussein was in conversation with Keith Wijesuriya, King Ratnam with Al Haseen and Mahinda Masimbula with Dananath Fernando with all three running parallel. I had little option but attend the posh suite of the late Governor, which the Hotel has now named Maitland Room for the authors story on Ameena Husseins novel The Moon in the Water, which the amiable Keith made it to be an educative and entertaining session.
Reliving the Past: Bringing History to Life; Virgin Authors: Doing it for the First Time commenced at the same venue and moderated by none other than the creator, originator and initiator of the concept himself, the down-to-earth; who, with an incredible passion and insight, the truly a man for all seasons, Capt. Elmo Jayawardena. The panel was very interesting, and it allowed space for discussion between the panelists and audience. Thus while the space between writers and readers reduced; they were given an opportunity to discuss views and beliefs with each other. Thoughts, ideas, and tales of people come in the form of literature through novels, short stories, drama or poetry. 
Beginning with Charulatha Abeysekara Thewarathanthri, winner of 2016 Gratiaen Prize for her novel Stories, and introducing her as a structural engineer, Mathematics teacher and daughter of Tissa Abeysekara, he invited her to brief on what prompted her to write the novel, Stories. The next to address the audience was veteran journalist Trevon Devotta on his new experience with an extensively researched manuscript of fictionalized narration of Japanese attack on Colombo and Trinco in 1942, which was followed by another Gratiaen winner [for Mithils Secret in 2009] Prashani Rambukkwella, a writing coach and Communications Consultant. Next, a medical specialist Dr. Gamini Goonetillaka, a surgeon who wrote a book incorporating his invaluable experiences at the theatre . Finally, Asiff Hussein with an inspiring and timely idea on the success story of inter-racial marriages; the true story of his own parents who came from two conservative Muslim and Sinhala Buddhist families.
The A and K Bookshop and Vijitha Yapa stalls displayed a good selection of texts on a wide range of subjects. The fest is important as often, readers usually get an opportunity to talk with a writer only through the writers work; here an occasion was created to speak with writers. They were able to meet many writers and speak with them.
The Lit Fest gathered and unified people with common interest in literature who always will remain Annasi and Kadalagotu at heart though the writer was somewhat disappointed that there wasnt the usual annasi and kadalagotu along with varieties of pickle [achcharu], at the entrance unlike on the previous occasions. It is quite understandable - the glamorous star class ambience with its own traditions would not. But, Captain Elmo, the man who represents Sri Lankanness, as Dr. Dayan Jayatillake once wrote, could have persuaded, Chef Publis, father of truly Sri Lankan cookery for a little magic of mouth-watering treats of Kadagotu, a nouvelle cuisine to match the literary novellas of the day. 
Capt. Jayawardena expressed his gratitude to a dedicated team led by Keith Wijesuriya for their unstinting co-operation, untiring effort andhard work.
What a treat for hundred rupees!

A voluptuous one visited a sexually transmitted disease clinic at a general hospital in the periphery about a fortnight ago.

The doctor to whom the young girl was referred to, invited her to take the seat opposite him and asked her to explain the symptoms of the disease.
The young one who cringed and squirmed took a long time to stammer out the details the doctor wanted to know.
Finding that she had contracted a serious venereal disease, the doctor questioned her about her sex life. The girl convinced of the gravity of her disease gradually overcame her shyness and came out with the names of all her sex contacts who included well known cinema and tele-actors and leading businessmen.
On being asked whether there were well-known politicians as well among her sex contacts, she had come out with the name of a senior purohita from a main political party.
According to the details revealed by the young one, the politician in question hailing from a distant part of the country is a virtual bachelor and his family too is closely connected to politics.

CERT|CC cautions Viber, WhatsApp, IMO users
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT|CC) said yesterday it had received several complaints from mobile phone users claiming that their phone numbers had used to create fake smartphone messaging applications.
CERT|CC Chief Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta told Daily Mirror mobile users have received calls from people requesting to send them verification codes for applications such as Viber, WhatsApp and imo.
The people who create these fake accounts enter the phone numbers of other mobile users and later call them asking them for verification codes that have been inadvertently sent to them.
Users should be vigilant when receiving calls requesting verification codes for Viber, WhatsApp and imo. Most of the callers politely tell users that they had entered the users mobile numbers accidentally and as such were unable to receive the verification codes, Mr. Chandragupta said.
He said that these fake accounts were used for many reasons and CERT|CC ask mobile uses to remain cautious when receiving requests for Viber, WhatsApp and imo account verification codes.
CERT|CC also advised mobile phone users to create fresh Viber, WhatsApp and imo accounts and deactivate the fake accounts by installing a fresh copy of the application on their smartphones with new verification codes.
Mr. Chandragupta also said they had received more than 2,000 complaints about fake Facebook accounts and 80 per cent of them were connected to uploaded fake profile pictures. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

One of his faithful political acolytes is going round the country chanting the theme slogan of the campaign. However, the high authority has already come to know that the member is only the mouthpiece of the ousted one and the campaign is being directed personally against him.
There is a strong possibility of another nail into the political coffin of the ousted one being driven shortly as a reaction to his campaign, they say.

The cabinet meeting held yesterday became very tense owing to a clash that erupted between the Minister of Highways and Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella and the Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera.

The hullabaloo triggered by the Guinness record bid- sari-pota drama is still making echoes in the hill country. Meanwhile, a Blue party politico recently raised to purohita status in the provincial body is said to be busy planning the ouster of the Chief Purohita blamed for the fiasco to fulfil his own ambition.

The ambitious purohita has already made an appeal to Number One that he be appointed the provincial chief in place of the incumbent now under siege. A sizable section in the provincial body is backing him, they say.
On hearing about underhand moves aimed at his ouster, the provincial chief had reportedly gone to Sri Dalada Maligawa carrying a tray of flowers one evening and spent a long time in silent prayer inside the inner sanctum. According to informed sources, the beleaguered chief had prayed to deities after offering flowers to Sri Dalada to protect his high office from those planning to grab it.

Governments not bound by UN experts advice: Ministry
	
Governments are not bound by the advice or recommendations of UN Special Rapporteurs, but can avail of the expert knowledge and experience of Special Rapporteurs who are available to Governments as a resource, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Wednesday.
Issuing a statement, the Ministry said some media reports connected to the visit of UN Expert on Transitional Justice Pablo de Greiff, had given erroneous and misleading information.
Advice and expertise of UN Experts can be obtained by countries in a manner that would benefit institutional capacity building, policy formulation, and policy reform and training needs as a Government may consider necessary, it said. 
At the invitation of Sri Lanka, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence Pablo de Greiff arrived in the country on Tuesday.
The Ministry said successive Governments in Sri Lanka have been inviting such Special Rapporteurs to the country to obtain their views and expert advice on specific thematic areas.
It said Mr. de Greiff is an Independent Expert in a specific subject area and Special Rapporteurs are mandated to report and advise Governments on human rights from a thematic or country-specific approach.
It said the Special Rapporteur follows a victim-centred approach and integrates a gender perspective. The victim-centred approach means all victims of a situation of conflict and not one group or one community, it said.
As required of Special Rapporteurs, he will present a Report on his visit to the Human Rights Council, in September 2018.
The statement said it was for the Government of Sri Lanka to decide whether there is anything that the Government considers beneficial to the people of Sri Lanka in his recommendations and whether the Government wishes to draw on his knowledge, expertise and advice and consult him further in any manner, once Mr. de Greiff presents his Report.

Number One in yahapalanaya chaired a Blue party locked-door meeting held in a hotel in the South recently. Even security guards were not allowed access to it.

At this meeting some party seniors got a rude shock when the Number One angrily reacted when they proposed fresh peace moves aimed at uniting the two warring factions, they say.
The Big Boss had his gloves off when he also took on the rebels who had been threatening to quit yahapalanaya. Using an unusually harsh tone, the Boss had challenged them to quit if they wanted to and taste what was to come.
Number One had later called several seniors personally and warned them to mind their behavior. He had also expressed his displeasure about the conduct of a Blue party stalwart from Wayamba who had been among the few vociferously critical about yahapalanaya in the recent past. 
Following this meeting, the dissidents have confined their activity to the backstage, they say.

## Title: HIDDEN AGENDA REVEALED IN PRE-FABRICATED HOUSE DEAL
## Section: Expose

HIDDEN AGENDA REVEALED IN PRE-FABRICATED HOUSE DEAL
	

Speculation is rife that there is a hidden agenda behind the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministrys proposed plan to award the much debated contract to a French company to install pre-fabricated houses. There is concern that these houses are to be installed at a high cost using low quality pre-fabricated material to resettle conflict affected families in the north and east. 
Questions have been raised as to why the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry is so interested in providing families with pre-fabricated houses, which have poor ventilation, rather than opting for low cost brick and mortar houses. According to the preliminary findings of a study done on model houses by Civil Engineer and Chartered Structural Engineer Prof. Priyan Dias, Civil Engineer and Chartered Engineer Dr. Rangika Halwatura and Chartered Architect Varuna de Silva of the University of Moratuwa, they came to a common conclusion that pre-fabricated houses will not have proper ventilation as there are no grills between the roofs, the doors and windows. The report states that these houses are poorly designed for hot climates as they dont allow hot air to escape. The report also states that such a design suits a cold climate or air conditioned rooms in a tropical climate. 
In 2015, the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry called for bids from interested parties to construct houses in the north and east. More than 35 bidders forwarded quotations, but due to huge bid bonds the Government was demanding only two parties were able to offer the said bonds. They were ArcelorMittal from France and EPI-OCPL Consortium, an Indian joint venture. 
Sources further stated as to how the former Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry Secretary did all the paperwork to grant the contract to the French company leaving no stone unturned in its attempts to get all other parties, that initially bid for the tender, to withdraw their applications.
 Bids submitted
Initially tenders were called to construct 65, 000 houses for the war-affected families in the north and east where 35 parties submitted bids. For the 65, 000 houses, the requested bid bond was Rs.650 million. As such a huge bid bond was requested from the bidders, other than two parties, the rest withdrew their applications. Later, once the number of housing units was reduced to 6, 000, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran requested the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry to call for fresh bids with a lower bid bond. This was because there were so many interested parties wishing to send their bids for lower cost brick and mortar houses, but it was to no avail. But, the ministry still wants to go ahead with ArcelorMittal as its local logistic agent. It is alleged that this agent is a close associate of the Minister. The second company EPI-OCPL Consortium, which had submitted a lower price compared to ArcelorMittal, too had to withdraw its bid for reasons best known to ministry officials. A senior official of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry claimed that this company failed to submit the necessary financial facilities. 
High pressure
According to realiable sources, the local partner of the rejected Indian joint venture is said to have connections with Minister Daya Gamage. However, due to the high pressure mounted on them, the Indian joint venture had to withdraw from the project. Knowing how rich Minister Gamages family is, no one accepts the Ministrys version of the story. It was the Cabinet Economic Committee, chaired by Minister of Special Assignments Sarath Amunugama, the then Defence Secretary, Resettlement Minister D.M. Swaminathan and Advisor to the Prime Minister R. Paskaralingam who recommended 6, 000 pre-fabricated houses in 2016 from the initial plan of 65, 000 houses, sources who wished to remain anonymous said. 
When contacted Minister Daya Gamage to find out why the Indian joint venture withdrew its application, the Minister refused to comment, but said that the company wasnt owned by him, but was owned by a family member. 
When asked why the ministry failed to call for tenders after the cabinet economic committee decided to bring down the number of houses to 6, 000 the sources alleged that the decision was taken to ensure personal gains for selected politicians. 
Expert group
Meanwhile a group comprising multi disciplinary individuals from Jaffna and Colombo, possessing expert knowledge in engineering, architecture, planning, community housing, financing, economics, law, community organization and project management had submitted an alternative proposal to the proposed pre-fabricated housing project to Minister Malik Samarawickrema on May 19, 2015. Minister Samarawickrema wanted them to re-submit the proposal with a formal financing proposal and a detailed implementation modality. 
As requested, we submitted a formal financing proposal together with report to which Minister Samarawickrema and Charitha Ratwatte had given their recommendations. However later, at another cabinet appointed committee, it had been decided to go for the 6, 000 pre-fabricated houses disregarding our proposals for unknown reasons, Niyanthini Kadirgarmar a Researcher in the north, told the . 
According to Kadirgarmar, the key drawbacks of the pre-fabricated houses are poor ventilation, risk of steel corrosion despite the coating provided, insufficient roof support, inadequate foundation and the absence of a hearth and chimney amongst the many other shortcomings. 
Brick houses with tiled roofs and grills on doors and windows allow the hot air to escape, but the steel houses dont have grills, which models have been designed for cold climates. We understand that the Government has planned to obtain a foreign loan to pay off the money to the contractor. If the country is facing an economic crisis as claimed by the Finance Ministry, due to the foreign debt the country has obtained, the economic crisis would deepen if another foreign loan is obtained. Our proposal included a domestic financing option where a formal term sheet from a leading local investment Bank has been secured. This demonstrates that raising domestic resources through a Rupee bond is more beneficial and indeed a viable option. Why does the Government opt for imported prefab houses, when brick houses, built locally, will generate employment, boost local enterprises and benefit the economy From what the Government is going to spend on the 6, 000 steel houses, more than 15, 000 houses can be constructed. The Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry built 10, 000 houses in the north and the east last year at a cost of Rs.850, 000 per house. What is the reason for them to spend Rs.650, 000 extra for a house which is not durable which the potential recipients would not like, but will accept as they dont have any other option, Kadirgarmar queried. 
Kadirgarmar further said that she had the opportunity to visit the two model houses on display, one which was furnished and the other not. Although Government claims that a fully furnished steel house would cost Rs.2.1 million and a non furnished house Rs.1.5 million, the furnished house consists of plastic furniture. The furniture and the other equipment provided in furnished houses will not cost more than Rs.600, 000 as the quality of furniture seems to be inferior, Kadirgarmar claimed. 
Close confidant
Meanwhile allegations have been leveled against the decision to offer the contract to a single multinational company, ArcelorMittal of France. The contract was offered to this company solely because the Chairman of their local agent, who also handles the logistic part of the project, is said to be a close confidant of not only Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminadan, but also many high-profile ministers and MPs in the good governance administration. 
Ravindra Buddhadasa Wettasinghe alias Ravi Wettasinghe is alleged to have links with few powerful ministers in the Government. With a questionable past record, Wettasinghe has three cases against him in courts including an indictment relating to criminal breach of trust and another custom related case. 
With such a controversial track record, some officials of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry are worried that the quality of the planned 6,000 steel houses would be substandard, sources added. 
Court documents
The logistic company in question, that handles the shipping, clearing of cargo , transport, recruitment for the project, supply of local items, selecting sub contractors and overall supervision of the pre-fabricated housing project, is Kumarka Engineering and Management (Pvt) Limited (Company registration number PV 109103). This newspaper is in possession of the Company Registrar document attested by the Additional Company Registrar which was obtained on May 26, 2017, which states that the address of the company and the names of the Board of Directors mentioned in the companys annual reports are inaccurate. 
The is also in possession of court documents to prove that Ravi Wettasinghe was allegedly absconding and living abroad during the former regime and returned to the country only after the present Government assumed power. 
During the previous UNP regime, from 2001 to 2004, Wettasinghe was in charge of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) workshops in Werahera, Keppettipola and Kahagolla. There are pending court cases against him for not returning 143 SLTB buses worth of Rs. 75 million and for the non-payment of EPF and ETF (case no: 5647/ 05) for the workers at these workshops. The case against Wettasinghe for not returning 143 buses to the state (HC 3604/2007) is befor the Colombo High Court and the case relating to defrauding EPF and ETF payments was heard in the Bandarawela Magistrate court. These cases were also heard in his absence. The court had earlier issued warrants for his arrest , sources said. 
Warrant withdrawn
According to these sources, Wettasinghe has also allegedly defrauded the Sri Lanka Customs to the tune of Rs.176 million by exporting scrapped brass, which is a restricted item, declaring the consignment as plastic hangers. 
At one of the above cases, Wettasinghes attorney told courts that his client was willing to return to Sri Lanka and appear in courts. The attorney had requested the court to withdraw the warrant issued against him. Although the warrant against him was withdrawn by the High Court, Wettasinghe didnt appear before court. When he was trying to slip away from the country, a few days before he was requested to be present in court, he was arrested at the airport on the arrest warrant issued in case number 5647/05 and was produced in Bandarawela MC. Later the High Court refused to grant bail to Wettasinghe. Although alleged attempts were made to mislead the court claiming that he is suffering from a serious sickness, the Chief Judicial Medical Officer of Colombo Dr. Ajith Tennakoon, on April 28, 2015, informed the courts that the accused had no such a serious sickness and there is no urgency to give him immediate medication. Later, he was granted bail under several conditions among which one was to report to the CID on the last Sunday of every month, sources added. 
Meanwhile it is learned that Wettasinghe had stayed away from the Customs inquiry as well, claiming he was unwell. 
Since scrap brass is a restricted item, if there is a need to export such items, there is a requirement to possess an export control license and also pay a Cess Duty equal to 50% of the value of consignment to the customs. In order to export scrap brass, Wettasinghe, who was in Singapore evading arrest during the previous regime, allegedly got his kith and kin in Sri Lanka to get a reputed logistic company to export the consignment in the guise of plastic hangers to Singapore. By the time, the customs nabbed the racket, eight containers had already been sent to Singapore. The two containers were to be shipped to Bahrain and Hong Kong. Although the consignment had been declared in Sri Lanka as plastic hangers, on the shipping documents being checked in Singapore it was revealed that the contents were scrap brass. After the calculation was made as to how much Wettasinghe had defrauded the customs, including Cess duty, the figure came to Rs.176 million.Wettasinghe was ordered to pay by the inquiring team. The suspect had then gone to Court of Appeal and a directive had been obtained to inquire the case once again. The Customs officials are ready and possess all the necessary documents, sources claimed. 
There are many instances where items not related to stipulated projects are brought to the country to evade paying customs duty. Considering how the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry has disregarded TNAs call to re-tender the 6, 000 housing project and even the civil societies viable proposals given to the Government, which were accepted by Minister Malik Samarawickrema, it is doubtful whether the ministry wants to help out the local logistic company which is now in the midst of a financial crisis over his alleged questionable conduct, sources alleged. 
When contacted, Ravi Wettasinghe promised to name a convenient time and a place to meet this reporter, but was not reachable after that. When this writer attempted to contact Wettasinghe last week, one of his officials said that he was out of the country.

Minister refutes allegations
However we met the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister D.M. Swaminathan at his Ministry a few weeks ago, he refuted the allegations leveled. We are going to sign the contract with the French Company which would be an environmental friendly project. We can save the environment as there is no necessity to purchase sand and timber to build these houses. We have followed the Government procurement guidelines and selected the best company in the world. We arent going to offer the contract to a mushroom company. We didnt want to go for 65, 000 houses given the countrys financial situation. These houses would have a well fitted pantry, toilets with water service, Swaminathan said. 
When asked as to why his ministry failed to re-tender after it was decided to construct 6, 000 houses as there are more parties willing to submit bids, Swaminathan said that they are going ahead with the company they selected initially as the Cabinet approval has already been given to go ahead with the selected party.
When asked how sure he is with the local agent of ArcelorMittal who has a bad track record when dealing with several parties, including Government institutions, Swaminathan said there is no hidden agenda involved with regard to this project. 
We called for tenders through the local and foreign media and the Sri Lankan Missions abroad and received quotations from 35 interested parties out of which 15 were selected based on their financial capacity. Thirteen parties paid the non refundable deposit and eight companies submitted their proposals. After evaluating the eight companies the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee and Project Committee selected two companies who could submit acceptable bid securities fulfilling the criteria as set out in the proposal request document. Out of these two, only ArcelorMittal was able to submit confirmed comprehensive finance facility to which all plans are now set to offer the contract to the successful bidder, Swaminathan said. However the Minister wasnt pleased when asked what his friendship with Wettasinghe was. It is alleged that Wettasinghe is in the Ministers Office most of the time. I dont know who this Wettasinghe is. He may have come to my office for official work, but he has not come everyday to meet me personally, the Minister said.

Malik, Kabir say they discussed Rs. 15 bn fund requirement at breakfast meeting
	
Minister of Public Enterprises development Kabir Hashim and Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama yesterday testifying before the commission said that they attended the breakfast meeting held on February 26, 2015 (before the controversial auction) and discussed about an immediate Rs. 15 billion fund requirement for Road Development projects.
At the onset of the yesterdays proceedings, it was revealed that there was a list of 20 witnesses submitted to the Commission by the Officials of Attorney Generals Department attached to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry in expectation of obtaining testimonies pertaining to the bond inquiry.
However, considering the time constraints, the Commission had decided to summon three witnesses out of that. They were EPF former dealer Saman Kumara, Aloyius personal Assistant Steve Samuel and Mr. Nihal Fonseka (Monetary Board member).
It was also stated that the decision to summon Minister of Public Enterprises development Kabir Hashim and Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama had been taken by the Commission itself not the officials of the Attorney Generals Department.
Both of the ministers yesterday appeared before the Commission and testified with regard to a breakfast meeting said to have been held on February 26, 2015 (before the controversial bond auction) at the CBSL.
Earlier, it transpired during the proceedings that a Rs. 75 billion fund requirement for the Road Development projects had been discussed at this meeting.
Former Governor Arjuna Mahendrans lawyer had also submitted a letter to the Commission which was given by the Finance Ministry to the Governor confirming about holding of such meeting.
However, this letter was sent to the Governor by then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake much later in June 2016 when Mr. Mahendran was testifying before the Hadunnetti COPE.
Minister Malik Samarawickrama first testified before the Commission yesterday and Justice K.T. Chitrasiri and Commissioner retired Deputy Auditor General K. Velupillai Kandasami questioned the witness.
Minister Malik Samarawickrama
Justice Chitrasiri: Did you attend the February 26, 2015
Witness Minister Malik Samarawickrama: Yes
Justice Kandasami: In what capacity did you attended that meeting
Witness Minister Malik Samarawickrama: As a senior Advisor to the Prime Minister
Justice Chitrasiri: Who were the members that participated in that meeting
W: Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Minister Kabir Hashim, former Governor Arjuna Mahendran, RDA officials, Treasury officials and CBSL officials
J: What was the purpose for holding such a meeting
The witness said that the Prime Minister had suggested to the then Finance Minister and the Government that the on going Road Development projects had been stopped due to unpaid bills by the previous regime. And therefore he came to discuss about the fund requirement to pay those bills.
J: What was the fund requirement
Witness said that there was a Rs. 18 billion fund requirement discussed. However at that time the RDA had Rs. 3 billion in hand and therefore, there was an immediate Rs. 15 billion fund requirement to continue the Road Development projects.
J: was it discussed how to raise funds in the meeting
W: No. There was no discussion as to how to raise funds but discussed about the fund requirement.
J: Did that meeting discuss anything about the T-bond auction, which was scheduled to be held on the following day (February 27)
W: None. There was no discussion at all.
J: Did you talk with former Governor Arjuna Mahendran on the telephone after the meeting on February 26 or on February 27
W: As far as I recollect, no.
J: What is your position in the United National Party (UNP) in 2015 and 2016
W: Chairman of UNP
J: During that period can you say that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Aloysius (father), Freelanka Group or any immediate member to them had made a fund contribution to UNP
W: As far as I know, no. Not to the party or even to me.
Then the Commission asked counsel of the Attorney Generals Department whether they have any questions to ask. However, Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera said that they have no question to ask from Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
Minister of Public Enterprises development Kabir Hashim
Justice Chitrasiri: Did you attend the February 26, 2015
Witness Minister Kabir Hashim: Yes
J: In what capacity
Witness Kabir Hashim: As the Minister of Highways
Who were the other members that attended this meeting
W: Senior advisor to the Prime Minister Malik Samarawickrama, former Governor Arjuna Mahendran, RDA officials, CBSL officials and Treasury officials were there.
J: What was the purpose of that meeting
According to the witness the Road Development projects had been stopped at that time due to unpaid bills by the previous regime.
The witness said therefore the RDA wanted funds to recommence those halted projects for unpaid bills. Mr. Hashim said that RDA had informed the Treasury Secretary about these unpaid bills on February 16, 2015.
When asked by the Commission, the witness said that he can provide the letters sent by the RDA if necessary to the Commission.
Mr. Hashim said there was an urgent fund requirement of Rs. 18 billion for the Road Development projects. He said there was an allocation of Rs. 3 billion in the RDA at that time and thereby needed an immediate fund requirement of Rs. 15 billion.
The witness also explained that this requirement of funds for the RDA had been discussed at the Cabinet Sub Committee meeting held on February 24, 2015 as well.
He said then they forwarded this fund requirement at the breakfast meeting held on February 26, 2015.
At this moment Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked You are sure about this fund requirement of Rs. 18 billion, right
Witness said that initially there was a discussion about a Rs. 18 billion requirement and after the allocations of the RDA (Rs. 3 billion) there was an immediate Rs. 15 billion needed for the recommencement of the Road Development projects. In the meeting we submitted our side to the officials over the urgent fund requirement and CBSL officials and then Finance Minister said that they will support us.
When questioned by the Commission, the witness said that RDA received Rs. 8.3 billion in the beginning of the Month of March from the Treasury. He said thereafter they requested the Treasury for the balance 10 billion on March 16, 2015.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: In the middle of March you still wanted that Rs. 18 billion. Which means that Rs. 18 billion February fund requirement remained unchanged even for the month of March
Witnesss answer was affirmative.
Justice Chitrasiri: Did that meeting discuss anything about the T-bond auction, which was scheduled to be held following day (February 27)
W: No
J: Did you speak to former Governor Arjuna Mahendran on telephone on February 26 or 27 after the meeting
W: To the best of my knowledge I dont think so.
J: What is your position in United National Party (UNP) in 2015 and 2016
W: General Secretary
J: During that period can you say that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Aloysius (father), Freelanka Group or any immediate member to them had made a fund contribution to UNP
W: Best my recollection, no.
At this point again the Commission asked the counsel of the Attorney Generals Department whether they have any questions to ask. However, Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera said again that they have no questions to ask from Minister Kabir Hashim as well.
However, Counsel Arulpragasam who was appearing on behalf of PTL questioned Minister Kabir Hashim regarding the National Savings Bank (NSB).
It was revealed that the state bank institutions came under the purview of the Minister since September 2015 after the General Election.
Counsel Arunpragasam: During your period, did NSB incur a loss
W: I think they havent had a loss
Counsel: Was that a substantial profit
W: Yes. Because dividends were at a record level
Counsel: Were you aware that the Treasury Operation Department at NSB gained profits during this period
W: I monitored it overall. And overall there was a profits.
Counsel: Do you know NSB dealer Naveen Anuradha
W: Not personally
Counsel: Who appointed him
W: The NSB Chairman. The bank had asked the CBSL to send an official to NSB and thereby he got appointed.
Counsel: Would you say Naveen Anuradha was a good performer
W: I cant say about it specifically. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

National Audit Bill cleared with some alterations
	
The Cabinet yesterday cleared the National Audit Bill with some alterations to the original draft, it is learnt.
The enactment of the National Audi Bill is an election promise made by the government to be implemented during the 100 day programme of its rule in 2015. However, it remained shelved due to differences of opinion among various stakeholders.
A Cabinet committee was appointed later to sort out grey areas in the original draft. The amended version was referred to the Cabinet yesterday for approval. The Cabinet endorsed the Bill. It will now be referred to the Legal Draftsmans Department.
Initially, it had been proposed to give authority to the Auditor General to take action against officials found guilty of any wrongdoing outlined in the proposed legislation. According to the amended version, the Auditor General has no such authority. Instead, any such action has to be referred to the Ministry Secretary concerned for action.
In the event of the Ministry Secretary concerned is found guilty of any wrongdoing, it should be referred to the Presidential Secretary for action. (Kelum Bandara)

Police violates Intl Mob Control Laws: Protesters
	
Anti-SAITM protesters today condemned the police attack and said they would complain to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) about the alleged violation of International Mob Control Laws.
Displaying photographs of some police officers armed with iron bars standing on the sidelines of the protest, Inter University Student Federation (IUSF) Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said the police were targeting the heads of the protesters.
He asked Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara as to who had given the police the authority to attack the protesters with iron bars instead of using wooden batons.
The attack was meant to hurt the students and not to disperse them. The STF chased the protesters along Marine Drive towards the railway tracks, Mr. Weerasekera said.
He said the police had recorded statements from the injured students who were warded at the National Hospital without considering their health conditions.
Mr. Weerasekara accused the unity government of following in the footsteps of the previous regime and attempting to suppress the rights of students.
Meanwhile, SAITM Virodhi Jana Pawura member Mahinda Jayasinghe said the attack was one of the most shameful seen in recent history and would seek legal assistance with regard to the violent behaviour of the police.
Responding to the allegations, Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told Daily Mirror that anyone could complain to the SLHRC or any other relevant institutions if they suspected the police had violated the countrys laws when dispersing the protesters.
Police have to follow the Criminal Procedure Code and duty bound to maintain law and order. Protesters violated the court order and the police had to disperse them. Before talking of international mob control laws, protesters should be aware of the countrys general law, he said.
SP Gunasekera said the peoples right to assemble peacefully and the freedom of speech have been guaranteed by the Constitution and the same Constitution says that any act which causes a public nuisance is an offence.
It was also learnt that Duminda Nagamuwa who was injured during the protest was still at the National Hospital.
It had also been revealed that the Inter Union Student Federation (IUSF) Convener Lahiru Weerasekara attended the protest while he is on bail under strict conditions in a case where he was alleged to have broken into the Health Ministry and damaged public property and that his bail would be canceled if found guilty of having caused public inconvenience.

SL pops up in foreign news reports on Airbus corruption scandal
	
References have also been made to Sri Lanka in foreign media reports on the massive corruption scandal rocking the worlds second largest aircraft manufacturer, Airbus. Spiegel Online,one of the most widely read English language news websites in Germany, says suspicious cases have begun popping up around the world, including in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, China, Tunisia, Kazakhstan and Mali.
AirbusCEO Tom Enders last week warned that the aircraft manufacturer could face significant penalties relating to ongoing corruption probes including one into the sale of fighter jets to Austria. We are currently being investigated for alleged breaches of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, Enders wrote in a letter to employees.
According to AFP, anAirbusbusiness unit in Paris reportedly built a network of shell companies linked to London-based Vector Aerospace, formerly the groups aircraft maintenance subsidiary.
Its system allowed the group to make bribes to decision-makers in Austria while Vienna was considering its purchase of Eurofighter military jets, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported Friday, culminating in a 15-aircraft deal worth about 1.7 billion euros (US $2 billion).
Inquiries have also been opened in France and Britain, on suspicion of corruption in Airbuss UK-based civil aviation arm.
Sri Lankan government is currently in a multi-million dollar dispute with Airbus over the purchase of four Airbus A 350-900 aircraft ordered during the previous Rajapaksa regime.
National carrier SriLankan Airlines has already paid pre-delivery payments for these aircraft running into US dollar millions but the airlines director board in November 2016 decided to stop making these payments.
The delivery dates of the aircraft were to commence from the second quarter of 2020 with the last aircraft being delivered on the first quarter of 2021.
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) detectives are now probing how this purchase deal under the previous Government came about.
In addition to the purchase of four Airbus A 350-900, SriLankan Airlines also obtained on lease four more. The lease has now been terminated with a controversial payment of US$ 146.5 million.

State Banks Meeting, Ravi coming to Penthouse happened in the same month'
	
Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera yesterday pointing out that the two events where Minister Ravi Karunanayake held the state banks meeting asking them to bid at a lower rate and the Ministers family coming to reside at a Penthouse apartment, had happened in the same month, suggested that Arjun Aloysius had fixed the March 29 and 31 auctions with the assistance of the former Finance Minister.
Continuing the cross-examination of former Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke yesterday initiated the proceedings stating that 70% of the bonds issued at the controversial bond issue (Rs. 10.05 billion) on February 27, 2015 had ultimately ended up with state institutions (EPF, SLIC and UGC Provident Fund) by September 2015 after the trading of those bonds in the secondary market.
During further cross-examination by DSG Gunatilleke it was revealed that there was an on sight examination carried out by the CBSL officials against Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) in November 2015.
In this examination the CBSL Public Debt Department (PDD) officials had found a series of violations on PTLs part. Based on that examination the Officials had sent a letter to PTL seeking explanation for those violations.
DSG Gunatilleke also questioned the witness based on the response given by PTL to the CBSL in during the examination. The DSG said that PTL had acknowledged some violations in the Lanka Settle System.
However, the witness gave his explanation on the violations that came out with regard to the LSS and said he cannot comment about it without referring to more data.
He said that there were several Primary Dealers at that time facing the same allegations similar to what PTL was facing in connection with the LSS.
There were malpractices going on in the market. I dont deny that. But we were aware about them and discussed them at the Monetary Board meetings. That is why there was a direction that came later asking all primary dealers to adhere to LSS requirements, Mahendran said.
DSG Gunatilleke: Did this report about the on sight examination come to the Monetary Board
W: Im not sure about it because if so I would have recused myself from that Monetary Board meeting.
DSG: At your time PTL was not suspended, right
W: Not suspended
The witness was of the view that PTL was facing allegations similar to what other primary dealers had at that time. According to him the Monetary Board had prioritized an issue relating to a Primary Dealer called Entrust at that time, where the CBSL had to pay over Rs. 2 billion to that Primary Dealer.

However, DSG Gunatilleke said that PTL had been suspended from its activities in the latter part of 2016 and later in July 2017 the CBSL suspended its Primary Dealer license.
DSG Gunatilleke was of the view that the current Monetary Board had also paid concern to the on sight examination report of PDD regarding PTL when deciding on the activities of PTL.
But the witness said that he had not given preference to PTL at that time as the Monetary Board, where he was the Chairman, had prioritized other concerns (the Entrust issue).
DSG Gunatilleke thereafter questioned the witness on the EPF transactions with regard to the month of November 2015.
The DSG said that capital gains of PTL in the month of November were amounting to Rs. 2.606 billion.
DSG Gunatilleke: It was a very large amount for a new Primary Dealer wasnt it
W: I cant say exactly. I have to check other details as well.
DSG: From the secondary market transactions in November, PTL gained 89% of the profits when compared with other Primary Dealers and altogether a 53% when compared with a stand alone Primary Dealer in respect of the profits. In this context, Rs. 2.6 billion is a significant amount in capital gains, right
W: Yes
During the questioning, it was revealed that Mahendran had called daily reports relating to all transactions of EPF before him after he assumed duties as the CBSL Governor.
From January to October, 2015 the EPF had largely purchased bonds from the Primary Auctions but in November a considerable amount of bonds had been purchased in the secondary market.
			DSG Gunatilleke explained:
			-There was a Primary auction on October 30, 2015, where the EPF had not bid.
			-The settlement day of that auction was on November 2, 2015. 
			-On that very settlement day (November 2) EPF bought some of the same tenure bonds issued at the Primary Auction from the Secondary Market.
			-It was revealed that EPF would have been aware on October 30 (auction day) about their cash availability on November 2 to settle bonds if they had gone for bidding in the Primary Auction.
			
		
DSG Gunatilleke questioned the witness about these activities of the EPF.

When the DSG questioned as to why would EPF not have bid at the auction and subsequently bought the same bonds on the settlement day of the auction in the secondary market, Mahendan said:
That is a matter for inquiry.
DSG: Now you said that is a matter for inquiry right
W: Yes
DSG: It was a matter known to you, right
W: I wouldnt have known it until the event had happened.
DSG: You are saying now that an investigation is warranted, right
W: Yes
DSG: Why didnt you investigate about it then
W: Data relating to this came in December, 2015.
DSG: Now you are saying the data came in December
W: Yes
The DSG Gunatilleke said that the witness was receiving reports of the EPF transactions on a daily basis and on November 4, 2015 he received a daily report relating to the November 2 transactions.
The witness said that he was not perfect with his gaze.
DSG: If you had acted earlier in November seeing the daily reports, things would have been different, right
W: I do not agree.
During this questioning it was revealed that in the latter part of December Mr. Chrishantha Perera (Monetary Board Member) had forwarded an email to Governor Mahendran which contained a rumor circulating in the market at that time accusing EPF helping PTL to gain phenomenal profits in November 2015.
Later, Mr. Mahendran had forwarded this to Mr. Jayalath (head of the EPF) to inquire into the matter.
However, Mr. Jayalth had thereafter prepared a report relating to the EPF and the November transactions and sent to the Governor.
According to the witness, he as the Governor had then called EPF officials and questioned about it in January, 2016. The witness said the officers gave reasons for their decisions in the month of November, 2015.
In the Jayalath report it was also highlighted the unavailability of a voice recording system in the dealing room of EPF.
However, when the DSG questioned as to whether he had referred the report to the Monetary Board, witness Mahendran said that there was no sufficient evidence to prove such allegations at that time.
DSG Gunatilleke also said that in the daily reports provided by the EPF to Mr. Mahendran the dates of the secondary Market transactions were not reflected.
DSG: Didnt you inquire as to why the dates of the transactions are not there in the daily reports
W: That is a reasonable concern but not referred at that time.
DSG: In October the dates are reflected in the daily reports, so why were the dates not there in those daily reports relating to the secondary market transactions in November
W: I have no explanation.
 
When the witness was questioned about not installing a voice recording system at the EPF, he said that he had raised concern about it but it was a problem relating to facility management and it was not installed purely because of a bureaucratic error at the CBSL.
At this point DSG Gunatilleke played two voice recordings in which the PABC dealer and the EPF dealer at that time Mr. Saman Kumara was negotiating a deal. (The recording was obtained from the PABC data base).
In this conversation, according to the DSG the confirmation of the deal may have happened prior to or subsequent to that conversation.
Therefore the DSG was of the view that if the EPF had the facility of a voice recording system the collusive activities could have been monitored.
Mahendran said That confirmation of the deal could be happened through a mobile phone or an e-mail or that confirmation could be struck during a cup of coffee as well.
DSG: Are you saying that such a deal could be struck having a cup of coffee Are saying that such deal could be struck through a dealers mobile phone Is it permissible doing that
W: I never said that
Referring the on sight examination reports of the PDD about PTL and the report prepared by Mr. Jayalath on the November transactions relating to PTL-EPF deals, DSG Gunatilleke suggested to the witness, You have suppressed Board reports. If you had inquired about them properly, these matters would have ended up there. You have acted mala fide. The witness rejected that.
DSG: In your time the PDD conducted activities in a way that benefited your son in law.
W: There is no evidence to that.
Then DSG Gunatilleke played another voice recording which reflected the conversation between the Superintendent of the PDD Srathchandra and the Official at the Peoples Banks Treasury Department.
In this conversation ( which took place on March 29, 2016 morning) the Peoples Bank official seeks the SPDs assurance that higher rates would not be accepted at the auction because there was a direction from Minister Ravi Karunanayake to the three state banks to bid at lower rates.
DSG: Did Sarathchandra tell you about this
W: No
DSG: Did anybody tell you about these two state banks meetings
W: No
DSG: Did the Finance Minister tell you
W: No
DSG: If your son-in-law, Aloysius tells the cut off rate at the auction (March 29, 2016) precisely that would be a price sensitive information, right
W: If correct yes.
DSG Gunatilleken then showed the actual cut off rate at the auction to the witness (14.7996).
DSG: If Aloysius had some information about the cut off rate as at 14.80 would that be regarded as price sensitive information
W: Question is who would have told him.
DSG: That is the question Mr. Mahendran (everyone in the court room started laughing)
However, referring to the phone conversation of Aloysius and Kasun Palisena where Aloysius was instructing his CEO as to how to bid, the witness said that that is how dealers talk. He also said there could be good analysts who could predict the cut off point so Aloysius could have got the information from anyone like that.
At this point Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera suddenly questioned the witness regarding several matters that came to light during the PCoI proceedings.
ASG Dappula De Livera: Now you are aware that there were two meetings chaired by then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake (on March 28 and 30, 2016 before the two auctions) with the state banks, right
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: Now the evidence has been led that Mr. Paskaralingam was also there at the meetings, right
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: There were Treasury officials present at those two meetings, right
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: As per the evidence, there were CBSL officials also present at the meetings along with the chairmen of the state banks (Peoples Bank, NSB and BoC) right
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: Are you saying now that you did not know about those two meetings summoned by then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake where the Minister had asked the state banks to bid at a lower rate at the auctions

W: Absolutely
ASG De Livera: Did Ravi Karunanayake inform you about summoning these state banks for meetings
W: No. the Finance Minister was not obliged to inform the CBSL Governor in such an occasion. I categorically say that I did not know about the meetings.
ASG De Livera: There was evidence that P. Samarasiri (Deputy Governor) was present at the meeting held on March 28, 2016 at the Finance Ministry.
W: I have no knowledge about it.
However, at this moment Mahendran replied quite intensively to the questions put forward by the ASG and emphasized his ignorance about Deputy Governor P. Samarasiris presence at the state banks meetings.
When the ASG remarked that the counsel appearing for the Deputy Governor had not contradicted this evidence, there was a heated argument between ASG De Livera and Mahendrans counsel.
Presidents Counsel Romesh De Silva and Counsel Chanaka De Silva who were appearing on behalf of Mahendran said that it was not fair to question his client continuously about a matter to which he had already replied stating his ignorance.
Counsel Harsha Fernando who appeared for P. Samarasiri said that there were only two witnesses (Peoples Bank Chairman and the NSB Chairman) who testified about the presence of the Deputy Governor out of the eight witnesses who testified before the commission with regard to the state banks meetings.
He said his client had not participated in such a meeting and will submit an affidavit proving it before the Commission.
However, ASG De Livera went on to question the witness repeatedly over the incident referring to the state banks meetings summoned by the then Finance Minister. The Witness too continued his stance that he did not know about those meetings.
At this point the Commission advised the ASG We will decide on whether P. Samarasiri was there or not and whether the witness was saying the truth.
The Commission seemed unconvinced over the repeated questing of the ASG.
ASG De Livera: You are lying perfectly. You nominated P. Samarasiri to attend those meetings
W: Why would I do that
At this point Presidents Counsel Romesh De Silva said The witness had been questioned millions of times about the meetings and he said that he did not know. So this questioning is not fair
ASG De Livera and Romesh De Silva PC engaged in an intensive argument at this point.
Dont jump like jack in the box, ASG De Livera said.
When Romesh De Silva argued with him he said Im not going to be dictated by the Commission. At this moment the counsel laughed at the comment of the ASG.
Im here to facilitate the Commission, ASG De Livera said.
Justice Prsanna Jayawardena at this point in a disappointed manner said At this moment you are not facilitating the Commission.
However, at the end of this heated argument the Commission allowed ASG De Livera to continue with the questioning.
ASG De Livera: Do you personally know Ravi Karunanayake
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: Do you know the family of Ravi Karunanayake
W: My children know them.
ASG De Livera: So, he would have known Aloysius as well
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: When did you come to know the fact that Aloysius had paid for Ravi Karunanayakes Penthouse apartment
W: Learned it from the Media
When the witness was questioned, he was of the view that he was unaware about such renting of an apartment while he was serving as the Governor.
According to the ASG, then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayakes family had resided at this Penthouse apartment since March 2016.
ASG De Livera: The state banks meetings summoned by then Finance Minister where he had asked the state banks to bid low and the Finance Ministers Family starting to reside at the Penthouse apartment had happened during the same month. So, isnt that ironical And wouldnt it reflect that Aloysius with assistance of the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had fixed the March 29 and 31, 2016 auctions
At this moment, Presidents Counsel appearing for Aloysius questioned about the facts because those revelations came from the witnesses and is yet to be proven.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena in a sarcastic manner said It appears to be true from the evidence of ASG De Livera
Justice Jayawardena seemed unhappy with the line of questioning of ASG De Livera and commented This line of questioning appears to be for the press
After ASG De Livera questioned the witness, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned Mahendran on several matters.
Justice Jayawardena: Now you have summoned daily reports of EPF, right
W: Yes
J: There is track record that the EPF had purchased from the Primary Market Auctions, right
W: Yes
J: And there was a huge departure in November from that trend, right
W: Yes
J: Why didnt you have a warning signal to your mind after seeing those daily reports about the purchases in the Secondary Market by the EPF in November
The witness elaborated his stance saying that due to the transfer of Naveen Anuradha from the EPF, the EPF lacked competent personnel to engage in trading.
Justice Jayawardena: You had served the CBSL since 1983, right
W: Yes
J: We have seen in the evidence that there was a culture of reverence with regard to the Governor at the CBSL, was it a correct statement
W: I dont agree
J: Is there a trend in the CBSL to comply with the word of the Governor
W: I dont think so
Then Justice Jayawardena questioned him about the connection between Mahendran and his son-in-law Aloyius.
Justice Jayawardena questioned him on the potential of conflict of interest. The witness said that he always kept an arms length with his son-in-laws company (PTL) when he conducted his duties as the Governor of CBSL.
The witness pointed out an incident in Switzerland where such a conflict of interest was seen in the international arena. However, Justice Jayawardena quipped it was in Switzerland and this is Sri Lanka
Justice Chitrasiri at this moment questioned the Witness: Didnt you think that Aloysius could have used you as a reference in his activities as a Primary Dealer
W: If so he should be punished.
Justice Jayawardena: Now you said you considered about you and your son-in-laws connection, right
W: Yes
J: So, the Jayalath report regarding the secondary market transactions of PTL and EPF in November referred to matters relating to PTL (son in laws company). So why didnt you consider taking some decisions with regard to that
The witness elaborated his answer and said that he discussed about that incident with others and wanted to conduct an impartial inquiry about the incident.
Justice Jayawardena: But the fact was no inquiry was held until late 2016. However, you said you wanted to keep an arms length with your son-in-laws company, right
W: Yes
J: So, was it prudent then to reside in the same house with him
W: I thought about that question too. But my conclusion was, if I wanted to give details to Aloysius I would have stayed in Jaffna and passed him information. If I wanted to give him information why would I stay in the same house.
Justice Jayawardena also questioned about the appointment of Mr. Saman Kumara to the EPF.
It was revealed that Mr. Saman Kumara was first appointed to the equity section of the EPF and later moved as a dealer. It was him who was at the EPF in November, 2015, when PTL gained phenomenal profits from the secondary market transactions with EPF.
Justice Jayawardena questioned the witness saying that Saman Kumara has been accused of being a key player in the alleged events that occurred in the stock exchange scandal prior to 2015.
Justice Jayawardena: Why did you let him come into the EPF Didnt you care about Saman Kumaras appointment
Witness was of the view that he was lacking CA qualified persons in the staff at that time. He also said that he discussed this with one Mr Tilak Karunaratne in the SEC and found that there was no sufficient evidence to accuse Saman Kumara on that allegation.
Justice Jayawardena in a sarcastic manner quipped at that comment: Even the Roman Empires wife would have cared of such a thing
The PCoI comprising Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Chairman), Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and K. Velupillai Kandasami will resume sittings at 10 am today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Tie-up with the formidable rival cost him high post
	

The sudden removal of the chief of a revenue-earning establishment raised many an eyebrow in political and white collar circles recently.

Discreet inquiries made by some inquisitive ones have now unraveled the mystery shrouding the ouster of the white collar high-up now cooling his heels in the pool.
According to informed sources, it was an act of indiscretion on his part that led to his removal from the coveted post.
This white collar high-up had called on a well-known astrologer in Ampara area to get a reading of his daughters horoscope. By the way, he is said to have handed a horoscope copy of another person as well to this astrologer for a reading. And it had come to light that the other horoscope belonged to none other than the former strongman!
Some bigwigs in yahapalanaya who had come to know about this horoscope affair had put the two and two together and found an answer not to their liking.
The white collar one had protested his innocence denying the allegation that he carried anothers horoscope to the astrologer. However, the bigwigs had believed the astrologer who had wittingly or unwittingly gabbed about the incident rather than the white collar one. So the man was pulled out from his high post and parked in the pool!

The diplomatic mission of a Red-country based in the city held a celebration at the BMICH recently to mark that countrys National Day.

The envoy of that country had invited both the incumbent Head of State and his immediate predecessor to this important ceremony due to begin at 7 in the evening.
Suddenly getting wise to the peculiarities of local politics, an official from the diplomatic mission called the former strongman and asked him whether he would mind delaying his arrival for the ceremony.
The former strongman asked why he should and the official explained: The incumbent Head of State too has been invited and he is due by 7 pm. We thought it would be better if you arrive for the ceremony after his departure!
Realizing that the diplomat was only playing a playing diplomatic game, the former strongman agreed to suitably time his arrival for the ceremony.
The envoy and his officials were happy that they could easily set right at the eleventh hour a silly mistake they had committed and they looked forward to the arrival of Number One in yahapalanaya sharp at 7 pm.
However, Number One failed to turn up at the BMICH on time or late for the ceremony.
Highly disconcerted envoy got his officials to make inquiries into the inordinate delay on the part of the incumbent head of State in attending the ceremony.
Finally, an informal message he received from the Yahapalanaya nerve-centre in response to the inquiries made, ended the speculation over the arrival of the VVIP. The message said: The Head of State will not attend the ceremony considering that the presence of both the present and former Heads of State at the ceremony is not necessary.

We are for peaceful settlement of disputes in Indian Ocean: SL
	
Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said that the modern post-conflict Sri Lanka stands for a peaceful Indian Ocean which includes peaceful rules-based settlement of disputes.
He expressed these views while addressing the Galle Dialogue Maritime Conference on Monday.
He said Sri Lanka also stands for a rules-based order which follows international norms and practices, freedom of navigation and overflight and safe sea lanes that allow for the free flow of goods both for Sri Lanka and partner nations.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kariyawasam said combating drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms smuggling and piracy require attention for better maritime management and security in the maritime domain around us.
He said it was important for the worlds Navies and maritime experts to develop and implement effective programmes to educate citizens about the importance of the oceans.
As the maritime realm becomes increasingly more significant in the context of our nations development, I think it is vital that the Navy gets more involved in task of implementing our Nations renewed and progressive vision for itself as a reconciled, peaceful, stable, and prosperous nation, he said.
He said that it was also necessary that the public considers the Navy as an integral part of our Nations core identity.
It must be considered as an Institution that is of service not only to the people of Sri Lanka, but to the world beyond; a force for good, carrying Sri Lankas flag in collaborative missions in the region and beyond, out there in the high seas  making sea lanes safer for shipping, for the free flow of goods, participating in humanitarian, evacuation and disaster relief operations, and contributing to regional and global security, Mr. Kariyawasam said.
He said the Navy must view itself, and the Nation must consider the Navy, as an extension of Sri Lankas diplomacy of peace and goodwill.

Why economies depend on ports
	
RIS Director General Professor Sachin Chathurvedi says trade and investment should be linked
Delhi: A visiting delegation of senior Sri Lankan journalists on an extensive familiarisation tour recently took part in a stimulating discussion focusing on the rationale behind Indias development cooperation with South Asian countries, with officials of the Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS).
The New Delhibased autonomous policy research institute specialises in issues related to international economic development, trade, investmentand technology. 
Conceived in 1979 as a think tank for Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) countries, today RIS is envisioned as a forum for fostering effective policy dialogue and capacity-building among developing countries on global and regional economic issues.
Our economies are crucially dependent on developmentof ports
	Afghanistan should be connected with Ho Chi Min city in Vietnam. Afghanistan connects with Central Asia.
	Statistics clearly indicate the fact that both countries have benefited from the Indo-SL FTA
The discussion with the group of seventeen journalists from print and broadcast media focused on Indias approach to South-South cooperation, which is distinct from traditional North-South cooperation, where emphasis is placed on mutual gain and commitment by the countries involved, freedom from imposed conditions, and policy coherence.
RIS is engaged across inter-governmental processes of several regional economic cooperation initiatives. RIS Director General Professor Sachin Chathurvedi said through its intensive network of think tanks, RIS sought to strengthen policy coherence on international economic issues and the developmentpartnership canvas.
Economists from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh came together in defining what the economic contour of South Asias rationale approach would be for creation of this entity, Prof. Chathurvedi said, elaborating on the history of RIS, especially noting the contributions of the late Dr. Saman Kelegama in this regard.
According to Prof. Chathurvedi RIS is studying present challenges in the region along with the optimal focal areas of cooperation. 
These include analysing how oceans were being utilised as development cooperation was transcending borders. 
Many of our economies are crucially dependent on development of ports and development of the ideas around them, Prof. Chathurvedi noted.
When RIS was established we realised trade and investment cannot be studied separately because it was also the time that the world economy saw a surge in Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). We found that trade and investment would have to be linked together in the process. By early eighties we found that technology plays a far greater and more important role in driving the way trade and investment should go. 
Trade, investment and technology alone are not sufficient to explain comparative advantage of countries and their international engagement. It is also very important for us to engage in finance as financial market drives trade, investment, technology to a great extent, he explained.
RIS officials divulged that during a World Trade Organisation meeting in Nairobi last year, the biggest challenge that the Director General of WTO identified was in the area of financing: countries are not able to finance imports. 
Prof. Chathurvedi believes that these are particularly countries which were crucially dependent on commodities. Surprisingly 38 countries in the world are crucially dependent on one commodity while another 52 countries are crucially dependent on 3 to 4 commodities for their exports.
If this huge spectrum of countries is dependent on commodity exports and commodity prices are crumbling down, you can imagine how difficult it is for such countries to see that their imports are taken care of and financed. Globally instead of trade financing going up, trade financing has come down by more than 38% in just 10 years rendering countries vulnerable to imports, he said.
He elaborated on the conditionalities imposed when imports are negotiated among countries. 
Suppliers of the products are themselves determining what sort of conditionality and what sort of price you will have to pay for imports that countries end up with. 
There are several countries which are ready to supply goods and are also ready to finance those imports. We are researching into such import-linked vulnerabilities which have multiplied over the years.
According to experts at RIS, the vulnerabilities dont stop at imports alone, it is linked to technology. 
There are entities which must decide on what kind of technology countries should import, along with the goods. The kind of financial autonomy or market you enter in, when you import is also a point of concern, the experts clarified.
The pillars of study at RIS are also dedicated to bilateral free trade agreements, connectivity andtrade facilitation. 
During a World Trade Organization meeting in Nairobi last year, the biggest challenge that the Director General of WTO identified was in the area of financing: countries are not able to finance imports.
Our idea is that Afghanistan should be connected with Ho Chi Min city in Vietnam. Afghanistan connects with Central Asia. Connecting these regions will be in terms of motor vehicle agreements, customs coherence, fast clearance of goods and services, compatibility of trade linkages between countries, easy tracking facilities, he said.
Speaking of future engagements, Professor Chathurvedi underscored the need for promoting and adopting regulations among countries. 
We are in an era, where technology is appearing as a real opportunity and also as a real threat to our existing products. There are countries which do not believe in regulation of technology. If you do not regulate technology it may end with a number of challenges. 
The RIS initiated the policy stating that South Asian countries must adopt a regulatory approach amongst themselves. Sri Lanka was the first country which in 2007 issued a circular to ban the import of genetically modified products. However Sri Lanka was pressurised and in 2007 itself Sri Lanka had to withdraw the order. Yet it is absolutely important to have regulatory structures in place and have a wider consensus on technology regulation in a country. It is not being opposed to technology but more about being in favour of responsible research and innovation. This is one area where South Asian Countries can easily cooperate, he stressed.
Noting of development where Sri Lanka is concerned Prof. Chathurvedi briefed on their recent collaborations with the island nation. 
We had taken our views to Sri Lanka and we had a very stimulating conference in Colombo and then with your agriculture experts in Kandy. The former president had given a sizable grant to establish a nano-technology centre close to Colombo. We are aware that Sri Lanka too is trying to cope up with new technological changes and challenges that are coming in. For smaller countries its a considerable challenge, he added.
Under the Indian Governments Technical Economic Cooperation Programme, Prof. Chathurvedi said India now was laying much emphasis on port development. 
There are 12 ports being developed under the Sagar Mala Project, which is a strategic and customer-oriented initiative of the Government of India to modernise Indias Ports. Its aim is to augment port-led developmentand coastlines.
It would be giving a major initiative on how port development would affect our partnership with Sri Lanka as most of our imports first land in Sri Lanka before reaching India. Ports are also coming up in Sri Lanka and therefore what would happen to our relationship with Singapore is also a question in the line, he said.
Prof. Chathurvedi also believes that Sri Lanka can play an extremely important role in terms of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor. Negating several reports he said, Media was quick to jump to conclusions that this was Indias response to One Belt, One Road, and then India, China comparisons were drawn. But during our discussions we identified that Sri Lanka can play an extremely important role in the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor. As of now India is committed to spending around USD 10 billion within the next five years with Africa under the lines of credit programmes by the Indian government. Japan has committed USD 30 billion for the next three years.
Capacity building, education and skill development continue to be extremely important in development cooperation. Sri Lankas specialisation in apparel export was complimented in the discussion whilst the need to identify additional skills required by Sri Lanka for enhancing product quality, was also noted. 
Sri Lanka is involved in research and development and also involved in branding, the two ends which are completely missing from the Value chain of developing countries, he said.
Responding to a question from journalists on the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), Prof. Chathurvedi said according to statistics from the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka and the IMF, before any trade agreements took place, Indias exports were 13 times higher than Sri Lankas exports to India. 
This has gone down drastically and now it has come down five times the value, in 2016. In 2013 total trade was USD seven billion which started with USD 653 million in 2000. In recent times however it had come down. Over the last three years the imports and exports of Sri Lanka have constantly declined. 
All statistics clearly indicated the fact that both countries have benefited from the Indo-SL Free Trade Agreement, Prof. Chathurvedi said.
It is important for us to see that the countries which are getting into trade of goods and services also leverage development potential through grants, development cooperation and through lines of credit. So, all encompassing, we should see a development compact, and that is across the modalitiesof engagement. 
Therefore ETCA signifies a great advancement over FTA. It is a role model for countries to engage in, especially when small and larger economies are exchanging among themselves or are getting engaged, he added
On a final note, Prof. Chathurvedi said an important aspect of development cooperation is to ensure that countries arenot indebted. 
They should not be borrowing and then losing out control of their own assets. Cooperation should evolve in such a way that they are ensuring their sustenance while also ensuring the ability to have technology, to meet their development goals through concerted efforts Prof. Chathurvedi said.
