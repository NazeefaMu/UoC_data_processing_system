The CFA programme provides a strong foundation of advanced investment analysis and real-world portfolio management skills. The course of study is organized into three levels and each level requires passing a six-hour exam. 
The programme curriculum increases in complexity as you move through the three levels: The CFA programme bridges current practice, investment theory, and ethical and professional standards in shaping the candidates to do investment analysis and portfolio management skills.
With 142,000 members in 73 countries around the world and with nearly 225,000 CFA programme candidates each year who sit for the CFA exams, the mission of the CFA Institute is to lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society.
President, CFA Society Sri Lanka, Rachini Rajapaksa CFA, in congratulating the new batch of charter holders and Level III passed finalists, said that it is a milestone year for the Sri Lanka Society. Established in 2001, the local society in celebrating its 15th anniversary was proud to have grown to a membership of 185 excluding almost another 100 odd charter holders who have gone overseas to work.
She told the charter holders that by earning the 3 important credentials ‘CFA’ after the name, they were also embracing a totally new world of fulfillment, satisfaction, success and also responsibility and that their actions, behaviors, demonstration of knowledge at the place of work and outside shape perception and the culture of CFA Society Sri Lanka and CFA Institute. 
Since the actions of individuals ultimately impact the wider society, to be mindful to uphold the CFA Institute values and work towards the ultimate benefit of the investment fraternity, our country and the world. Rajapaksa went on to say that they are the future of finance and so to be a difference that matters!!
Governor in delivering the oration shared his personal experiences in relation to constructing a stable and prosperous society. Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy emphasizing on how one can construct a prosperous society and a prosperous economy stated that whatever plans we have for the economy will be very difficult to be achieved unless are routed in sound ethics and good values through good quality balanced growth. 
He said Sri Lanka can no longer drive growth through incremental foreign commercial borrowings and a new growth model should be with different mixes from the state and the private sector because the country’s debt dynamics don’t have the fiscal space to have only a state sector driven development model.    


He told the young charter recipients that, building up credibility, integrity and reputation is more important than the material progress and emphasized the fact that, credibility and integrity built over the years should not be wiped out by a single act of rashness. He earnestly asked for the support of professionals on the major development projects proposed by the government as the economy will grow gradually over the next 5 years. He also urged all those who are working in the private sector, especially those in the capacity of decision making to think seriously about investing in Sri Lanka, as it is our duty and we owe our country.
