He sets a healthy trend!


	

Yahapalanaya Big Boss recently left for the Maldives to attend the National Day celebrations of that country as the Chief Guest.  The ministerial one handling Finance also accompanied him on this visit.
This official visit abroad by the new Big Boss was one with a great difference, they say.
Whenever the previous Head of State visited abroad he was accompanied by a large retinue which included a dozen top officials. But the new Big Boss took along with him on this official visit only a few security men and several aides. 
Sources close to the main office say that the new Big Boss deliberately broke with the tradition of taking a huge following with the Head of State when visiting a foreign country to set a new healthy trend.
