 Global Payments Inc, a leading worldwide provider of payment technology services, announced that its Sri Lankan subsidiary, Global Payments Asia Pacific Lanka Pvt Ltd. (Global Sri Lanka), has entered into an agreement with Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Sri Lanka’s largest electricity provider, and MasterCard to enable consumers to pay electricity bills using their MasterCard credit and debit cards.
Global Sri Lanka has deployed its point of sale terminals at CEB’s Colombo 02 head office as well as its outlets across Colombo, Dehiwala, Gampaha, Kiribathgoda, Negombo Ratmalana and Thudella Ja-ela to facilitate this service. The company also plans to offer this convenient solution at other CEB outlets in the coming months.
 Enabling CEB to move more of its day-to-day transactions to electronic platforms, this solution will simplify monthly utility bill payments for consumers while offering them greater security. CEB customers will be charged a nominal convenience fee of 1.1% when settling bills with their MasterCard credit and debit cards over the Global Payments terminals.
 T. K. Liyanage, Finance Manager, Ceylon Electricity Board said, “As Sri Lanka’s leading electricity provider, we continue to upgrade processes and systems to offer greater levels of service to our consumers. Eliminating the need to carry cash while expediting the payment process, they are sure to appreciate the safety and convenience being offered. Working together with MasterCard and Global Payments, we look forward to making this available at more outlets in the future.”
 “Partnering with electronic payment technology titans like MasterCard, we strive to bring state-of-the-art payment solutions to Sri Lanka. We are excited to collaborate with a large utility service provider like CEB and are focused on providing hassle-free, secure electronic payment solutions to other CEB outlets,” said Nazeem Mohamed, Director in Sri Lanka & Maldives, Global Payments Asia Pacific Lanka Pvt Ltd.
