	The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) today requested the Sri Lanka Customs to stop consignments of rejected Maggi Noodle from India being released to the importers because they are said to contain high levels of Mono Sodium Glutamate (MSG).
	The Indian High Commission had requested the CAA to ban the import such noodles to Sri Lanka from India.
	“Responding to the written request, CAA Director General J.M.A. Douglas has written to the Customs asking it to prevent any Indian-rejected noodles entering the country for the safety of consumers. Both Singapore and Nepal had already banned the import of Maggi instant noodles from India,” CAA Spokesman Udayajeewa Ekanayake said.
	Indian Central government had banned 27,000 tons of Maggi noodles found with MSG and high levels of lead (Pb). The government had directed the relevant company to immediately destroy the banned consignments. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
