Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) had violated the agreement on live coverage of the past few parliamentary sessions and vowed he would take immediate action against its Chairman.

He said Parliament had paid the SLBC for broadcasting live coverage of parliamentary sessions and that it was doing so for about four years now.

"I heard that SLBC Chairman was acting in a biased manner. I raised this matter with him twice," the Speaker said and added that the chairman's actions was a disgrace to Parliament.

He said this in response to a question asked by UNP MP Mayantha Dissanayake that the SLBC and Rupavahini Cooperation were acting in a biased manner and refrained from providing live coverage of parliamentary sessions.

The Speaker said Parliament had no agreement with the Rupavahini Cooperation with regard to live coverage. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
