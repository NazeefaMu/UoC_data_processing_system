Two youths from the same family killed after they being hit by a train while attempting to take a selfie while standing on the railway track located between the Kollupitiya and Bambalapitiya Stations this evening, Kollupitiya Police said.

The two brothers, who were 24 and 12 years of age respectively, were residents of Anuradhapura. The accident had occurred at around 6.30 pm.

It was reported that the brothers were so busy taking selfies they had not seen or heard the Aluthgama bound express train from Maradana that hit them.

Police said the elder brother, who arrived from Singapore that day, had died at the scene while his younger brother had succumbed to his injuries while being taken to the Colombo National Hospital.

It was reported that the 24-yr-old had been picked up by his family on arrival to the airport and that they had then gone to the Galle Face Green after which the two boys had made their way to the place where the accident occurred.

The Kollupitiya Police were conducting investigations into the accident. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
