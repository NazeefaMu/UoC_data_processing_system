Has your garbage been collected?


	

In view of the crisis created by the failure of authorities to collect garbage recently, the Daily Mirror has decided to petition the Task Force Unit established at the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry with a list of areas where garbage remains uncollected.

We request our readers affected by the crisis to send the location of such areas, by way of comments so that we could forward details to the ministry.

Readers could also contact the Task Force Unit directly on 0112 302722
