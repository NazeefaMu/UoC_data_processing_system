Deepening the political crisis, President Maithripala Sirisena has told the UNP yesterday that he would permit the SLFP MPs to vote according to how they feel about the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

He said this when he chaired a meeting of party representatives ahead of the no-confidence motion and vowed to reconstitute the Cabinet tomorrow no matter what the outcome of the vote would be.

At this meeting Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said it was the SLFP stance that the Prime Minister should step down. (Kelum Bandara)
