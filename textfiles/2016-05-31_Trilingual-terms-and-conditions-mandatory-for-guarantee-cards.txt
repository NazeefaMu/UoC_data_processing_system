The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) today made it mandatory to include the terms and conditions in guarantee cards in all three languages for consumer durables with effect from January 01, 2017, CAA Chairman Hasitha Tillekeratne said.

He said this regulation was implemented under the Extraordinary Gazette Notice 1966/43.

The CAA made this decision considering the views of the public which constantly brings to the attention of several issues regarding consumer durables and this is largely due to the guarantee cards carrying terms and conditions only in English, he said.

“After having drawn the attention of the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishard Bathiudeen to this matter, I was authorized to implement the regulation,” he added.  

Mr. Tillekeratne said that this can be considered as yet another step towards strengthening the consumer’s right to information. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
