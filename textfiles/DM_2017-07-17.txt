A DEVILISH SECRET LURKS BEHIND IMPORTED milk
	

Few are aware that thousands of new-born calves are slaughtered every day within hours of their birth in dairy farms in Australia, through NZ, Europe, America England and other large scale milk producing countries

Today, in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist country, many people avoid eating meat, especially beef. In the distant past, aversion to any food produced after taking an animal life was more marked than now and meat stalls of any type were seldom seen in operation during that time. Among some Buddhists this hands-off extended even to a taboo in eating eggs because they contained chicks in the process of development. This trend resulted in the term Buddhist eggs that referred to eggs produced in farms that raised only hens or layers to produce eggs. (No cockerels are found in layers cages.) Consequently there was no possibility of eggs getting fertilized- so Buddhist eggs.
To eat or not to eat beef (and other meats) has been a subject of argument among Buddhists. One group was of the opinion that it was permissible because beef or meat came from a dead animala carcass while another group pointed out that animals were being killed because there was a demand for their flesh.
Beef boycott and saving cattle from slaughter
In comparison to the consumption of chicken and other meats, the boycotting of beef among Buddhists is much more widespread especially in village areas where rural folk rear cows for milk and bulls to draw carts and for paddy field work. The love and care they extend to the one or two cows that provide milk for their children come from their hearts. When such animals get old and dry up, no-one thinks of selling them to a butcher. How can we do such a thing to an animal that provided us so much Let them be around and when they die we will bury them is the usual response when questions are asked about their plans for ageing cows and also bulls. Calves are similarly loved and cared for. Admittedly there are some who think that the maintenance of a non-productive cow or calf is too costly. Such people take more drastic steps in getting rid of such uneconomical and troublesome burdens.
Stigmas in imported milk
The availability of fresh milk to consumers in this country is nowhere near the demand; hence, the need to import powdered milk in huge quantities into the country. And such milk as everyone knows is pricey and it seems importers do not think twice in demanding price hikes. In such a well-orchestrated monopoly, government finds its hands tied because the country depends on imported milk to meet their needs. However, questions have been raised about the quality of imported powdered milk. Concerns of substances tainting such milk powders have made the news in the past. But such negative impacts soon died down for various reasons. And, people still wanted milk.
A practice that has gained ground among Buddhists is the release of cattle destined to be slaughtered in an abattoir. Singly or in groups, people buy such animals destined to die and hand them over to families that are willing to care for them.
Do they or dont they know
Fairly recently, one of the companies importing powdered milk (from Australia or New Zealand or both as far as the writer knows) and selling them here in value added packs under their own brand name was seen advertising them in conjunction with their programme in saving cattle from butchers. It cannot be denied that it has made praiseworthy progress in saving cattle from slaughter.
Now here comes the crunch. Is this company and others importing powdered milk aware of what takes place routinely in dairy farming in Australia and New Zealand that export huge quantities of milk to Sri Lanka. (This does not mean that milk producing countries like the UK, Europe, Canada, and the United States among others are not open to such criticism. They are as vulnerable to the same charges.)


"Where is the Buddhist voice in this Buddhist country Why are animal rights activists in Sri Lanka so silent on the issue In what manner is the government hoping to handle this two-facedness in this issue"

The gross manner in which dairy farms are managed in Australia and New Zealand as commercially operated units has drawn severe criticism from people in those countries as well as international groups. It is well known that cows come into milk in their cycles of calving optimized at around 6. Over that ideal, it is not considered economical to maintain cows because their milk yields drop. Consequently to maintain levels of profit as determined by farm owners, cows are artificially impregnated practically annually according to time tables of coming into heat. Such drastic practice tells on the animals health and when their productive period is over they are culled; a polite way of saying they are killed for beef. Old cows just eat into profits while offering low returns. Because the poor quality of their meat does not satisfy sophisticated tastes, the stringy meat is generally channelled to fast-food chains that specialize in grinding low-priced, low-quality meats to produce hamburgers sausages and pies.


"Farmers separate calves from their mothers as soon as they are born and are allowed to die through thirst and starvation. Some are dragged away and shot dead"

Perhaps they are aware of the systems of bovicide (culling cattle) but choose to remain tight-lipped. That is not surprising when they too are partners in the milk business and do not wish to perish owing to moral considerations. Profit is the ulterior motive in any business and judging by the quantum of milk being imported the money in the business of importing milk must be enormously satisfying.
But, if Sri Lankan milk importers are aware of the manner in which dairy farms are run in Australia and NZ and their cost control tactics, they are hypocrites. While great publicity is being given to saving cattle from slaughter powdered milk produced in dairy farms that are also slaughter houses operating perhaps on a much bigger scale than of all abattoirs in Sri Lanka put together. [It transpires that 2 million newly-born calves are killed every year in NZ alone.]. And it is reasonable to assume other milk producing countries follow the same methods in cost cutting. Many of these milk producers treat milking cows and their calves like inanimate components of a cold-blooded production line that are discarded once their usefulness comes to an end in making money. In dairy farming too costs, sales and margins of profit take priority over any other consideration.
New-born calves have no chance
The real tragedy in commercialized milk production is the gruesome and inhumane manner in which newly-born calves economic inconveniences in farm managementare dealt with. The gender does not matter. Farmers separate calves from their mothers as soon as they are born. Still struggling to find their feet, calves are carted away and allowed to die through thirst and starvation. They are not given a chance to suckle the colostrum that gives a boost to their development or milk, bond with their mothers and experience their warmth. There are many reports made by people who have seen the heart-rending sight of bellowing cows running after trucks taking their babies away to be heaped in boxes and left on road sides until they die. About 36 hours later trucks collect the dead calves for disposal. In some cases newly-born calves are dragged away and shot dead. That means in addition to the tender veal young bulls provide, some calves also end up as veal steaks at restaurants.
When a new born calf is taken away from its mother the trauma must be devastating. Just imagine a baby being separated from its mother soon after delivery.


Government intervention is eyewash
It is understood that the governments of these countries have promulgated laws that stipulate that calves should be kept alive for a certain period of time a few daysbefore they are put away. That is the extent of governmental consideration to new-born calves. They have forgotten that they as shareholders of their countries milk industry bear a major responsibility to initiate a more merciful solution to this situation.
It must be mentioned that animal sanctuaries for unwanted cattle and calves have been established in some countries by private concerns. But being costly to manage them, their success and potential for expansion is understandably limited.
So what is the answer No-one can expect Australia and New Zealand to stop producing milk-- powdered milk and exporting it. It is most unlikely their governments would place stringent regulations on the treatment of newly-born calves and ageing cows that are uneconomical to maintain either. The dairy industry is a very important cog in their economic wheel.
In Sri Lanka many see that the only answer is to produce our own milkenough to meet demand. During the past few decades governments made several attempts to promote milk production in Sri Lanka but failed. And the need to import powdered milk in such vast quantities confirms those failures that carried a multitude of loopholes in both government policy making in boosting local milk production and weaknesses in administration.

"But, where is the Buddhist voice in this Buddhist country Why are animal rights activists in Sri Lanka so silent on the issue Importantly, in what manner is the government hoping to handle this two-facedness in this issue"

Is silence the answer
The need for government to push the correct buttons to make the country self-sufficient in milk remains stronger than ever. But, many wonder whether it would ever happen.
The majority of Sri Lankans are blissfully unaware of the harsh practices involved in countries from where the milk they drink is imported. People who save cattle from slaughter are also ignorant about the camouflage behind milk production. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that Sri Lankan milk-importing companies in Sri Lanka are aware of the dark secrets behind giant milk producers from whom they import milk and milk products. But no-one hears even a murmur of dissent from these companies against the unethical and cruel practices of their suppliers. It is not surprising; the milk-importing business is big money. Consequently it is not surprising that even institutions as savers of cattle from butchers throw moral principles and animal rights to the wind and import milk form abattoirs that function side by side in dairy farms abroad. The facts are stubborn and horrifyingly ugly; and could stand any challenge.
But, where is the Buddhist voice in this Buddhist country Why are animal rights activists in Sri Lanka so silent on the issue Importantly, in what manner is the government hoping to handle this two-facedness in this issue
Is the deafening silence the only answer to the whole sordid business

Allegations against ex-navy spokesman D.K.P. Dassanayake are baseless, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary, Udaya Gammanpila said today.
He told a news conference that Commodore Dassanayake was not involved in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth and the statements made by Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara with regard to the allegations were false and baseless.
"I challenge the police media spokesman to an open debate so that I could prove who should be arrested over the allegations made against Commodore Dassanayake," Mr. Gammanpila said.
He said a war hero should not be held responsible so-called abductions and disappearances.
"We are not in a position to defend the accused but we are keen to see that justice is meted out and provide evidence against those who should be arrested," Mr. Gammanpila said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Dr. Tilokasundari Kariyawasam: Iconic Lady who skilfully decorated the field of education
	
Dr. Tilokasundari Kariyawasam, the iconic Lady who skilfully decorated the field of education introducing modern scientific mechanisms in Sri Lanka, is sick no more. 
During the past half century, she was the towering personality who remained as a huge banyan shelter radiating knowledge and wisdom to the up-coming generations. Her psychological implementations were not limited to class room in schools, but diversified the scope of education for the benefit of infants, pupils, youth, adult and even those of the ruling class. 
She was born at Balummahara village in Siyanekorale, in 1927. Both, her parents were school principals. Her father was a descendent of Keragala Wanasinghe clan, while the mother belonged to the Mapa generation. Thus she not only inherited family prestige but also substantial fortune from cultivations and properties to lead a comfortable life. 
At first Tilokasundari was an old girl of Vishaka College Colombo, during the tenure of Clair a Motwani, as the Principal. During World War 11, she was admitted to Dharmapala College Pannipitiya and finally to Ananda College, when Mr. L.H. Mettananda was its Principal. Among her school mates while at Ananda, had been Sagara Palansuriya and W.S. Karunaratna (Later Prof. W.S.). Obtaining direct passes, she and W.S. together had entered the University of Ceylon at the time. 
Dr. Tilokasundari often reminiscence the serenity of rural life. She had even travelled daily to the campus, from their Rockhill Estate at Alawwa, which was located on top of a hill, 2000 feet high. Her days at campus during Sir Ivor Jennings, had been a glorious period. Most of her batch mates had later reached distinguished positions in the country. Among them were Felix Dias Bandaranaike, Irangani Serasinghe, Kamani Meedeniya, Irangani Gopallawa. Others included D.B.I.P.S. Siriwardene, Gunapala Senadhera, K.M.P. Rajaratne, Dharmapala Wethasinghe, Stanley Tilakaratne, Rupa Wethasinghe and Ilean Wickramasinghe (Mrs. Siriwardane) and Phylisia Makalanda. 
Whilst at the University Tilokasundari, for the first and last time had acted the main character in a drama titled Sunethra. The drama was produced by another batch mate named Piyadasa Kariyawasam. The event became a turning point in her life, as two of the couples who took part in it, later got married. Tilokasundari married Piyadasa, who also became a Director of Education while Ilean got married to D.B.I.P.S. later becoming the Principal of Vishaka College. 
In 1952, she started her educational career by joining the Tutorial Staff of Vishaka College, as a young graduate teacher. At the time Susan Pullimud, was its Principal. In 1958, Tilokasundari, became the Principal of Sangamitta College Galle and in the following year she was promoted to the rank of a grade one Principal. 

"Her books covered almost all the aspects education and deep philosophy in Buddhist doctrine blended with her skills and vast experiences"
During 1966 to 1968 she was awarded a British Council Scholarship to obtain her Phd, at the University of London. After she returned to Sangamitta, she was transferred as the Principal of Ananda Balika Maha Vidyalaya, Colombo. Meanwhile, she was elevated to the rank of Special Grade Principal which was also equivalent to the post of a Director of Education (D/E). 
Since February 1972, she functioned as the Regional Director of Education, for both Tangalla and Matara. 
In 1973, between July and October she served at the Ministry as the All Island D/E. Beginning in October 1973 to January 1976, she functioned as the D/E for Teachers Training Colleges. 
From January 1976 to April 1977 she became D/E for planning. 
In October 1977, she received a one year scholarship to the University of London, where she underwent a course of studies in Educational Planning, Administration and Management. 
Thereafter being a grade one D/E, she held the post of Commissioner of the Educational Publications, for a period of three years. 
In June 1983, she assumed duties as the Deputy Director General of Education at the Ministry. 
Finally in 1989, she simultaneously served as the Ministrys State Secretary and Director General of the National Institute of Education. However, due to pressure of work she relinquished her duties shortly, as the State Secretary. 
Dr. Tilokasundari, had also served as a Director in State Printing Corporation and Library Service Board. Besides as a member of the Vocational Educational Committee. Being excelled in both oriental and occidental languages Dr. Tilokasundari, had authored over 25 books in Sinhala and in English. She also had the gift of oratory and had represented Sri Lanka, in Inter National Parleys and conferences on a large number of occasions. 
Her books covered almost all the aspects education and deep philosophy in Buddhist doctrine blended with her skills and vast experiences. 
Some of these were titled as  Achievement of Primary Level Student of Sri Lanka in Reading and Mathematics, A Study of School Drop  Outs in the City of Colombo, Suggestions for The Preparation of Language Books, The Story of Three Friends, Feminism in Theravada Buddhism, Munidasa Kumaratunga  The Genious, Buddhist Woman and Family Life, National Assesment of Educational Progress in Mathematics in Sinhala in Sri Lanka, Buddhism and Psychology. 
Her demise is a great loss for the humanity at large creating an intellectual vacuum.

The GMOA said today the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) was acquired by the government on a lease agreement.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference the GMOA would consider the acquisition as one carried out without any transparency. He said Dr. Fernando or Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should brief the country about terms and conditions involved in the transaction.
He said even though the NFTH was acquired by the government it had not resolved the SAITM controversy.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen De Zoysa said NFTH was built at a cost of Rs.3.5 billion with a loan of Rs.2 billion granted by a State bank.
He said the government was allowing the hospital 10 years to settle the loan but the salaries and other costs would be borne by the government and asked on what basis was the government claiming that it had taken over the NFTH. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Hambantota Port deal signing next month
	
The Government had, more or less, finalised the agreement for leasing out the Hambantota Port to China Merchants and was planning to strike the deal shortly, sources told the Daily Mirror yesterday.
According a government source, two separate companies would be formed to deal with administrative and commercial operations of the port.
The majority equity of the company to be formed for administrative operations would be vested with the Sri Lankan side. Therefore, the source said there would be no need to amend Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act as a requirement to sign the deal.
However, the source said that the Chinese company would possess majority equity in the company proposed for commercial operations of the Port.
It is proposed to hand over 80 percent stake of the port to the Chinese side.
Initially, the Government decided to sign the agreement in January in conformity with President Maitripala Sirisenas second anniversary in office.
However, the move met with resistance from port workers and the sections of the general public.
Also, some legal impediments arose from Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act.
Afterwards, the Government appointed a Subcommittee to work out a criterion for the deal without leading to any legal snag.
The source said the Government was likely to ink the agreement next month. (Kelum Bandara)

ICICI Lombard files for first Indian IPO by a non-life insurer
	
REUTERS: ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of shares in what would be the first IPO by a non-life insurance company in Asias third-largest economy.
ICICI Lombards two main shareholders - ICICI Bank Ltd and Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd - will sell a combined 19 percent stake in the insurer in the IPO, according to the filing released on Friday.
Bankers estimate the IPO could raise 60 billion Indian rupees (US $932 million), making it one of the biggest Indian IPOs in recent years. Indias IPO market has been on a roll with companies raising $2.6 billion in the first half of 2017, after $4 billion in 2016, the best year for IPOs in six years.
ICICI Bank, Indias third-biggest lender by assets which owns about 63 percent of ICICI Lombard, plans to sell up to a 7 percent stake, or 31.8 million shares, in the IPO.
Fairfax, led by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa, is selling about 12 percent, or 54.5 million shares, in ICICI Lombard, the largest private sector non-life insurerin India.
It owns about 22 percent of the insurer, after it sold a 12.2 percent stake in May to investors including Warburg Pincus. That deal had valued ICICI Lombard at 203
billion rupees.
Fairfax, which is setting up a new insurance joint venture in India, needs to bring its stake in ICICI Lombard to below 10 percent to comply
with regulations.
SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd is also gearing up for an IPO this year which bankers have said could raise as much as $1 billion. Non-life insurance companies owned by the Indian government also have plans to go public in 2017-18.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ICICI Securities, IIFL Holdings are leading six banks on the ICICI
Lombard IPO.
CLSA, Edelweiss and JM Financial are the other banks on the deal.

1,662  killed 3,500 injured, Afghan civilian deaths hit new high: UN
	

KABUL AFP July17, 2017 -Civilian deaths in Afghanistan hit a new high in the first half of 2017 with 1,662 killed and more than 3,500 injured, the United Nations said Monday. 
Deaths in the capital Kabul accounted for nearly 20 percent of the toll, according to the report by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which has been documenting civilian casualties in the war-torn country since 2009. 
The majority of the victims were killed by anti-government forces -- including the Taliban and in attacks claimed by the Islamic State, the report said. 
The first six months of the year has seen a significant rise in the number of civilian lives lost in highly coordinated attacks involving more than one perpetrator, with 259 killed and 892 injured -- a 15 percent increase on the same period last year. 
The UNs special envoy to Afghanistan Tadamichi Yamamoto said the human cost of the conflict remains far too high. 
The continued use of indiscriminate, disproportionate and illegal improvised explosive devices is particularly appalling and must immediately stop, he added in a statement. 
A total of 174 women were killed and 462 injured -- an overall rise in casualties of 23 percent on last year -- while 436 children were killed in the same period, representing a nine percent increase.

Made-in-India warship to be largest in Sri Lankan Navys fleet
	
The Sri Lankan Navy is on the verge of commissioning its largest warship, which has been built in India under a Rs 1,000-crore contract inked four years ago for two such vessels.
The manufacturer, state-owned Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL), will deliver the first offshore patrol vessel to the Sri Lankan Navy at a ceremony at the yard on July 22.
The 105-metre long warship, with a displacement of around 2,400 tonnes, is expected to be commissioned into the Sri Lankan Navy on August 2.
It will be the largest warship to be operated by the Sri Lankan Navy. It is also the largest warship to be exported by an Indian shipyard. The step will deepen naval ties between the two countries, Rear Admiral Shekhar Mital told HT from Goa.
The shipyard has beaten the deadline for delivering the warship because of which the Sri Lankan Navy will induct the vessel almost three months ahead of the scheduled delivery. Sri Lanka will get the second warship in February 2018, again three months ahead of schedule.
Such patrol vessels carry out several roles including fleet support operations, maritime surveillance, defence of offshore installations and escorting high value ships.
Capable of reaching a top speed of 25 knots, the vessels have been designed to accommodate a helicopter on their flight decks.
The shipyard will also deliver a fast patrol vessel to Mauritius on August 9, the 14th such vessel to be delivered to that country during the last two years.(Hindustan Times)

Unity Govt. vital for country's development: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today stressed the need to continue the national government with the participation of the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) despite the difficulties.
He said this at the foundation-stone-laying-ceremony for the Viyathpura Green Professional City in Pannipitiya last morning.
Development projects such as this are not being implemented to get political advantage for the UNP or SLFP. It is a difficult task for two political parties to work together. It is the same when it comes to implementing a development project because you will not know where you end up if something goes wrong. However we need to work together for the sake of the country, the Prime Minister said. We formed the national government under President Maithripala Sirisena as we saw the need for major development programmes such as this and to provide a better future especially for those in the working class. We could have refrained from doing so but the main parties decided to work together instead. Let us continue to work together and try to solve the problems faced by the country. Lets work together so that people will praise both parties and then they will choose suitable candidates when we hold elections. The world community has kept a close watch on this alliance and we receive the support from all corners of the world and it has helped us to control the debt issue."
The Prime Minister said the total debt which the country has to repay within the next three years was Rs.4.2 trillion and stressed the need to build up a competitive market economy if the country was to be debt-free.
We will have to increase our total revenue and the tax revenue in particular to pay the debts. Sri Lanka will be in a position to do so by at least 2020, he said and added that the benefits of a competitive market economy should not be limited to a few who own industries.
We need the market economy and social justice to go hand in hand, the Premier said. (Yohan Perera)

Venezuela opposition holds unofficial plebiscite to defy Maduro
	

REUTERS, 16th JULY, 2017
Venezuelas opposition holds an unofficial referendum on Sunday to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro as he seeks to create a legislative superbody that his adversaries call the consolidation of a dictatorship.
The symbolic poll, which will also ask voters if they want early elections, is intended to further dent Maduros legitimacy amid a crippling economic crisis and three months of anti-government protests that have led to nearly 100 deaths. The opposition has cast the vote, which begins at 7 a.m. local time at some 2,000 centres around the country, as an act of civil disobedience to be followed by zero hour, a possible reference to a national strike or other escalated actions
against Maduro.
