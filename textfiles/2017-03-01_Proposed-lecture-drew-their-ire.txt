Proposed lecture  drew their ire


	



A Blue party conference organized by the former Madam was held in Negombo recently.

 


However, a big commotion created by some invitees marred the proceedings, they say.

Two purohitas, one of them a legal one at PC level and the other, a former secretarial one had set the ball rolling by taking up cudgels against the Madam for inviting a left-leaning theoretician holding a Green party seat in the Diyawanna council to deliver a lecture at the conference. 


They all had described the inclusion of this lecture in the conference agenda as a subtle move to enlist their support for some proposed Constitutional provisions which they had been opposing from the very outset.
