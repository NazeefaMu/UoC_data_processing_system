UPFA MP Lohan Ratwatte said today the person who defeated the SLFP was the party chairman and as such the party could not win under the present chairman.
“SLFP supporters at grassroots level are not in favour of the present party chairman as he was the one who worked against the party and defeated it. I like to tell our supporters to be patient until the right opportunity comes,” he said.
He said the party should either remain in the opposition or in the government.
Mr. Ratwatte said the situation in the country was so complicated now and seems as if the war victory would be reversed. “The LTTE is raising its head again. LTTE prisoners should not be released.  I’m completely against this move,” he said. (Nadeeka Dayaa Bandara)WATCH
