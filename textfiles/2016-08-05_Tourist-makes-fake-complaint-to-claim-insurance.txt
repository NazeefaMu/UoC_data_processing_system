Police have found that a complaint lodged by a British tourist claiming that his gold ring worth Rs. 280,000 was stolen from a hotel he was staying, was fake and it was aimed at fraudulently making an insurance claim.

The complaint had been made that the gold ring studded with a diamond and another electronic device worth Rs. 28,000 had been stolen from his room in the hotel he was staying in the Gampola area.He had also requested a copy of the complaint as he was due to leave the country on Friday (5) after staying in the country for 15 days.

Meanwhile the police began investigations and when they searched the hotel room and the safe where the tourist had kept his valuables they found several gold jewellery in the safe.

The keys of the safe and the room had been with the tourist throughout his stay in the hotel.

Police later became suspicious about the remaining jewellery as a thief would not have left them intact.

Later investigations revealed that the complaint was false and the tourist intended to make a false insurance claim.

Police refused to give a copy of the complaint to the tourist. (Suranga Rajanayaka)
