Multi Finance PLC (MFP), one of the country’s earliest established financial institutions, is ushering in a new era of digitized financial services, following its acquisition by the real estate development giant, Fairway Holdings. 


A rapidly diversifying conglomerate, the Fairway group has expanded to operate across a plethora of industries following a unique business model for wealth creation for all stakeholders. 


MFP, drawing from a four-decade-long legacy built on trust and integrity, is set to align with the Fairway group’s vision, rebuilding on the company’s sterling repute to offer customers a highly enhanced array of financial services.


With financial stability and massive growth potential, MFP will reinforce its identity as one of Sri Lanka’s premier financial institutions through heavy investment in talent acquisition and development for the company’s immediate expansion. 


“In keeping with the pace of digitization across the globe, we, at Multi Finance PLC, are restructuring our business offerings to align with a new, digitized business model,” commented MFP Head of Human Resources Meditha Karunatillaka.


“In today’s dynamic financial environment, the customers demand highly personalized services with transparent benefits and risks. To offer such customized money management solutions, MFP is investing in developing a new breed of financial managers through a specialized leadership training programme.”


Targeting two tiers of graduates and freshers with a passion for financial servicing, marketing, management, credit, recoveries, operations and accounting, the 24-month bridging programme is strategically structured to include integral subjects, on the job training, theory and practical knowledge with industry expert guidance, thereby building a strong career path for all trainees to progress forward as highly competent, cross-functional financial managers. 


“The inaugural batch of trainees will be chosen following strict selection criteria. We are not looking for a financial background. We are looking for the best performers to join us, grow with us and become part of the new MFP culture, to advance MFP and also drive Sri Lanka’s financial industry forward. This is a professional development programme that develops and equips future financial leaders to innovate and implement new value channels, better servicing customers in the management and maturing of their finances,” Meditha continued.


All trainees will be offered multiple benefits, including loans at special interest rates, insurance, personal loans for studies, incentives, etc. Upon the successful completion of the 24-month programme, a certification of completion accredited by a recognized institute or university will be awarded to all trainees. 


“As a long-established, responsible financial institution, our ambition now is to develop new- age financial gurus to provide the best financial management services Sri Lanka has to offer,” elaborated Meditha.


“This programme serves as the perfect foundation for skilled and motivated graduates and school leavers who are ambitious to build a highly progressive career upon. This opportunity is not for dreamers, but for achievers.”
