World Cup winning team to raise funds for past cricketers

The 1996 World Cup Champion team will be back in action when they clash with an All Stars XI in an exhibition cricket match which is scheduled to take place on March 19 (Saturday) at the CCC grounds, Maitland Crescent.
The main aim of organizing this match is to build a trust fund for the welfare of past cricketers who need financial support and to launch a water purification project.
The event is organized by the members of the 1996 World Cup winning team along with the official sponsor of the victorious Lankan team, Singer Sri Lanka PLC.
"The Sri Lankan Cricketers Association will also join in as well as our principal sponsors Singer. Singer was the sponsor in 1996. The match is also being used to promote a water purification project in Anuradhapura. If we can raise funds the proceeds of that we are going to channel it through a water purification project in Anuradhapura," said Roshan Mahanama.
"We will also set up a fund for past cricketers. No sooner I say that or no sooner I briefed them at a group, people were wondering why a fund for past cricketers. They were laughing as well. But, what people don't realize is say, in any era, over a period of 10 years it will be only 60-70 cricketers who will end up playing for Sri Lanka. For us to get the 60- 70 cricketers, what we don't realize is that there are another three to four hundred cricketers and they don't get benefited to that extent," he said.
"Without them obviously you can't get the cream or the best of cricket and sadly in the country, I know individually almost everyone from previous era's upto the current era, they have helped one another. But there's no organization and the only person who thought about a benevolent fund for cricketers was Minister Gamini Dissanayake. I don't know which year. But I remember him saying that we want to setup a benevolent fund for past cricketers. But it never got if off the ground.
"So, we need to start somewhere as a stepping stone. And it will be done jointly. What we intend to do is to setup a trust fund through the Sri Lanka Cricket Association together with the members of the '96 World Cup winning squad," the '96 World Cup team member and ICC Match Referee Mahanama, who is an organizer of the event told the Daily News.
Speaking further about the water purification project, Mahanama said, "This is a project that has been identified by the Singer team as well. Singer has been doing a lot of projects. We thought we will go with a project that has been identified rather than go in search of new projects.
"In other countries, the Player Associations are fully involved in promoting and looking after the cricketers after they retire. This is also one of the reasons the Association is involved. The current players are well-established. What we have done in the past is promoting and looking after the welfare of the past cricketers. But we must also find out how we get the resources for it. The resources are from the current cricketers. Current cricketers used to contribute a few percentages from their salary into the fund. That is here.
"In other countries they do make a contribution through the Cricket Board. The Cricket Boards of the other countries give a percentage of their revenue to the Players Association. The Players' Association looks after the interest of the players. There are cricketers who don't have job opportunities after they retire.
A classic example is in Sri Lanka we have cricketers like Roy Dias and other big names who were top cricketers. But sad to say, financially whether they are stable is the question. They are almost 65-70 years old and still coaching," commented former cricketer and cricket administrator Ken de Alwis, who also joined the conversation.
The Sri Lankan cricketing legends likes of first Test captain Bandula Warnapura, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene who dominated Sri Lanka cricket in the last three decades since 1980 are due to represent the 'All Stars XI'.
After the cricket match at the same venue, arrangements have been made to stage a musical evening featuring well known Sri Lankan artists. Whilst enjoying music Sri Lankan cricket fans will get a great opportunity to meet their cricketing heroes of yesteryear who will be there to grace this wonderful occasion.
