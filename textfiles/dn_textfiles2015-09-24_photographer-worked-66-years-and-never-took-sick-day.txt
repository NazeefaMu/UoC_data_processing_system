Photographer worked for 66 years and never took a sick day

US: The top of Timothy Hyman's desk is barely visible, with piles of head shots of current and former state employees scattered across it. Enlarged photos of highways, bridges and intersections throughout the state of Maryland are taped to his office walls.
The pictures are just a few of the thousands taken by Hyman, the staff photographer for the Maryland State Highway Administration for more than a half-century.
Hyman, who will turn 78 next week, retires this month as the state's longest-serving employee. For 60 years, Hyman has focused on Maryland history in the making, documenting the construction of roadways, snapping pictures of more ribbon-cutting ceremonies than he can remember and capturing on film (and, more recently, digitally) the state's changing transportation landscape.
Gov. Larry Hogan honored Hyman this month for not only his years in state government but also his commitment to his job. In his 66 years of working for the state, Hyman never took a sick day.
"Tim Hyman is truly an inspiration to us all," Hogan said as he presented Hyman with a proclamation for his retirement at a Board of Public Works meeting on Sept. 16. The relics of six decades in state government fill Hyman's small corner office in a state office park not far from Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport.
Taped to the wall near his door is a copy of a 1963 photo of President John F. Kennedy participating in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Interstate 95, near the Delaware line, with Maryland Gov. Millard Tawes and Delaware Gov. Elbert Carvel. The photo was taken days before Kennedy's assassination.
Packing up his belongings one recent day, Hyman pulled a file from his desk drawer that contained a program for the Eastern Region Military-Civilian Safety Conference at the Statler Hilton of Annapolis. It was dated 1969.
