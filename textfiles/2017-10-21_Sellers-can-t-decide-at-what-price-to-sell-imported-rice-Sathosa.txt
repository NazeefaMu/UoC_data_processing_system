The 200,000 metric tonnes of rice, which was scheduled to be imported from Burma, Thailand, India and Pakistan would not be allowed to be sold at prices higher than was stipulated by the government, Lanka Sathosa Chairman T.M.K.B Tennakoon said.

Addressing the media he said the rice stocks would be imported by the end of the year. He said that the rice would be distributed using a Government distribution mechanism as well as through private importers.

“The stock of rice would be distributed via Sathosa, Cooperatives (MPCSs) and major super markets while it will also be sold to retailers by Sathosa,” he said.

“The selling price of rice will be monitored by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA). Those selling rice cannot do so after keeping a large profit margin and they cannot decide at which price it should be sold,” he said.

“There is an Maximum Sales Retail Price (MSRP) set by Sathosa. Sellers from rural areas should sign an agreement with us, adhering to the controlled price at which they are allowed to sell. That price can include their transport cost and profit,” the Sathosa Chairman said.

Accordingly the details of the sellers and their agreed selling price would be given to the CAA for monitoring. However, he said that local millers could decide on their own prices and the MSRP set by Sathosa would not affect them. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
