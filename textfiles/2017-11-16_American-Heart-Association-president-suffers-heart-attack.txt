DAILY MAIL, 15th NOVEMBER, 2017  
The 52-year-old president of the American Heart Association suffered a heart attack during the organization’s annual conference.  


John Warner, CEO of UT Southwestern University Hospitals in Dallas and a practicing cardiologist, suffered a ‘minor’ episode on Monday morning in Anaheim, California.  


It came hours after he delivered his keynote speech on Sunday afternoon about preventing heart attacks in older people, sharing that all the men suffered heart conditions in their 60s.  


Warner was taken to a local hospital near the conference, where doctors inserted a stent to open a clogged artery - a common move that Warner performs often himself, but one that was brought into question by a recent study which found the operation carries more risks than benefits.  


He was met at the hospital by his wife, daughter and son who all had come to watch his speech at the conference.
