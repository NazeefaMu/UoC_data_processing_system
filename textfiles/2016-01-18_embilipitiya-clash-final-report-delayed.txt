	The final investigation report into the death of the youth in Embilipitiya, which was to be released today was not released as scheduled as the investigations were not yet concluded, a senior Police officer told Daily Mirror.
	He said that interim report into the incident was handed over to the IGP N.K. Illangakoon last Saturday and the final report would be submitted after January 27.
	“Several inquiries into the incident are yet to be recorded and the final report would be finalized after the initial inquiries are completed,” he said.
	Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon last week instructed Sabaragamuwa Province DIG, C.D. Wickramaratna to hand over the final investigation report in the death of the youth in Embilipitiya on January 18.
	The Police Chief ordered an investigation into the alleged brawl between the police and residents which resulted in the death of the 29-year-old, Sumith Prasanna Jayawardana.
	He was killed after falling off the third floor of a house during a clash between the police and the residents on January 4. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
