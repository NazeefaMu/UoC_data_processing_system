Sumanthiran visits A'pura Prison

TNA MP and Spokesperson M. A. Sumanthiran visited the Anuradhapura Prison along with Provincial Council members, Asmin Yakoob and Sanankiyan Sayandan yesterday and spoke to the Tamil prisoners being held under the PTA.
The prisoners were on a token fast demanding their release by the government. At the Anuradhapura Prison 36 prisoners were observing the fast of whom two had already been hospitalized. They vowed to continue the fast until the government released all Tamil Prisoners and requested that the public too join their cause.
The prisoners in relating their individual stories said that they had already served a much longer term than their crimes warranted in the event they had been convicted. They requested TNA MP and Spokesperson M. A. Sumanthiran to take their issue with the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister on hearing same said that he was awaiting a report from the AG's Department on their stance on the prisoners.
Sumanthiran reiterated the point he made last week in Parliament on the party's stand on the matter which is that All Political Prisoners be released as agreed by the government. In the event the government does not respond in the next few days they too would be forced to join the prisoners in their fasting.
