THE BIG QUESTION


	



I am sure you will all recall times when you have had multiple questions on anything and everything – some small and easily resolved, others complicated and needing extensive exploration – the latter being successful, only if you are open to rational thinking!

For me, there is one big question that needs prompt responding – not about black holes, extra-terrestrial life or even the ‘creation’. But I have been on the hunt for a convincing conclusion on this issue. What I want to know is ‘what happens to us next’…

No one can deny that we have been extremely lucky to have been born into this life as a complete human being and then, having been able to find a suitable job or qualify to pursue a career, to support this life. Some of us, I know, are quite complacent, taking comfort in the thought that this is the end of the story for us, as their particular spirituality dictates, and being confident that all will be well in the end. (‘How so?’ is what you will have to ask next, rationally speaking). Others think that all is planned for you by the benevolent deity, (is that not too simplistic?), and think nothing of it until you are on the other side! (Well, wouldn’t that be too late?).


Each individual is identifiable only by his or her karma and not by his or her physical form, which is composed of the four basic elements that will invariably disintegrate


Afterlife

When conditions are so abstract, in my humble opinion, it is not too much to ask of yourself what the options available are, to explore this ‘big question’. The various scriptures can be the first port of call: As mentioned earlier, a benevolent deity who would have a ‘sense of duty’ or even an obligation to see to the welfare of His ‘creation’ may seem too simplistic. But if it is relevant to you and you are happy with it, that is all that matters and the case will be deemed to be closed. But if you accept the outcome afteryou cross over, come-what-may, what will be your position then? Will it not be too late for any remedial engagement? Is there a process for appeal or are you prepared for what comes next anyway? The question now is, are you prepared to take this risk? Taking everything into consideration it appears prudent to think seriously about what comes next, before it is too late.

Does science say anything about an afterlife? Not directly, as this phenomenon cannot be objectively verified. Browsing through scientific literature however, one cannot help, but notice the tendency to acknowledge the continuation of life and the scepticism with regard to a benevolent source of power. These ideas are even reflected in science fiction, which continues to be popular to this day. For objective proof of course, one would have to bide time for about another century, but no one reading this article today will have that kind of lifespan at their disposal.

For those who believe that there is continuation of life after death, there are other issues to consider: What will this new life be like or where will it take place? Will it be me, as myself or will it be as a different living being? The answers to these questions are all found in The Buddha’s Teaching. He confirms that life has been continuing from time immemorial and will continue uninhibited into the future, so much so that it is futile to look for its beginning, but recommends working towards one’s salvation right from here and now. He has described His past lives in many of his discourses and a collection of 550, as The Jathaka (rebirth) Stories, are included in the Tripitaka, The Canon of Theravada Buddhism. The Buddha’s Teaching is the only major doctrine that does not support ‘Creation’ by an almighty being. Instead He has described the accumulation of ‘Karma’, both good and bad, which will follow the doer through their sojourn in life (samsara), creating the environment in which each life is sustained. Karma is not transferable and will not disintegrate or dissipate except under special circumstances.


Others think that all is planned for you by the benevolent deity, (is that not too simplistic?), and think nothing of it until you are on the other side! (Well, wouldn’t that be too late?)


It will produce results according to the type of karma accrued. Each individual is identifiable only by his or her karma and not by his or her physical form, which is composed of the four basic elements that will invariably disintegrate. Hence there is no place for a soul, or anything that is permanent, for any identification. There are plenty of lifeforms, both unseen and seen with our naked eye. One may therefore be reborn as any such lifeform, dependant on the karmic force exerted. According to The Buddha, to achieve another human existence is virtually impossible. Should this be the case, it goes without saying how important it is to make the best use of this human life and seek salvation. It needs a large chunk of good fortune (karmic energy) to re-establish human life. As all things that arise dependent on a cause are impermanent, they lead to ‘un-satisfactoriness’ and suffering. 

This is known as ‘Dependent Origination’ (Patichcha Samuppada). The Buddhist doctrine enumerates The Four Noble Truths as its foundation and The Noble Eight-Fold Path as a means of depleting the repeated births in samsara in order to reach Nirvana. The Buddha proclaimed that:

‘All conditioned things are subject to change, It is natural for every living thing to end in death.’


The answers to these questions are found in The Buddha’s Teaching. He confirms that life has been continuing from time immemorial


By following The Noble Eight-Fold Path, one can extinguish the flames of recurrent births and secure safe passage into Nirvana. It is up to the reader to explore widely and choose wisely.

May all beings be well and happy!
