LankaPay Technnovation Awards 2017 recognized the banks and non-banking financial institutions which have been steadfast to the cause of using innovative technology to promote digital transactions and excelled in this endeavour. 
Initiated with the objective of reducing the cost of financial transactions by promoting the use of country’s national payment network, LankaPay Technnovation Awards 2017 took into account the interbank transactions carried out during the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017. 
The selection process of the eventual winners underwent a rigorous and extensive two-tiered evaluation process. The initial evaluation was carried out based on the performance of individual banks and non-banking financial institutions against a set criteria defined and communicated at the commencement of the competition period. 
The validation of the data used for this initial evaluation and shortlisting process was subjected to an independent audit process carried out by E&Y. At the second stage of evaluation, the shortlisted winners presented their case to an independent eminent panel of judges who determined the final winners.
This was an initiative aptly supported by the Central Bank while the independent panel of judges was chaired by Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry Secretary Wasantha Deshapriya. The other members of the elite panel of judges were Management Systems (Pvt.) Ltd Chairman and Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka Past President Asite D.B. Talwatte, Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka President and BR De Silva Partner Lasantha Wickremasinghe, Colombo Stock Exchange Chief Executive Officer Rajeeva Bandaranaike, Manil Jayasinghe – Head of Assurance/Senior Partner, Professional Practice Director, in charge of Banking and Financial Services Practice of Ernst & Young and council member of ICASL and Kapruka.com Founder and Chairman Dulith Herath.
