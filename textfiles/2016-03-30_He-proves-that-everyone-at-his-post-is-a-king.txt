He proves that everyone at his post is a king


	



 

A certain uniformed bigwig in the Defense establishment was among those who had received summons to attend a special high-powered conference at the nerve-centre of yahapalanaya. 

 


The Big Boss and several purohitas holding key portfolios had arrived for the conference on time and they were about to proceed with the business when they noted the absence of the bigwig from the Defense establishment.    
In fact, the bigwig in uniform also arrived on time, but the office aide posted at the entrance to usher in the arrivals told him that his name was not among those listed to be allowed in. The Defense bigwig who found himself in a dilemma decided to sit outside and wait for what was to come.
The Big Boss who took the chair, the first to note the absence of the Defense bigwig, proposed to wait for his arrival to get on with the proceedings. They waited for about one hour, but the Defense one failed to show up.
A visibly angry Big Boss sent for the office aide on duty at the entrance and when the latter appeared, he asked him: “Didn’t …….arrive for the conference?”
“He turned up about one and half hours ago…he is waiting outside,” replied the office aide. 
“So why on earth didn’t you send him in?”
“But, Sir, I had been given strict instructions not to send in unwanted characters,” the aide replied.
“How can an official like …..be an unwanted character?”
“He has not been listed as an invitee. So I presumed that he is not wanted…,” the office aide explained. 
The Big Boss who looked highly amused dismissed the office aide and started the conference without further delay.
