It has been a year since you Passed away  
We still think of you Everyday  
Those we love don’t go Away  
They walked beside us Every day  
Unseen Unhered But always near  
You are still Loved and missed Every day !  
May Jesus grant you eternal peace!  
Your loving Husband & Son , Sisters & Brothers
