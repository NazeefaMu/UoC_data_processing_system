He says he too is in their boat


	

An opposition Diyawanna member had recently made representations to a top white-collar one at the august assembly on behalf of a group of employees who over the years had been deprived of salary increments and promotions. 

 


The white collar high-up had responded that the fact that employees were stagnating on the same salary and the same post for years did not surprise him because he himself was being underpaid and he had failed so far to get those responsible to place him on the proper salary stage.


“My predecessor had been drawing a monthly salary of Rs.94,000. But what I am receiving is a pay much lower than that,” he had added.


By the way, the opposition member had also pointed out to the high-up that the officers in higher grades had been granted higher pay in the recent past while unjustly denying those in minor grades a simultaneous upward pay revision.
