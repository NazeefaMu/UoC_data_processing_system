Ravi's late attendance causes stir in House


	

Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake walking in late for parliamentary sessions caused a stir in the House today.

A few minutes earlier Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked why the minister was not present to answer a question."The minister had informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry that he was unable to be present at its proceedings as he had to attend Parliament. However, he is not present here either," Mr Dissanayake said.

The minister arrived at around 2.30 p.m. and said he was late because he was with President Maithripala Sirisena and some diplomats. He then answered a question asked by JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
