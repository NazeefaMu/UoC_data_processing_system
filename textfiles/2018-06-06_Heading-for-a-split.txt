Heading for a split


	



 

Signs of a serious rift within the Gang of 16 have begun to appear, they say

 


When most of them insist that they should lose no time in teaming up with the former strongman, there is a trio adamant they should make this irrevocable move along with their present party leader pointing out that it is politically suicidal for them all to burn bridges behind without the latter in tow. 
The flamboyant one from Uva is the most articulate one among the three dissidents. The other two are senior Banda from the hills and the former sporty one from Wayamba who recently got entangled in the bond net. 


The gang is heading for serious split unless they decide to hold their horses to reach a consensus or a compromise, they say.
