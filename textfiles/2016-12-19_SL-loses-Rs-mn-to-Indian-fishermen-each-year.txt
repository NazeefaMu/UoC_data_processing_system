The Sri Lankan fishing industry incurred a loss of Rs. 9,000 million each year due to illegal fishing by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters, the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry recently said.

Issuing a statement, subject Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said Indian fishermen illegally snared close to 6,000 tons of fish in Sri Lankan waters each week.

“At least three Indian fishing boats enter Sri Lankan waters every week, which is nearly 5,000 fishing boats entering our waters illegally each year. This is a huge threat to the Sri Lankan fishing industry,” the minister said in the statement.

However, he also said the number of Indian fishing boats entering Sri Lanka illegally had decreased by 50 percent, when compared to previous years, due to the high level of security provided by the Sri Lankan Navy and the Sri Lankan Coast Guard.
