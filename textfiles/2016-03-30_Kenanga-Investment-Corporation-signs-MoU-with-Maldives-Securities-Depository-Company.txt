A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed recently between Kenanga Investment Corporation Limited (KICL) and Maldives Securities Depository Company (Pvt.) Ltd (MSD).
The MoU was signed by MD/CEO Rohan Senanayake and Director Surath Peiris on behalf of KICL, while MD/CEO Hassan Manik signed on behalf of MSD.


Senanayake explained that with KICL entering into this MoU with MSD, KICL had led the way for a formal endorsement for Sri Lankan investment bankers to take advantage of a range of lucrative corporate finance opportunities in the Maldives.


“KICL has been invited by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) to participate in the proposed investor forum organised in collaboration with the Maldivian Stock Exchange to create awareness among Maldivian corporates on the advantages of listing on the CSE. 


Being the overseas investment arm of Malaysian-listed company K & N Kenanga Holdings Berhard, a highly established financial group in Malaysia with experience over four decades, this MoU expands the depth, breadth and scope of services offered by KICL to the market, leveraging on the strengths we possess,” he said of the group’s operations in equity broking, investment banking, future broking, treasury, corporate advisory, Islamic banking, wealth management and investment management.

 
KICL, established in Sri Lanka in 2007, specializes in capital market activities with its core strengths in investment banking and fund management encompassing a formidable presence in Sri Lanka’s investment banking arena, facilitating the listing of companies, raising corporate debt through listed debentures and providing advisory services for several restructuring ventures, mergers and acquisitions.


Senanayake stated, “Building on the synergies of the Kenanga group’s established presence in Asia and Middle East, through direct equity participations and strategic partnerships in Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia, KICL is looking forward to expansion within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region, with this MoU being the first step in that process and South India being earmarked next.”
