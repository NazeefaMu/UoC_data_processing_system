Mind your flu

The influenza season is around the corner. Before joining the club of influenza victims, read on the following precautions and stay off this menace. Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha speaks to Health Watch on what kind of action to take in order to prevent influenza.
Q: What is Influenza?
A: Influenza is an acute viral infection caused by an influenza virus. There are three types of influenza viruses. They are A, B and C. Type A influenza viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of various virus surface proteins. Among many sub types of influenza, A viruses, influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) sub types have a tendency to spread. Influenza viruses circulate in all parts of the world. Type C influenza cases occur much less frequently than A and B. That is why only influenza A and B viruses are included in influenza vaccines.

There are two annual seasons for the disease: one in May, June and July and the other in December, January and February. The second season of this year has already started and over 200 samples obtained from the patients had been tested and over 50 of them found positive for the viruses. Seasonal epidemics and disease burden in temperate climates and seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.
Q: What are the main signs and symptoms?
A: Seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat and runny nose. Cough can be severe and can last two or more weeks. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention. But influenza can cause severe illness or death especially in people at high risk. The time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about two to four days.
Q: Who is at risk?
A: Yearly influenza epidemics can seriously affect all populations, but the highest risk of complications occur among children younger than age two years, adults aged 65 years or older, pregnant women, and people of any age with certain medical conditions, such as chronic heart, lung, kidney, liver, blood or metabolic diseases (such as diabetes), or weak immune systems.
Q: How does Influenza transmit?
A: Seasonal influenza spreads easily and can sweep through schools, nursing homes, businesses or towns. When an infected person coughs, infected droplets get into the air and another person can breathe them in and be exposed. The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, and wash their hands regularly.
The virus spread up to one metre when released to the air and exist in the air for about few minutes. It survives in the environment (door knobs, surfaces of tables, hand rests, bars attached to buses, trains etc) for a longer period. It survives in air conditioned environments for much longer period than in a normal open environment. The illnesses can result in hospitalization and death mainly among high-risk groups (the very young, elderly or chronically ill). Clinics and hospitals can be overwhelmed during peak illness periods.
Q: How can Influenza be prevented?
A: The most effective way to prevent the disease and/or severe outcomes from the illness is vaccination. Safe and effective vaccines are available and have been used for more than 60 years. Among healthy adults, influenza vaccine can provide reasonable protection. However among the elderly, influenza vaccine may be less effective in preventing illness but may reduce the severity of disease and incidence of complications and deaths. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of serious influenza complications, and for people who live with or care for high risk individuals.
WHO recommends annual vaccination for pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy, children aged six months to five years, elderly individuals (over 65 years of age), individuals with chronic medical conditions, health-care workers. Influenza vaccination is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with vaccine viruses. Influenza viruses are constantly changing. For many years WHO has updated its recommendation on vaccine composition biannually that targets the three (trivalent) most representative virus types in circulation (two sub types of influenza A viruses and one B virus). Starting with the 2013-2014 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, quadrivalent vaccine composition has been recommended with a second influenza B virus in addition to the viruses in the conventional trivalent vaccines. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines are expected to provide wider protection against influenza B virus infections.
Flu injection is very effective to prevent complications such as pneumonia.
WHO highly recommends that pregnant women, elderly (healthy) individuals can also prevent influenza before the season or during an epidemic. The side effects of this vaccine are rare and local effects are painful at injection site. Flu will last only two days if developed. Once taken, the vaccine is effective for one year and need to take annually.
Avoiding crowded places during epidemics is also recommended. Wearing masks also help prevent spreading the disease but it is not highly effective.
The infected person should stay at home until fever settles and they should not go to work or school. They should take plenty of fluids and adequate rest. No need to avoid any particular food, they should not take Aspirin. Pregnant women with flu should seek medical treatment during the first 48 hours from a qualified medical practitioner. Other vulnerable groups should pay attention to difficulty in breathing, increase tiredness, sleepiness as danger signs. Transplant patients may not develop fever and need to be extra careful of illness.
