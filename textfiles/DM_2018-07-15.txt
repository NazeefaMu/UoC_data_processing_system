England, which lost to Croatia in the semifinals, matched its best World Cup result  fourth in 1990  since winning the tournament for the only time in 1966.
France and Croatia will play in the final on Sunday at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.
Belgium's previous best finish at the World Cup was fourth, but the team outplayed England in the midfield to go one better this time.
The Belgians could easily have scored more, with Pickford making a good save to stop a shot from De Bruyne in the 11th and Alderweireld volleying narrowly over the bar in the 35th.

Bus fare hike if Govt. failed to meet demands: ACPBA
	
The All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) said that it would go for a bus fare increase if the Government failed to look at their demands favourably.
Speaking to the media at a press briefing in Gampaha today ACPBA Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said that buses incurred losses due to the recent fuel price increase.
Short distance buses incur a loss of Rs.750 daily and Rs. 22,500 monthly, while long-distance buses incur a loss of Rs.40,000 monthly, he said.
The Government should provide a loan at a concessionary rate of two per cent when buying new buses and should omit the tax imposed on tyres, tubes and spare parts, he said.

Death Sentence: List of 18 submitted to Justice Ministry
	
A list consisting names of 18 convicts, who were sentenced to death for drug-related crimes, had been submitted to the Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry, Prisons Spokesman Commissioner Thushara Upuldeniya said.
He said the list was submitted on Friday (13) evening.
He said the security inside the Prisons had been beefed up to curb drug smuggling by convicted drug traffickers.
He said the Prison Department had also limited the meals brought by outsiders to such inmates, to prevent communication.
Meanwhile, the Department had also separated the convicted drug traffickers from other inmates to cutoff their supplies and connections with the outside world and other inmates.
According to the measure, the Department hoped to expand its intelligence and equip Prison Officers with better equipment.
Commissioner Upuldeniya added that the Department had planned to launch an awareness campaign targeting convicted drug traffickers to educate them over the harm of drugs and discourage them from drug-trafficking.
Meanwhile, the Prison Department announced last week, that it would call for applications to recruit two hangmen this week to execute the death sentences.
President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday (11) stated that he would sign off on the execution of capital punishment following an alarming rise in drug menace.
He noted that drug racketeers, who were convicted and serving jail terms continued their operations, while in prison and called on the Justice Ministry to provide a list of the names of individuals, who had been sentenced to death over drug-related crimes. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Education sector to disrupt due to a token strike
	
Countrys education sector to disrupt due to an islandwide token strike by Education Administrative service officers, school principals and teachers on Thursday (26) urging the Government to suspend 1,014 appointments made under the political victimization scheme immediately.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said despite the strong trade union protests, around 1,014 individuals were promoted to Sri Lanka Education Service.
Principals and teachers showed their displeasure by reporting sick leave on July 04 on the date the appointments were granted.
Mr. Stalin said that unions held discussions with the Prime Minister and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara on July 03 at the Parliament, and met the Public Service Commission officials on July 10 where they gave two weeks to withdraw their decision.
He explained that until now it had not received any response from the officials, therefore, will resort to a token strike on Thursday (26).
A total of 17 unions in the education sector had given their consent for the trade union action including the Education Administrative service officers.
We were compelled to take stern trade union action due to Governments move to destroy the entire education sector with unqualified individuals. The education system of the country will be disrupted on Thursday due to authorities short-sighted arbitrary move, he added.
He further said that among the appointed individuals to the sector under the political victimization, 27 individuals had failed the G.C.E Ordinary Level Mathematics subject while another 138 were found guilty on disciplinary grounds. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

EU says no to Death penalty
	
The heads of diplomatic missions of the European Union (EU) countries would convey their displeasure to President Maithripala Sirisena on the move to execute death sentence, the Daily Mirror learned.
According to diplomatic sources, the heads of resident missions of the EU countries would do so in keeping with their common position to oppose the death penalty all over the world.
Sri Lankan courts hands down the death sentence. Nevertheless, no execution has taken place since 1976. As a result, those sentenced to death are virtually commuted life in prison.
President Sirisena announced recently that he would place his signature to hang death to two criminals found to be operating drug trafficking from their prison cells with the covert support of the Prison Authorities.
Currently, there are over 1,200 prisoners sentenced to death.
The Justice Ministry announced yesterday that it had submitted a list of 18 such criminals found involved in drug trafficking rackets operating from prison cells.
Sri Lanka voted in favour of the moratorium on the death penalty at a UN forum in 2016, confirming its commitment taken during the 6th World Congress against the Death Penalty in June 2016.
Wherever death penalty is implemented, we would urge that Government to stop it, the diplomatic source said,
Two years ago, Sri Lanka voted in favour of a worldwide moratorium on death penalty. For example, if Sri Lanka were a European country, it could not even become a member of the council of the European Union.
It is nothing new. The European Union and its member States are campaigning all over the world for the abolition of the death penalty.
Asked whether the EU diplomatic missions would take it up with the Government, the diplomatic source said: We will do it in a short time. (Kelum Bandara)

Fake passport racket helping Lankans fly abroad as Indians busted in TN
	
Indian Police have busted a fake passport racket in Tamil Nadu, which helped Sri Lankan nationals fly abroad from the city as Indian citizens, the PTI reported.
Two Sri Lankans, including a 38-year-old woman, suspected to be part of the racket, have been arrested, police said.
Earlier, the crime branch wing had arrested 11 people, including a travel agent, for allegedly preparing fake passports by collecting amounts of up to Rs 10 lakh from Sri Lankan nationals.
Police said investigations revealed that the woman had come to Tamil Nadu from the island nation on a tourist visa some time back and had been staying here well past its expiry date.
She had sought the help of the travel agent, who prepared a fake passport for her.
Her accomplice, who also possessed a Sri Lankan passport, managed to get a fake Aadhar card for her, police said.
The woman and her accomplice were arrested from a house in the city on Friday and produced before a local court, which later sent them to Puzhal central prison.
Describing the modus operandi, police said the travel agent used to prepare fake Indian passports for Sri Lankan nationals, based on the information he received from his aide in Colombo.
The man, with the help of his gang, collected expired passports from people of economically weaker sections and sold them to Sri Lankan nationals as valid Indian passports for a monetary consideration.
Police also recovered 77 Indian passports, 12 Sri Lankan passports and machines used to prepare them and cash of Rs 85,000.

HRCSL wants President to revoke death penalty view
	
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) in a letter sent to President Maithripala Sirisena had requested to revoke his decision to enforce the capital punishment on drug traffickers and implement a powerful and long-term policy framework for the suppression of grave crimes, including drug trafficking.
HRCSL Chairperson Dr Deepika Udagama expressing the Commissions opinion stated that the death penalty was a cruel and inhumane punishment, and seriously violated several human rights, including the right to life and freedom and was an extreme and irreversible punishment but ineffective as a deterrent.
She said that the commission admitted that major social issues caused by drug trafficking, including youths addiction to drugs, was exerting undue pressure on future generations and therefore, drug smugglers were engaged in a seriously anti-social process.
"However, it is the Commission's view that it could be curbed only by apprehending drug traffickers efficiently and enforcing serious punishments appropriate to their crimes, not by implementing punishments such as death penalty," she said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Money circulation down: PM
	
The demand for consumer goods had gone down as a result of money circulation decline in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
However, he assured that the Government had decided to pump in money into the villages through the Gam Peraliya programme under which maintenance of tanks would be handed over to farmers.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this while speaking at the launching of Gam Peraliya in Nikaweratiya last morning.
Livelihood of the people in this area had come to a standstill as a result of the long-term drought, which lasted for four harvesting seasons.
People in this area cannot cultivate crops. What can they do except cultivating crops The economic downturn is visible today. Sales of consumer goods have gone down. Money circulation in the country has declined, the Prime Minister said.
He said some areas had got water to cultivate essential crops but that was hardly efficient.
This is why we decided to focus on villages. If we renovate tanks the villages will benefit from these projects. The contracts to desilt them will be given to the villagers themselves. The soil collected from desilting will be given to farmers. They can learn something from that. At the same time, the concessionary loans schemes will be launched for the rural people. The money would be pumped into the villages by these projects, the Prime Minister added.
He also assured that infrastructure facilities will be enhanced as well. The Prime Minister revealed that new laws would be brought in to ensure that the farmers would benefit from it.
He said this is called Wevu Govisathu Kirima (Handing over the responsibility of maintaining tanks to the farmers in the villages).
The Government also intends to provide assistance to those farmers who are willing to cultivate organic paddy, he said.
The Prime Minister said Gam Peraliya was the second phase of Governments programme to stabilise the economy.
The first phase of this programme was to settle the debts. There were no funds to pay the loan instalments when we took over.
We would have to go back to the era, where only two yards of cloth was given to a family if we were not able to find funds to settle debts.
We found some funds but had to increase taxes to find more funds. We were criticized heavily for this, he said.
The Prime Minister said that the tax structure would be changed as the Government felt that some taxes were unfair.
At the same time, he said the Government would also focus on large-scale development projects, especially for enhancing exports.
Hambantota port Public Private Partnership, Mattala International Airport Public-Private Partnership, LNG power plant in Hambantota and the Oil Refinery would be part of this plan, he said. (Yohan Perera)

SLA will not close camps in North: Army Commander
	
Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake today said in a media statement that as a responsible Army, SLA would not close down Army camps in the Northern Province as alleged by some media reports.
The Army urges the public not to be misled by those unfounded and false media reports, but continue to repose the full confidence in the Army, considering its past services as well as the roles and tasks, now being performed across the country, he said in the statement.
He said; Under any circumstances the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) will not resort to any decisions that would pose a threat to national security, and it always prioritizes national security concerns, the Army commander said in a statement.
Sri Lanka Army is prepared round the clock to respond to all security requirements in the country. During the war, the Army adopting its own structural reforms succeeded in winning the war at that time. In similar vein, the Army while performing a gigantic role in development has thrown its full weight behind the governments ongoing nation-building projects as the prime mover, the commander said.
However, some opportunistic politicians and mass media organizations, envious of the Armys commitment to the countrys future are in the practice of spreading malicious and false propaganda in order to inculcate the public with untruth and distortion regarding the ongoing rightsizing process of the Army, the statement added.
Lieutenant General Senanayake said that right-sizing process has always been happening in the Army and had even taken place during the war and also in the post-war period before this one.
Through that, the troops mainly deployed for administrative duties are relieved and mobilized for field duties to gain better productivity, thereby doubling their efficiency.
This process does not allow any Army camp to be closed, but it instead enables the majority of troops in those camps be deployed for emergency disaster needs and nation-building tasks in an effective manner. Nevertheless, some false media reports try to claim that this process has led to a large let-up in the security arrangements in the North and East. It certainly is not a disbanding of battalions, but is only a restructuring with the intention of distributing human and material resources equally among other battalions, the commander said.
Some of those media organizations, operating as cats paws of disgruntled politicians, are malicious towards various development projects, being undertaken by the majority of Army troops island-wide under the guidance of the President, he said in the statement.
