Gnanasara Thera’s plea: CA declines to grant permission


	

The Court of Appeal today declined to grant permission to the application filed on behalf of Ven. Gnanasara Thera, to file an appeal to the Supreme Court against his conviction.

The Court of Appeal was of the view that there was no legal grounds for the application.

However, the Counsel for Ven. Gnanasara Thera said an appeal will be filed directly at the Supreme Court by way of Special Leave to Appeal. (S.S.Selvanayagam)
