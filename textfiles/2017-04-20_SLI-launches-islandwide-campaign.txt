A message on the importance of insurance and protection was delivered to Sri Lankans across the island by the officers of Sri Lanka Insurance (SLI) early this month. 
The awareness campaign was conducted islandwide on a door-to-door basis as part of the efforts of the national insurer to propagate the importance of being protected with insurance in case of unforeseen situations that may arise. 
The second phase of the campaign would be held on April 22.
