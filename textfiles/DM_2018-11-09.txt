AIA Higher Education Scholarships; inspiring academic excellence for 24 years
	
AIA Insurances Higher Education Scholarships Programme, now in its 24th consecutive year, rewards the top performers from each district at the Grade 5 scholarship examination, by giving them a monthly bursary from Advanced Level (A/L) class right up to the completion of their University degree.
Started in 1994, the programme was initiated to lend a hand to Sri Lankas brightest and most promising students, as they are the future of our nation. AIA scholarships do not require the winners parents to be an AIA Insurance customer, but awards are purely based on academic merit.
This years Chief Guest, acclaimed neurosurgeon Dr. Sunil Perera inspired the students by sharing his own personal experience with studying and highlighted the need for undeterred commitment to learning. He shared the difficult circumstances he had to face during his journey to the height of medical achievement and urged the students to never give up in the face of adversity and to pursue their dreams with passion and determination.
The highlight of the event was when enthused scholarship winner, D.H.P Dimagi, from the Galle district, spontaneously addressed the gathering to note how pleasantly surprised she was that AIA saw through the commitment to support her and her fellow winners. She noted that at the time the scholarship was granted when she was in Grade 5, it seemed so far away and she never believed it would come to fruition so many years later. She conveyed her gratitude to AIA for honouring a promise and she committed to persevering in her studies, so she can gain entry to University and do justice to the support she has been given. She added that the bursary will come in most useful for her tertiary education since it will give her the financial security to focus fully on her studies and not worry about finding money for her text books and other educational needs.
So far, 600 students have qualified for the AIA Higher Education Scholarship when they enter A/L and 450 students have already started receiving the bursary. Many of them have gone on to reach top designations is various fields, including medicine, law and engineering.

America wakes to another mass shooting
	

Gunman kills twelve after storming student night

California, (Daily Mail), 8 Nov 2018-Twelve people have been killed at a country music bar in southern California after a masked gunman wearing all black opened fire on crowds of college kids before taking his own life with a semi-automatic handgun.
The shooter, who has not been named publicly but has been identified by police, stormed Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday at 11.20pm. He first shot the bouncer then opened fire on the crowds of youngsters who were there to enjoy a night of line dancing and country music. 
As dozens ran for their lives and used bar stools to shatter the windows to escape, the shooter continued firing his black semi-automatic pistol and throwing smoke grenades to confuse them. 
When the first police officers arrived at the scene three minutes later, the gunman shot one of them multiple times before shooting himself. By the time SWAT teams arrived, he was dead. The sheriffs sergeant who was shot later died in hospital. He was Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran. 
In total, 13 are dead; 11 people inside the bar, the sheriffs sergeant and the gunman. According to KTLA, the gunman was 29 years old. Police are yet to identify his motive or release his name. 
An additional 10 to 15 victims were injured during the mass shooting, including the bouncer, a young female cashier and college students. 
The gunman shot himself before SWAT teams got inside.

As the world watches over us - EDITORIAL
	
he present political crisis that has engulfed this country sees many contrasting views being presented as to whether it is an issue that also connects with the outside world or is purely an internal matter which should be settled within us.
Right now what is continuing to fuel the crisis is the refusal of ousted Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe to accept his removal which puts the newly appointed person to that post Mahinda Rajapaksa in quite a difficult position.
This power struggle makes us look very silly to the outside world because, like Great Britain has affirmed, all nations recognise the state. And that is how it should be. But as we know very well all countries that are players in the international scenario including Great Britain have their preferences on these matters.
Meanwhile representatives of a section of the Maha Sanga early this week staged a rally at Town Hall and passed a resolution urging President Maithripala Sirisena to work in accordance with the Constitution and convene Parliament to settle this political crisis. Outspoken monk Ven. Dambara Amila had in fact warned that the international community would take tough action against Sri Lanka if the present political crisis continued. Another monk Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera had urged the authorities to safeguard democracy. These are the voices of one set of monks.
However, contrary to these voices the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter the most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera has said that this is an internal matter and external forces should not interfere in settling the issues of the country. Similar sentiments were aired by the Chief Incumbent of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara the Venerable Professor Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangarakkita thera. Also prominent nationalist monk ven. Elle Gunawansa thera said that the international community is shedding more tears at the change of Government than the people of the country as their agenda in Sri Lanka had been thwarted.
However, Sri Lanka is also part of most international bodies and although such bodies cannot impose themselves on the country there views also matter internationally. For the record Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland recently made references to the Commonwealth Charter adopted in 2012 and reminded that all member states, Governments, political parties and civil societies have the responsibility to uphold and promote democratic cultures and practices.
Its true that president Sirisena had his differences with ousted Premier Wickremesinghe and eventually decided to remove him. But what has earned him the wrath of a section of the population and mostly the western countries was the manner in which he removed his PM.
US Embassador in Sri Lanka Alaina. B. Teplitz has underscored the importance of reconvening parliament to put an end to this current political crisis. The bottom line is that the outside world has influence over Sri Lanka in how it solves this political crisis; a fact that the islands patriotic citizens must fathom whether they fancy it or not.
There is still confusion whether the UNP parliamentarians will get an opportunity to show their numbers when Parliament convenes on November 14. Ministers of the new Government including the Cabinet spokesmen have said the only agenda on the cards on this day is for President Sirisena to make the policy statement.
President Sirisenas camp is confident that the full cabinet will be sworn in before Parliament is convened. This is amids news that some members of parliament switching off their phones or going overseas in their attempts to avoid being approached to accept portfolios. The UNP too is confidant and says that it can muster support to have a headcount of more than 113.
As the political infighting continues, many people fear it would have international repercussions. Meanwhile the horse trading in politics continues while a helpless nation looks towards the skies for a solution out of it!

Astrology and the operation of Law of Karma
	
None can gainsay the obvious fact that the science of Vedic astrology rests on the Law of Karma which also implies the existence of rebirth or the circle of birth and death.
Astrologers often refer to the Natal Chart or the horoscope as the Map of ones Karma.

Definition of Karma
The Sanskrit word, Karma that has entered the Sinhala vocabulary is in common usage in this country. Although the term, Karma is used as Kamma in Pali text books on Buddhism, the Buddhists in this country usually use the Sanskrit term in their daily lives.
The word, Karma has its root in the Vedas of Brahmanism and the definition of what Karma or Kamma is, given both in Vedas and in Buddhism is basically the same. However, Buddhism unlike the Vedas denies that there is a permanent entity called Atma passing from one birth to another.

Astrology,a mechanism to account for operation of Law of Karma
By the way, Astrology, a byproduct of Vedic philosophy seems to have been developed as a mechanism to account for the operation of the Law of Karma encompassing the terrestrial phenomena with special reference to human beings. While Mundane Astrology has been developed for the purpose of foreseeing the significant events of the material world like wars, plagues, earthquakes, socio-political and geo-political changes, environmental transformations etc. Natal Astrology has been developed for the purpose of predicting fortunes and misfortunes in store for individuals.
It is presumed that just as every natural phenomenon that occurs in the world, every fortune or misfortune that an individual has to face in life is subject to a universal law called the Law of Karma. And Astrology is the mechanism that has been designed and developed by ancient Indian seers based on the Law of Karma to gain a foresight into the future of the material world as well as that of an individual.
Scholars of Vedic philosophy have classified Karma under the following laws of Nature:
Law of Causation
	Law of Action and Reaction
	Law of Compensation
	Law of Retribution
	Law of Impressions
	Law of Causation
The Law of Causation is the basic law that says that whatever happens in the universe is due to a cause. All other laws of Nature are subordinate to this fundamental law. Thoughts and actions of Man are subject to this law. A good thought will produce a good effect, a bad thought a bad effect. Similarly, a good action will produce a good reaction, and a bad action, a bad reaction. Both cause and effect constitute Karma.

Law of Action and Reaction
For every action there is a reaction. If you cause pain to another, you will, in turn, suffer pain. This law operates both on mental and physical planes with precision and accuracy.

Law of Compensation
The Law of Compensation operates in every natural phenomenon. This law will restore equilibrium, harmony and justice in the wake of every catastrophe. Every evil act will beget an evil result under this law too.

Law of Retribution
Every wrong action will bring its own punishment according to this Law of Retribution. He who hurts another hurts himself first. He who cheats another cheats himself first. Every wrong action while instantly punishing the doers inner self will eventually punish him by way of pain, misery, misfortune, disease etc.

Law of Impressions
Whatever one does, would leave an impression on ones subconscious mind. Impressions that converge make Samskaras (dispositions or behavioural traits). Samskaras transform into habits and habits in turn develop into character. Thus, Karma produces character.

Boeing issues warning on potential instrument malfunction
	

(c) 2018, The Washington Post  Timothy McLaughlin, Ashley Halsey III, Stanley Widianto Nov 08, 2018 - JAKARTA, Indonesia - Airplane manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday issued a bulletin to airlines worldwide warning of erroneous readings from flight-control software on its planes, after a Lion Air jetliner crashed into the sea soon after takeoff, killing the 189 people on board. 
Boeing, which is assisting in an investigation into what went wrong in the Oct. 29 crash of one of its new 737 Max 8 jets, said it issued the bulletin as part of its usual process. 
The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday issued an emergency notice to all operators of Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes. It warned airlines that erroneous sensor inputs like the one that came into play in Indonesia could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, leading to possible impact with terrain.

Counting stars from the gutter
	
What made the Yahapalanaya coalition a refugee camp of political survivors
he teacher asked a Montessori child whats there in the drawing book drawn in large red, blue and green patches, smudged all over the page.
The little one says The Sky.
The teacher stands nonplussed.
A sky Why red and green for the sky
The kid points to another.
He put red. So, I put green.
And blue the teacher asked.
He gave that pastel.
No contradictions and doubts here. It is the sky, as the little minds understood. That seems what our Constitution is with 19 Amendments to it made time and again. It is the drawing book of our legislators.
They have drawn as they wished in creating a Constitution. People have to accept it as the supreme law of the land and are called upon to safeguard it too.
On that supreme law called the Constitution, President Sirisena has signed the Gazette notification to convene the prorogued Parliament on Wednesday 14 November.
Parliament was prorogued at midnight on Friday 26 October 2018, immediately after Mahinda Rajapaksa was arbitrarily appointed as PM by President Sirisena.
The deal it is said was sealed with President Sirisena accepted as the SLPP-SLFP alliance presidential candidate and Rajapaksa agreeing to lead the campaign says inside information.

"Parliamentary elections would follow immediately thereafter and allow Rajapaksa to be a powerful PM through another amendment to the Constitution, as Rajapaksa believes he could return with a 2/3 majority on his own"
President Sirisena stands qualified to face an election on 10 January next year they claim, as he completes four years in office on January 8, 2019.
Sirisena would keep the media ministry under him till then.
Parliamentary elections would follow immediately thereafter and allow Rajapaksa to be a powerful PM through another amendment to the Constitution, as Rajapaksa believes he could return with a 2/3s majority on his own.
What makes Rajapaksa so confident of his path to victory He certainly is the most charismatic Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independent Sri Lanka as I have said before in these pages. But how is a question, often asked.
Sri Lanka has always asked for Sinhala Buddhist leaders in mainstream national politics with a dominant social psyche that has been publicly Sinhala Buddhist from Anagarika Dharmapala afterwards.
Yet, that was not without demands for socioeconomic answers for development.
Socioeconomic issues left the Sinhala Buddhist psyche moderate though dominant with the urban middle class. This was taken into the provinces by the Buddhist Commission headed by Gunapala Malalasekera, assisted by N.Q. Dias in early 1950s.
Bandaranaike thus becomes its political representation and was voted as PM in 1956, contesting from the MEP in an alliance with Philip Gunawardenas LSSP (R).
Yet, the socioeconomic issues could not be forfeited for Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism till the 1972 Constitution and Standardisation in University entrance became political issues for Tamil democratic parties.
To sum up a long political history, after 1972, the slogan for a Separate Tamil State, the 1983 July massacre of Tamil people, the escalation of the military conflict, lifted the moderate Sinhala Buddhist psyche into a more ruthless form of anti Tamil patriotism dragging in the rural society as well, from where the Sinhala soldiers were recruited.

"From 2015 January corrupt and chaotic politics of Yahapalanaya made Rajapaksa politics dominant and inevitable"
This became Mahinda Rajapaksas turf on which he bargained votes for his 2015 Presidential Election campaign.
His political ancestry in the deep South, the very rare honour of being titled Sri Rohana Jana Ranjana by the prestigious Buddhist Sect Shyamopali Siyam Nikaya giving him acceptance among all Buddhist monks and free access to all Buddhist temples, his public acceptance of all superstitious beliefs and rituals of the ordinary Sinhala Buddhist folks makes him an organic leader of the Sinhala rural polity.
Even his attire with the maroon shawl and the thick moustache, make him the icon of Sinhala Buddhist patriarchy, the much-revered father figure the Sinhala Buddhist majority has turned out to believe in.
Beliefs dont fade off easily in backward cultures. That perhaps explains the pious attraction he has among rural women too.
Meanwhile, the numbers game is still on, in a sordid struggle to give Rajapaksa the majority in Parliament. It has turned out more rough and tough than first expected to be.
Chandrika Kumaratunge had also intervened to move her pawns on the chess board against Rajapaksa, leaving him with much less than the 108, Rishad Bathiudeens ACMC wants Rajapaksa to prove before the 05 ACMC MPs move in.
From 2015 January 09 evening to 2018 October 26 midnight, corrupt and chaotic politics of Yahapalanaya made Sinhala Buddhist Rajapaksa politics dominant and inevitable.
In an inherently corrupt urban-centred economic model that makes all systems hugely corrupt in this free market economy, nothing else can be expected too.
Cronies who run business in this are not permanently affiliated to political parties. To say it mildly, they fund political parties and leading political personalities. There is thus, long-term obligations politicians have to give in to and compromise on.
The Yahapalanaya coalition was therefore like a refugee camp of political survivors given 100-Days with an extension thereafter to find a permanent place.
A refugee camp of surviving political groups and parties fighting to have permanency in an unprincipled, unplanned-for site theyve managed to squat on. The 19A, a product of that unholy coalition celebrated as an historic achievement, made the Constitution look like the smudged painting of the little kids sky.
The latest Constitutional Coup by Sirisena and Rajapaksa thus made a mockery of the present Parliament and the Constitution with its 19A.
This Constitutional Coup remains a long process that only comes to an end with their decision to have Presidential Poll in January and allow Rajapaksa to be head of a Caretaker Government, though without a clear majority.

"Beliefs dont fade off easily in backward cultures. That perhaps explains the pious attraction he has among rural women too"
Proving a majority does not arise immediately. On 14 November it would only be a ceremonial opening of a new Parliamentary Session by the President, after which the next date for Parliament sittings would be announced.
That would have to be 05 days from the opening of the new session and therefore will have to be any day after November 19.
It is only then, the Speaker could officially accept the No Confidence Motion against PM Rajapaksa that for once compels the UNP and others to accept Rajapaksa as the PM though argued as illegally appointed.
Accepting the No Confidence Motion does not mean it would be discussed immediately and put to vote.
Party leaders in Parliament will have to agree on a date to have it discussed and put to vote.
That again can be haggled upon and delayed till early December if necessary.
Meanwhile, the Presidential Poll would be announced making the No Confidence Motion irrelevant and dragging the UNP into another squabble in agreeing on a candidate.
Whatever the outcome of schemings and manipulations for numbers and power, a Caretaker Government by Rajapaksa or a UNP led new alliance in Government, will not bring this tragi-comedy to an end, even after Parliament meets on Wednesday, November 14.
Nor will a quick election provide any solace either, with these two mainstream political parties once again vying against each other.
Continuing with this free market economy, they would not have anything new or different in their political thinking.
Their culture of greed fashioned by big money and power would remain too. People cannot impact their political vision, nor on their party decisions.
In short, NO political manoeuvring with these two political parties even with new human faces, male or female, can pull this society out of the gutter.
Nothing short of shelving the free market urban economy with its filthy rich, for a complete paradigm change can lift this society to a decent, civilised life.
That, therefore, demands a new social discourse on what development means to people and their personal and social life.Development should mean the quality of life in terms of time and wages for a cultural life and recreation, every citizen would be entitled to and would have access to with equal opportunities.
We also need to define what democracy should be in its function beyond Rights and elections.

"His political ancestry in the deep south, the very rare honour of being titled Sri Rohana Jana Ranjana, his public acceptance of all superstitious beliefs makes him an organic leader of the Sinhala rural polity"
Democracy needs to be defined and designed as Participatory democracy with people adopting a national policy on all major necessities like education, health, public transport, through Referendums. We, therefore, need to pull the drafting of the New Constitution out of boardrooms with experts into the public domain as a social exercise, with active local participation, to draft and adopt a Constitution the people could own.
With all political parties and their leaderships incapable and uninterested of even provoking such intellectual discourse in society, it certainly is the burden of the Concerned Citizenry to begin such social dialogue from the beginning.
If at this juncture of disastrous political miscalculations made by self-elected social and public interest activists and a very corrupt, self-serving professional middle class, a new initiative if not initiated by all concerned citizens, then as Oscar Wilde says in the comedy, Lady Windermeres Fan:
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
With glee here in Sri Lanka, thinking alls done right, it is a heavy burden on society no doubt to kick-start a new dialogue, but Development and democracy dont come for free and without responsibility.

## Title: Deciphering Dyslexia

Deciphering Dyslexia
	

Most of our readers are familiar with the term dyslexia. But do we know details of dyslexia , what it is, how it affects life and what intervention is possible In this weekss Health Capsule, we decided to consult Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Teaching Hospital in Karapitiya, to obtain more information on the topic.
How often do we take everyday skills that we possess; reading and writing for an example, for granted Most of us have to just look at the sentences in the book or in this case the newspaper, that we are reading and our brains do all the work automatically regarding reading and interpreting the content before us. Now imagine looking at your favourite book and seeing only symbols or starting to write a letter to your friend living abroad, knowing just what to write, yet not knowing how to write it. That is the struggle that a dyslexic individual face every day. 

Symptoms 
In preschool, when we are just learning to read and write, all of us see and identify letters as symbols, explains Dr.Attygalle. But, while most of the children learn to recognise, interpret and incorporate these letters into their reading and writing, after a certain period of time, the minority continues to have difficulty with them. 
They usually cannot remember the letters of the alphabet, forgetting and writing letters the wrong way, for an example confusing their b s with d s. They find dictation especially hard, for an example writing cat as K-A-T instead of C-A-T. They also read in letters, pronouncing one letter of a word at a time, and being unable to grasp the meaning of the sentence immediately after reading.
These children tend to read and write very slowly when compared with the other children, but can understand well if explained verbally. This is because Dyslexia is not in any way a problem of intelligence, explains the doctor. In fact, these children can be very smart, their intelligence similar to that of the children of the same age group. 
Their difficulties when it comes to letters will be frustrating as well as confusing to the child, his parents as well as the teachers, because they cannot figure out why he or she cant cope with these seemingly simple tasks while performing well in other aspects of life. 
If the child does not receive the support and understanding of his family and teachers, this may result in severe psychological distress to the child, with him being labeled as slow or stupid. Such children tend to drop out of school early, and are exposed to the risk of anger and unhealthy coping mechanisms like substance abuse. 
Recognising and treatment
Dyslexia is more accurately described as a spectrum, states Dr. Attygalle. So, the severity of the symptoms would change from child to child. Many of these children go into adulthood without being formally diagnosed as dyslectic. But, with time, they develop their own coping mechanisms to deal with the difficulties that they face and will cope with the demands of day to day life considerably well. 
These children are usually identified by the class teacher and referred to a child psychiatrist or an educational psychologist. Most of the time, the child is referred with a complaint like forgetfulness or not paying attention in class, explains the doctor. There are no specific tests to diagnose dyslexia due to the variations of disease symptoms from child to child, but can be diagnosed clinically after thoroughly assessing the child, including his reading and writing skills. They are also more likely to have certain other conditions like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), when compared to other children of their age.
Early diagnosis can usually result in a better outcome in dyslexia. Management is usually done by a multidisciplinary team, including educational psychologists, child psychiatrists, and speech and occupational therapists. Treatment will include special interventions in teachings which are more focused on the childs needs. Parents and the teachers will also be instructed on how to help the child cope with the difficulties. Throughout all this love and support are invaluable to the child as well. 

Good news 
You do not have to fret about your childs future just because he was given a diagnosis of dyslexia. In fact, many of the worlds leading personalities are either diagnosed or are suspected to have had dyslexia. This list not only includes Leonardo Da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, and Walt Disney, some of the most famous artists of their times, it also has the names of Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill and Steve Jobs. Some researchers even theorise that in order to compensate for their deficiencies, the individuals having dyslexia are more creative, having the ability to think outside the box, a trait that all the above mentioned personalities share. So, if you or your child has dyslexia, think about the positive side, while staying strong and fighting hard to overcome the difficulties.

DEW challenges UNP to seek SC opinion
	
Former Minister D.E.W.Gunasekara yesterday challenged the UNP to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court if they maintain that the President had violated the Constitution by sacking Ranil Wickremesinghe from the Prime Ministerial post and proroguing Parliament.
He told the media at the party office that President Maithripala Sirisenahas acted according to the provisions of the Constitution and not violated a even a letter of the Constitution.
Who protested when former Prime Minister D.M.Jayaratne was sacked in January 2015 and appointed Mr. Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister when President Sirisena won the Presidential Poll he asked and added Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed as the Prime Minister after removing Mr. Wickremesinghe on October 26 by President Sirisena on the same constitutional provisions.
The Constitution clearly says that the President is the head of State, head of the cabinet, head of the government and the commander of the Armed forces. Therefore he is the absolute leader of all state affairs and the country and his action cannot be challenged at any court of law. They know it and attempt to resolve the issue in a different forum, Mr. Gunasekara said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Equity market lost Rs. 4 bn due to actions of Prez: Mangala
	
UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera yesterday charged that a sum of Rs.4 billion had gone out of Sri Lanka asthe net outflowfrom the equity market as a result of the decision by President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a new Prime Minister.
This reaction by foreign investors will have a negative effect on the Sri Lankan economy especially in the face of the prevailing global economic crisis, Mr. Samaraweera said in a statement issued last evening.
He also warned that the yield of the one dollar bond which matures in January next year had shot up to 9.9 per cent from 5.5 per cent earlier. This will double the countrys debt services, he said, adding that the increased net outflow of funds will also result in a further devaluation of the rupee.
Additionally, he said the country will face issues in further borrowings to finance the total foreign debt service which stands at a staggering US$ 15 billion at present.
The former Finance Minister, referring to the tax concessions given by the newly appointed regime, pointed out that the government will lose a revenue of
Rs.75 billion as a result of this move. There would be no option but to increase income tax thereafter, he said. (Yohan Perera)

They said the reappointments were made by Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Accordingly, the TAC was established under the Tax Appeals Commission Act no 23 of 2011, to facilitate a more expeditious resolution of disputes that may arise between the taxpayer and the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) or the Director General of Customs (DGC) due to a determination on the imposition of any Tax, Levy, Charge, Duty or Penalty.
Any aggrieved party could appeal to the TAC and TAC after having conducted the hearings on the appeals could deliver its determination either confirming, reducing, or amending the original determination by the CGIR or the DGC.
At present, there are about 264 appeals pending and it is expected that these appeals will be resolved with the revival of the TAC. By activating institutions such as the TAC established to provide relief to the Taxpayers in a more expeditious manner, it is envisaged that the ease of doing business climate in the country will also improve, the Ministry said.

Foreign visits by Hakeem, Rishad fuel speculation
	
The decision by Leaders of both the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Rauff Hakeem and Rishad Bathiudeen respectively to leave the country in a hurry on Tuesday night had invited much speculation and tongue wagging in local circles.
The reasons for this sudden departure had many persons in political circles wondering whether this was a precursor to them leaving the Ranil faction and going over to the Mahinda faction. This line of thinking was given even more weight as the duo was seen going in for a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena prior to departure from the island.
When inquiries were made from a spokesperson for the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress about the sudden foreign visit by former minister Hakeem, he had replied that the leader had gone abroad for personal reasons and that he would be back soon. (Sujith Hewajulige)

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus When mother and baby are exposed to danger
	

Out of the many non-communicable diseases, diabetes takes such a prominent place that we all know of at least one person with diabetes. While diabetes comes as Type 1 and 2, there may be instances when it could get severe, especially with age. Diabetes not only affects ones health, but also the quality of life of an individual. Statistics have proven that over 425 million people have diabetes. Diabetes can be expensive for the individual and the family. While the focus has been diverted towards diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is less spoken of. In view of the Diabetes Awareness Month which falls in November, the Diabetes Association of Sri Lanka (DASL) has planned several programmes.
Hence we spoke to Dr. Chamari Warnapura, Deputy Medical Director  National Diabetes Centre at DASL who
shed light on GDM.

What is gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after labour. It can occur at any stage during pregnancy, but is more common in the second half. It occurs if your body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the extra needs in pregnancy. Expectant women can help control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising, and, if necessary, taking medication. Controlling blood sugar can prevent a difficult birth and keep you and your baby healthy.

Prevalence
According to the statistics collected by the DASL 1 in 4 persons have abnormal sugar levels. 2.1 million and 2.3 million people have diabetes and pre diabetes respectively. According to the last prevalence study, which was done in 2008, 21.8% abnormal blood sugars in total are prevalent in Sri Lanka. Dr. Chamari Warnapura said that 1 in 7 births were affected by gestational diabetes. The prevalence of high blood glucose in pregnancy increases rapidly with age and is highest in women over the age of 45. In 2017, there was an estimated 204 million women (20-79 years) living with diabetes in the world. This number is projected to increase to 308 million by 2045. 1 in 3 women with diabetes were of reproductive age. 21.3 million or 16.2% of live births had some form of high blood sugar during pregnancy. An estimated 85.1% were due to gestational diabetes. The vast majority of cases of high blood sugar during pregnancy were in low- and middle-income countries, where access to maternal care is often limited, said Dr. Warnapura.

Risks to mother and foetus
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a severe and neglected threat to maternal and child health, Dr. Warnapura continued. Many women with GDM experience pregnancy-related complications including high blood pressure, large birth weight babies and obstructed labour. The mother can go on to develop type 2 diabetes within 5 to 10 years after delivery. The foetus can develop conditions such as low blood sugar, jaundice and low calcium. Babies may also have a large birth weight leading to obstructed labour, added Dr. Warnapura.
Detection and diagnosis
According to Dr. Warnapura, the risk assessment for GDM should be undertaken at the first prenatal visit. Women with clinical characteristics consistent with a high risk of GDM (marked obesity, personal history of GDM, sugar in urine, or a strong family history of diabetes) should undergo glucose testing (see below) as soon as feasible. If they are found not to have GDM at that initial screening, they should be retested between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Women of average risk should have testing undertaken at 2428 weeks of gestation, she added.
Low-risk status requires no glucose testing, but this category is limited to those women meeting all of the following characteristics:
Age >25 years
	Weight normal before pregnancy
	Member of an ethnic group with a low prevalence of GDM
	No known diabetes in first-degree relatives
	No history of abnormal glucose tolerance
	No history of poor obstetric outcome
She further said that a fasting plasma glucose level of >126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) or a casual plasma glucose >200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) meets the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes, if confirmed on a subsequent day, and precludes the need for any glucose challenge.
Reclassification of the mothers sugar status should be performed at least 6 weeks after delivery, Dr. Warnapura continued. If glucose levels are normal post-partum, reassessment of sugar level should be undertaken at a minimum of three-year intervals.
Women with pre-diabetes in the postpartum period should be tested for diabetes annually. These patients should receive intensive lifestyle management therapy and should be placed on an individualised exercise programme because of their very high risk for development of diabetes. All patients with prior GDM should be educated regarding lifestyle modifications that lessen insulin resistance, including maintenance of normal body weight through lifestyle modification.

Diabetes Awareness Month
The DASL has been in the forefront in spreading awareness on diabetes. One of their programmes include The Family and Diabetes which aims to raise awareness on the impact that diabetes has on the family and support network of those affected while promoting the role of the family in the management, care, prevention and education of diabetes. These aims are achieved with campaigns such as #dontsugarcoatit  which is a nutritional labelling campaign spreading awareness on food labelling. The other aspect is to conduct awareness programmes for the whole family.

Health tips for pregnant women
As always, pregnant women with GDM should keep an eye on their diet. In order to get all the vitamins and minerals you and your baby need, you should try to eat food rich in vitamins and nutrients from different sources every day, Dr. Warnapura further explained adding, This means you should have a balanced diet with the right proportions of carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals and water.
In addition to that, pregnant women should also do regular exercises. Exercise means being active and it helps to lower blood sugar. When you have gestational diabetes being active every day can help lower your blood sugar. But there are a few things to keep in mind, Dr. Warnapura stressed. Pregnant women should stop exercising if they feel contractions. Also if they are taking insulin and feel that they are having low blood glucose then they should stop exercising and treat that condition instead. she said.

Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis trapped as fighting escalates
	

By Ali Al Mujahed, Sudarsan Raghavan (c) 2018, The Washington Post Nov 08, 2018 - SANAA, Yemen - Despite U.S. calls for a cease-fire, fighting is escalating in a strategic Yemeni port city, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and deepening a humanitarian crisis where millions are already grappling with a possible famine. 
The clashes in Hodeida, pitting a U.S.-backed regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against northern Houthi rebels, has led to numerous civilian casualties over the past week, said residents, health workers and aid agencies. The violence is also nearing medical facilities, threatening the safety of patients and essential medical workers. 
The fighting has particularly intensified near Hodeidas port, through which pass more than 70 percent of all food, fuel medicines and other essential supplies destined for the northern part of the country where large majority of Yemenis live. 
Hodeida is once again trapped in violence with hundreds of thousands of Yemenis caught in the middle, said Fabrizio Carboni, a senior official for the International Committee for the Red Cross in a statement Thursday.

Hypocrisy  comes with a capital H
	
I knew nothing.- Ravi Karunanayake
Politics does strange things to civil society. This, despite the fact that civil society is supposed to be independent. But then we are political animals. We do not want to be independent. We cant be independent. We have certain preferred outcomes and these we want to promote, one way or the other, regardless of those notions of democracy and freedom we bandy about day after day. In other words, its all about seeing your favourite horses running the country and telling others how to run themselves. 
The backlash against the (temporary) caretaker government stems from three different groups. The first, obviously, are those who were humiliated at seeing the leader of the UNP being ousted, for the second time after a space of 10 years, from the Prime Ministers chair. These are the kepuwath kola types. The second are those who raved over the governments reformist programme but ranted against its pro-privatisation economic programme. These are the (spent) old leftists. 
Regardless of their motives, both of them support a return to the status quo, which is why even someone like Kumar David, despite his leftist credentials and critiques of IMF austerity measures, terms the Sirisena-Mahinda combination a putsch much less preferable to the government the likes of him were critiquing. 
Both these groups, however, are unapologetic about where their loyalties lie, even if they sweep those loyalties under the carpet of good governance. It is the third group that interests me. They are a mishmash of the first two, yet exude a (deceptive) neutral stance. Broadly entailing civil society, they include those outfits (in the media, online and everywhere else) which have been promoting the very same good governance the government they support played and tampered with, these last three years. If the Rajapaksas, who have no moral right over the UNP or their allies, want to pick on the hypocrisy of the previous government, they dont have to look further than the hypocrisy of this civil society (which, as a friend of mine recently commented, tongue in cheek, is as civil as the international community is international). They would need to point at two distinct incidents which transpired during the yahapalana years, both of which that civil society feigned silence at. Lets list them out, shall we 

"If those protesting outside, on the streets, are shedding crocodile tears over the plight of the people, they have only to remind themselves that the people they are fighting for were left virtually voiceless, and paralysed, over these last three years"
The first was the bond scandal. The independent media wasnt exactly quick to catch up on it, even when it was spreading like wildfire through informal channels, and when they did catch up on it, certain commentators did, and wrote, everything they could to absolve the not-so-immediate wrongdoers. 
I remember a particularly unsavoury piece, written by an anonymous Roving Editor and published in a prominent Sunday newspaper, prompting the politicians to stop focusing on the scandal and move on to bigger issues confronting this country. The best summing up of the magnitude of THIS issue came from former deputy governor of the Central Bank, W. A. Wijewardena, whose political inclinations are hardly with the Rajapaksas: that the bid placements caused a far worse damage to the bank than the 1996 LTTE bomb attack. 
Outrage against the bond auction came from, I can attest quite strongly, a broad section of the population, both for and against the Rajapaksa regime. Outrage from the Rajapaksa camp was directed less at the reality of the scandal than at the If-we-were-not-there-it-wouldnt-have-happened rhetoric. But that was a minority. The anger of the people, as a whole, was less partisan and more representative of the country (more representative, certainly, than the crowd that went out to the streets two weeks ago, since the money the Central Bank lost belonged to all of us). Civil society would have had a field day championing their cause, to the country, if not the world. 
And yet, no protest erupted. None of those freedom loving activists came out. Where were they Singing The Internationale with the old leftists 
EconomyNext, a website I otherwise respect immensely, failed to offer a single report on the bond auction in 2015, and did so only after the scandal hit the ceiling in 2016. The likes of Asanga Welikala and Razeen Sally, who delivered lectures on the role of the State as a night watchman, failed to condemn the role THIS State had taken on: as daylight robber. Welikala in particular had no problem titling his anti-Rajapaksa rant Paradise Lost hinting that Rajapaksas appointment signalled an end to some paradise that was supposed to have existed until then. Deluded, much 
And its not just the bond scandal. Malinda Seneviratne, in his piece Selective tear-shedding in seasons of demagoguery, asks the following question: 
When Sirisena gave nomination to Mahinda Rajapaksa and immediately thereafter stood with Wickremesinghe, did they whimper about the spirit of democracy When he sacked and replaced the General Secretaries of the SLFP and UPFA, going as far as obtaining an interim court order so the Central Committees of these political entities could not function, did they protest

"EconomyNext failed to offer a single report on bond auction in 2015"
I dont remember the US Embassy, the British High Commission, the European Union or the United Nations propounding their concerns over these anti-democratic moves. But there was a more reprehensible anti-democratic move engineered by the President. No one talked about it, and far from condemning it, many of those who are now denouncing the loss of democracy celebrated it. 
This was the decision of the President to usher in defeated candidates through the National List. It wasnt about the National List per se. It was about the legitimacy behind the decision to take in those who had clearly lost the trust of the people. D.E.W. Gunasekara, together with Nagananda Kodithuwakku, filed a petition against it, contending that the appointment of rejected candidates (as opposed to pre-selected appointees) through the List amounted to a violation of the peoples sovereign right to elect political representatives of their choice, since the clause inserted in the 1978 Constitution, Article 99A, the 14th Amendment, had not been enacted through the mandate of the people (obtained preferably via a referendum). 

"Former CJ Sripavan rapped Nagananda Kodithuwakku for obstructing justice"
The petition was made in 2015. Then it got postponed. The then Chief Justice, K. Sripavan, withdrew from the case. Then it got postponed again. Then he argued that it was a not a matter of general or public importance. Then D.E.W. Gunasekera tried to take the case to Geneva. Then the Chief Justice rapped Kodithuwakku for obstructing justice (read, persisting with the issue). Then the case returned to the Supreme Court after Kodithuwakku filed a separate petition. Then it got delayed again. Forget the US Embassy. Forget the British High Commission. Forget the European Union. Forget the United Nations. Where was Civil Society They had championed parliamentary legitimacy. They had facilitated a shift in the polity from state to the legislature. The appointment of failed candidates was clearly not right, then. Article 99A required a campaign against it, if at all because it was as much a violation of the peoples sovereign right as the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
And yet, no one spoke. No one hummed. 
Was it because if someone did hum, the Rajapaksas and their cohorts would have returned to the Parliament (they did, but not as ministers). Perhaps. Revolutions, after all, even the most facile revolutions (like the one we witnessed from 2015 to 2018), thrive on expedience, and on tactics that lie outside the parameters of constitutional legitimacy. They are crafted by politicians first, and only then by policymakers. But then, thats the exact same argument the Rajapaksas are using. Now. Whether or not they intended it, the former government handed over the fuel and the gunpowder to this government. You did it to us then, well do it to you now! is the gist, the bare essence, of what the likes of Keheliya Rambukwelle are spouting. 
But thats another story. 
If those protesting outside, on the streets, are shedding crocodile tears over the plight of the people, they have only to remind themselves that the people they are fighting for were left virtually voiceless, and paralysed, over these last three years. Where were these democracy lovers, we can ask, when the Central Bank went down in flames over those bids, the President sacked the General Secretaries of the SLFP and UPFA, and candidates roundly defeated in a general election were appointed without as much as a by-your-leave as ministers Nowhere to be found. 
Should we stand by them now Ideally, yes. Are they for democracy Perhaps. Do they idealise political outcomes which negate their calls for a movement that is NOT about Ranil Definitely. Is this hypocrisy with a capital H You bet.

6.2 million  who  gave the mandate were betrayed
	

With the heat of the political situation rising daily, JVP Leader and MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressed his views regarding this crisis during an interview. Excerpts:

QWhat is the JVPs opinion on the political situation that is unfolding at present
The political incidents that are taking place now are not related to the forward march of the country or its citizens. All these incidents have erupted as a result of the shameless, conspiratorial power struggle within the two political camps. Observing the activities in these camps during the past few days one could judge what sort of people they are and their characters. We are asking the people to think intelligently as to what they (Politicians) have done for the country during the past seventy years. Therefore the JVP is drawing the peoples attention as an alternative force around which the masses can rally round.
QAt a time when the attention of everyone is drawn towards who would be the Prime Minister and what is going to happen to the Government, do you think people would show any interest on an alternative force as proposed by you
This is the opportune moment. It is clearly evident that there is a political conspiracy. This conspiracy is similar to eloping with a village damsel under the moonlight. The President in the dead of the night calls an MP and without the knowledge of all appoints him as the Prime Minister and follows this by proroguing the Parliament. It is true that the President has the power to appoint the Prime Minister, but it is the Parliament that decides who should be the Prime Minister. By this action it is amply proved that the President had activated this political conspiracy. The behaviour of Ranil Wickremesinghe during the recent past may have prompted him (President Sirisena) to resort to this action. But Sirisena should not forget that he was also a stake holder in this as he too is responsible for the three-and - a-half year rule.

"The person who was subject to such slandering by the Mahinda camp has now sent his hands around the shoulders of those who slandered and slung mud at him"

Sirisena has betrayed the 6.2 million who placed their trust in him by casting their franchise preferring him to Mahinda Rajapaksa. There were 5.7 million who voted against Sirisena. Therefore it is a established fact that there is no one among these groups who has hopes of uniting these two. Therefore it is proved now that both of them have gone against the mandate given to them. They had betrayed the mandate. It reached the boiling point last Friday with the conspiracy for a power change. Therefore there is no trust in each other. Therefore we are inviting everyone to join in protecting the peoples mandate. Therefore this is the moment for an alternate party, which can be a force to be reckoned with.
QYou are vociferous in claiming that Maithripala Sirisena once alleged that in the event he had lost the Presidential election he and his family would have been buried six feet under while also levelling serious charges that they were mass scale fraudsters and corrupt individuals. Sirisena has finally put his arms around a person whom he has accused. Your comments.
This surely portrays the level of politics and the rut into which they have dragged it into. Without any shame the dirtiest nature of it is now being displayed. This set of people is now jumping about in the stinking mud hole. Being in the Government of Mahinda, Maithri remained as a Minister and raised his hand approving all the misdeeds that were committed by the former president. Maithri then made his exit saying that he did not get a place and adding that if he was appointed as the Prime Minister at that time he would have left that Government. No, Maithripala Sirisena would never do that. The 2015 power camp gets build up with the aim of securing power. A coalition Government featuring both the UNP with the SLFP is formed with the aim of securing power. The present Mahinda- Maithri group of conspirators was formed with the intention of grabbing power in a shameless manner.

"We however have a responsibility as a political group to intervene at a time the country is subject to anarchy or instability"

It was Maithri who repeatedly claimed that in the event of losing the Presidential elections, he and his family would have been six feet underground. He also said that on the night of the elections he took shelter in a coconut estate. Who said these Was it we Maithri who made this announcement aloud and clear on many occasions has stooped to such a low by teaming up with Mahinda whom he accused and ridiculed. We also remember how Mahindas camp took the micky out of Maithri and ridiculed him using words and phrases which are unprintable. The person who was subject to such slandering by the Mahinda camp has now sent his hands around the shoulders of those who slandered and slung mud at him. This proves to the entire world how politically bankrupt these two individuals are. To grab power they would resort to any low tactics.
QWhat do you feel about having a possible Government under Maithripala and Mahinda Rajapakse given that there was a past where the president had lambasted the Rajapakses as rogues
There is no doubt about Ranil and Maithripala directly and indirectly working to delay the investigations relating to the frauds and acts of corruption of the former regime. If there had been a genuine interest to unearth the truth relating to these frauds and acts of corruption, they could have been uncovered. Those who were hell bent on taking these robbers into custody, they are now conniving with the same group of robbers to form a new Government. We have no doubt that this is an extension of the black era of the Rajapakses. Even those who were in the Yahapalana Government whose names have surfaced in connection with alleged frauds and corruption, have been bought over by the new regime. These individuals are featured in bids amounting to several millions of rupees. These three groups are presently engaged in gambling risking the lives of the people.
QNow everyone is anxiously awaiting the reconvening of the Parliament. Your comments.
We do not think that this issue would resolve with the convening of the Parliament, removing the crown from Ranil and putting it on Mahinda or putting it back on Ranils head.
It would not produce a solution to the issues confronting the country and its people. We however have a responsibility as a political group to intervene at a time the country is subject to anarchy or instability. The only solution is to convene Parliament and entrust responsibility to the person who commands the confidence of the majority. We demand that Parliament be reconvened with the aim of overcoming this instability. We remember how Dinesh Gunawardene, during the recent past, used to make much hue and cry demanding that parliament be summoned despite there being a flood situation in the country. Where are they now They are today absconding from the Parliament. We are not demanding the reconvening of Parliament so that Ranil or Mahinda can show the majority, but do it because we have opinions to express regarding this instability.
QPresently it is said that the value of an MP is rising rapidly. Did they place any bids for JVP members
There were no calls from any side.
QIs it true that Basil Rajapaksa threw a bait earlier
There was some idea like that earlier. But we would never join in any coalition. We have no political affiliations with both these camps. However, instead, we have a political matter to sort out with these two factions. No one will step forward to make deals with our MPS, and that is the testimonial they had issued on us. From where do these groups get all this millions of money This is the black money they possess.
QWhat will now happen to the post of chief organiser of the opposition
As far as we are concerned we dont recognise such positions . We took them on as responsibilities. The party in the opposition which has the majority would get the post of Leader of the Opposition and the post of Chief Organizer of the Opposition.
QOpposition Leader Sampandan met Mahinda Rajapaksa and had a discussion. Your comments
Mahinda Rajapaksa in order to retain his power, and taking into consideration the cases against them, and in order to block the entry of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, is now ready to resort to any dirty work. That is the reason he come forward at this critical juncture and accepted to work along with his enemy Maithripala Sirisena, thus obtaining the Premiership. Mahinda would not rest on his laurels and would align with any group in order to protect himself .
QHave you discussed this grave situation and the political instability with other minority parties
We are exploring all avenues to have discussions with the left movements, members of other parties, citizens groups, civil society Intellectuals and other individuals regarding this situation. We do not want to be mere spectators. We are getting directly involved in this and our interventions are to change this political out flow.
QWhat have you got to say about President Maithripala Sirisenas address to the nation
Actually it was lamentation. Is the President someone who laments in the face of his people Mathripala Sirisena used to speak in this manner. There is no difference between his speech after exiting the government of Mahinda and the recent one he made. As President he was lamenting that he could not do many things and giving excuses. This questions his suitability for the post. Actually his address to the nation was a great insult to those who are tasked with such duties. It is similar to a comical act.
QThough you make accusations against Maithripala Sirisena, your political stance at that time indirectly contributed to him becoming the President. Therefore you too are responsible for the present situation
During that election we were firm in our decision and that was to defeat the Rajapakse camp. We also reiterated that we had no faith in the rule that would follow. That is happening now. In the midst of these happenings it is our responsibility not to let go. Therefore we are offering leadership to the people to defeat both camps and strengthen the alternative force.

MPs defections a sheer betrayal of the voters
	
The seat does not belong to the MP; it belongs to the party and voters

n elderly gentleman, a United National Party supporter, cast his preference vote for a teledrama actress who contested the 2010 parliamentary elections from the UNP, for he felt she was being unfairly vilified by the then government leaders who suddenly projected her character as a a bad woman after she played the lead role as a do-gooder for more than a hundred episodes. She was, however, elected to parliament, largely on the sympathy of voters, including many elderly people who exercise their franchise not in anticipation of any benefits for them but in the hope that the future generation will have a better Sri Lanka. But she betrayed her voters, when she crossed the floor and joined the Mahinda Rajapaksa government after remaining some months in the opposition as a UNP parliamentarian.
As Sri Lanka finds itself in a constitutional quagmire following the controversial swearing-in of a new prime minister by the President while the sitting prime minister insists he is the rightful holder of the post, the absence of an anti-defection law is seen to be the major curse that undermines democracy and the peoples mandate.
As the numbers game for the decisive 113 target becomes dirtier by the hour, nothing makes such a huge mockery of democracy and the voters the biggest losers than the floor crossing, frog jumping or monkey acts of members of Sri Lankas 225-seat parliament.
As MPs switch sides amid allegations that they are being bought over for hundreds of millions of rupees, the voters feel betrayed. In an audio clip posted on social media, a young smart voter was heard demanding from his MP who switched sides and was sworn in as a deputy minister that he be paid Rs. 2,900  the amount was worked out by dividing the money the politico is alleged to have received by the number of preferential votes he polled.
Theres no gainsaying that Sri Lankas democracy is party-based. At the start of an election campaign, a political party presents before the voters its manifesto, outlining its policies and the programmes it intends to implement if elected to office. In the absence of a mechanism to hold the parties accountable to a judicial authority for the pledges they make in their election manifestoes, the parties do promise the sun and the moon. Whether they fulfill their promises is another matter. But the issue here is that the people do vote for a party rather than for an individual, for, at a parliamentary election, the main purpose is to elect a new ruling party or reelect the party in office. Our voting system is also structured accordingly. First we cast our vote for the party and then cast our preferences for the candidate of our choice.
Under the circumstances, if MPs elected from one party switch their allegiance to another party, it is sheer betrayal, unless, of course, they are required to do so by a petition by their electorates with the number of signatures being, at least, equal to the preferential votes they received at the election.
In Britain, though floor crossing is permitted, the present trend is MPs, instead of crossing the floor, resign their seats, publicly announce they have joined another party and stand for by-elections. Often, the MP who crosses over loses the seat.
In the United States, elected representatives can take an independent stance on any issue, although they come under the party whip. In the US, both major parties encourage their opponents to jump to their sides, but, in such instances, research shows that the voters were furious and records show that the frog had often lost the reelection bid. Research carried out on floor crossing in developed democracies underscores that what matters more to the electorate is not the candidate but the party and its policies. If a candidate becomes bigger than the party, its populism or cultism that distorts democracy.
In Australia, voters take to the streets shouting slogans such as Give back our seat when an elected member switches sides. An MP holding on to the seat and supporting a party which was not the choice of the people who elected the MP is seen in developed democracies as indulging in an act of fraud committed upon the voters.
When money or other inducements such as cabinet posts are involved, then the fraud amounts to a murder of democracy. The seat strictly belongs to the party or to the voters. It is in this context that the need for anti-defection laws assumes significance.
Sri Lankas democracy will remain defective until and unless the country strengthens its anti-defection laws or brings in constitutional amendments, making party jumping illegal. We need to ensure that the sanctity of the august assembly is not tainted by bribery and corruption and the earlier this is done the better it is for the survival of our democracy. Otherwise, what we call Sri Lankan democracy will only be a charade.
India, the worlds largest democracy, passed its anti-defection law as a constitutional amendment in 1985 with the intention of ending bribery and corruption at the highest level and the ugly practice of inducing defection with the reward of ministerial positions and perks. According to the Indian law, members of parliament or state legislatures are deemed to have defected if they either voluntarily resign from their parties or disobeyed the directives of the party leadership on a vote. Even independent members are disqualified if they join a political party because the spirit of the law, as interpreted by a five-bench Supreme Court ruling in 1992, is to respect the electors preference of the party. During the hearing, the right of an MP to defect was defended in terms of the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech, but the court held that the anti-defection law did not violate any rights, freedoms, or the basic structure of parliamentary democracy.
Sri Lanka has an anti-defection clause in the constitution. According to Article 99(13), where a Member of Parliament ceases, by resignation, expulsion or otherwise, to be a member of a recognised political party or independent group on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his becoming such Member of Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such member.
However, the vacation of the seat is subject to the provision that allows the Supreme Court to interpret the validity of a partys decision to expel an MP. Different Supreme Court benches  in the Athulathmudali, Ameer Ali, Amunugama and Piyasena cases, for instance -- have interpreted the exception provision differently and their rulings have only increased the call to amend the law to plug the loopholes.
However, in 2015 the move to strengthen the constitutional provision on anti-defection came a cropper when the Mahinda Rajapaksa-led opposition made the withdrawal of it as a condition to extend its support for the 19th Amendment. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, one of the prime movers of the 19th amendment, had to give in to get the bulk of the 19th amendment passed. But he must be ruing this mistake or the missed opportunity, having known that Joint Opposition leaders are past masters in fishing out rival party MPs with inducements of ministerial perks and allegedly money. We could have been spared of this moment of turmoil in our quest to establish democracy in our country, if we had included anti-defection provisions in the 19th Amendment.

Of fluttery butterflies and slimy LEECHES...
	

Its not everyday that a President of a representative democracy mentions butterflies, not once but twice, in a public speech. Our President is obviously not fond of butterflies, going by what he said at the rally held at the Parliament Roundabout on Monday. The interminable list of his grievances and lamentations against the ousted PM as well as the reasons for removing the latter and appointing the former President and strongman to that seat, lengthens. 
The President is all at sea in his apologetics and woefully out of logic in defence. He was so out of sync at Diyawanna that MR had to remind him to stand still for the national anthem. 
In appointing MR as PM, the President was confident that MR commanded the majority support of the Parliament. Then came the assassination plot followed by the cultural differences with RW, among other things, apparently making unity impossible. Surprising, indeed, not to have realised that they were worlds apart in terms of cultural allegiances and personal inclinations, being in Parliament for over four decades and brushing shoulders with each other; but better late than never, you may say! 
Third in the list
That aside, now it seems that it was not purely on the basis of 113 in Parliament that the President has made his dubious move on the night of October 26, which opponents call unconstitutional. Apparently, going by what he said, egged on by a cheering and devout MR worshipping crowd, MR was never a first choice. It turns out that his first choice was Sajith, the second Karu and in the absence of no volunteer to become PM, he was left with no alternative but to select MR. The UNPers are not fond of white hoppers it seems! 
Undoubtedly, the remark must have irked the Moustachioed Macho Maverick, to be counted third in the list. Falling from the throne, accepting nomination as the Kurunegala District Parliamentary candidate from MS, then standing up when MS inaugurated the eighth Parliament on September 1, 2015, and finally receiving the PM post from him a few days ago would have been too much. No, MR would not have liked that remark even a wee bit! As Ajith Perera, MP quips, not only has MS entrusted his political future in the hands of an extremely vindictive, not to say vicious politician, who never forgets those who have humiliated him, but also playing roulette with his very physical existence, with a man who wanted him six feet sub terrain, not once but five times; given the well-renowned theatrics of the Rajapaksa clan, decried by him at defection in November 2014, the apprehension
stands valid. 
"The attempt to gatecrash the Attorney Generals Department, holds the key to the question. People look at Diyawanna, Wijerama and Temple Trees, but I dare say, the eye of the storm lies in Hulftsdorp"
The Leech Tweet
Another with the acronym MS, namely Mangala Samaraweera, tweeted ,obviously feeling the pinch of the butterfly insinuation, that it was better to be a butterfly than to be a leech; a reference to a despicable creature with the habit of attaching itself to any living organism to suck blood for its own survival. Well, MS did indeed get a pint of fresh political blood on January 8 after he clung on to the UNP and a floating vote amounting to 6.2 million. Now realising that he would never be the common candidate from the green side of the divide, he embarked on a type of a blitzkrieg, the hara-kiri style , a do or die mission, to leech on to another formidable and ever compliant political organism, the most credulous, worshipping and cult like constituency of the former strongman, a proverbial easy suck for a political piggybacking leech. The numbers game which was peanuts earlier for MR and his siblings with billions to dangle, seems a bit dodgy this time around. Firstly, there are only 30 Cabinet seats to carrot out; any prospective government thus conjured, with less than one and a half years left, appearing less appetizing for the turncoats in terms of the spoils such positions offer; the obvious indignation, of the moderate and apolitical segments, as shown by the lukewarm crowd support the Jana Mahima received; RW quite unlike his old self, deciding not to budge an inch turning Temple Trees into a symbolic fort of democracy; the galvanizing effect the highhanded move has had on the grassroot member of the UNP who are flocking to Colombo day in day out, something unimaginable pre October 26; amicable Karu not being so amicable and pliant anymore to the MR bandwagon.
All this deter possible crossovers and as in the case of Manu the media man, might trigger traffic in the opposite direction. 
Picture postcards from Swaziland
It is very rarely, that a PM or a national leader of that capacity would not receive even a single congratulatory note from the international community almost two weeks after appointment. Even the good old chief of Swaziland, with his blatant excesses and orgies, had the presence of mind to check his instincts before saying hi to his old friend from Sri Lanka. Just like the Rajapaksas eagerly awaited and highly publicized each and every ship and airplane that came to their port and airport, I am sure they will blow from all trumpets had the Swazi chief, at least, posted a picture postcard to his counterpart of sorts. That too is yet to be. No, it hardly augurs well for the former strongman of this isle, not at all. He is an old fox who would have, even in his sleep, realised that a UNP government that was growing extremely unpopular and having less than eighteen months in power would have offered him an ideal springboard to bounce back with a vengeance (not only figuratively, mind you) had he the patience and more importantly, time. 
My gut feeling says it was the time factor. Something might have drastically forced his hand to accept the MS offer. Otherwise, why jeopardize a certain opportunity and the return to glory, cometh the next election 

	President out of logic in defence

	Public not privy to shady spots in SLs political history
	
The eye of the storm
The attempt to gatecrash the Attorney Generals Department, holds the key to the question. People look at Diyawanna, Wijerama and Temple Trees, but I dare say, the eye of the storm lies in Hulftsdorp. The files in the AGs Department as well as the appointment of Special High Courts. That is where the fate of a dynasty lies. The entire pantomime might not so much be directed at political power, per se, as it may be escaping the gallows or lengthy terms of imprisonment with RI. 
But that too is an educated guess of an ill informed citizen, mind you! 
There are many shady spots in our national political history that commoners like you and me are not privy to, folks! Like what MR told RW when they met on the wee hours of January 9, 2015 as well as what Gotabaya Rajapaksa whispered to RW when they met in a hush-hush one on one midnight rendezvous at Temple Trees a few days ago. Albeit now figuring as the bastille of democracy, Temple Trees is not without its fair share of political intrigue, by a long stretch! It is in such a context the rationale for the move and its aftermath baffles me. As MR himself admitted at the Diyawanna rally that he would not have made such a move himself, had he been the President; he needs not. He is not a leech who has to cling on to an alien political entity for survival. That is, if not for the time factor! 
In the mean time, the politics of butterflies and leeches, eating white hoppers and drinking black coffee, continues to dazzle the public eye. 
I dare venture to state who are better; butterflies or leeches Even if I did, would it matter, when a 6.2 million vote matters so little

He met with the TNA delegation on Wednesday and discussed the current political situation. He reportedly asked the TNA to abstain from the vote of no confidence if it were moved.
However, the TNA said it had taken a decision to vote against the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. In response, the President is reported to have said that he will not reappoint Mr. Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, the President assured the parliamentary of his UPFA on Wednesday evening that he would, for sure, secure the required majority to form a stable administration, and therefore no one in the party should worry about it. (Kelum Bandara)

Ravi's daughter asked to appear in Court on Monday
	
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratna today ordered the MP Ravi Karunanayake's daughter to appear in Court on Monday.
The Magistrate said said this order was made after considering a motion filed by the CID and another filed by Mr. Karunanayke's daughter.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Grihagama supporting the motion filed by the CID said Onela Karunanayake was asked to report to the CID to record her statement in connection with the investigations into the bond scam.
However, Ms Karunanayake who had reported to the C ID at 8.50 am had left at 9.05 a.m. without informing the CID.
President's Counsel Shavendra Fernando appearing with Sajeewa Jayawardena for the two lawyers who had accompanied Ms Onela said she had gone to the CID on October 29 on a request by the CID to make the statement. But without recording her statement the CID had asked her to come on another day.
She had reported to the CID on November 5 with attorneys-at- law Aravinda Gamage and Amila Pieris.
The counsel said a person introducing himself as the receptionist had asked for the names of the two attorneys and had refused to allow them to accompany Ms. Karunanayake. Therefore Ms Onila after spending some time at the CID premises had returned home.(T.Farook Thajudeen)

The country is currently facing a non-righteous debt situation and it could lead to a debt crisis if not tackled early, Governor of Central Bank Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
The Governor made these observations when he testified at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka on Wednesday (7).
He told the Commission that his colleagues in the debt department were capable of managing the situation but highlighted that it is the duty of each citizen to be aware of government policy.
Mr. Coomaraswamy added that every citizen should act in line with government policy and people should elect MPs those who are cautious enough to handle financial matters as their representatives.
I am not referring to any government, in particular, its been the case ever since we received independence, Coomaraswamy said. (Yoshitha Perera)

Susil's statement shows RW sacked to dismantle special courts: Ajith
	
The real objective of removing UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of Premier is obvious when going by the remarks made by newly-appointed Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha, UNP MP Ajith P. Perera said today.
He told a media briefing that the statement made by the new justice minister that his first act would be to abolish the Special Courts established under the Judicature (Amendment) Act and is clearly why Mr. Wickremesinghe was sacked from his post.
Cases connected to some 120 files that were investigated were to be taken up by the newly established courts and Mr. Premajayantha's statement reveals the objective of forming a new government and avoid these cases from being heard, Mr. Perera said.
He said the statement made by MP Dayasiri Jayasekera that one or two MPs might be killed on November 14 could mean that the SLFP and SLPP was trying to secure a majority in the House by killing MPs.
UNP MP Harsha De Silva said the newly appointed government had failed to arrest the economic issues including the devaluation of the rupee.
The value of the rupee against the dollar was Rs.172 on October 26 but it has dropped to Rs.175.13 as of yesterday, he said.
Dr. De Silva said it was amusing to hear the new International Trade Minister saying that new government will reconsider its earlier decision to abolish the free trade agreement signed with Singapore after repeatedly pledging to abolish it no sooner they came to power.(Yohan Perera)

Tenants leave, taking with them the doors and windows
	
A married couple obtained a shop premises in the Southern Province on lease and started a shoe business, but as the business was not profitable they informed the owner, who was based in Colombo, that they were closing up shop.
As the lease period was not up and having only been in business for six months, the couple requested the owner to refund a part of the money paid on the lease. The owner refused and an argument arose which led to a quarrel.
Sensing the serious trouble they would have to face, the couple requested for a months grace to vacate the premises, a request the owner of the premises readily agreed to.
Before a months grace had lapsed, the owner of the premises visited the shop and to his horror, he found that the couple had not only removed the goods from the shop but the doors and windows as well before doing the vanishing trick. The dejected owner is now gathering information from his neighbours in order to track down the couple. (Upasena Liyanagama)

Unsolved crimes and political dramas
	

uring his presidential election campaign in 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena used photos of murdered ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen and missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda to criticise the state of affairs under former President Mahinda Rajapaksas rule. At every election rally, Sirisena, ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe along with other politicians of the United National Front (UNF) Government spoke about the spate of killings, assaults, intimidations and abductions committed between 2005 and 2015.They promised to serve justice in cases including the alleged murder of Thajudeen, shooting of Katunayake Free Trade Zone (FTZ) worker Roshen Chanaka, the suspected killing of 27 prisoners at Welikada, the abduction of 11 youth in Dehiwala-Kotahena areas and the disappearance of journalist and cartoonist Ekneligoda.
Since 2015, there seemed to be little progress in the investigations. The suspects of a few cases were arrested and compensation was paid to the families of victims. But, the masterminds behind the above mentioned criminal acts are still enjoying impunity. President Sirisenas Government, that promised to clear the stigma associated with the country regarding unsolved crimes of the previous regime, has failed to keep its word.
Witnesses of the killing and abduction cases and relatives of the victims aired their views on the political change that is taking place in the country. They also voiced their opinions on how it would affect the ongoing investigations of their cases. They fear that the return of the previously ousted powerful leader Mahinda Rajapaksa would officially put the full stop to the ongoing investigations.
Wasim Thajudeen, a prominent national rugby player, was found dead in a burnt car in May 2012 in Kirulapone. Earlier it was reported that his car had crashed into a wall and caught fire. It was ruled as an accidental death. However, the recent investigations by the CID had found that the player was murdered before the accident and what was made to resemble an accident was staged.
Former Officer-In-Charge of Narahenpita Police Sumith Perera, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Colombo Judicial Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara have been arrested in connection with the cover-up after the murder. However, no suspect has been arrested yet regarding the killing of the rugby player. The next trial date for the case is November 29.
During the past three and a half years, Thajudeens murder case was making headlines almost every other day. Ayesha Thajudeen, the sister of the national rugby player, spoke to the Daily Mirror and expressed her disappointment over the political drama which was linked to his brothers murder case.
She said that her family had hope when there were developments in the investigation. But, during the past one and half year, the investigation and the hearings turned out to be a mockery. I have stopped going to the hearings, Ayesha said. She is of the view that the political conflict between the two main political parties may have contributed to the bureaucratic delay of this murder case.

"Our sadness has now turned into hatred because we shouldnt have gone through such an unpleasant experience if there was nothing important going to surface from the case"
It has been very difficult for Thajudeens family to endure an experience in which one of its members face was in the headlines every day and eventually conclude with no positive outcome. She believes that the law enforcement authorities possess information regarding her brothers murder. Yet, they are not ready to release it to support the investigation.
Our sadness has now turned into hatred because we shouldnt have gone through such an unpleasant experience if there was nothing important going to surface from the case, said Ayesha. I dont think we can harbour hope that this case would move forward. The only wish is that God will serve justice some day, Ayesha said. She pointed out that the judiciary and every law prevailing in the country should be put together for the benefit of its citizens. Even the political arena is in an entire mess now. How can we have any hope regarding our brothers case asked Ayesha.
She stated that Sri Lanka has reached a point where the country as a whole has lost. It isnt only about crimes, she reflected.
It is ten years since the white van abductions featuring 11 youth had taken place in and around Colombo. The family members, whose sons, husbands and fathers have failed to return home since September 2008- when they were abducted in white vans allegedly by the Sri Lanka Navy- still demand that the authorities find out the whereabouts of their loved ones. During their 10-year struggle, Achala Senevirathne was the lawyer who represented the aggrieved families. Senevirathne said that it is too sad to say that parents, wives and children of the abducted are still looking forward to the return of their loved ones. She also said that they need to see the truth prevail, since all the evidence had been collected from the required parties.
Governments may change from time to time. But the judicial system, where people seek justice from, has to remain independent without any political influence. We started this case against abductions of the 11 youths while being under pressure from outside parties who wanted us to withdraw ourselves from the case, she said.
She underscored that detectives attached to law enforcement authorities and lawyers should be given the freedom to carry out their duties without fear. Senevirathne made a request; Dont touch judiciarys independency and law and order. Then the public can have confidence that their cases will be decided fairly and in accordance with the law.
Six years have lapsed since the deaths of 27 inmates inside Welikada Prison; during a riot and in the aftermath of the incidents which took place in November 2012. The failure to promptly open and carry out a criminal investigation into the deaths is another black mark on Sri Lankas justice system.
Despite having strong evidence and the testimonies of a number of witnesses to the alleged shooting incident, those who gave orders to shoot selected inmates havent been caught. The families of those killed claim that those responsible for the alleged massacre include some powerful political and security officials who are still roaming free.
A key eyewitness to the shooting incident, Sudesh Nandimal Silva alleged that those who gave orders to shoot at the prisoners have surfaced in society due to changing political power. Silva has frequently been threatened and intimidated. Within the past three and half years, we witnessed some progress in investigations of crimes committed during the Rajapaksa regime. The investigations were slowly and steadily reaching the prosecution, he said.
"Governments may change from time to time. But the judicial system, where people seek justice from, has to remain independent without any political influence"
Silva thinks that deliberately protecting culprits of the crimes and delaying judicial procedure against them are chief reasons for the present political calamity. He said that the relatives of the victims of these cases had worked hard to unseat the previous Government, expecting good governance in stead where lives of the people would be safe. But, now President Sirisena has brought the Rajapaksas back to power, Silva said. He has no doubt that Mahinda Rajapaksas return to power would expose their lives to more danger.
He is also disappointed with Presidents actions. Maithripala Sirisena assumed power by promoting our cases and being sensitive to our tears. He used the cases to get more votes and promised to bring justice to all the victims. He also promised to release the country from the grips of criminals. Dont let people experience another period of terror, he pleaded.
Cartoonist and political analyst Prageeth Ekneligoda went missing in January, 2010, shortly before the Presidential Election. His wife Sandya Ekneligoda, demanding an account of her husbands whereabouts, has taken her protest even to the United Nations. She has been threatened and insulted by various people, yet she is determined to continue with her fight. Sandya told the Daily Mirror that the Army doesnt offer the necessary support in the investigations.
They have information to continue with the investigations or to conclude them. But, for reasons known to them, they arent ready to support the case, she complained.
I have been facing threats and intimidations even during the Yahapalana Government. By today the Rajapaksas have acquired power again. Our lives are in danger now. We never know how things would turn out, she said. She also criticized that several media organisations are working on propaganda, adding that the journalists and editors should not forget how media stations were burnt down, journalists were killed and attacked during the Rajapaksa regime.
She stated that democracy in this country is at stake now. Speaking on the current political crisis, Ekneligoda said, Sirisenas actions in 2017 and 2018 did not match his words in 2015. If his actions did not match his words, then his words were nothing, but blatant lies, Sandya stressed.
Roshen Chanaka was shot dead in May, 2011 by the police during a protest by Free Trade Zone (FTZ) workers in Katunayake against a Government move to introduce a pension scheme for the private sector employees.
His mother, W.D. Kanthi ,who still laments over her sons demise, has been engaging in monthly protests outside the FTZ, demanding that the Government releases the report compiled by former High Court Judge Mahanama Tillekeratne on the Katunayake FTZ violence. Although the report was said to have been handed over to the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it was not published nor were the recommendations of the report implemented.
Kanthi said that she also worked hard for the victory of the Yahapalana Government with high expectations of a safe country for sons of all Sri Lankan mothers. We cannot live in an unsafe country. Now we are compelled to do so. No one can guarantee the safety of our sons in this country now. The only thing that the Yahapalana Government did was the release of the Mahanama Tillekeratne Report. It also happened as a result of continual protests and requests, Kanthi said.
She said that no matter who occupies the hot seat in politics, she would demand justice for her son; who died at a young age.
Criminals should not be set free by any government. All the family members gathered here today have the right to hear the news of a fair verdict by the judiciary, Kanthi added.
Meanwhile, Nava Sama Samaja Party Leader Wickramabahu Karunaratne said that in a country like Sri Lanka, impunity for murderers, fraudsters and human right violaters has been the norm.
No person committing criminal activities has been held responsible for any of the human rights violations committed under the last Rajapaksa Government between 2005 and 2015. There has been little or no progress in investigating the attacks and threats that have taken place. We thought that the Yahapalana Government was a victory for democracy. We were wrong, Karunarathne said.

Apart from the murder of Thajudeen, shooting of Chanaka, killing of 27 prisoners at Welikada, abduction of 11 youths for ransom and the abduction of Ekneligoda, there are many unsolved cases such as the extra-judicial killings during the 88-89 period which took place under the rule of the UNP Government too included in the accounts presented in the Batalanda Commission report.
However, the lack of accountability together with violence and threats can affect the investigations and the parties who have been continuing to pursue these cases over the years despite obstacles. Whoever is in office, until authorities take concrete steps to reduce impunity, it will be difficult for the country to restore trust of the people in countrys democratic system and judiciary system.

I dont think any of these investigations is genuine
New Govt. Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella
The Daily Mirror contacted the newly appointed Government Spokesperson and State Minister of Mass Media and Digital Infrastructure Keheliya Rambukwella for a comment on behalf of the new government regarding the above mentioned allegations.
Rambukwella comments
The Yahapalana Government promised that they would bring perpetrators of those incidents to book. They had almost four years in office to keep their word. But, I dont think they found anything substantial or anything that can be proved in a court of law. As they havent found any powerful political character behind these incidents as they earlier said, I dont think any of these investigations is genuine.
"These so-called investigations are still in the non-summary level where the law enforcement agencies havent been able to find conclusive evidence against the defendants"
The Army officials and Police officers were arrested and kept in remand with no strong charges against them. I salute the judges who bravely took the decision to grant bail to several suspects saying that they could not be locked up unless the detectives could prove their guilt. For an example, Senior DIG Anura Senanayake was kept in remand for almost 13 months. This is political victimization, said Rambukwella. He also said that these so-called investigations are still in the non-summary level where the law enforcement agencies havent been able to find conclusive evidence against the defendants.
Wont continue investigations based on presumptions
MP namal rajapaksa
Meanwhile, Member of Parliament and eldest son of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa, speaking to the Daily Mirror upheld Minister Rambukwellas claims.
He said that under his fathers new government, they would not continue or initiate investigations based on presumptions without having strong evidence. There is no room for politically motivated investigations under our Government.

Vasu denounces 'entertaining' foreign envoys in House
	
Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday criticized Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for what he called entertaining foreign envoys in Parliament and inquired if the Speakers of these countries would have allowed the intrusion by our envoys in the affairs of their Parliaments and States.
In a letter to the Speaker, National Languages and Social Integration Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara said he was shocked to note that the Speaker had entertained foreign Ambassadors at his Parliament office when it remain prorogued to discuss matters that concerned the President, Prime Minister and the State.
Significant among those who were invited were the envoys of the US and the UK as well as those from other western countries. It is common knowledge that some of these countries actively engaged themselves in the Presidential Election held in 2015, in which you played a pivotal role to oust the then regime. Would the Speakers of these respective countries have entertained intrusions by our Ambassadors/High Commissioners in the affairs of their Parliaments and their States, he queried.
Recently, the minister pointed out that the US and the UK had been 'concerned' about alleged plots by other countries to meddle in their elections and political sphere. In this context, I fail to comprehend your tolerance of the intrusive conduct of these envoys et al in the affairs of our State, he said.
He said Speaker Jayasuriya was a part of the plot to oust the government in January 2015 and colluded to compel the President to appoint a Prime Minister, who had the backing of only 48 MPs, whilst there was a sitting Prime Minister who had the support of 155 members of the House.
How is it then that you find it unacceptable when the President appoints a new Prime Minister, who led a movement that received mass support in the recent local Government Elections In doing so, have you not usurped the powers of the President, as the Constitution mandates in the assessment of the level of confidence commanded by the appointed Prime Minister amongst the Members of Parliament, he inquired.

We're opposed to elections under this illegal Govt: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it was dangerous to go for an election under a government which obtained power through unconstitutional means and stressed the need to rectify the present political crisis before going for a national election.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news conference that the approval of a two-thirds majority in parliament should be obtained after rectifying this unconstitutional political coup before announcing an election.
It is dangerous if someone goes for an election after obtaining power through unconstitutional means. If an election was announced under this unconstitutional government, it will be clearly construed as a part of this political coup," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Why hip fractures should be fixed early

Why hip fractures should be fixed early
	

Each lower limb is connected to the body via the hip joint which is very stable and socket type joint. It allows a vast range of movements. Each joint transfers half of the body weight when one stands upright. Talking about this part of the body, hip fractures are quite common in our present society. We spoke to Dr. Chandana Herath, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Base Hospital, Nuwara Eliya to shed light on the topic. Excerpts:

Q Who are vulnerable to hip fractures 
Hip fractures are commonly seen in the elderly women who have osteoporosis and is less common in men. The bone at the hip joint will be broken after a simple fall on ones side. The peak incidents noted in the Sri Lankan population take place between the ages between 70-85 years.

QWhy are hip fractures commonly associated with the elderly 
Fall prone bodily changes like poor vision, general slowness, prolonged reaction time and other medical conditions which interfere with balance and walking develop with advancing age. As I mentioned earlier, the weakened osteoporotic bone due to ageing is susceptible to fracture.

Q What exactly happens during a hip fracture
There are many ways the hip can break and it ranges from two pieces to four pieces. The exact location of the fracture also matters when deciding the method of fixation. After examining the patient an orthopaedic surgeon will decide which method of treatment is suitable for a particular patient.
Patients who had half hip replacement would be off the bed next day morning and they are able walk with the full weight on the operated leg. We will recommend you to use a walking frame to ensure you do not fall again. The others who had plate and screw fixations are able to walk with a walking frame the next day. A patient will be advised as to how much weight must be applied on the operated leg.

Q How would you figured out if a person has a hip fracture
A patient will find it difficult to stand up and put weight on the injured side. Pain will be felt at the groin when the leg is moved. The leg will appear short and turned outwards at the foot.

Q What could you do at home
Make sure that the injured person is out of danger from further injuries and splint the leg to the uninjured leg. Two paracetamol tablets can be given to the patient until he is taken to the hospital. The patient can be in a seated position if pain-free. However, it is safer for the patient to be transported while lying flat. Make sure to take all available medical records and medications with the patient.

Q The procedure at the hospital 
The patient will be examined and assessed by a doctor. A plain X - ray of the hip/Pelvis will be taken to identify the fracture.

Q What is the health impact of a hip fracture 
The health of an elderly person can be deranged significantly and rapidly after sustaining a hip fracture. The elderly may look healthy as long as their bodies function undisturbed. Once this homeostasis is disturbed, recovery is slower. When the patients are bed bound with a hip injury, their heart activity, blood flow to parts of the body, respiration, bowel motions, hormonal regulations and brain function are subjected to change. Developing chest and urine infections is common in these patients and may worsen the condition. They are prone to develop bedsores rapidly and existing medical conditions like diabetes could go out of control despite regular medications.

Q How can these complications be prevented
Surgical fixation of the hip joint is the reliable option available. The current recommendation by the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (NICE) UK, is to have hip surgery approximately within 36-48 hours after the injury. Alternative treatment methods can not achieve a better outcome and the strong recommendation is to perform surgery without delay.

Q What are the benefits of the surgical treatment procedure
The pain will be reduced immediately after the operation and there will be a marked relief. It will help in many ways since pain has deleterious effects on body physiology. So the derangement of the body organ systems will be reduced.

Q When can a patient walk again after hip surgery
The patient can be mobilised easily i.e. can be allowed to sit, transfer from bed to chair. Nursing care could be given easily. A patient can stand up the following day after surgery and slowly return to normal activities.

Q What are the type of surgeries
There are three main ways of fixing the broken bone. When the fracture is at the zone 1 (shown in picture), you will need a half hip joint replacement (Hemiarthroplasty). Total hip replacement will be done during certain instances. The fractures in the zone 2 are fixed with a plate and screws (Dynamic Hip Screw- DHS). Zone 3 fractures need fixation with a metal rod (Proximal femoral nail-PFN) inserted into the canal of the bone.

Q How long is the surgery
It is a major surgery. However, it is a frequently performed simple surgery and will take about 45 minutes. The patient will be anesthetised to numb the lower limbs. Incision is made over the side of the hip about 4 inches. Immediately after fixing the hip the patient is allowed to eat and drink. One needs to remain in the hospital for 1-2 days after the operation. Medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, previous heart problems do matter with anaesthesia. However, medical conditions are optimised before surgery and modern day anesthesia is safe.

A patient will find it difficult to stand up and put weight on the injured side. Pain will be felt at the groin when the leg is moved. The leg will appear short and turned outwards at the foot

Q When can a patient return home after surgery 
Generally, a patient can return home within 1-2 days. However, it may take additional 1 or 2 days if medical problems like diabetes are not under control.

Q What will happen if surgery is avoided
If your fracture is in the zone 1 (Fig 1), never opt for healing without surgery because you may not be able to walk. Fractures in the zones 1 and 2 (Fig 1) might heal without a surgery. However, a patient has to remain in bed for eight to ten weeks without walking. After healing a patient will have difficulty in walking, squatting and wearing trousers.
If surgery is not done the fractured leg will be painful up to one month. In addition, there is a high chance of developing complications like bed sores, pneumonia, blood clots in the calves and lungs etc. The chance of losing life is high within the 1st year after injury if surgery is not done. Further, the leg could be shortening and awkwardly healed. A patient will never be able to walk normally again. Sometimes, it may not heal at all and then would require an operation later. In such cases the operation will be difficult and the injury may get complicated.

Q How about wound care
The wound will be checked before being discharged from the hospital. The wound heals within 7-10 days. Having a shower after one week is not a problem and the wound should be kept dry following a bath.
Patients will be screened to detect other medical conditions like checking for eye sight and controlling osteoporosis which could prevent further falls.
