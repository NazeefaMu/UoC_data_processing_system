Commission to Investigate into Complaints Regarding Missing Persons today met presidential secretary P. B. Abeykoon and requested a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Commission Chairman Maxwell Paranagama said they had exchanged views on the action taken by the Commission so far and discussed what needed to be done in future.
“We requested a meeting with the President and the Prime Minister to discuss the future action to be taken by the Commission and mentioned that the Commission’s mandate ends on February 15,” he said.
The Commission was appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on August 15, 2013 and its mandate was renewed every six-months.
Mr. Paranagama said the Commission would continue to probe the complaints received though the date of the next public sitting has to be fixed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
