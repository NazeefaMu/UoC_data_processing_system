A story that has gone viral in public service refers to a driver of a woman purohita who is said to be wielding more power and authority than the Ministry’s topmost white-collar high-up himself. 

 


His exploits range from manipulating marks scored by job aspirants at top level interviews to providing jobs in various establishments coming under the purview of the Ministry, they say.


The number of people calling on this driver to get their needs attended to is much higher than those seeking an audience with the purohita herself.


People from the purohita’s electorate calling at the Ministry openly admit that this driver is much more helpful in getting their problems solved than the white-collar high-ups or the purohita herself.
