Two double decker buses were deployed recently under a tourist promotion drive launched in a city dotted with numerous sites of religious and cultural significance.

 

Soon after the inauguration of this tourist bus service, the chief purohita and a certain recently appointed provincial purohita had taken a ride right round the city in a double decker. However, the VIP duo riding around the city were in for a very unpleasant surprise when groups of people who had gathered at several points on the route greeted them with boos. 


It later transpired that boos and jeers were mainly directed at the recently appointed provincial purohita who had become a thick chum of the chief purohita after a bid led by him to oust the latter had failed. The crowds had shouted slogans deriding and condemning the provincial purohita for ‘now kissing a hand he tried hard to cut.”
