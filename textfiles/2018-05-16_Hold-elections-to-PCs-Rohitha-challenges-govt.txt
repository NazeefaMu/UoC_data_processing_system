Hold elections to 3 PCs: Rohitha challenges govt.


	

Former minister and MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena yesterday challenged the Government to hold elections to three Provincial Councils, Sabaragamuwa, North-Central and Eastern in the same month.

Addressing a news briefing, he said although the government had promised on numerous occasions that it would hold the elections to the three PCs, it had been unable to do so due to the instability of the government.

“If the UNP and SLFP intend to contest the PC polls together they are welcome to do so. But, we know for sure that whichever party or amalgamation of parties put their names forward for the PC polls, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will win at the election convincingly,” Abeygunawardena said.

Meanwhile, he said people were confronted with a lot of issues due to the hike in fuel prices.

“The prices of goods like fish, short eats, and tea would go up soon. This situation is a result of the poor economic management of the government,” Abeygunawardena said, adding that this government has been the most unsuccessful government in the history of politics.
