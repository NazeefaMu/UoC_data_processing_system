The animal which is believed to be from the species of Mongoose has not yet been clearly identified.
The WLD said the animal had no tail and its fur was yellow and brown.

Mr. Bandara said the Genetec Institute’s gene tests would soon identify whether the animal is a kind of deformed mongoose species.
