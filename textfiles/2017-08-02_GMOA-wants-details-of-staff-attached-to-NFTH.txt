The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today referred a letter to Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa requesting for information on the staff of medical officers attached to the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that they had earlier referred a letter to Mr. Sugathadasa requesting for a copy of the agreement signed on acquiring the NFTH to the government under the RTI and added that there was no response with regard to it.

“Even the Supreme Court has allowed the GMOA to intervene into this issue. Despite such a condition, the ministry has not provided us with a copy of the agreement. We are forced to take legal actions against this incident in future,” he said.

He said that it was a question whether the doctors and nurses who had earlier worked at the NFTH, would now be considered as government officers or not. He also said that it was a question whether these staff members had been offered with appointment letters, if they had taken to the government cadre.

“It is necessary to consider about the qualifications of these staff member and their standards to work as government officers,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said that the National Protest Day (NPD) organised by the ‘SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra’ in protest of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was successfully held today across the country.

He said that all the unions attached to the healthcare services, political parties, university students, parents and several other trade unions attached to the government and private sector had participated in these protests.

He said that they had carried out the main protest march against the SAITM from the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) premises to the Health Ministry today. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
