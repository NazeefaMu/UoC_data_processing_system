A strong dust storm swept across several parts of western and northern India on Wednesday, killing more than 100 people and injuring hundreds more in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, leaving a trail of destruction, uprooting trees and disrupting power supply in Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.  


At least 64 people were killed in four districts of western Uttar Pradesh with maximum deaths reported in Agra.  


Thirty-five people were killed in Rajasthan with Bharatpur suffering the maximum damage. The district reported 17 deaths. Nine people died in neighbouring Dholpur in the high-speed dust storm that started around 7pm and wreaked havoc for two hours. Nine deaths were reported from Alwar.  


Most deaths occurred in house collapse due to the storm, officials in 
Rajasthan said.  


A squall and dust storm followed by heavy rain also lashed New Delhi on Wednesday evening and caused traffic snarls in some parts of the national capital.  


The storm also caused major destruction in Alwar where more than 100 trees were uprooted, many of which fell on stationary vehicles and snapped electricity cables. The power distribution company switched off electricity to prevent further damage.  


Weather department officials said the downpour and thunderstorm are expected to continue for another 48 hours especially in the hilly regions like Chamoli, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag and Pithoragarh districts.  


 The Meteorological Centre, Uttarakhand warned a fresh downpour was approaching and likely to affect the western Himalayan region from May 5.
