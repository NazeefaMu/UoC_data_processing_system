Joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage yesterday rejected the allegation made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake that he had bought a house in England saying the Bribery Commission (BC) had proved him innocent.

He said that the Bribery Commission and the CID had conducted an investigation which showed that he was in no way connected.

The MP said he had disclosed these matters in his 2009 Assets and Liabilities declaration.

"My brother Vijayananda Aluthgamage, who is in Japan purchased that house to help his two children studying in England. After this government came into power, I was accused of owning a house in England. My brother was brought to the BC and CID with regard to the incident and he produced proof of his earnings to purchase that house," he said.

Mr. Aluthgamage said the CID had conducted an investigation and forwarded it to the Attorney General, but they only managed to file a case against him two weeks ago saying that he had obtained Rs. 3.9 million from a Trade Union.

"The CID filed that case after I urged it to take action against me. The government kept on calling us thieves for the past two years. But they only managed to file a case against me for obtaining Rs.3.9 million from a Trade Union ," he said.

He challenged Mr. Ramanayake to talk about fraud and corruption by UNP ministers including the Prime Minister, within the UNP parliamentary group meeting.

He said he was ready to face any legal action.

"I am a businessman. I own several companies," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
