The name of a Sri Lankan who worked in Dubai for a monthly pay of Rs.25, 000 about 15 years ago figures in the Panama Papers list, they say.

 


This worthy, who also served the former royal family as an odd-job man, became a billionaire within a short time.  


Now, an owner of a high-end hotel in a foreign country, this person has been providing food and lodging to the members of the former royal family, whenever they were on a private visit to an Arab country in the mid-east.
