Former minister Mervyn Silva, who recently established an organisation named "Joint Opposition", said a picture of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe should be hung at SLFP Headquarters, as he had helped to create the present government.

Addressing the media, he said that the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena could be established only because of the support given by Mr. Wickremesinghe and therefore, his picture should be hung as a matter of courtesy.
