US quits UNESCO over 'anti-Israel bias'


	

The US is pulling out of the UN's cultural organisation UNESCO, accusing it of "anti-Israel" bias, the BBC reported a short while ago.

Quoting the US state department, the article said the US was also concerned about mounting financial arrears at UNESCO and that the agency needed to be reformed.

Meanwhile, UNESCO Head Irina Bokova has said the withdrawal was a matter of "profound regret".
The withdrawal represented a loss to the "UN family" and to multilateralism, Ms. Bokova said.

The US will establish an observer mission at the Paris-based UNESCO to replace its representation, the state department said.

The decision follows a string of UNESCO decisions that have drawn criticism from the US and Israel.

In 2011, the US cancelled its budget contribution to the agency in protest at its decision to grant full membership to the Palestinians.

And last year, Israel suspended cooperation with UNESCO after the agency adopted a controversial resolution which made no reference to Jewish ties to a key holy site in Jerusalem.

Then earlier this year, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned UNESCO for declaring the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank a World Heritage site.

The US withdrawal is also motivated by a desire to save money, Foreign Policy magazine reported.

US President Donald Trump has criticised what he sees as a disproportionate contribution by the US to UN institutions.

The US funds 22% of the UN's regular budget and 28% of UN peacekeeping.
