SAITM: GMOA says not too optimistic about committee report


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today it was not too optimistic about the Presidential Committee Report on SAITM on the basis that the report contradicted the committee’s recommendations.

It said the committee report contained grave errors and the GMOA had appointed its own committee to study the entire report of the presidential committee before arriving at a final decision.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference the committee had concluded that SAITM had stopped student enrollment and therefore there is no reason why it repeats that recommendation.

“Even though the committee says SAITM has stopped student enrollment, Dr Neville Fernando told a newspaper that he has accepted 300 more applications. GMOA had earlier requested the authorities to issue a legal order banning student enrolment until this matter is resolved,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
