Over certain actions of govt.I'm disappointed: Susil Premajayantha
	
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha yesterday said he was disappointed with certain activities of the government and that even SLFP leaders did not accept his ideas.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Head Quarters, the minister said the United National Party did not accept the ideas of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
He also said some have come to power with the intention of selling state resources but the SLFP would not do so.
There was a practice of selling state properties during the previous United National Party (UNP) governments. Since then the Sirimavo Bandaranaike SLFP government had taken back state institutions which were under Western rule, he said.
The Minister alleged: The UNPers in the past while in power sold state properties and its still repeating same. Recently, the government had sold 80% of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese firm. Without selling the Port we should have a plan of proper management. For that we have the relevant people and resource persons.
What happens is that policy makers are not listening to the advise of professionals in the country. That was the problem of drawing the government to sell its property. There should be a proper plan to provide jobs to 10 million youth as what the government promised , Minister Premajayantha said.
Every commercial enterprise has a business plan. First of all the government has to think whether they are capable of managing the State institution . If the plan was not applicable, the government should implement another plan. Without thinking of any business plans, I think this government had come to power with an idea of selling its properties, he said.
The whole world is moving to different paths with the development of new technology. Without drawing the country according to the requirement of the fast movement, there was no point of handing over or selling state organizations to some other countries. That shows where we are heading to , he said.
After the Hambantota Port, there is a possibility of selling the SriLankan Airlines, like wise even the Katchatheevu island, the Minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

PCoI Chairman questions Palisena on his predictions of Govts fund requirement
	
Chairman of the PCoI Justice K. T. Chitrasiri today asked the CEO of PTL Kasun Palisena as to why he did not think that Central Bank Officials advertised only for Rs 1 billion worth of bonds while knowing the fund requirement of the Government, since they had other means of collecting the required funds.
Justice Chitrasiri made the observation on considering the earlier submission by Palisena that they bid 15 times more than the advertised amount, after predicting the urgent fund requirement of the Government which was much more than the advertised amount.
Summarizing the line of questioning done on the other day (August 9) over bidding a 15 times bigger volume at February 27 auction, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena yesterday told the witness that the Commission has an open mind and hence to provide any other reasons as to why he identified that auction to be extraordinary.
The witness said that the Rs. 300 billion worth of payments made by the Government using reserves without raising borrowings for the maturity repayments of the Bonds, interest rate payments of IMF loans and for the Mini budget proposals and also the canvassing conducted by the CBSL officials on February 27 auction hinted them that the Government was in need of money.
During witness explanation which was quite the same as what he had said the on Wednesday, Justice KT Chithrasiri questioned the witness Having known about what was offered at the auction (1 billion), CBSL officials were also well aware about the fund requirement of the Government and other urgent requirements as you said, so dont you think that they had other means of collecting money
Because of the canvassing done by the CBSL, we predicted that the government urgent money requirement and with the mini budget during the hundred day program we felt the government was in need of money, witness Palisena said.
Requirements of funds were also known to the Government officers, therefore, dont you think when CBSL advertised for only 1 billion they might have had some other means of raising the required money , Justice Chithrasiri asked.
The witness said he made those predictions on his capacity as a primary dealer and did his job only.
In the mean time, Chief Executive Officer of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Kasun Palisena yesterday also said that he had convinced foreign investors to invest in Government securities, equity and FDIs at the Singapore Finance Asia Summit sponsored by PTL in March 2016 referring to the possible International Monetary Fund assistance, which Sri Lanka was to receive as an Emergency Fund Facility at the time..
Referring to three bond auctions that took place on October 26, 2015, March 29, 2016 and March 31, 2016, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd Chief Executive Officer, Kasun Palisena explained to the Commission on what basis it had placed much larger volume of bids, at a higher rate than what had been offered.
It was explained that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had placed a higher volume of bids than the offered value of bids at those auctions.
Referring to the auction held on October 2015, Mr. Palisena explained that they were expecting Sovereign Bonds to be raised at the latter part of the year and thereby the yield rates would pick up. And also he said that there was a rumor about a Forex swap with India, which was positive news for the market. He said when they were bidding a larger quantity PTL wanted a rate which they were comfortable with.
Referring to the two auctions held on March 29 and 31, 2016, Mr. Palisena explained as to why they were bidding much higher quantity at a higher rate.
He said that there was pressure on the interest rate again starting from the latter part of 2015 to March 2016 because there was a down turn in the foreign investments in Sri Lanka.
The witness said that the down turning would generally effect in picking the yield up because there were heavy foreign exits by the beginning of 2016.
Heavy foreign exits in the market by March 2016 effected an upward trend in the rate, the witness said.
While elaborating the situation that the Government was facing by March 2016, the witness said that Sri Lanka was looking for international assistance because of the Balance of Payment crisis that happened with the exit of foreign investments.
He said there was IMF assistance as EFF (Emergency Fund Facility) offing for above reason.
Sri Lanka was facing a balance of payment crisis due to sudden foreign exist, he said.
The witness was of the view that it was another reason for them to predict Governments urgent fund requirement by March 2016 before the two T-bond auctions (March 29 and 31, 2016).
He also explained on what basis they went on to bid at a higher rate at those auctions.
Even at the Summit that we had in Singapore in March, we went out to promote Sri Lanka and I mentioned that any yield above 12 % is a buy currently in Sri Lanka, he said.
During the evidence led by Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando and Counsel Romali Tudawe, it was explained that PTL had sponsored a summit Finance Asia held in March 2016, in Singapore to promote Sri Lankan Government Securities, equity and FDIs.
The witness also said that PTL sponsored the summit partnered with a Singaporean company and there was a presentation done by one Thiruchelvam from that company.
Subsequent to the presentation there was a panel discussion at the summit.
What did you tell foreign investors, Counsel Romali Tudawe asked.
Witness said,  I managed to convince them to come and buy Sri Lankan products. We showed if IMF funds come how it will be positive news for the market.
He said there was a specific need over IMFs assistance to come at that time because the Government was almost facing a balance of payment crisis.
Government had to find methods for repayments, he said.
Mr. Palisena also confirmed that the IMF assistance (EFF) however came after April, 2016.
He also said that the CBSLs officials also did participate at the Summit held in Singapore. Then Governor Mahendran, Mr. Sarathchandra, Mr. Jayalath and some Public Debt Department officers had participated.
The witness was of the view that all the times when Government was in such situations the yield rates picked up and they were part of the factors them to predict Governments fund requirement than what CBSL had offered on the advertisements before the auctions held on March 29 and 31, 2016.
Mr. Palisenas evidence will continue tomorrow. (By Shehan Chamika Silva)

Ravi's resignation sets a good precedent: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament today that Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake had set a good precedent by resigning from his portfolio.
He said no member of the previous government had resigned no matter how serious the charges levelled against them were.
The Premier said the ministers resignation to allow for impartial investigations showed this governments commitment to good governance.
The Premier said media institutions were making allegations today taking advantage of the environment of freedom that prevails in the country today.
"Had the media done this during the previous regime, it would have experienced the same fate which befell Lasantha Wickramatunga and Prageeth Eknaligoda. Media today paints everyone as thieves because of media freedom," he said.

The Blackmailing Bogeyman Behind  the Screen Cyber Exploitation and Violence in Sri Lanka
	
What is the value of a smartphone It isnt the price tag thats stuck on the box. But when it comes to the access to information, how valuable can a smartphone be The thousands of possibilities made available to smartphone users are baffling. The task of unlocking such possibilities may seem impossible, but for many most young people using a smartphone and handling the internet are effortless tasks. 
In a country like Sri Lanka, where many parents value tradition and dont encourage open conversations regarding stigmatized topics, a smartphone is a treasure trove of information for any child. And due to this continuous, unfiltered access to information on social media and the internet, children are exposed to a wide array of information which gives rise to issues such as cyber exploitation. The Daily Mirror spoke to Grassrooted Trust and the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) and learned that technology and the internet coupled with the belittling attitude we have towards certain members of society opens up a whole new can of worms. 
What is cyber exploitation and violence
As defined by bakamoono.lk, Cyber exploitation and violence (CEV) is when someone is bullied, blackmailed, threatened, discriminated, and/or coerced online. This includes the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos online as well as any other material via memes, and edited images.  According to an article published by Open Democracy titled Investigating Sri Lankas nude culture by Hans Billimoria, we learn that Grassrooted Trusts engagement with cyber exploitation has changed since they had been approached by a group of 70 girls who were being blackmailed because of naked pictures and videos they had shared with their boyfriends. Billimoria writes that the issue is well known by schoolgoing children and the practice of sharing nude pictures with your partner were deemed as natural and normal. Girls were furthermore under the impression that their boyfriends would never betray them and being shamed for sharing their nudes was unthinkable.  He further wrote that the exploitation had become more methodical and violent. The group of 70, for example, were being blackmailed via a false account on Instagram Direct with the simple calculated threat  I have your naked picture. Send me the naked picture of another girl. Or see what I do with yours 
The blackmailing party had further built a database of naked pictures and videos of young Sri Lankan women and girls categorized under names, schools, description of the picture and/or video i.e. top, bottom, front, back. Except, those werent the names of the categories. They were far more sexually explicit, purposely used to capture the imagination of the young men, and perhaps women, that peruse the database.Sample lists of this database are sent out to young men in relationships with requests for naked pictures of their girlfriends, with the promise of FREE access to the entire database as a valued contributor. And of course, young men who had just ended a relationship, or had one ended, were also approached; the angry, hurt, resentful and indifferent who maybe more primed to share their girlfriends nudes and videos. 
Billimoria further wrote that one perpetrator had hacked into Facebook Messenger and had tried to convince other girls to take part in a fabricated UN Women Campaign by completing 15 tasks that began with a picture of the colour of your shirt and subsequently went on to ask the girl to undress and pose for the camera in an explicit manner.
It is still difficult to identify under which laws cyber crime or cyber exploitation is going to be governed and no law reforms have happened with regard to this. -
Hans Billimoria,
Grassrooted Trust.
Speaking to Grassrooted Trust the Daily Mirror further learned that there hasnt been much of a change since 2015 and that the conversation about this issue needs to be moved forward.The CID admitted to us to the fact that a market has been created for these images and for these videos and young people have access to this market.
And when you have created this market its about supply and demand and you need to feed this market. It has been two years after the story broke free. We have gone to the NCPA, ICTA and the Ministry of Telecom and Digital Infrastructure. We have had discussions with the Ministry of Education and were facilitated by the NCPA. But its still difficult to identify under which laws cyber crime or cyber exploitation is going to be governed as no law reforms have happened with this regard, said Hans Billimoria of Grassrooted Trust. Sri Lanka does have an existing legislative framework, within which perpetrators of cyber exploitation and violence can be prosecuted.  Billimoria further stated that they have two major concerns; the lack of a response mechanism and absence of preventive education. 
The lack of a response mechanism
Speaking of the lack of a response mechanism he said,Take a case that I was dealing with. A girl sent pictures to her boyfriend at the age of fifteen. She is now 20, at an international university and the boyfriend is also at another international university in another country. Now some third party has gotten hold of her pictures and is blackmailing her saying that unless you come and tease me, in front of the camera, naked, I am going to publish these pictures. This is a standard story. One issue that we are dealing with is that the relationship that she has with her father has hitherto been an obstacle to her coming out and saying, listen I have made this mistake, please help me. And that is why we keep reinforcing open lines of communication between parents and children, because we dont want a young person or any person to be further victimized because of that relationship. So that is one area that we want to focus on in terms of response; that is the ability to approach the family. 
Secondly, what we need to look at is where do these young people go Where does anyone go if this happens Your instinct is to go to the police station. For example, in another case we dealt with, we shall name the individual girl X, she told us what the situation was. We decided to go to the police station that was closest to her to file a complaint. We were told by the person in charge of the womens desk at the police station that it would be better for us to file a complaint at the Computer Crimes Division which works along with CERT Sri Lanka at the BMICH. When we went to the BMICH we couldnt find this Computer Crimes Branch. Then we went to CERT who told us that there was no computer crimes branch at the BMICH. And I said to them isnt it interesting that your your police station thinks that there is a computer crimes branch at the BMICH and thereby is directing victims of cyber crime to the computer crimes branch of the CID. What they said was that the victims would then come to them and they would direct them to where they should go. When I outlined the case to CERT they directed us to the CID, he continued. 
He further stated that the current response mechanism in place is too long winded. We arent blaming CERT, or the CID, or the police. Far from it. I think that they are definite allies in this process, but there is definite concern to be able to negotiate this response mechanism. The CID is very responsible and very sensitive. But accessing the CID is the challenge not the CID itself. This process needs to be made simpler.
Especially with a crime where the potential for the proliferation of content is getting shared rapidly, the process is not the immediate removal of the content, but writing a letter to the director of the CID. Because how many people are going to go through the long daunting tunnel to access the CID 
Preventive Education
Speaking of the existing need for preventive education, Billimoria highlighted the issue of violation of trust and consent. Consent is given to be filmed in that space for each other. But they didnt give consent to become porn stars. Its that violation of consent that I keep going back to. Even in prevention education, at Grassrooted we focus on three areas. One area respected; self respect and respect for others. The second area that we focus on is being sensible; thinking through actions, think before you share, thinking about the power that we hold by a boy or a girl, depending on who shares that naked picture. The last one is about consent; understanding what consent means and understanding that its not the sharing of the picture that is the violation, but rather the violation of trust.
For us its the violation of the trust and the consent that is the issue. It goes back to the point how we treat another person and what has been put in our head about how we treat other people. That is why this is an extension of other forms of violence. One extension of attitudes and extension of patriarchy that feed gender based violence, because again, it is about something as simple as what we call the baduwa kella culture, where we constantly reduce women to sexual objects. If you take a look at the images we see, its always that very sexually exploited nature of those objects that we see; parts of the woman. Or at the very least we see the full frontal of the woman; where the woman is looked at as a commodity. So this conversation has progressed to how women are commodities in this porn industry, especially in this home based porn. We really need to take a close look at that, he added.
Consent is given to be filmed in that space for each other. But they didnt give consent to become porn stars. Its that violation of consent that I keep going back to. Even in prevention education, at Grassrooted we focus on three areas. One area respected; self respect and respect for others.

Is it fault of technology
Its not. It is the manifestation of our attitude towards women and girls, said Sharanya Sekaram, Grassrooted Trust. 
I think what is important to look at is that often cyber exploitation is recognized as something separate, something that has manifested because of technology. Its not. It is the manifestation of our attitude towards women and girls. We say women and girls because that is primarily who we deal with. It is the manifestation of the violence that women and girls have faced on the streets, in the bedrooms, in relationships. Its a form of gender based violence. And perhaps the only real difference is that its much easier to perpetrate. You can hide behind the screen and nobody needs to know who you are. But I think it is very important to keep reiterating that its not new, its not because of technology, its not this generation. If you take away Facebook, Snapchat and all those things, it wont change a thing. Its really that we treat women and girls badly. We have allowed this violence to appear in so many forms. Theres no difference, at least for me, between a man who hits his wife and a man or boy who circulates pictures of his ex girlfriend afterwards. Its sexual violence, said Sekaram.
We need to take a look again at the relationship between children and parents. We also need to take a look at this notion of shame around discussing sex. Or this notion of shame around taking a naked picture and the damage that its causing or the potential damage that it can do. Where there is a device that can record whether its a phone with a camera, where there is a relationship between a boy and a girl, regardless of where you are in the country, there is an exchange of naked pictures, that is a reality, added Billimoria. 
Children at schools Ive been to know exactly whats happening. When I spoke to an 11-year-old boy, who was a part of a larger work group, he knew exactly how to articulate what nudes are. So the information is out there, but the information isnt with those who are less savvy about what is possible on the smartphone. What is the role of the Ministry of Education What is the role of the National Institute of Education Why hasnt anything happened during the last two years, although the NCPA has been talking about this and a special task force has been set up which we are a part of In terms of prevention and responsibility, these are key questions that need to be asked. We would like to promote this discussion and see who would be responsible here, he concluded.
 This is a form of severe child abuse -NCPA Chairperson Marini de Livera
Commenting on the issue, NCPA Chairperson Marini de Livera stated that, This is a form of severe child abuse and NCPA is doing everything in her power to prevent and protect children from this scourge. 
She further said, Children should be offered guidance by parents and teachers and other responsible individuals that although the internet has many plus points- such as being a store house of knowledge and an effective medium of communication-it has to be used with a sense of responsibility, concern for others and a strong sense of duty.You should be careful not to harm yourself. And also you must not harm others through the use of this medium. It should be used for the benefit of society, not to destroy individuals and cause grief to them. 
Everyone should assume responsibility of ensuring protection of children from cyber violence-parents, teachers, religious leaders, all professionals, youth leaders, Parliamentarians, Policy Makers and the general Public she added.

The Western Contribution to Buddhism
	
William Peiris has devoted his life to literary pursuits in Ceylon, fulfilling the positions of journalist, editor, writer, and radio broadcaster. More than this, he has done much to awaken an interest in Buddhism from the angle of Western contributors in this vast field. 
Last year his paperback on Sir Edwin Arnold - torch-bearer of Buddhism to the West by means of his epic poem, The Light of Asia - was published by the world-famous Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, Ceylon. 
Due to the formidable nature of the research that would be entailed, no one has yet compiled as comprehensive a work as the present one. Its true that some biographical sketches appeared at the end of 2500 years of Buddhism, published by the Government of India to commemorate the Buddha Jayanti Year, 1956, but those were largely confined to Pali and Sanskrit scholars, including analyses of texts edited or translated by them. The multitude of names normally associated with the growth, spread and knowledge of Buddhism in the Occident was thus omitted. 
The present work, therefore, remedies a serious deficiency in our knowledge of Buddhist endeavours in Europe and North America. The author clearly deserves our admiration and respect for the great efforts that have been undertaken to complete this thesis. No doubt, individual biographies were to be had for the mere asking, but, nevertheless, most writers would have found the task of compilation from numberless sources too daunting even to consider. There is no doubt in my mind that the authors dedication to the Buddhadhamma induced him to persevere to the end. 
Virtually all the Western European countries, together with the U.S.A., have made a distinct contribution towards a furtherance of Buddhist studies, and Mr. Peiris has endeavoured to include in this work almost all those concerned over a period of one and a half centuries. 
A fascinating chronicle, this work should become a text-book for all wishing to pursue a study of Buddhist history.

Buddhism has gained a foothold in the West because of the fruits of the labours of western Buddhist scholars who had displayed remarkable zeal and industry in the study as well as dissemination of it. Its equally owing to their ardour that Buddhism has become a subject of study and speculation in all the worlds premiere academic institutions and universities. Its well and fitting that these pioneering scholars be appreciated and their biographies recorded for posterity. This is what has precisely been done by William Peiris. We can now better appreciate certain Buddhist scholars and their splendid labours as herein light has been shed on hitherto unknown and veiled facets of their fruitful and ponderous lives. 
I consider it a precious privilege for the Buddhist Cultural Centre to bring out this new edition of the monumental work of William Peiris The Western Contribution to Buddhism on the pioneering efforts of the western savants of Buddhism. We are immensely indebted to Ms. Manjari Peiris, the beloved daughter of William Peiris, for providing us with a copy of The Western Contribution to Buddhism and giving her permission to bring out this new edition of her fathers unique biographical treatise. I also wish to acknowledge the hard work of those who contributed to its successful publication in numerous ways. 
May the blessings of the Triple Gem be with you all!

Why could not others resign: Ravi to his supporters
	
Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake who resigned from his ministerial portfolio today questioned why others, against whom allegations had been made, could not resign if he could do so simply because there were allegations against him.
Arriving to his residence at Rajamalwatta after the special statement made in Parliament on his resignation, he said he had resigned with pride from his ministerial portfolio to set a good precedent.
I have made this sacrifice in order to show the innocent people that they could witness a new dawn in future. I am truly grateful for the people who still stand by me even during a difficult phase, he said.
He said they would continue with this government in a positive manner with the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
However, he said the media institutes had given publicity to him for the past twelve days even more thatn what was given to the President.
I can tolerate all these things. But is it justifiable to do this for my wife and three children he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Karunanayakes residence was seen crowded with his supporters soon after he made his statement on the resignation.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Workshop on newspaper in education

43 completed files gathering dust for 2 yrs: Rajitha
	
Some 43 files on which investigations had been completed by the FCID, the Bribery Commission and the CID on various crimes have been forwarded to the AGs Department some two years ago and they are gathering dust.,Cabinet spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
Dr. Senaratne expressed his disappointment and disapproval on what he called a go slow policy by the Attorney Generals Department on cases against politicians and top officials of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime and a quick and no hold barred attitude to file involving charges against Yahapalana politicians.
Minister Senaratne told the weekly cabinet news briefing held in Parliament today that the entire country and the government expected the AGs department to show the same efficiency, haste and speed to file charges against ministers and officials who robbed the country and committed various crimes including murders and embezzlement of billions of rupees of public money and added sadly this was not happening.
I think a probe on the performance of the AGs Department is also a necessity. I am aware that the some 83 files on which investigations have been completed on various crimes by the FCID, the Bribery Commission and the CID have been forwarded to the AGd Department some two years ago and gathering dust. No charges have been filed against any of these crimes. Dont forget that this is the department that took months if not years to identify the signature of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Minister Senaratne said sarcastically.
He said the AGs Department took only a few days to inquire the alleged abduction case against Colombo District UNP Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra and a complaint against his son Gampaha District Parliamentarian Chatura Senaratne and added the AGs Department probed these two complaints in an unusual swiftness.
Minister Senaratne accused that a lady state counsel even allegedly instructed to expedite the inquiry against Mr. Senaratne.
Minister Senaratne also expressed reservations on the ongoing probes by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the bond scam and said it was appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena for a specific investigation but now it has ventured into probing non relevant or unnecessary matters such as leasing out of apartments to Ministers that has made the main issue complex and confused.
Have you ever heard cabinet Ministers are brought before commissions of inquiry and questioned by state counsel before in the same way how Minister Karunanayaka was cross examined by the Additional Solicitor General very aggressively before the PCoI Under the Rajapaksa regime a state counsel was not permitted even to open a file against a government minister of official. This is the difference the Yahapalana government has introduced, he added.
Minister Senaratne said the PCoI has made a request to extend its term of inquiry by another 3 months and questioned as to whether it was to probe the bond issue or any other matters and added the task of the PCoI was not to provide sensational news to the media.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

GL questions Presidents delay in removing Ravi
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris yesterday said it was questionable that President Maithripala Sirisena had not removed Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake yet as Foreign Minister despite having the authority to do so.
Peiris told a news conference that President Sirisena should immediately remove Minister Karunanayake from his post.
It is evident that the Government is taking a long time to arrive to a decision on the No-Confidence Motion against Minister Karunanayake. There is no reason to take time. A decision should be immediate in this regard, he said.
Meanwhile, he charged that not only Minister Karunanayake but also several other bigwigs were connected with the alleged Central Banks bond sale controversy.
Initially, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken over the authority of the Central Bank under him even though it is illegal, he added.
Commenting on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, Peiris said that the Government should go for a referendum even though it would get approved in Parliament with a two-thirds majority.
He said that he would file a petition in the Supreme Court to conduct a referendum in this regard. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. will assure no moves to harm country's sovereignty: President
	
The policy of the Yahapalana Government is to bring foreign investment in a way which will not harm the countrys sovereignty and dignity, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President also added that when entering into agreements with a foreign country or a company regarding investments, a special clause will be included stating that in any way land ownership is not assigned to anyone and only the necessities of a particular investment will be fulfilled.
President Sirisena made these remarks addressing an intellectual dialogue held at the BMICH to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
When we develop as a country, the assistance of the economically powerful nations in the world is needed and the present government has been able to get the assistance of all these countries through a friendly and cordial foreign policy, President Sirisena said.
This government has been able to avoid many negative impacts on Sri Lanka internationally during the past two and a half years and anyone can see today the benefits of the steps taken by the government to increase foreign exchange reserves and to reduce the foreign debt burden, he stressed.
We can celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka in a happy and positive environment as a result of laying a solid foundation in the relations between the two countries during the past two and a half years and the present government is committed to further strengthen those relations, President Sirisena added.
During this event, President Sirisena presented awards to the winners of the competitions held to mark the 60th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
The President of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association Amaradasa Gunawardena presented the commemorative book issued to mark the 60th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka, to the President.

The decision to resign from his position of Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka was made with pride and not with sadness or under pressure, Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament a short while ago.
Making a special statement, Karnanayake explained that he had no need to purchase properties illegally and said the various allegations leveled against him were baseless.
Everyone knows of my wealth. People from my party and others have visited me in my house. They knew that I do not use my wealth for politics, he said.
Drawing parallels to the former government, the parliamentarian said the Attorney General was allowed to investigate ministers now, unlike before. We want the authorities to continue their investigations, he said. 
I have sacrificed my position for democracy and good governance. I am proud of the decision that I have made, Karunanayake concluded.

I will return ownership of H'tota Port to the people: Wijeyadasa
	
Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the sale of Hambantota Harbour - a public asset-to the Chinese was a wrong and assured the public that he would not rest until he regains its ownership on behalf of the people.
In an interview with our sister paper the Sunday Lankadeepa the minister recalled that as a politician he had always done what was right by the country and fought against corruption. As a result he said he had been able to secure government resources worth more than Rs.1,000 billion which included the Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Insurance Company and Litro Gas Company and vest them with the people.
The deal with China in relation to the Hambantota Harbour is decisive within the sphere of global politics as it has prompted India to demand possession of the oil tanks in Trincomalee, the minister said.
He warned that as 89 per cent of the ships arriving at the Colombo Harbour were there for re-export these ships would not want to sail an extra 400 nautical miles to Colombo when with the further expansion taking place at the Hambantota Harbour they could dock there and unload their goods. This would then end up turning the Colombo Harbour into a swimming pool while the Chinese company with a major stake in the Hambantota Port would flourish.
The minister stressed that whether he was still in the government or was forced out he would continue his fight against corruption and the tyrannical attempt by the Chinese to take over the world of trade. (Prasanna Sanjeewa Thennakone)

## Section: News Features

Moving into a milieu: Delovak Athara  and Ran Salu
	
The third in a series of sketches of the movies of Lester James Peries
After Rekava and Sandeshaya, Lester James Peries knew that no one was going to take a chance with him again. With Gamperaliya he found someone who would: Anton Wickramasinghe. Wickramasinghe, then separated from his wife, was living in the Orient Club, the haven of the Colombo 7 elite. In the history of our cinema, he was probably the only producer who had a connoisseurs taste for the cinema. The fact that he didnt want to continue with Gamperaliyas two sequels, even after it won lavishly abroad, attests to that. Lesters fourth film needed to be different, therefore. 
Delovak Athara remains my favourite movie by Lester, if at all because it moved into a milieu I can identify with at once. The great achievement of Gamperaliya was that, despite the social backgrounds of the cast and crew, it evoked rural life rather startlingly. That famous opening sequence wasnt there in Martin Wickremasinghes novel, for instance; it was plotted by Regi Siriwardena, and it delayed the shooting of the film for a whole year until the Mahakappina Walawwa was discovered. The greatest art is sometimes born out of accident. The Sinhala cinema prospered because of those accidents, especially in Lesters career. 
Its perhaps a testament to the mans individuality, but he never displayed any overt enthusiasm for the New Wave in continental Europe. His signature was Renoirean; graceful, poetic, never slipshod, always calculated. Delovak Athara became the only movie of his which swerved from that trend. For a moment at least, it embraced the grey, but freewheeling charm of Godard and Truffaut. What is your ambition Patricia asks a celebrity in Godards Breathless. To become immortal, and then die, replies that celebrity. And yet, theres nothing random about these conversations; underlying and puncturing them was the freewheeling zeitgeist of its time, which symbolised an entire generation. Delovak Athara was a little like that. No less a critic than Philip Cooray called it his most continental work, comparing his cameraman, Willie Blake, to the great Raoul Coutard, Godards cameraman. 
With Delovak Athara the man rebelled against the conventional wisdom of the sixties
With Delovak Athara the man rebelled against the conventional wisdom of the sixties; that the director was an auteur. No, he said to Malinda Seneviratne 15 years ago, The film director is like a conductor. He has to interpret a script with a whole group of people. Lesters first interest had been literature  the awards he won at St Peters were all for essay competitions  and he once recalled, for me, the days when hed cycle to the Public Library. He was respectful of the scriptwriter in the moviemaking process, which is why the quality of his work can be traced to his writers. 
Delovak Athara doesnt succeed at being the terse thriller it tries to be. There are sequences which, while incidental to the plot, take time to unravel even after we stop anticipating their final punch. The sequence of Shirani (Jeewarani Kurukulasuriya) swooning after her fiance and our protagonist Nissanka (Tony Ranasinghe) tells her his terrible secret is like that. We await it, are thrilled by anticipating her reaction to his ill-timed confession, but by the time she does swoon after two items in a concert-pageant, weve lost our interest. Even that wordless sequence of Nissanka contemplating his dilemma at night is melodramatic, and his paranoid imaginings (he sees the man he killed outside his window) add little to what we already know. 
Its a rather flawed film, but it was probably the best of its kind made here. But while it managed to replicate the zeitgeist of Godards films, it had none of the Gallic spontaneity of the New Wave. The mood was intellectualised, unemotional, and cold. Of the penultimate sequence Cooray had this to say: Nissanka is standing by a tree, lost in his thoughts, the camera moves slowly around him, frames him between two tree trunks, and catches the slow trickle of a tear down his cheek. But the scene does not move us. The objectivity is all. Lester had abandoned Renoir, yes, but he hadnt abandoned the documentarian in him. Thats where the objectivity came from. 
And its exactly that sharp, focused, unemotional objectivity which is missing in Ran Salu, the next film he directed. Anton Wickramasinghe, in a move characteristic of Lesters career, stopped making films with him after Delovak Athara. Considered at this point as a prestige failure (the movie didnt make a profit, and took time to break even), he was offered a most unlikely deal; a script by a man he once described as probably the only original scriptwriter in the Sinhala cinema, P. K. D. Seneviratne. Like Delovak Athara, it would be shot in the same milieu, with roughly the same cast (Tony Ranasinghe, Irangani Serasinghe, and J. B. L. Gunasekera) but with a different crew (particularly the cameraman, Sumitta Amarasinghe, who was closer to Seneviratnes glamourised view of village life than Willie Blake could be).

Youll notice that many writers and audiences describe Ran Salu as a Buddhist film today. But there are no Buddhist films, just as there are no Marxist films or capitalist films: these are convenient labels used to demarcate the ideology of the work of art, as opposed to what that work of art actually represents and contains. P. K. D. Seneviratne was less a scriptwriter of Buddhist movies than he was a moralist parading as a middle-of-the-road cineaste. Deeply influenced by the Colombo poets, he saw in the village the salvation of his country and his race. 
Towards the end of the 1950s, when our directors began to feverishly adapt the novels of W. A. Silva, the trend was to capture the countrys lost innocence with certain stock figures borrowed from the early English theatre: the innocent virgin, the abusive, drunk, lascivious headman, and the devoted paramour. In Seneviratnes hands, that virgin became Punya Heendeniya, that headman became D. R. Nanayakkara, and that paramour became Dayananda Gunawardena. The film was Kurulubedda, which got so conflated with Rekava later on that even the compilers of the Insight Guide on Sri Lanka wrote that they were directed by the same person, Lester James Peries. 
Youll notice that many writers and audiences describe Ran Salu as a Buddhist film today
Ran Salu was the inevitable continuation of Kurulubedda and Sikuru Tharuwa, and had the same cast, including Punya, Nanayakkara, and Dayananda. By shifting to the same milieu that had characterised Delovak Athara (Kurulubedda had been stimulated by the visual loveliness of Rekava, and as with that film, Seneviratne was inspired by Lester here too), he continued with the change of setting, a point reinforced by having Irangani Serasinghe and J. B. L. Gunasekera as the mother and the father. 
Its a different kind of Buddhist ethos which sweeps across in the movie, consumerist, cosmetic, and lavish. Seneviratne depicted the contradiction at the heart of that milieu rather well. While Delovak Athara (like Rekava) didnt contain a hint of the temple or Buddhism, here the clash between the social aspirations of Sujathas family and their commitment to their faith accentuates the plot. So much so, in fact, that anyone repudiating that faith in favour of those aspirations had to be a villain. 
That villain was Tony Ranasinghe. In one sequence he flares up, frustrated at his fiances reserved attitude to their affair: I wont come to this house if that dasa sil gani does. To which he gets a typical Seneviratne-ist response from Sujatha (Punya): Dont ever speak of that nun like that again to me, Cyril. I dont like it. 
In the American Western the saviour is always a man of the people, but hes more refined than the people hes with. In Seneviratnes movies, the heroes are rooted in their surroundings, but they are more sophisticated than their people, who are depicted as simpletons not unlike the forever grinning villagers (who exist to entertain) in John Fords films. Kurulubedda had a whole bunch of these simpletons, socially less well off than the two heroes. Even in Ran Salu, that discrepancy comes off: both Sujatha and Senaka are affluent, though from different milieus, while the servants are chatty, gossipy innocents. (This even pervades the score: for the servants, especially Nanayakkara, Amaradeva reserved the only upbeat musical motif in the movie.) 
At a little more than two hours, Ran Salu was as long or short (depending on how you prefer to see it) as Delovak Athara. But while Delovak Athara was an intellectualised picture  it revolved around a single incident, after all  Ran Salu was, as Cooray called it, a plotted film. Emotionally it overwhelms, which is why it lacks the objectivity of its predecessor, but then it wasnt really Lester. 
In Ran Salu Lester hence achieved his conception of the director as a conductor. I did nothing but transform the script, he once told me when I talked with him. True. Together with its fidelity to realism that was lacking in Seneviratnes previous work, Ran Salu was, at the end of the day, a scriptwriters dream come true. Lester wouldnt return to the theme of faith as a leveller for 40 years. And after those 40 years were done, he returned to it for one final time, as Ammawarune would be his last film.

## Title: National Forum for Life Insurance Advisors to enhance public awareness on insurance

National Forum for Life Insurance Advisors to enhance public awareness on insurance
	
The National Forum for Life Insurance Advisors (NAFLIA) will take place for the 8th consecutive year with 2017s theme being, Towards the Day All Sri Lankans are Insured- Are we ready The forum is anticipated to bring together top-level Life Insurance advisors from across the country and provide them with a platform for knowledge sharing and networking.
Subjects such as new developments in the insurance industry and technological entities will become hot topics for discussion among other things.
The overall structure of the event this year has been scheduled to include an extremely informative keynote address and the participation of movers and shakers from outside the Insurance Industry in panel discussions will bring in thoughts and views of key personnel who are not from the Insurance industry explained Deepthi Lokuarachchi, the President of the IASL. 
Deepthi Lokuarachchi andHashra Weerawardena

Lokuarachchi further explained, The Insurance Association of Sri Lanka(IASL) is a collective body representing all companies both in the Life and General Insurance fields. The IASL has various subcommittees that are tasked with the management of key areas such as, Actuarial, Finance and Technical sectors, which affect the industry. As such, the Marketing and Sales Forum (MSF) is a subcommittee of the IASL represented by key personnel involved in marketing and distribution of each company. Therefore, NAFLIA is the annual coming together of Life Insurance advisors and distribution management, facilitated by the Marketing and Sales Forum under the guidance of the IASL.
NAFLIA is being organized by a dedicated team of like-minded individuals from the MSF and has been the focal driving force for events pertaining to both the General and Life Insurance sectors of the Sri Lankan Insurance Industry over the years. Their most recent undertaking was the General Insurance Sales Congress (GISCO), which was held for the 2nd consecutive year with the participation of members from the General Insurance fraternity, stated the Chairman of the Marketing and Sales Forum, Hashra Weerawardena as he discussed the role of the MSF.
On the primary purpose of NAFLIA, Lokuarachchi said, The primary driving force in organizing NAFLIA is to provide a forum for Life Insurance advisors to share experiences and gain knowledge. As such these events have in their agendas, presentations and panel discussions by eminent personalities in the management of Insurance firms, industry experts and top advisors from major industries in the country so that the audience will be able to receive input from a wider spectrum.
Salesmen who would convince a customer to purchase an intangible product, and a benefit, which may not accrue to him or her during their lifetime, in particular and in the greater part of the world in general, predominantly drive the Sri Lankan Life Insurance Industry.The benefits of this unique product will be enjoyed by their loved ones, which will enable the continuity and prosperity of a family unit in society. Life Insurance will therefore bring in that certainty to the uncertainty that we all live in; the forum for Life Insurance advisors (NAFLIA) provides an opportunity for the Life Insurance advisors to sharpen their skills and share ideas about successes within the fraternity, added Weerawardena.  Primarily the pre-and post events publicity pertaining to the event and points discussed provide the general public information regarding the importance of Insurance and it also provides a stimulus for advisors to enhance their performance to be able to qualify for a part of this event. Together, these two facts help the industry boost its image both from the point of greaterpublicity in the media as well as greater activation at ground level, saidthe President of the IASL as he described the manner in which events such as NAFLIA improve the position of Life Insurance in Sri Lanka.
Weerawardena contributed by saying, Until a sudden, unforeseen and unfortunate situation takes place, the general population would not think of the significance of having Insurance. This is the real situation even though in todays nuclear family setup it can be a necessity. Events such as NAFLIA enable the Insurance advisor to be more professional in the pre-sale approach as well as in post sale service that serves to be an integral part of a good life Insurance advisors key role in society. These events propel the advisor to be a financial consultant, risk assessor, and more importantly a friend when in need. The IASL through the MSF has been able to lobby the government with the help of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka and have on the 1st of September 2017 declared as National Insurance Day along with the launch of a commemorative stamp that will be unveiled to mark the date. Further, the month of September will be commemorated as Insurance Awareness Month, where the hype will be created in the media as well as on ground level through various activations and promotions, Lokuarachchi announced.
The Chairman of the MSF further emphasized aboutInsurance awareness and its penetration within Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, this is still known to be at a low level when compared with some countries in the region. Our theme this year is very apt in this regard and speaks of our vision for Sri Lanka in the not too distant future when we wait for the day when Sri Lankans will embrace the concept of Insurance. Many events are being planned for the 1st of September and throughout the month of September in order to make the public aware of the need for Insurance and to take the message of Insurance to all corners of Sri Lanka, he added.

NDBIB-CRISIL expand fixed-income index portfolio for Sri Lanka
	
NDB Capital Holdings PLC and CRISIL Ltd have announced the launch of 9 new fixed-income indices in Sri Lanka.
The new series of indices complements the existing series of 4 indices introduced in 2013.
Developed and maintained by CRISIL, the new series of indices, include three indices on the repo market, two composite indices for treasury and repo, and four dollar versions of existing T-Bill and T-Bond indices.
CRISIL, a global analytics company driven by its mission of making markets function better, is Indias foremost provider of ratings, data, research, analytics and solutions.
In 2013, together with NDB Capital Holdings Limited, CRISIL introduced the only fixed income indices to Sri Lankas fixed income market, the NDBIB-CRISIL 91 day T-Bill Index, NDBIB-CRISIL 364 day T-Bill Index, NDBIB-CRISIL 3 year T-Bond Index and the NDBIB-CRISIL 5 year T-Bond Index.
The new indices will enhance the range of the existing series of indices.The three new repo indices, NDBIB-CRISIL Overnight Repo Index, NDBIB-CRISIL 1 Week Repo Index and the NDBIB-CRISIL 1 Month Repo Indexwill provide some exposure to the repo segment and would address the short term fixed income market performance. The two composite indices NDBIB-CRISIL Composite Government Debt Index and the NDBIB-CRISIL Composite Repo Index seeks to capture the performance of a portfolio invested in the Government T-Bill, T-Bonds and repos. The composite indices will help in performance evaluation of gilt-edged funds, which invest in Treasury bills and bonds across maturity. The dollar-denominated versions of the original four Treasury indices would provide dollar-adjusted returns for global investors.
Co-branded using the credentials of NDB Investment Bank Ltd, Sri Lankas leading investment bank and a fullyowned subsidiary of NDB Capital Holdings PLC, and CRISIL, the indices are expected to provide further reference for debt capital market participants and propagate government securities as an attractive investment opportunity inSri Lanka.
The government securities market has emerged as the largest and the most liquid market for fixed income securities in Sri Lanka, with total outstanding treasuries amounting to approximately Rs. 4 trillion. Most market participants, including banks, insurance companies, funds and retailers participate in the government securities market. With the government allowing foreign participation in rupee denominated treasury securities, there has been a significantly high demand from foreign investors for treasury securities, making the case for measurement of performance of government securities.
Nagarajan Narasimhan, Senior Director, CRISIL Research said, Our new set provides investors with credible and independent risk-return measures at the shorter end of the government securities market, alongside composites for broader market representation. That should further the cause of developing the debtmarket in Sri Lanka.
The new indices, will facilitate the launch of index-tracking funds, which could benefit the government securities market in the country. In addition, the indices will enable the construction of derivatives linked to them.
Vajira Kulatilaka, Director of NDBIB and CEO of NDB Capital Holdings Limited stated, The new NDBIB CRISIL indices launched would cover a broader spectrum of fixed income securities available to investors and also track dollarised returns in treasury securities. We believe that this would be pivotal for structuring and pricing securities in the market and also be of interest to foreign investors, particularly at a juncture where there is growing interest from foreigners in relation to Sri Lankan financial markets.

A little silence of us cannot be regarded as that we have taken a step back from this battle. This battle will continue further. The strength of this battle will not always depend on strikes and protests, he said.
He also said that the GMOA has engaged in this battle in order to safeguard the standards of the medical education in the country and added that they do not proceed with any political motive.
Meanwhile, commenting on the legal actions taken against the university student activists, Dr. Soyza said that the law of the country should not be biased towards any party.
He said that everyone should be equal before the eyes of the law and added that the Attorney General's Department had sabotaged several proceedings with regard to the cases against university students.
We will not go against the law of the country by any means. But we will intervene to the suppression of these university students through our legal professionals, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
