His non-attendance raises eyebrows


	



 

COPE, an important creation of the Diyawanna council tasked with monitoring the working of state-owned enterprises has been much in the news in the recent past. 

 


COPE came into public focus particularly in the wake of the uproar triggered by the controversial Central Bank bond issue.


Incidentally, the Central Bank bond issue continues to come under the scrutiny of COPE and the fact that a vocal representative from the Red party was conspicuous by his absence at six consecutive sittings of the COPE has raised eye brows in political circles.  Meanwhile, some JO stalwarts have announced that they are going to make a sensational revelation regarding the Red member’s failure to attend the COPE proceedings, they say.
