The Indian government is examining BCCI's request for a green signal for the Indian cricket team to play Pakistan in Sri Lanka in December, amid indications that Islamabad's continuing support to terror groups will be a major factor in shaping the decision.
"We have to take into account what impact our decision can have on the morale of the country when there is no let-up in support for terrorists from across the border," a top-ranking government functionary told TOI just after BCCI confirmed that it had approached the Centre for its clearance.
BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said on Wednesday that the board had made a formal request to the ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Tuesday, seeking clearance to play Pakistan. He emphasised that given its adherence to ICC's Futures Tour Programme, BCCI was committed to playing Pakistan "in UAE or at any other neutral venue if the conditions in Pakistan were not suitable".
