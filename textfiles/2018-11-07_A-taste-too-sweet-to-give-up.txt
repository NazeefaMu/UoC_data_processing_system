A taste too sweet to give up  !


	

The country witnessed a series of somersaults by our Diyawanna politicos with the sudden regime change. However, there are more somersaults in the offing, say observers.


Most of these turncoats keen on exploiting the prevailing situation to make a fortune are set to offer themselves to the highest bidder. 


A leader of minor political party enjoying the support of a city-based community while looking after the interests of the people in the upcountry estate sector had recently received an invitation to throw in his lot with the new regime.


He had readily accepted the invitation and at the negotiations that followed had asked for a host of perks and concessions and had received a positive reply. However, negotiations had hit a snag when he had asked for the trade portfolio at the top table. Asked to consider taking up another subject, the man had stuck to his guns and the talks ended with each party assuring the other, “no hard feelings!”


However, the politico unable to resign himself to the idea of being reduced to a nonentity after enjoying power and perks of a top team member is said to be looking for a chance to meet the new Number Two again or another round of talks, they say.
