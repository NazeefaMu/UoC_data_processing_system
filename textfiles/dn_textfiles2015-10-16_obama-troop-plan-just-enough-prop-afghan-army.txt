Obama troop plan just enough to prop up Afghan army

US: The decision to keep thousands of US troops in Afghanistan drives home the hard truth that despite billions of dollars and years of training, Afghan security forces are far from ready to go it alone.
But experts are divided on whether the troop levels outlined on Thursday by President Barack Obama are sufficient to prop up the weakling Afghan army.
Obama said 9,800 US troops would stay in Afghanistan until the end of next year, scrubbing plans to pull all but 1,000 from the country after 14 years of US involvement.
James Dobbins, a former US special envoy to Afghanistan and a veteran diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the Rand Corporation, said the plan was sufficient to maintain the status quo.
"Retaining the force at the current level will prevent the kind of collapse of order and disintegration of the country into a Syrian-type civil war," he said.
"It's adequate to do that. We have to anticipate the conflict's going to continue at more or less the current level for a while."
The US-led coalition officially ended its combat mission last year and the remaining troops are there to train and advise Afghan counterparts to police their own nation and to carry out counterterrorism operations.
Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said 9,800 troops was a low number given the task involved.
By early 2017 when Obama steps down, their numbers are expected to drop to about 5,500.
"Can you cut well below 10,000? The answer is no you can't, not without crippling any real effort to do much more than hope to hold on to most of the major cities and urban population centres, and then gradually lose the countryside," Cordesman said.
"If you go down to 5,500 you are going to be way under a minimum level, and you have no real slack for forward combat advisers," he added.
The United States has spent more than $60 billion to train Afghan government troops and build their capacity since 2001. But their first year leading security efforts has been brutally hard.
Thousands have died, the Taliban has dealt them a string of blows and desertion rates are high. Plus the Islamic State group has emerged as a new threat in Afghanistan.
The Taliban launched a successful offensive in Helmand province this summer and went on to briefly capture the city of Kunduz. In both instances, Afghan security forces needed support from US-led trainers and aircraft to tilt the balance back in their favour.
"They cannot handle the fight alone in this stage of their development," General John Campbell, who heads the US-led NATO mission in Afghanistan, told US lawmakers last week.
