The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently said that it would continue to support Sri Lanka to achieve development goals including the areas of nuclear medicine, non-destructive testing in industry and assistance in introducing nuclear energy.

IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano expressed these views during his visit to Sri Lanka on March 14.

While joining the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya at the inauguration of the new offices of the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board, Mr Amano was informed of the progress the country has achieved in applying nuclear techniques for development.

He reiterated the IAEA’s continued assistance in capacity building in this advanced technology; “The inclusion of nuclear power as a possible option for electricity generation by 2030 is a key element in Sri Lanka’s Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2015-2034,” he added.

He met State Minister of Foreign Affairs Vasantha Senanayake and State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera and discussed key areas of Agency support when establishing important institutes such as the Sri Lankan Gamma Centre, the National Centre for Non- Destructive Testing and the Nuclear Medicine Unit at University of Peradeniya was covered.

Minister Perera explained that in the area of non-destructive testing, Sri Lanka has built significant experience of over two decades and its companies provide inspection services to both the public and private sector.

“The IAEA has played an important role in helping Sri Lanka promote these technologies, particularly radiographic testing,” the Minister said.
