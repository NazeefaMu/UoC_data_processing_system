Travel in a backward area gives her a backache


	



 

A prominent woman politico who made an extensive inspection tour in a highly backward electorate recently is said to be undergoing herbal oil treatment for a severe backache.

 


The area the woman politico toured has been neglected by politicians and the administrative authorities concerned for decades and practically all the roads are badly broken up and dotted with yawning ruts and potholes.  Despite riding a deluxe vehicle, the woman politico badly shaken up by its frequent jolts and jerks all along the way had developed a backache. 


The woman politico who was confined to bed for one full day is now undergoing Ayurvedic treatment, they say.
