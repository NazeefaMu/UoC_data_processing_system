Government has directed South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to halt student admission and awarding degrees until government conditions on private medical colleges are gazetted, Presidential Secretariat announced today.

The statement said that the Government would Gazette the minimum standard of the medical education forthwith.

While changing the administration procedure it said the Government had decided to continue the institute as a joint venture of the State and private sector in the future.

The statement also said the courses followed by the SAITM students would be rearranged in a manner that they would be in line with a procedure accepted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and will adopt a mechanism to register those who already graduated at SAITM, with the SLMC.

It said the Government will seek the Attorney General's advice to inform the Government’s stance on the SAITM to the Supreme Court.

It also stressed that the SLMC’s independence and impartiality should not be influenced by any institution or individual.

The Presidential Secretariat further stated that an appropriate mechanism would be put in place after discussions with relevant stakeholders to list the SAITM in the stock market or to establish a trust with funds raised with the participation of State and private sectors in order to run the SAITM as a viable institution.

It also called on the university students, who have refrained from attending lectures over the SAITM issue to attend lectures. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
