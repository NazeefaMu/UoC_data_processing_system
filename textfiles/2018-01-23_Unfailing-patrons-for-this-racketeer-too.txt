Unfailing patrons for this racketeer too


	

A fuel filling station in a city suburb was sealed recently on being found committing the offense of pumping kerosene oil to bowsers to be used for illegal purposes.



 
In fact, it is illegal for a filling station to pump in any fuel in bulk to bowsers etc. for they are expected to provide fuel only to vehicles.  


This racket of selling kerosene in bulk for illegal purposes like mixing it with petrol had been going on for some time and the Police caught the fuel station employees red-handed.


Now a senior purohita from the Western province and a deputy one from a remote area in the country have begun pestering the authorities concerned with repeat requests to restore the license to the errant filling station owner.
