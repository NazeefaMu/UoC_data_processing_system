The Government's Deputy Chief Whip Ajith P. Perera yesterday requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take action against several joint opposition MPs whom he accused of undermining the dignity of Parliament.

He said MP Priyankara Jayaratne had insulted the chair by sitting on the seat allocated to the Speaker while MP Prasanna Ranatunga did so by sitting on the seat allocated to the President Mahindananda Aluthgamage had rung the quorum bell after sittings were suspended on July 28.

“These acts are a clear violation of parliamentary dignity,” he said.

The Speaker responded by saying he would examine the video clips and decide on the matters raised.

Joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said no action could be taken against any MP as the incidents took place after the parliamentary session was suspended on that day. “Action could be taken against MPs if they misbehaved during the sessions as per the standing orders,” he said.
