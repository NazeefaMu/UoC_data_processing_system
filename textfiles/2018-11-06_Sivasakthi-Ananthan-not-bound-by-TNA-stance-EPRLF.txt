Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) MP Sivasakthi Ananthan is not bound by the stand taken by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on the current political crisis though it was an ally of it, a party official said today.

The TNA has taken up the position that the sacking of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe from the office of Prime Minister was unconstitutional and would support a no-confidence motion to unseat new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. It commands the support of 16 MPs.

Meanwhile one of them has defected from the TNA and taken oaths as a minister of the new government.

EPRLF also has one MP elected on the TNA ticket. Party leader Suresh Premachandran told Daily Mirror that Mr. Anandan was not be bound by the TNA’s position. He said the EPRLF kept on observing the developments before taking any decision.

“We are watching how things unfold,” he said.(Kelum Bandara)
