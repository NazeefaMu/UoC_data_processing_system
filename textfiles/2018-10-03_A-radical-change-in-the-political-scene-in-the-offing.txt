A radical change in the political scene in the offing?


	



 

The political sibling -aka Master Brain behind Pohottuwa-who had just begun a three-month holiday in the land of Uncle Sam had taken the party men by surprise when he suddenly returned home last Tuesday.

 


Party stalwarts and pals, who knew well that the far-sighted sibling would not have cut short his vacation on a whim, had made immediate inquiries direct and indirect to ascertain the reason for it, but a firm ‘mum’ had been the response from all sources.


Nevertheless, a few enterprising party heavyweights had learnt the million-dollar reason from a link in the family chain: that he is due to meet a very high Yahapalanaya authority for a political significant powwow.


A very significant move decisive for the Pohottuwa’s political future, is about to take the country by storm and several Pohottuwa high-ups already wise to this move, are now up in arms against it, they say.
