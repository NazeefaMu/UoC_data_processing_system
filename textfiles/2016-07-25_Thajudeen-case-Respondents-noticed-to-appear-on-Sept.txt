Considering the revision bail application filed by former senior DIG Anura Senanayake, who is in remand custody over the inquiry conducted into the killing of Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen, the Colombo High Court today noticed respondents to appear in Court on September 8.

The respondents were OIC Ravindra Wimalasiri, Director of CID and the Attorney General.
Earlier, in the magisterial inquiry, the prosecution held that the suspects were charged under Sections 113 (conspiracy) and 32 (Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), of the Penal Code and according to the provision in Section 13 of the Bail Act.
