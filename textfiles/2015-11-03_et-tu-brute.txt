“Et tu Brute?”


	


This former Betel leaf party Diyawanna member from a district in the West was in the habit of genuflecting to the deposed strongman when the latter was the monarch of all he surveyed. 
However, the strongman wise to the politico’s true colours did not offer him any position of authority and kept him at arms’ length. Once he tried all tricks in his bag to secure the chair of a state-owned enterprise without success. He contested the last general poll and suffered an ignominious defeat.
Soon after the general poll, the politico switched his allegiance to the new Big Boss and made it to the Diyawanna through the national list, thanks to the latter’s sympathy. He later begged for some position and was given a responsibility that enabled him to have a say about Diyawanna council affairs.  
Meanwhile, the new Big Boss received a written request from his predecessor now reduced to back bencher status that he be allotted an office room at the Diyawanna complex. 
The new Big Boss later met a select group of seniors to discuss his predecessor’s request. The majority of seniors present at this powwow were for granting with this request. However, the member now having a say about the Diyawanna council affairs was up in arms against allotting an office room to his one-time patron. “How can we give him an office at the complex…? He is an ordinary member now. If we acceded to his request, all other members too could claim an office room each…,” he argued.
