Bond scam gets a mate!


	



 

A story that has gone viral in political circles says that an advisor of a Ministry has received a massive commission and this bonanza has been shared by three to four persons involved in a tender affair, they say.

 


The tender that brought a fortune to these people is related to the construction of a highway, sources say.


According to the sleuths who uncovered the scam, the company that offered the hefty commission is from a country that has become a benefactor in recent times.


Earlier, when the awarding of the tender was getting stalled, certain parties had intervened to iron out the problems impeding the process and had thereby earned an ‘award’ for themselves.


Some JO members who first smelled a rat are said to be planning to bring the scam to the centre-stage with a big bang. “This one equals only the Treasury bond scam in enormity,” a JO member remarked.
