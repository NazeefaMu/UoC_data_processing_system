Lights, camera, aliens ... what we'll be talking about at the movies next year

 
In 2016, space invaders will take over from zombies, we shall laugh at international conflict and see Michael Bay finally getting serious.
Aliens land
Aliens were curiously absent from big screens in 2015. Even The Martian was a deceptively titled tale of human ingenuity. But with zombies and vampires becoming very old hat, space invaders are set to make a comeback. Twenty years after most of the world was decimated in Independence Day, the landmark-exploding baddies are back to finish the job in the sequel, with Jeff Goldblum returning to fend them off. A more cerebral take on a similar set-up is explored in Sicario director Denis Villeneuve's Story of Your Life, with Amy Adams playing a linguist tasked with discovering whether extraterrestrials have come to earth to make nice or nasty. There's less confusion in young-adult tale The 5th Wave, which has Chloë Grace Moretz trying to save her brother as alien attacks hit. Finally, Hedwig and the Angry Inch director John Cameron Mitchell adapts Neil Gaiman's short story How to Talk to Girls at Parties about a visitor from outer space lost in Croydon, with Nicole Kidman. Benjamin Lee.
Pop directors get political
There comes a time for every director to put away childish things. In 2016, Michael Bay and Peter Berg will make the leap from kids' stuff to chewy adult politics. Bay is tidying away his Transformers to make room for a film about Benghazi. 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi follows the six-man team that defended an American diplomatic compound after radical Islamic terrorists attacked, killing the US ambassador to Libya. Bay has angered some Libyans, who say his jingoistic take diminishes the role that local people played in defending the Americans. Meanwhile, Berg, who has already chalked up an Afghanistan war thriller (Lone Survivor, starring Mark Wahlberg), is swapping battleships for oil rigs with Deepwater Horizon, his take on the 2010 oil-rig explosion that killed 11 workers and raised questions about the rigs owners' safety record.
Like Stonewall director Roland Emmerich before them, both Bay and Berg have suffered and will suffer critical approbation for daring to step outside their big, dumb comfort zone. Not everyone can be Spielberg, but then it's tough to be taken seriously after you've made millions framing close-ups of Megan Fox's bum. More likely to be taken seriously for getting serious is Rob Reiner. The director of The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally has flirted with gravitas (A Few Good Men), but his recent dramas have lacked heft. LBJ, starring Woody Harrelson as Lyndon B Johnson, is being talked up as a sincere return to form. Henry Barnes.
We start laughing at the news
Leftie Hollywood has long gone gaga for the international conflict comedy. M*A*S*H, Good Morning Vietnam, Three Kings, In the Loop - the absurdities of war have always appealed to the liberals. It's nice to know that, despite the chain of command and beyond the standard operating procedure, there are people, and people will always screw up eventually. This year's clutch of satires come straight from the frontline in Afghanistan. Tina Fey is fronting Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, based on the book The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan by embedded US journalist Kim Barker. And Animal Kingdom director David Michôd is escorting Brad Pitt through War Machine, another high-profile Netflix acquisition. Pitt plays General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan whose scathing assessment of the Obama administration, reported by journalist Michael Hastings in a Rolling Stone profile, led to McChrystal being relieved of his command. Michôd's film will follow Hastings as he ingratiates himself with McChrystal's people and finds out how they really feel about their commander-in-chief. Stoical archness in situations the military would deem "Fubar" will be the order of the day here. Just let's not forget there's a war on. The Guardian
