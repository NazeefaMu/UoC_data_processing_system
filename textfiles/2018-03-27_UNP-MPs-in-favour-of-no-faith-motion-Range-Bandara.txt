State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resource Management and Anamaduwa UNP organizer Palitha Range Bandara claimed yesterday that there were 27 UNP Parliamentarians who are ready to cast their votes in favour of the No-Faith Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe or they would not attend Parliament.

he made this statement while addressing a swearing-in ceremony accorded to the newly appointed UNP councillors to the local government bodies in Anamaduwa electorate.

He said further, “there should be one final thing for this. Take for example, the former leaders. Don’t the people say that it was better if J.R.Jayawardena was there? Don’t the people say that it was better if R. Premadasa was there? Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake are also like that. Then, what will the UNPers say when it comes to talking about Ranil Wickremesinghe?”

He said he would be expelled from the party or the post of organizer. "I came here by tendering my resignation. But it was not accepted. I will try to mete out justice on behalf of the Anamaduwa people," he said. (H. Chandana and Rovan Perera)
