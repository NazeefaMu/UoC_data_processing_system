Govt. attempting to delay LG polls: JO


	

The government is making sinister attempts to delay the local government elections by getting one of its own party members to challenge in Court the gazette notification on the elections, joint opposition MP Ranjith Soysa said today.

"It does not make any difference to the JO because it is prepared to face the elections any time," he told a media briefing held at the parliamentary complex.

He said the JO would form a broad alliance consisting of anti-government parties and civil society groups to contest the LG elections.

"The JO is willing to join any party other than the UNP. We will announce the name and symbol of this new alliance shortly," the MP said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
