Astrology is the study of the influence that planets and the stars that work on the human beings and all terrestrial events. The Sun and the Moon though not planets in an astronomical sense are treated as planets for the purpose of this study. 

Predictions based on positions of planets
The planets are continuously moving in a circular celestial path called the Zodiac and the horoscope or the Natal Chart cast based on the celestial map showing the positions of the stars and the planets in the Zodiac at a given moment of the birth of an individual is used as a tool to predict the fortunes and misfortunes in store for him or her. 

Zodiac and 12 signs
The Zodiac is divided into 12 divisions called Signs or Rashis and the weakness or the strength of a planet depends on the Rashi it is passing through at a given moment. The degree of the influence that a planet produces on an individual depends on the strength it commands while passing through a Sign. 

A rare phenomenon
It is seldom that two or more planets are found placed at the same time in favourable Signs where they are unusually strong. However, this phenomenon occurred when Venus began its passage in the Sign of Libra at 21.22 hours on September 19, this year where it acquires a special strength called Moolatrikona Swakshetra. This event occurred when Mars was already passing through the Sign of Capricorn powered with a special strength called exalted status.

Mercury to attain exaltation in Virgo 
Meanwhile, Mercury is due to move into the Virgo sign at 04.16 hours on September 19 where it will remain till 12.44 hours on October 6 commanding exalted status. This means the children born during the period from 21.22 hours on September 1 to 12. 44 hours on October 06 should greatly benefit from two especially strong planets Venus and Mars occupying the Libra and Capricorn signs in their horoscope and some of these newborns will gain greater benefit by way of special favourable yogas resulting from these two planets being placed in certain Houses in the horoscope. 

Three planets with special strength 
Meanwhile, the children born during the period from 04.16 hours on September 19 to 12.44 hours on October 06 will greatly benefit from three especially strong planets, Mars, Venus and Mercury and some of them will be beneficiaries of favourable yogas.


The special benefit resulting from Mercury gaining exalted status will cease by October 06. 


However, the newborns will continue to benefit from the special strength of Mars and Venus until the former exits from the Capricorn sign for Aquarius at 08.23 hours on November 06 this year. 


The following tables show the special favourable yogas the newborn natives are due to benefit from Mars, Venus and Mercury gaining special strength, depending on their Lagna (Ascendant). 


Children born from 21.22 hours on September 1, 2018 up to 04.16 hours on September 19, 2018
Mars will cease to produce favourable yogas when it moves into Aquarius sign at 08.23 hours on November 06 although Venus will remain in its exalted status placed in Libra sign until 20.43 hours on January 01, 2019. Therefore, Mars and Venus will continue to produce favourable yogas from 12.45 hours on October 06 to 08.23 hours on November 06 as shown in the Table 1 above.
