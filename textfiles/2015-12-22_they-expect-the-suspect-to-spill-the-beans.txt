Findings of the Police investigations into the re-opened case of the ruggerite’s death which were made known from time to time sent shock waves through the country. 
Police in a relentless pursuit of incriminating evidence had got experts to report on the CCTV footage covering the rush of events relating to the alleged accident. They have now wrapped up the case with iron-clad evidence pointing to a pre-meditated murder, they say. 
The suspect directly involved in the commission of the murder is an army officer who served as a driver of a VVIP family at the time.  He had been promoted to the rank of captain thanks to the political patronage he enjoyed, they say. This suspect who had been leading an affluent lifestyle with servants at his beck and call and wining and dining in high end-hotels in his hay day, is now awaiting trial in an army camp in the North, they say. 
Police expect that this suspect will in due course, come out with the full story behind the murder
