Sri Lanka’s fastest growing life insurer, Softlogic Life Insurance PLC, recently conducted a biannual congress to recognize its Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) winners who took part in MDRT Annual Conference 2017, which was held in Orlando, USA. 


Themed ‘Road to MDRT 2017’, the congress also provided a platform to drive and motivate more Softlogic advisors to achieve the prestigious MDRT recognition in 2018. The event that was attended by the senior management of the company focused on motivational training and other related aspects. 


The programme was directed towards bringing value towards participants who were chosen by the company as potential MDRT qualifiers for 2018, to drive towards the ultimate target of being MDRT-qualified advisors. Opportunities were given to last year’s Court of the Table (COT) members to share their achievements and what they have experienced by attending the prestigious MDRT Annual Conference in Orlando, USA. 


In 2017, Softlogic Life has produced 41 advisors who were qualified for the membership of the MDRT. Of the 41 qualifiers, four Softlogic Life advisors have received the prestigious COT membership.
Congratulating all MDRT winners of 2017, Softlogic Life Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said, “At Softlogic Life, we focus heavily on the importance of professional development of our sales staff. We are constantly on the lookout for top talent and believe in investing to support their development as well as providing state-of-the-art tools for enhanced productivity to serve our customer base efficiently. This achievement is a significant milestone for Softlogic Life, which goes to show the level of commitment and professionalism of our sales team.” 


Addressing all participants, Softlogic Life Chief Operating Officer Chula Hettiarachchi said, “Softlogic Life is proud to have so many MDRT qualifiers in our team that enables our company to drive quality and productivity, enabling us to gain the highest premiums in the market. This qualification will give our advisors a higher recognition to drive our business with more value and prestige. We are fully committed to supporting our MDRT qualifiers to attend future international conferences that will also include financial assistance. Softlogic Life will continue to invest in our dynamic sales force by offering the best training, advanced technology and career opportunities in the industry.”
