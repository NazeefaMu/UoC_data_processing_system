Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said today he would brief the Cabinet tomorrow on the incident where a minister’s son intruded into his ministry and tried to spy on him.
“I will not allow sons of any ministers to do politics in my ministry. We cannot allow family rule to continue as in the past,” he said.
The minister said he had no reason to do any deals with anyone and said he could have done so even before January 8, if he really wanted to do so.
“Not mega deals I could have done super deals. As someone who had done no deals in the past as a dedicated UNPer, I will protect the party,’ he said and added that certain people were attempting to destroy the party.
The minister said he had no connection with Avant Garde and challenged anyone to prove otherwise. (Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
