Gentlemanly understanding reached over the gentlemen’s game


	



 

The second in command of the country’s gentlemen’s game tendered his resignation to the head of the body controlling the game saying that he was not prepared to tolerate the misdeeds by some persons any longer, they say. 

 


On receiving the resignation letter, a highly disconcerted head called at the office of the second in command and appealed to him to withdraw the resignation. 


The second in command took advantage of this meeting with the boss to give the chapter and verse of the wrong doings by some people holding key positions in the administration.


The boss after giving an attentive hearing gave an assurance to his reluctant second in command that he would look into all wrongs done in the past and the latter agreed to continue to serve in his present office on the strength of this undertaking, they say.
