As the stage is set for the commencement of the Port City Project after the recent visit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the ‘Peoples Movement against Port City’ is planning more protests against the project in the days to come.

The joint coordinator of the Movement and Environmentalist Hemantha Withanage told Daily Mirror that they have planned for more street protests if the government goes ahead with it. “We are currently engaged in educating the fishermen in Negombo and Colombo about the adverse effect the port city project will have on them but we will have to take to the streets as the last precaution if the government goes ahead with it,” Withanage said.

“The government should stop lying to the people of promising a brighter future through this unsustainable development businesses,” he said while adding that there are no regulations in place to control an off shore financial market at the moment though such an activity is to be carried out in Port City. “There is a danger that it might become a centre for money laundering and illegal commercial activities,” he further said.
