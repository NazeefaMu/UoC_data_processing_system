The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry today said the Finnish Ambassador to Sri Lanka Rauli Suikkanen had agreed to provide the latest technology to generate electricity from sea waves to the country.

He expressed this at a special discussion with Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya at the Ministry.

“Our country is surrounded with sea and therefore we can generate electricity using sea waves easily. We can determine the capacity of electricity which can be generated. The projects can be launched with the latest technology with minimal cost. Therefore the electricity can be used during the dry seasons,” the minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
