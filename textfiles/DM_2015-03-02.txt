SL is among the significant successes of UNHRC: Kerry
	
	US Secretary of State John Kerry who addressed the gathering at the High level segment today said that Sri Lanka is among the significant successes of the Council and added that opportunities for real change exist in Sri Lanka.
	While stating that no other state has worked harder than the USA to promote human rights, he added that although the wheels of justice may not turn as rapidly as all of us would wish, the foundation for establishing justice has been prepared.
	Meanwhile, Botswana Foreign Affairs and International Corporation Minister Pelonomi Venson Moitoi, congratulated Sri Lanka on the outcome of its Presidential election and expressed their willingness to work with the new government.
	She said that its an opportunity to make further progress and further strengthen efforts towards democracy and resolve outstanding human rights issues.
	Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that although the government has been able to achieve much during its 48 days in office, many more hurdles need to be overcome.
	The Minister made these remarks a short while ago during the High Level segment of the 28th UNHRC sessions held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, where he said that obstacles including bureaucratic bottlenecks, entrenched attitudes resulting from the practices of the previous regime and extremist elements that attempt to derail the Governments initiatives need to be grappled in working towards realizing the governments pledges.
	For some of us, the changes that are taking place and the speed at which the issues concerning our people are being addressed may not be rapid enough. I assure this Council however that the political will and commitment required for this purpose has not diminished in any way, he said.
	Minister Samaraweera noting the action taken towards reconciliation said that steps have been taken to implement the recommendations of the Commissions that were set up at the time, including those made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and added that inquiries will be conducted into incidents identified by these Commissions as serious violations of human rights, which warrant further investigations and a criminal justice response.
	The content of the Report of the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka too can be taken into account by domestic investigative and judicial mechanisms which we are in the process of setting up, he said while adding also adding that although Sri Lanka possess the competence, skills and human resources required to ensure the success of the reconciliation and accountability journey, they recognize that much can be drawn from the advice, technical support and assistance of the international community.
	To this end, the Minister said that the Special Rapporteur on truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff will be visiting Sri Lanka next month upon invitation, for consultations and added the government also looks forward to receiving the Working Group on Involuntary and Enforced Disappearances.
	Commenting on the steps that have already been taken by the government to ensure democracy is reinstated and upheld, he noted that within days of being elected, the new government unblocked blocked websites, lifted restrictions on foreign media personnel who are visiting the country and lifted the travel restrictions to the conflict affected areas. He also stressed on the shifting of the NGO Secretariat which was previously under the Defense Ministry, under the purview of the Ministry of Policy Planking and Economic Affairs so that they are able to work without any fear or harassment.

Video: Face covered helmets banned
	
	Following recent robberies and murders committed by men wearing fullface helmets, Police today imposed a ban on wearing such helmets.
	The ban would be implemented from March 21, the Police said.
	Police Spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana said such incidents were consequences of not implementing this regulation earlier.
	According a Police regulation, helmets covering the face between eyebrows and the chin would be prohibited.
	After March 20, riders wearing full face helmet would be fined Rs.1000, while a court case will be filed, SSP Rohana said.
	He said the Police wanted the regulation implemented immediately for two reasons  one because of instances where criminals escaped identification using full-face helmets with tinted visors and the other being recent murders using helmets as masks. (Piyumi Fonseka and Sanath Desmond)

MR dumps astrology
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had told a Pakistani newspaper that he no longer believed in astrology.
During a conversation with a journalist of Dawn, Mr. Rajapaksa had said that he didnt believe in astrology.
Journalist: I have to ask you this, do you still believe in astrology
Mr. Rajapaksa: Now, I dont, (laughs)The full interview:
It is 8.00 a.m. on Saturday and I am outside Carlton House, the forest-green-coloured residence of Mahinda Rajapaksa, former president of Sri Lanka. It is a modest structure and on a low roof perches a medium-sized board carrying a picture of him beaming.
He has been residing in his hometown Tangalle after his shocking defeat in the presidential elections nearly 50 days ago. According to news reports, his electoral loss takes its place alongside that of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was so certain of her popularity that she called early elections in 1977. Mr Rajapaksa too had  counselled by his astrologer  called for early elections.
His residence is manned by two policemen in olive-green uniforms along with three intelligence officials dressed in plain, solid-coloured half-sleeved shirts and black trousers. They cast a cursory look at me and continue watching the sloping road. Sari-clad women, men in shirts and colourful sarongs and uniformed schoolchildren are walking up and down it.
Some of them walk past the gate of the residence, which is shaded by a large tree, to meet with and have their children blessed by Mahinda Raja (King Mahinda). He is usually present in his house but for the last two days he has been in Colombo and is now on his way to Tangalle.
This I know because I came to Carlton House on Thursday when I was earlier insistently told by a contact whom had I met serendipitously in Mount Lavinia in Colombo that I should meet Mr. Rajapaksa. He hasnt spoken publicly to the media ever since his electoral loss and you should speak to him and write about it, my contact said.
So here I am by the gate waiting for Nishantha Sandabarana, a close aide to Mr. Rajapaksa, who will take me to meet him. I am struck by the ordinariness of the entire scene. There is a pharmacy next to Carlton House where people purchase their medicines. Right opposite the house is a union council office, next to it is a fire brigade and alongside a cinema. Nobody is stopped by the law enforcement officials. There are no checkpoints. No fortified entrance. One cannot help thinking about the fortified mansion of our former president in his home city Karachi.
Half past eight and buses upon buses draw up at Carlton House. People dressed in their best clothes go inside the house. Clearly, he is still very popular. Later, a policeman informs me that two days after the presidential result was announced on Jan 9, people started to appear outside his residence since 4am. Thousands came that day, he says, adding that these days, hundreds come every day to pay their respects to the former president.
About 45 minutes later Mr. Sandabarana appears. He tells me that Mr. Rajapaksa should arrive in half an hour. I am taken inside the gate and directed towards a seat next to a tiny security room. Here, people hand over their mobile phones and then stand quietly in a queue.
At a quarter past nine, I spot a large black sedan entering the compound. The crowd chants Jayaviva (May you have a long life). Mr. Rajapaksa has finally arrived.
Mr. Sandabarana comes to fetch me but first I have to hand over my bag to the security staff. We walk past the long queue and Mr. Sandabarana says: I told him that a Pakistani lady wants to meet him because you live in her heart and in Pakistani peoples hearts. Without missing a beat, I answer: Ah, yes! Absolutely,
I am taken to a room with people standing in line before a large glass-topped desk; the former president is seated in a brown leather chair. He smiles and we shake hands. It is lovely to meet you, I say. I cant imagine us meeting our former president like this. You are very popular. He beams, clasping my hand warmly. I ask him that the Sri Lankans I have met here say that Pakistan helped in quelling the Tamil insurgency. How so See, the US, Europe, the West, they are not our friends, he says. Pakistan helped us, especially Musharraf. What happened in my country and the insurgency happening in your country, RAW [Indias Research and Analysis Wing] is behind it. I ask him how Pakistan and Sri Lanka can develop closer ties. I have visited Pakistan twice and went to Taxila and saw the Buddhist relics, he says. People here dont know about these things.
Leaning back in his chair, he becomes pensive and of his own volition speaks about his defeat in the elections. The Muslims in the east and people in the north were misled, probably by international forces, he muses.
Any message for the Pakistani people, I ask. We hope your insurgency is over soon, that the country prospers and we become closer.
Before I take my leave, I thank him profusely for meeting me, I have to ask you this, do you still believe in astrology Now, I dont, he says and laughs out loud.

MS to meet EC
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena hopes to meet Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya soon to discuss the proposed electoral reforms, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
	He told Daily Mirror that the enactment of electoral reforms was a key election promise made by President Sirisena during his campaign and as such he believes the government is obliged to fulfil this promise to the people.
	Dr. Senaratne, who is also the Vice President of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), said he raised this matter at the National Executive Council (NEC) which comprises representatives of the political parties that backed the President at the election. It has been appointed to oversee the execution of the 100-day programme.
	He said SLFP was insistent on electoral reforms and that it should be carried out without delay.
	If there is a will, new electorates can be delimitated within 40 days. There are different formulas being presented for a new electoral system, which is a mix of the First-Past-the Post-System and the Proportional Representation System, Dr. Senaratne said.
	He said some parties in the government were not keen to have electoral reforms enacted during the 100-day programme.
	It is unacceptable. There is time for it. If there is will, it can be done. During my election campaign, I categorically said that electoral reforms will be enacted on a priority basis. Nobody in the government can disregard it now, he said.
	Dr. Senaratne said the SLFP was flexible with regard to the abolition of executive powers as a part of constitutional amendments.(Kelum Bandara)

Underhand attempt to sell Blood Ivory uncovered
	
	Suspicion surrounds a secret deal between highly placed state officials and a politician to sell a stock of Blood Ivory which is in the custody of the Sri Lanka Customs Department at present, informed sources said.
	In a shocking revelation, Daily Mirror has reliably learned that the stock of 359 elephant tusks, commonly referred to as Blood Ivory, and valued at over Rs. 360 million, which was seized by the Customs Central Intelligence Unit, while in transshipment, on May 22, 2012 is to be sold illegally to a third party by the relevant authorities under the patronage of a senior politician of the present government.
	The contraband had arrived in the Colombo Port in a 20 foot container from Kenya en route to Dubai.
	The sleuths had opened the container to inspect the goods as they were causing an unbearable stench, and found the tusks which still had flesh adhering to them. They had been severed from the live elephants -- killing them on the spot.
	Customs officials said that the consignment weighing over 1.5 tonnes was the largest ever detected in a South Asian country.
	Customs director general Jagath P. Wijeweera who confiscated the container carrying the consignment said it was now lying opposite the Customs Preventive Office inside the Colombo Port.
	An attempt by the Presidential Secretariat to release Blood Ivory from the custody of the Customs in a bid to offer it to the Dalada Maligawa was foiled when many people, including environmentalists protested against the measure saying the contraband should be destroyed in public.
	A letter sent to the Director General of Customs on December 19, 2012 on the subject of Forfeited stock of 359 pieces of elephant tusks, signed by the then presidents chief of staff Gamini S. Senarath had instructed the director general to release the goods to a courier service named Colombo Logistics -- to be dispatched to the Dalada Maligawa as directed by the former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	Responding to the allegations, Customs spokesman, director Leslie Gamini said the consignment was still lying outside the Preventive Office under supervision by the Department.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
