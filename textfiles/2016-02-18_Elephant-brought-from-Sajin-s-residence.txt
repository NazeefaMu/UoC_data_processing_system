An elephant, found from the residence of former UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena in Ambalangoda, was taken into custody by the Wildlife officials and the CID today.

The officials who took the elephant into custody on a court order said the owners failed to submit valid documents to prove the ownership of the animal.

They stated that the 15-year-old elephant had been taken to the Udawalawe elephant transit home.

Sources said the Wildlife Department officials raided the former MP’s residence on January 12, 2015 in search of an elephant, and he had then produced a licence to prove the ownership of the elephant.
