A bipartisan delegation from the US House of Representatives arrived in Colombo today for three days of meetings as part of the House Democracy Partnership (HDP), the US Embassy today said.   

Issuing a statement, the Embassy said the delegation is pleased to continue the partnership begun with the signing of a Collaboration Agreement between the US House of Representatives and Sri Lankan Parliament on September 14, 2016 in Washington D.C.  

The visit serves to underscore the strong bipartisan support for Sri Lanka in the US Congress.  

“This visit by our nation’s elected representatives in Congress shows that bipartisan support for strong US-Sri Lankan ties is robust across the branches of the US government,” said US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap.

During the visit, the delegation is scheduled to meet the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Affairs Minister and Speaker.  

The delegation in Sri Lanka is led by HDP Chairman, Congressman Peter Roskam and includes Ranking Member Congressman David Price, Congressman Gerry Connolly and Congressman Adrian Smith.

The HDP is a bipartisan, twenty-member commission of the US House of Representatives that works directly with partner countries around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions.
