MYTH: You should take antibiotics when you have the flu.  

BUSTER: “Antibiotics are medications that fight infections, caused by bacteria. A flu is an influenza or virus causing fever. Viruses aren’t affected by antibiotics. They will only have an effect on bacterial infections. In fact it is not good to give antibiotics when there are some symptoms since you can be exposed to other infections,” explained Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Pediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital.
