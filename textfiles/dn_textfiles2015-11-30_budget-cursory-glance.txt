Budget at a cursory glance

The Government’s budget for 2016 aims at development initiatives by way of allocating funds for the improvement of infrastructure facilities. It also aims at upgrading the existing infrastructure facilities with the aim of promoting industries, tourism sector in addition to transportation sector.
According to analysts, these mega development initiatives, once implemented, will have positive effects on the country’s economy as they provide long awaited solutions in the transportation sector. When making proposals for development projects, the government has not only proposed new projects, but also ensure how the projects could make use of the existing facilities in a more productive manner.
The proposal to create industrial parks along the proposed expressways and expressway exit points, for instance, is commendable. The decision to allocate government lands in Hambantota and Trincomalee to encourage ship building, ship breaking and ship repair activities will pave way to make use of the ports in Hambantota and Trincomalee as employment generating ventures.

A convention hall with state of the art facilities and with a seating capacity of at least 7,000 to be built adjacent to Town Hall in collaboration with the private sector will also make Colombo a hosting centre for mega local and international events. The proposal to the build a monorail system connecting Negombo -Katunayake - Colombo and Colombo Kaduwela as a public and private sector partnership project is a praiseworthy proposal. It was a long awaited project which will ease the traffic congestion.
Commercial activities in Colombo
Allocation of Rs.15,000 million for the expansion of the road network which includes the expansion of the Ruwanpura Expressway, extension of Marine drive up to Panadura, extension of the Pamankada-Ratmalana Road, new bridge construction over the Kelani River, reconstruction of 25 bridges and three flyovers create new hopes about a better road network in the country.
Allocation of Rs.10,000 million for the construction of elevated road from Cotta Road to Kaduwela on BOT basis, the proposal to construct a new access road from the Kelani Bridge to the Colombo Fort improving access to Fort is a step taken to ease heavy traffic congestion in Colombo. This will further boost commercial activities in Colombo.
The decision to expand the Central Expressway to connect Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Mullaitvu and Jaffna under a public private partnership renews the hopes of the public about an expressway network expanded to the North Central and Northern provinces.
Most importantly the allocation of Rs.10,000 million for projects under master plan on the megapolis project will take the country towards a new era of urbanisation in the country. However, it is the expectation of the people to see a development that will not be a burden to the country's economy in a long term basis.
The government's effort revealed in the 2016 Budget to widen the tax net is a commendable move which will help bring in more revenue to the coffers, said tax experts. They said the proposal to net in around 60 percent of the affluent class who evade taxes is praiseworthy move but how it hopes to achieve this feat is yet to be seen.
Tax consultant and Partner Gajma and Co. N R Gajendran said the government has focused on wooing more FDIs to the country by slashing the corporate tax, revising the land lease tax and doing away with the dividend tax for shareholders outside Sri Lanka.
‘The policymakers should focus on stimulating more FDIs, promoting exports, research and development, encouraging innovation and investment in human resource development if it is to get to the next level of development,” Gajendran said.
Foreign investors
With regard to the income tax being increased from 12 percent to 15 percent for value added exports, he said we need see the total picture. Today the cess on exports has been removed and there is a huge advantage of the devalued rupee for exports. No country has a low income tax as in Sri Lanka. An increase from 12 percent to 15 percent will not have a major impact on exports, he said.
Tax experts said the land alienation policy adopted in the past sent a negative signal to foreign investors who were uncomfortable to invest in Sri Lanka. Foreigners could not buy land. There was an upfront cost of 15 percent which meant the cost of commencement of business shot up. The move to revise land lease tax in the budget will attract foreign investors and the space for development.
The reduction in VAT (Value Added Tax) by around three percent will offset the increase of PAL (Ports and Airport Levy) and NBT (Nation Building Tax) which have been increased from 5.0 percent to 7.5 percent and from 2 percent to 4 percent, experts said.
However industrialists said the revision of PAL and NBT will have a adverse impact on capital investment programs. It has also been proposed to introduce the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) in 24 institutions.
Gajendran appreciated the measures to simplify tax system and improve administration. However, the government will have to walk the talk and the private sector will have to keep pace with the rapid changes across the globe.
The budgetary allocations to the education sector represented an all high six percent of the GDP, which the Government Ministers called a victory for general masses. However the joint opposition and the JVP criticized it as a gimmick to hoodwink the people.
The budget has allocated a sum of Rs.1000 million for teacher-training and re-training while quarters and hostels will be built at an amount of Rs 2000 million, next year. Showcasing the commitment of the government to improve basic facilities in state schools Rs. 4000 million has been set aside to develop sanitary and water facilities in all primary and secondary schools in the country by 2016. In addition, a sum of Rs 2000 million has been allocated to supply electricity for schools without power.
All 3577 primary schools in the country will be upgraded at a cost of Rs.10,000 million under a medium term action plan.
At the same time, 1,000 secondary schools are to be provided with activity rooms, laboratories, multimedia facilities, libraries with e-library facility. The Finance Minister allocated Rs.15,000 million for this purpose and another Rs.30,000 million to develop another 1360 ‘neglected schools’.
Further, to stress its commitment to develop estate sector education, the government has set aside Rs.250 million to upgrade 25 estate schools as secondary schools. Among other programs envisaged are the improvement of dental facilities in schools and allowing schools to enter into partnership with private sector to utilise their unused property for activities such as farming to generate income.
It also removed import duties on books, journals and magazines to promote education. Other key decisions include the restriction of students in a classroom to 35 and a voucher system for school uniforms.
Higher education sector
The government also increased total budgetary allocation for higher education sector by 30 percent in 2016. Another welcome decision is to provide hostel facilities for all undergraduates by 2018. Local universities will also be encouraged to get accreditation with professional bodies to attract foreign students to their postgraduate courses.
To honour former Education Minister Lalith Athulathmudali a university named Mahapola University will be built at Malabe. This university will focus on teaching ICT, Business Studies, English, Management and other new market oriented subjects. A sum of Rs.3,000 million is allocated for this purpose.
A new engineering and agriculture faculty in Kilinochchi and Vavuniya, Postgraduate Institute for Pali and Buddhist studies are among the other projects envisaged under the 2016 Budget.
The government, in keeping with its vision to produce computer savvy young generation, will also provide free wi-fi zones in all universities and laptops will be provided under interest free three year loan programmes.
To curb the flow of foreign exchange out, the government will support the previous government’s policy to set up foreign institutions within Sri Lanka. A point scheme will also benefit those who excel in sports and other extracurricular activities during school.
The budget made concessions for the technical education sector as well. Techno-based campuses and vocational training institutes are being envisaged to bridge the gap in lower and middle level skilled workforce. Within the next two years the intake to German Technical College is to be increased by 200 students.
The emphasis placed on this sector was further highlighted by the fact that it allocated Rs.3000 million to provide foreign training for master trainers in the vocational training sector and introduce standardized English courses with the participation of private sector.
