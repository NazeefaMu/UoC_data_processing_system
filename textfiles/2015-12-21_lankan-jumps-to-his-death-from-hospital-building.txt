A 30-year-old Sri Lankan reportedly jumped to his death from the terrace of Qatif Central Hospital in the Eastern Province on Saturday.
The police are investigating the case and the reason for the expatriate taking his own life were yet to be ascertained, local media reported on Sunday.
“The police department in central Qatif received a report from the hospital about an Asian worker who committed suicide by jumping from the terrace of the hospital building,” police spokesman Col. Ziad Al-Ruqaiti was quoted as saying.
“Police and experts have launched an investigation into the incident. The body was being held in preparation for transferring the case to the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution,” he added.
Saudi Arabia is home to some 550,000 of the total 1.5 million Sri Lankan’s currently working in the Middle East.
The Sri Lankan government had earlier this year announced a pension scheme for its overseas workers, if the workers complete two years of foreign employment.
A top official at the Ministry of Foreign Employment had said the new government has drawn up a package of proposed facilities and services to Sri Lankan overseas workers, including the pension scheme in recognition of their contributions to the country’s national development. (Arab News)
