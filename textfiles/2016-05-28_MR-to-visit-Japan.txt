Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will undertake a tour of Japan on June 9 along with a few other members of the Joint Opposition, it is learnt.

He will travel in Japan on an invitation extended to him by a group of Sri Lankans living in that country. Sources close to him said MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranatunga will join him.

This is his third overseas visit undertaken after his defeat at the Presidential Election last year. Earlier, he visited Uganda and Thailand. (Kelum Bandara)
