National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) Leader Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera said today parliament should be dissolved and the general election held after enacting the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He said what they wanted was not to bring any political party to power but to abolish the executive presidency through the required amendments to the Constitution.
“We are not interested in which party comes to power whether UNP, SLFP or JVP. What we want is to introduce the necessary amendments to the Constitution,” the Thera said.
He requested all MPs to vote for the 19th Amendment and said those who oppose it would be considered as traitors.
“We request the people to take to the streets and urge the 225 MPs to support the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. We will never get such an opportunity in the future and the MPs should not miss out on such an opportunity,” the Thera said.WATCH
