THE HINDU, 05th FEBRUARY, 2017-AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala was on Sunday elected as the Leader of the Legislature party by the MLAs in the party head office in Chennai paving the way for her swearing in as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.


Ms. Sasikala will be sworn in as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on February 9.
The development came exactly two months after Jayalalithaa’s death. Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam proposed her name in the MLAs’ meeting and she was unanimously elected as the Legislature party leader. Mr. Panneerselvam said he would soon hand over the resignation to the Governor. Ms. Sasikala was  elected as the party’s general secretary in December last year following the death of Jayalalithaa.
