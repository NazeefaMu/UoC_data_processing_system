Sajin Vass allowed to go abroad

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered the temporary release of the passport of former Foreign Ministry Monitoring MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena for five days.
While ordering to temporary release the passport on medical grounds, Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya observed that the suspect would be allowed to travel only to Singapore and ordered that the passport be returned to Court custody on November 3.
The former MP informed Court that that he wanted to travel to Singapore for medical treatment and moved Court that he be permitted to leave the country for five days from October 25 to 30.
The former MP's passport had been impounded in relation to a case of non-declaration of assets and liabilities. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against him in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975.
