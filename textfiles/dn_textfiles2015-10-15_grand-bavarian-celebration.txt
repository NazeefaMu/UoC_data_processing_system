The Grand Bavarian Celebration

The Paradise Beach of Mount Lavinia Hotel came alive with a gala celebration of all things Bavarian. For five days, from October 7th to 11th, Colombo Oktoberfest provided an unforgettable experience to all participants with traditional Bavarian cuisine, games and music for people from all walks of life.
There were Bavarian hostesses and The Bayernrokers band, who flew all the way from Germany played traditional Oktoberfest sing-along favorites with popular English hits, keeping everyone on their toes till the wee hours of the morning.
