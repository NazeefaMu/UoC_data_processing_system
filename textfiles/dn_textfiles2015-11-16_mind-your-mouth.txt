[HEALTH WATCH]
Mind your mouth!

World Diabetes Day was celebrated on November 14. According to the latest findings, 20 percent of urban population and eight percent of rural population in Sri Lanka suffer from diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is on the increase among school children and pregnant women. Senior Lecturer attached to the Medicine Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Colombo, Consultant Endocrinologist / Diabetologist Dr. Prasad Katulanda talks to Health Watch about the risk of developing diabetes and preventive measures.
Q: What is diabetes ?
A : Diabetes is having higher sugar level in your blood than the reference range. In Type One diabetes, there is no insulin production in the body at all and the person needs to take insulin from outside in order to survive. Type One diabetes usually affects children and young people.
Type Two diabetes is more common than the Type One diabetes and it is caused due to Insulin resistance in the body and non production of Insulin in the body. Initially a person can manage Type Two diabetes through lifestyle modifications and tablets, but later most of them needs insulin as well.
Q: Who are at risk of developing diabetes ?
A : South Asian population is at high risk of developing diabetes. Actually there are some genetic markers that have been found out to incriminate as risk factors for diabetes, but it looks like it is not only the genes. It is genes' environment interaction. The same genes were there in our bodies even thousands of years ago, but diabetes was not so common. Now it is believed that due to lack of physical exercise and unhealthy diet, these genes get modified themselves. This is called epigenetic. This gene modification plays a major role in developing diabetes.
Q: What are the complications of diabetes ?
A : Diabetes has two sets of complications. If a diabetic's sugar level is very high, he/she can get diabetic coma, various infections etc.
But if a diabetic's sugar level is not in control for a long term, many other complications can be developed in him/her such as Diabetic Retinopathy which causes blindness, Nephropathy which causes kidney failure, Neuropathy which causes lack of sensation in your feet, genital areas, etc. Lack of sensation in feet can lead to amputations and lack of sensations in genital areas in males can cause erectile dysfunctions. One of the more serious complications caused due to lack of sensations is having heart attacks and strokes. These heart attacks and strokes affect young people in a more aggressive way. A diabetic can get a heart attack or a stroke ten years before than an ordinary healthy person gets the same. Those heart attacks can be painless.
Q: How can diabetes be controlled?
A : Modifications in lifestyle are very important for any diabetes patient. They should eat healthy food and do regular exercises. The tablets given to such patients are very safe and they never cause kidney damage even when taken for a longer periods. Some people think that long term intake of tablets can lead to kidney damage, liver txocation etc, but all those are only myths. There is no truth in those ideas. These myths cause a lot of problems for diabetics because not taking drugs as prescribed lead to kidney damage etc.

Q: How about various opinions/beliefs existing among people on diabetes medicines?
A : All the herbs that are used by some people that they would lower their blood sugar level are not evidence based. The western medicines are scientifically developed on evidence based systems. They are very closely monitored by International organizations such as FDA in US, European Medical Regulatory Authority etc. But when it comes to herbs, scientific researches had not been done. This does not mean that herbs are not useful. The relevant authorities/institutions should conduct scientific researches and develop medicines out of these herbs which are very potent and safe.
Q: How can diabetes be prevented ?
A : Sugar intake leads to many diseases including diabetes. Diabetes patients should not take sugar. But here in Sri Lanka all food and beverages contain sugar. Tea is served everywhere in Sri Lanka after mixing sugar and not separately. People do not reject sugary food and beverages because according to our culture and traditions, offering food and beverages and accepting food and beverages is equally important. Due to this situation healthy people falls sick and the sick (diabetics) people cannot control their diseases. Annually one Sri Lankan consumes 30 kilograms of sugar and this is far beyond the limit.
The latest scientific researches had clearly shown that use of sugar, especially soft/cool drinks have a direct link with developing diabetes. If a person takes one or more such drinks per day, his/her risk of developing diabetes is twice higher than in a person who do not take those drinks. Drinking soft/cool drinks have a major impact on children's health. There is nothing in sugar other than calories. No nutrition in sugar at all. Sugar offers us empty calories only. Sugar can be avoided very easily and it should be done in order to prevent diabetes and many other related health issues.
The persons who use excessive sugar face other health problems such as developing fatty liver which cause cirrhosis. Fructose in sugar causes this condition. Too much intake of sugar increase triglycerides in blood. This leads to heart diseases. The possibility of developing cancer is higher in over weight people. High intake of sugar makes people over weight. Healthy diet and regular physical exercises are very important for all.
