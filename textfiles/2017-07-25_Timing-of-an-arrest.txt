Timing of an arrest


	

Attempts by law-enforcement authorities to arrest an errant Dharma- Chakra wearing security high-up had been thwarted by a top political authority on a number of occasions. 

 


However, the authorities biding time had gone into action the moment the top political authority who was on a visit to a foreign country took flight to return home. When he was about to be taken in, the Dharma-Chakra high-up had tried to contact the friendly political authority flying back home without success.


“The fellow would be still absconding, if we failed to arrest him while his ‘patron saint’ was up in the air,” a senior law- enforcement officer had remarked.
