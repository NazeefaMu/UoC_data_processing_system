‘Twin leadership’ move gets a beating!


	



 

It is no longer news that a prominent member of the Group 16 now reduced to 15, has begun promoting the idea of starting a new political journey led by the incumbent Number One and the former strongman from the top two positions.

 


However, this proposition is being frowned upon by practically all other members in the group, they say.


Most of the group members, who prefer to follow in the footsteps of the former strongman, have already rejected the idea of a twin leadership.


Meanwhile, a gabby heavyweight from Uva challenging the twin leadership proposition had declared point blank that they had no choice other than to put forward a ‘marketable’ candidate at the upcoming big poll and the others had readily endorsed the view.


The general opinion about the group members is that the former strongman may not like the idea of playing the second fiddle to another person.Nevertheless, the advocate of ‘twin leadership’ continues to canvass support for the move undeterred, they say.
