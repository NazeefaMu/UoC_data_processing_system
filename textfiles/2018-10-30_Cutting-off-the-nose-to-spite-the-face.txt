The opening of an Osu Sala outlet in a main town north of the central capital is getting dragged on due to a tug-o-war between two rival politicos in the area, they say.

 


Arrangements have already been made to open an Osu Sala outlet in the town shortly on the initiative of a certain politico in response to a long-standing demand by the public, who are now compelled to buy their medicines at exorbitant prices from the private sector, but the politico occupying the main chair of the local body is yet to give the official nod for the purpose, informed sources say.
The chair of the local body is deliberately withholding his official, okay just to spite the rival politico, these sources add.
