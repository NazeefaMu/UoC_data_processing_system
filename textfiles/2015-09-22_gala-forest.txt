Four persons, who went to see the Gonawala Waterfall in the Rangala Forest of the Knuckles mountain range, have not returned home, the Ragala Police said.
A search operation had been launched with the help from the area people and other volunteers, after the wife of one of the trekkers, lodged a complaint with the Police.
The Police said they believed the group -aged between 18 and 32- from the Ragala area, lost their way on their return journey. They said that the group had gone Sunday evening to see the waterfall.
