SL vulnerable to drug traffickers - Ruwan

Sri Lankan Security Forces including the coastguard are continuously engaged in protecting the country from the drug menace since the country is vulnerable to drug traffickers due to its location, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said.
Security Forces have confiscated a significant amount of drugs, the minister said at the international meeting of senior drug enforcement officials of the Indian Ocean region at the Taj Samudra Hotel, Colombo yesterday.
The meeting was jointly organised by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Global Maritime Crime Programme and the Defence Ministry. Wijewardene said Sri Lanka was maintaining a cordial and close rapport with other countries and organisations which are engaged in fighting the drug menace in the international arena. "Sri Lanka is in the centre of the Indian Ocean and therefore the country is easily affected by the drug menace," Minister Wijewardene said.
