Ginigathena bridge needs repair

The bridge across the canal at Millagahamula, on the Hatton-Avissawella road in Ginigathena, Nuwara Eliya is in a state of disrepair. The iron rods on the 30 metres long bridge, which was constructed by the Highways Department several decades ago, has not been repaired for a long period, inconveniencing commuting motorists.
The Road Development Authority (RDA) had previously taken steps to constructing a new bridge by means of funds provided by the French government, but plans could not go through for reasons of landslides from the mountains above, due to heavy rains at the time. No steps were taken to resume the repair since, and residents said authorities must take note of the issue and repair the bridge immediately.
