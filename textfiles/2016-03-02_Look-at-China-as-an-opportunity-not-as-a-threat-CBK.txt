China is a big economic power in the region and countries should look at China as an opportunity rather than a threat, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who is in India to take part in the Raisina Dialogue, said on Tuesday.

 
“China is a big economic power in the region, along with India,” she said addressing the inauguration of the three-day dialogue, a global conclave on geopolitics and geo-economics organised by the Indian External Affairs Ministry and the Observer Research Foundation.


She also said that the conflict between India and Pakistan had hindered the development of the region badly.

Ms. Kumaratunga went on to state that South Asia had immense potential to increase trade and bring in development though it was the least integrated region in the world.

She also stressed the need for building trust and confidence among the countries to increase cooperation.  

 “A paradigm shift is needed in the policies of the governments.  The new generations, having born after the India-Pakistan partition have left behind conflict and are looking forward for development of the region,” she said.

She said there was also a need for ‘pragmatic action plan’ by the leaderships of the countries of the region to economically integrate and develop.

“There is no need for a grand vision, but only a pragmatic action plan,” she said.

Meanwhile, she called for the “enterprise of building cooperation and economic integration” between the countries in South Asia first and then with other countries in Asia.

“Sri Lanka, having good relations with all countries, can act as a bridge between nations,” Ms. Kumaratunga said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
