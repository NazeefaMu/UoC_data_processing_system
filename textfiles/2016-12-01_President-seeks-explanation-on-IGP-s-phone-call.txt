President Sirisena was responding to Joint opposition MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake who raised a question on the issue this afternoon.

IGP Jayasundara answering a call allegedly said he had informed the FCID not to arrest anyone without his permission, according to the video.

“What was said by the IGP was wrong and I have called for an explanation on this matter from him," the President said.(Yohan Perera)
