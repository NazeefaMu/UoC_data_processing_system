The prevailing rains in the South-Western part of the country is expected to continue while a spill gate of the Kukule Ganga had to be opened as a result of the heavy rains during the past week, the Department of Meteorology said.

It said showers or thundershowers were expected at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, North-Western and Southern Provinces and that heavy rains of about 75-100 mm could be expected at some places with rain occurring in the Northern Province and in the Anuradhapura district while the possibility of afternoon thundershowers was also increasing.

“The low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal to the North-east of the island is likely to develop into a depression and move away from the island and surrounding sea areas during next few days,” the Met Dept said.

It said the seas off Mannar to Batticaloa via Kankasanturai and Trincomalee and the seas off Matara to Pottuvil via Hambantota could be rough at times with the wind speeds increasing up to 50-60 kmph.

Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Assistant Director Pradeep Kodippili said a landslide warning had been issued in the Ratnapura District. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
