Mudharabah Term Deposit, which is a long term investment plan that extends from one month up to sixty months, offers profit payments monthly, annually or at maturity, depending on the preference of the customer. Mudharabah Savings Accounts facilitates a flexible and convenient way of deposits and provides easy access to the savings through a savings pass book, an internationally accessible ATM/Debit card which is accessible from any HNB ATM machine and through CLC’s online banking facility. 
 Wakala Investment – refers to a Fixed Term investment plan where the company as the Agent manages Investor’s funds for an agreed profit rate. The term can be from 01 month up to  60 months. 
Through Ijarah (Leasing), CLC will lessen the burden of capital expenditure by providing fixed term leasing facilities for vehicles, machinery and equipment. Murabaha refers to the sale of goods at a price which includes a profit margin in addition  to the cost.  
This service will be available for Trade Finance and for the purchase of property, vehicles, machinery and equipment. 
Diminishing Musharaka refers to property financing where CLC partners with the client for a common ownership of an asset. 
However since the client has the ability to purchase the company’s share periodically, it diminishes the company’s ownership and increases the client’s share eventually passing complete ownership to the client. 
To satisfy working capital requirements of the customer CLC Islamic Finance provides Wakala Lending (short term business and working 
capital finance).
