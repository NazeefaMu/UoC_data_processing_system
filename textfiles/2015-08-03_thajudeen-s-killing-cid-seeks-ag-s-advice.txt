The CID which is investigating the death of former Havelocks Sports Club Rugby Captain and Sri Lanka Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen has sought the Attorney General’s advice to exhume his body in connection with the magisterial inquiry, police sources said.
Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the body would be exhumed based on the Attorney General’s advice and upon the receipt of a Court order.
Local media on Monday (3) reported that burial site of Mr. Thajudeen who died in May 2012 was being provided police protection.
On July 28, the Colombo Additional Magistrate ordered the Colombo Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) to submit the final and detailed postmortem report pertaining to the death of rugby player in court before September 10.
On Monday (27), the CID informed Court that Mr. Thajudeen's death was a homicide and not accidental.
The CID informed Court that the investigations conducted so far had revealed that his teeth and the bones in the pelvic region were broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death. The CID said his leg muscles had been cut with a piece of broken class.
The CID said the government analyst's report and the postmortem report on the death appeared to be contradictory and that the death was not accidental but a homicide.
The former Havelocks SC rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen died in May 2012.
Earlier the police had said Mr. Thajudeen had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds on Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
