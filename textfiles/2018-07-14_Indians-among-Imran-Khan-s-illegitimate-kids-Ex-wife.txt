New Delhi (Hindustan Times), July 13, 2018 - Journalist Reham Khan, who was briefly married to Imran Khan, has claimed in her autobiography that the cricketer-turned-politician told her that he sired at least five illegitimate children, including “some” Indians. Reham Khan, a British-Pakistani journalist, makes a number of claims in her self-titled autobiography about Imran Khan’s love life.   


Perhaps the most damning allegation of all in the book is Reham Khan’s claim about Imran Khan’s illegitimate children,   


Reham Khan, 45, writes that the issue of the 65-year-old Imran’s illegitimate children came up while they were discussing Tyrian, his daughter with the late socialite Sita White, in 2015.
