Onetime meat is now their poison


	



 

Web media which carried out a major role in bringing the yahapalanaya into power has become the whipping boy of several sections of the society.

 


Government, unhappy about the conduct of this media, has now placed before its top team a proposal that calls for legislation to regulate it. 


An important and powerful political authority in the country who has taken into his heart to properly discipline the web media has already gone out of the way to get the necessary legislation beaten into shape, they say.


Some say that it is a strange quirk of fate that the political authority directly involved in drafting the legislation is none other than a member hailing from a political family holding a major stake in several media institutions.


Onetime meat for someone can become his poison at another time, a political wag quipped giving a clever twist to a well-known adage.
