Considering the bail revision application filed by the Attorney General, the high court suspended the decision by the Gangodawila Magistrate till June 21.

The Court also called for the case report of the inquiry into allegedly keeping an elephant in contravention of the PPA and Fauna and Flora Act.

The fourth suspect, former Additional Magistrate Thilina Gamage, was also noticed to appear in court on June 21. (Shehan Chamika Silva and Farook Thajudeen)
