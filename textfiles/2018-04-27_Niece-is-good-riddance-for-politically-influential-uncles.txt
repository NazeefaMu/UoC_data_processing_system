Niece is good riddance for politically- influential uncles


	



 

The lady in this story had the good fortune to be appointed to a high office in provincial administration.

 


On the day she assumed duties in the high office, two of her politically powerful paternal uncles stood on either side of her to invoke their blessings. 


However, when she assumed duties in another station following an unusual transfer, only her third uncle living in a distant place had turned up to offer his greetings. 


The two politically-influential uncles whose goodwill she enjoyed earlier have now fallen out with her and are shunning her like the plague, they say.


Ever since assuming the high office, the lady is said to have become highly critical of one of the two uncles holding other political positions. The bad blood between the uncle and the niece that later aggravated into a feud manifested in even their official functions, is the main cause for her transfer to another area, they say.
