Tory civil war erupts into the open


	



 

UK, (Daily Mail), 5 October 2017 - Cabinet ministers rallied to prop up Theresa May today as the Tories descended deeper into civil war after her conference speech nightmare.  


Plotting against the Prime Minister has reached fever pitch after a sore throat saw her cough and splutter through an agonising 65 minutes on the stage in Manchester.  To make matters worse, a notorious prankster achieved an extraordinary security breach to approach the podium and hand Mrs May a P45 - before letters started falling off the slogan position in full view of TV cameras behind her. The premier appeared close to tears as she finally finished the address, and husband Philip rushed up to comfort her.  Dozens of Tory MPs are believed to be ready to call for the PM to go - but not the 48 required to trigger a formal vote of confidence. Instead, they are hoping to pressure Mrs May into stepping down voluntarily, potentially as early as Christmas.  


Former minister Ed Vaizey said this morning that ‘quite a few people are firmly of the view she should resign’. Pressed on whether he thought she should go, the MP said: ‘I am finding it increasingly difficult to see a way forward at the moment and it worries me.’
