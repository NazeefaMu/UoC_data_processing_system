Seed Magic

On this warm, beautiful day, there’s a tiny plant waiting to pierce the soil and raise its head
Remember how Jack exchanged his cow for some ‘magic seeds?’ His mum was furious with him and threw the seeds out of the window. But hey presto, the next morning there was a giant beanstalk in their garden. Not just any beanstalk too, but one that reached the sky.
Jack was luckier than most of us. His seeds sprouted overnight. He was certainly, more lucky than poor Winnie-the-Pooh, who planted a pumpkin seed and stayed near it throughout the spring, eating honey to kill time. By the time the pumpkin grew, Pooh’s tummy too, had grown almost as big as the pumpkin.
I know, these are make-believe stories. But the funny thing is, you will find there is a magical, enchanting aura surrounding seeds, in real life too. After all, they lie dormant, under a shroud of soil, for ages and ages, then, suddenly burst forth with enchanting vigour to end up as a stunning collection of eye-catching flowers, the kind that attracts fairies, or a mouth-watering bunch of mangoes, the kind that attracts cheeky squirrels. To state the obvious, seeds let you start at the beginning. It is a satisfying, personal involvement that starts with your decision of which seeds to grow.
Choosing the best seeds
Experts say there are several factors that need to be taken into account when it comes to choosing the best seeds for your garden. If you are planning to grow vegetables you need to first decide what vegetables and then what varieties. A review of your personal and your family’s likes and dislikes will probably narrow the list quickly.

Choosing flowers on the other hand, requires a lot of decisions - but you can “mix and match and choose” to fit a wide range of options. Basically, you need to decide if the flower will ultimately be planted in full-sun, partial-sun or a shady location. Seed packets and catalog descriptions will tell you the light requirements for a particular class and variety.
Deciding what to plant was easy. It was the next step that turned out to be the hardest of them all. Buying seeds. When I called the Department of Agriculture and asked if they had vegetable seeds for me to buy for my backyard vegetable garden, the person at the other end of the line said, I should talk to some other person about it. I was given another number to call. When I dialed this number every few seconds for about thirty minutes I kept hearing the engaged tone. Finally when the phone rang I was told the person I was supposed to talk to was on another call. But thankfully, before the person-I-was-not-supposed-to-talk-to hung up, I managed to blurt my question to her. Which was so very simple. Can I buy vegetable seeds from their department? And, as I expected, the answer too, was pretty simple. “Yes,” she said. “You can buy vegetable seeds and fruit plants from our centers,” Then she cut the line.
Ruwan on seeds
I didn’t know where these ‘centers’ existed, and I didn’t want to talk to her again. So, I turned elsewhere and came across Hayleys Quality Seeds & Flowers Division on the net. Instead of calling, I sent an email to Ruwan Rajapakse, Director / CEO and found myself on cloud nine when he sent a comprehensive answer. “The seeds we have are mainly hybrids for the export market. They are protected by IP. The Sri Lankan market is not ready to have planting materiel from seeds due to two reasons; It takes a long time to reach the flowering stage, and it needs a lot of care at the nursery stage. Hence, we sell young plants in Sri Lanka, that give flowers in a few weeks. This means they are 6 to 8 weeks from seed stage when we sell them,” wrote Rajapakse.
Yet, what he said, did nothing to solve my problem. I still didn’t know where I could find vegetable seeds for my backyard and a few flower seeds for the front garden, seeds like marigolds to ward off insects, and petunias, for their petite beauty, even though I wasn’t sure if they will grow in Colombo.
The best containers
Meanwhile, I started to read all I can about what I should do, if and when I found some seeds. Expert gardeners on the net, unanimously agreed on one fact, which is something even Mr. Watson would have figured on his own. “After the seeds, the first thing you will need is a container to grow them in.” What followed though, was pretty useful. “The best containers are those made for the purpose. There are seed starting containers made of plastic or pressed fiber, peat strips and pots, and peat pellets of different types, as well as growing cubes and even complete seed-starter kits available. You can base your choice on price, convenience and even curiosity to decide which to use.”
 
They also said, drainage is the important factor to watch out for when the seeds are sown in containers. If you use recyclables such as egg cartons or cans, which is what I was planning to do, be sure to punch drainage holes in the bottom.
The start!
For seed starting, the best choice is “a sterile, soilless germinating mixture which is available in stores.” Which stores? They did not say. So, I decided, I would fill the containers with ordinary garden soil and keep my fingers crossed. For, no matter what, it’s a universal truth that nothing is perfect, and, not every seed will germinate, anyway.

It was useful to know though, that large seeds that can be easily handled could be placed individually in the mix. Smaller seeds can be sown by snipping off a corner of the seed packet and tapping them gently out of the packet as you sow them. If too many seeds fall out at once, you should gently spread them with the tip of a pencil. Seeds need room to grow, so, be careful not to plant them too thickly. Place two large seeds and two to three small seeds in each container where you want at least one plant to grow.
Check the directions
Check the directions to see if the seeds need light or dark to germinate, said the experts. Those that need light should not be covered with the soil mix, but should be pressed down (not buried) so that they make contact with the moist medium. Those that need dark should be lightly covered with the mix (about 1 to 2 times the seed thickness) and can be placed in a dark place or covered with black plastic or something else that will keep the light out.
I confess at this point, I gave up reading. I renewed my search for seeds, instead, and, eureka! Three days ago, I finally found a few precious vegetable seeds. They were hanging in tiny polyethene bags at the entrance of a hardware store, competing with a dozen broomsticks to draw my attention. A packet cost Rs. 10.
Right now, the brinjal seeds and tomatoe seeds are in two egg containers under the Kathurumurunga tree in my backyard. I dug holes in a sunny spot and inserted two seeds each of ladies fingers and beans into them. None of the packets had instructions, which thankfully gave me the freedom to do everything my way.
Three days later, I am still waiting for the seeds to sprout. Who knows, if my bean seeds are as magical as Jack’s, next week I might be writing to you from the giant’s house in the clouds.
Hope the giant has wifi up there.
