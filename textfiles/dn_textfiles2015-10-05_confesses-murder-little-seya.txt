Minuwangoda Chief Magistrate D.A. Ruwanpathirana yesterday re-remanded Dunesh Priyashantha alias Kondaya, the main suspect in the Seya Sadewmi rape and murder until October 19 pending his DNA investigation report.
The second suspect, I.P.Saman Jayatilleke produced in Court by the CID yesterday was ordered to be produced before the Gintec Institute, Borella on October 6 for a DNA investigation and report by the prison authorities.
Police had strengthened security in the Court premises when the case was called yesterday. Jayatilleke was brought to Court under stringent security by the CID while the main suspect was produced by the prison authorities themselves.

The second suspect being brought to Court
Inspector Ravindra Wimalasena making submissions in Court on behalf of the CID said the IGP entrusted investigations into this case to the CID on September 16. He said: “When investigations were made about the main suspect reported to be hiding in Ingammaruwa in Akarangaha it was revealed that the suspect had fled to Bemmulla, Gampaha. Thereafter, the main suspect was apprehended with the support of residents. There was information about crimes committed by the main suspect’s brother on earlier occasions. When a statement was obtained from him he alleged that the crime was committed by the first (main suspect).”
Inspector Wimalasena said since the two statements submitted corroborate which each others, steps were taken to call for a DNA report on the first suspect. He said since the DNA report has not been received, he moved Court to re-remand the first suspect. Inspector Wimalasena said the second suspect was released after recording a statement from him.
“This was a crime against the entire society rather than a single family.” He would therefore expect all parties to perform their duties in a responsible manner. Attorney Asela Rekewa assisted by Dilan N. de Silva and Nivon Gamage watched the interests of the aggrieved party.
As revealed in the Daily News yesterday, Saman Jayalath, the elder brother of Dunesh Priyashantha alias Konadaya had confessed to the murder of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi of Kotadeniyawa, the CID informed courts.
Dunesh Priyashantha alias Konadaya had earlier confessed to the rape and murder of Seya.
However later Priyashantha had told the CID that it was his brother who had committed the crime.
Kondaya had told the CID that he had confessed to the crime as his brother had forced him to do so.
Kondaya has said that he had confessed out of fear for his elder brother.
With the latest revelation of Priyashantha, the CID arrested Jayalath on Saturday. Following the arrest the Court allowed the CID to detain the suspect for 72 hours and interrogate him.
According to the CID, the suspect had entered the house with the intention of raping Seya Sadewmi’s mother whom he barely knew. “When I entered their house that night through an open window, I saw Seya’s mother watching TV. I waited till she switched off the lights,” the suspect had said.
He had confessed to the Police that his intentions changed when he saw five-year- old Seya who was lying in the bed with her mother and other siblings.
Instead of harming her mother, the suspect had kidnapped the child with the intention of raping her. According to his confession, the suspect had carried the girl in his arms and raped her in a paddy field close to her house.
When the girl began to shout, the suspect had strangled her neck with the t-shirt she was wearing,the CID said.
The suspect had admitted that he raped the girl several times, even after strangling her.
Then he had thrown the body of the five-year-old old girl into the jungle.
The suspect, Jayalath gave a two- hour long separate statement to the Magistrate in the latter’s office room last afternoon.
Meanwhile, sources said that there are some discrepancies related to the technical evidence, including medical reports, presented in relation to the case against Priyashantha alias Kondaya.
Police also said Kondaya’s elder brother had described in detail how he had committed the crime.
Earlier Priyashantha too had given details to the CID officers on how he had allegedly committed the crime.
The Police said there are some contradictions in the confessions made by the two brothers.
The Police earlier arrested two other suspects - a 17-year-old school student and a 33-year-old man - in connection with the crime. They were later released after the CID informed courts that their DNA tests did not match the samples with those obtained from Seya’s body.
Meanwhile, the Minuwangoda Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered to conduct a DNA test on the suspects. They were also remanded till October 19.
