The Government has decided to grant bank loans at concessionary rates to ex-LTTE combatants for self-employment purposes, officials said today.

The parliamentary oversight committee of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry has discussed this matter and decided to proceed with the granting of loans at low interest rates to the ex-combatants reintegrated into society after rehabilitation.

“We have to work out the modalities,” an official said.

About 12,000 LTTE combatants surrendered to the military during the final stages of the war and underwent rehabilitation which included the provision of vocational training skills. (Kelum Bandara)
