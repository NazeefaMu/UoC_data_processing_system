Towards new Constitution: Constitutional Assembly to epitomize transparency in Amendment Process

 
The government has called for a Constitutional convention of transparency to review and suggest changes to the Constitution as with its resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly, United National Party [UNP] legislators yesterday told the Daily News.
As pointed out by UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera , the resolution for converting Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly will ensure transparency of the amendment process more than it will under the Standing Orders of the House.
Although some members of the Janatha Vimuthi Peramuna [JVP] have made statements to media that converting Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly was in violation of Standing Orders, they admitted in the party leaders’ meeting that the Constitution can be amended with more transparency under the proposed resolution.
Asked if they have a mandate as a political party to change the Constitution entirely, Perera said they said in unison with President Maithripala Sirisena during the Parliament election, that they will not compromise the unitary state of Sri Lanka , but would look to devolve power meaningfully to find a lasting solution to the national question.
He said they undertook the task of abolishing the Executive Presidency and introducing a new electoral system.
“Having to undergo many changes over the past since 1978, our Constitution is having serious problems. It needs to be strengthened,” he said.
“All legislators may propose amendments to it , the draft of which must be approved by two-third supermajority in Parliament. The draft Constitution must then go to the Supreme Court for its determination,” he explained.
The Court can determine whether those changes to the Constitution are requiring the approval of the people at a referendum.
Perera said the government has clearly stated that it will put the draft Constitution to be approved by the public at a referendum.
We asked Perera about criticism leveled against the government by interested groups in the joint opposition that the government is set to change those clauses in the Chapter two , Article 9 of the Constitution which states:”
The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).”
Perera said, “These were mere speculations hammered out by some frustrated parties out of malice. We will not do anything to injure the position of Buddhism. Nobody has event wanted to do anything of the sort, not even the Tamil National Alliance.”
