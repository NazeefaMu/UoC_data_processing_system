A commemorative ceremony to mark the death anniversary of a onetime prominent Blue party purohita killed in a terrorist bomb attack is due to be held shortly.

 


After organizing the ceremony, the widow of the slain politico, now a Deputy, invited Number One in yahapalanaya to chair this ceremony as the chief guest. 


“Didn’t you invite the other boss?” Number One had asked the lady.


“I couldn’t invite him yet. But I propose to!” she had replied. 


“I have already got several engagements marked for that day…If he is coming, you can invite him to take the chair at the function… Why don’t you give me time to consider?” 


The conversation ended on this indecisive note, they say.
