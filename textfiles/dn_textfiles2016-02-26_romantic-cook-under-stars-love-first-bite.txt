A romantic cook-off under the stars - Love at first bite

Pegasus Reef Wattala hosted “Love at first bite”, a romantic cook for your Valentine competition on February 13. To enter the competition couples had to register via a Facebook selfie competition where 8 lucky couples were short listed to compete in a competition where they had to cook for their Valentine. 
 
The event started with the couples being welcomed at Pegasus Reef Hotel with each lady receiving a red rose. The couples were then treated to a mouthwatering 3 course candle light dinner set at the romantic ambience of The Deck at the Fishery, against the backdrop of the Indian Ocean.
 
Apart from the main competition another Facebook competition was conducted simultaneously at the event where the couple who had the most number of likes was also rewarded. However, not a single couple was truly disappointed as all of them went home with wonderful gifts. 
 
The competition saw the male contestants preparing a seafood dish within a time span of 20 minutes and the dishes were judged according to the creativity, attractiveness, difficulty, cleanliness and last but not least taste. The competition was judged by Pegasus Reef Resident Manager Harsha Jayasinghe, Executive Housekeeper Mala Munasinghe and Head Chef Roshan Jayawickrama. 
The lucky couple Harintha & Kaushalya Fernando won jewelry and a 5 course seafood dinner at the Fishery on the Valentine’s Day while the others won gift vouchers from clothing stores and Pegasus Reef.
