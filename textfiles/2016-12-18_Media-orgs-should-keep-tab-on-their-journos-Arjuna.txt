Minister Arjuna Ranatunga on Saturday said that media organisations in the country should keep a proper tab on their reporters in order to prevent incidents similar to that in Hambantota.

"The media personnel should act in a manner that will not tarnish their image. Such issues will be minimised if the respective media organisations keep a proper tab on their media personnel," Minister Ranatunga told media at the Magampura Harbour in Hambantota.

He also said that a team of Port Authority officials had arrived at the Magampura Port to assess the damage done to the property of the Port during the recent incidents.(Sanath Gamage)
