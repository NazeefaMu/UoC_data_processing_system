The Supreme Court today fixed for November 24 the granting of leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petition filed by ex-president's chief-of-staff Gamini Senarath and the two other FR petitions filed by SLIC's ex-managing director Piyadasa Kudabalage and Samurdhi's ex-commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna

President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with Sugath Caldera and Niran Anketell informed the Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Anil Gooneratne that the petitioner was now in remand and the bail application filed in the Fort Magistrate’s Court and the order on bail is fixed for November 21. Senior State Counsel Suhashi Herath appeared for the respondents.

The petitioners are seeking a Supreme Court order preventing the FCID from arresting them on the magisterial inquiries under the Public Property Act with the case being filed in the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court on charges of misusing Rs.4 billion in government funds.

The petitioners cited Police Chief Pujitha Jayasundara, the FCID Director, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.

According to the report filed in the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012 Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kollupitiya. It was to be constructed by a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC). The Rs.4 billion had been invested in the Hyatt Regency Hotel Project in Hambantota. (S.S.
