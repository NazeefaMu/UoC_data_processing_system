Find Elara’s tomb; do as Dutugemunu said: Douglas


	

Opposition MP Douglas Devananda yesterday urged the Government to trace the real tombstone of King Elara and preserve it.

Raising a question under Standing Orders 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday the MP said the incorrect public opinion on the Dutugemunu -Elara war should be corrected as some misinterpret it as a communal conflict.

“Some put it as a communal conflict, whereas it was a battle to take control of the Anuradhapura Kingdom only,” he said.

“King Dutugemunu never treated Elara as his enemy and ordered people to respect him whenever they went pass his tomb," he added.

Mr. Devananda said Sri Lanka would be disrespecting King Dutugemunu if the government failed to preserve the tomb of Elara and people were not made to pay homage to it as Dutugemunu wished.( Yohan Perera)
