There are two Pohottuwa co-organizers appointed to an electorate in the South and they have gone gung-ho in promoting a loyalist of their’s as the chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha in their area.

 


The party high-ups too have found it difficult to resolve this issue which has put the two co-organizers at loggerheads as both members backed by them have polled an equal number of votes at the recent mini-poll.
