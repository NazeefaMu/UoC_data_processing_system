The Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) officer cadets from US universities partnered with the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University to assist with flood relief activities in Wellampitiya and Kolonnawa -- two of the most affected areas in Colombo.  

This is the first year the cadets traveled to Sri Lanka as part of a world-wide program in which over 1,200 US cadets are participating in various activities in 49 countries to broaden their cultural and regional knowledge.  

In Sri Lanka, the Cadets will help with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, participate in exchanges with Sri Lankan military cadets and practice cross-cultural communication. (Photo courtesy: US Embassy)
