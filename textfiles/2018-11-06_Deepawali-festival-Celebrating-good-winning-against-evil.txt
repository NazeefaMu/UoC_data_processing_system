Hindus celebrate Deepawali (Also known as Diwali) as the day Lord Krishna finally subdued the demon Narakasura. Though this is the belief of Sri Lankan Tamils regarding Diwali, people of Southern India use the occasion to commemorate the conquering of Asura Naraka, a powerful king of Assam. This king is said to have imprisoned thousands of inhabitants and it was Lord Krishna, a deity worshiped in Hinduism, who was finally able to subdue Asura Naraka and free the prisoners.   
There is also a North Indian belief that Deewali is celebrated to honour Lord Sri Rama Chandra, the Seventh Avatar Incarnation of God Vishnu. It is believed that on this day Rama returned to his people after 14 years in exile. It is also said that he won a battle against the demons and King Ravana. People lit lamps in their houses to celebrate his victory over evil (light over darkness).   


The goddess of happiness and good fortune, Lakshmi, also features in the celebrations. It is believed that she roams the earth on this day and enters the house that is pure, clean, and bright.
