AIA boasts the most number of qualifiers for this year’s Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) from Sri Lanka. With a total of 63 qualifiers, comprising 48 wealth planners and 15 bancassurance executives, these highflyers are testament that AIA has the best agency and bancassurance expertise in the country. 


MDRT is internationally recognised as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. Its members are required to generate a certain level of premium, commission and income and demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and exceptional client service. 


These outstanding achievers were personally congratulated by AIA Group Chief Executive and President Mark Tucker, who flew to Sri Lanka for a celebratory luncheon with the qualifiers. This was a fitting acknowledgement of the relentless commitment and highest level of professionalism shown by these advisors who helped AIA become #1 MDRT in Sri Lanka. 


AIA Sri Lanka CEO Shah Rouf said, “Our advisors are known for providing the highest standards of professional service to families and individuals across Sri Lanka and this achievement is a reiteration of just that. We will continue to support their development by offering high-quality training programmes, hiring and retaining top talent and providing the most advanced tools for enhanced efficiency and productivity.”


Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe added, “We are in the business of helping customers close the gaps between what they have and what they will need, be it to protect their families, access the best healthcare or enjoy retirement- this is no easy task and it is truly commendable that our advisors are able to not only positively impact people’s lives but also be recognised as being the best of the best in the country.”


AIA invests heavily in training and in new technologies that place their advisors above industry standards while taking every effort to enhance the customer experience. With a roll out of next generation systems in the pipelines, AIA’s doors are always open to advisors who have what it takes to join the distinguished list of MDRT members and work together with AIA in making a real difference.
