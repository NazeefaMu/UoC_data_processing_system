'Govt's policies will affect country's economy'

The policies initiated by the present government will largely affect the country's economy, former Minister Professor Tissa Vitharana.
Addressing the media at the N.M Perera Centre yesterday, Prof Vitharana said the government has taken measures to obtain external loans which will have a huge impact on the economy.
The government is totally depended on the World Bank and international funds. Those who blamed Chinese projects commenced under the former regime have now sought a loan arrangement with China to construct the first phase of the Colombo -Kandy Expressway," he added.
Responding to the statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the previous government had failed to address resolutions of the UNHRC properly, Professor Vitharana said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not support America and other resolutions which would affect the country.
He said according to the government, it was the mistake the former President had committed. Professor Vitharana said only American supporters are happy with the government's progress.
The progress with regard to the UN report has to be reconsidered. That will affect the political leaders, the Forces and the people, he said.
The interest of loans received by the government is gradually increasing, former Minister Bandula Gunawardene said.
He said for the first time in Sri Lankan history, Treasury Bills increased to Rs. 400 billion.
The price of oil, coal, rice and other items have gone down in the world market. Development programmes have been stopped and no new projects have been introduced by the government. There fore the need for more money has become a complicated issue, he said.
Former Minister Dinesh Gunawardene said they condemn the government's initiative to abolish the concessions given to tea and rubber manufacturers.
The government should grant concessions for tea and rubber smallholders as promised in the election manifesto, MP Janaka Wakkumbura said.
The government has stopped giving concessions provided to tea and rubber smallholders. There is no reasonable price allocated for tea, he said.
Wakkumbura said the authorities need to show concern over the issue as these manufacturers provide a great support to the economy.
Former Minister D.E.W. Gunasekara said Presidential Commission have to be appointed to give a report on the crimes happening in the country.
Officials should be directed to submit the report in six months. Death penalty is not the solution to reduce the increase of crimes, he said.
Gunasekara added that the report should include the suggestions and proposals of religious leaders and diplomats as well.
MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, Democratic Left Front leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara and former Minister G.L Peiris were also present.
