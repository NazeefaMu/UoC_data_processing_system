Featuring the Best of Ramani Fernando Academy

Hair Art 2015 promises to be a glamorous evening of high fashion on December 5 this year. The show will be a platform for the talents of the students graduating this year from the Ramani Fernando Sunsilk Hair & Beauty Academy. Hair Art will also be a gala to celebrate ten years of styling careers in the industry.
"The Academy began with just eight students, but today there are more than 100 students graduating and more than 4000 people have studied at the Academy. The industry is getting more professional," Academy founder and renowned Sri Lankan hair-stylist Ramani Fernando said at a media briefing. The Academy boasts of having trained a student who went on to receive the prestigious City & Guilds' Medal of Excellence, an internationally recognized award for hair and beauty.
Ramani Fernando Training Managing Director Lucky Lenagala added that the Academy focused on 'quality training' and 'raising the bar' every time. Speaking about what this may mean to women and fashion in Sri Lanka Unilever Beauty Nilushi Jayatileke said that there has been growth in the beauty industry in the past two years, fashion and beauty is now taken more seriously, and that "the Sri Lankan woman is transforming."
Hair Art will feature some interesting themes this year: hip-hop street fashion, formal elegant up-do's, and fantasy styling - we were told, by fashion designer and Hair Art choreographer Senaka De Silva. We caught a glimpse of all this at the media briefing, and it was a very creative, interesting presentation. The hip-hop styles were youthful, popping with neon colours, braids and a street-punk appeal complemented by an upbeat soundtrack and enthusiastic, spunky models. Next, for elegant up-do's we saw a bold, dramatic, precariously hair-sprayed up-do on a model who glided gracefully over the catwalk in a long white figure-hugging gown, with make-up in nude and silver tones - altogether, beautiful and ethereal, coupled with ambient music. The last category - fantasy styling - lets students really let loose with their creativity. This edition, the theme for fantasy styling is 'the celestial signs of the zodiac' - as a sample, a model walked out depicting Pisces, with a long fish-tail dress, theatrical make-up and a dramatic silver fish-scale headpiece.
There was a lot of theatre in the presentations by the models and a lot of quality effort put into sculpting the hairstyles - if you're a fashion enthusiast or in fact an artist in any field, Hair Art 2015 will definitely be a show worth waiting for.
