Laugfs LPG Hambantota import, export terminal agreement signed

Laugfs Terminals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Laugfs Gas signed the agreement with China Huanqiu Contracting and Construction Corporation (HQC) for the turnkey EPC construction of Laugfs LPG Terminal, the first and the largest investment in Hambantota port.
Built with an investment of over US$ 80 million, the Laugfs Terminal will be one of the largest LPG import and export terminals in its class in South Asia in terms of storage capacity, and will be the most strategic in terms of its location, having access to serve a population of around half a billion within neighbouring countries.
"This LPG terminal will be a monumental step in our global expansion plans, which we are aggressively pursuing,and will help further strengthen our energy presence across the region," Laugfs Group Chairman W.K.H.Wegapitiya said.
"Hambantota is a strategic location that sits in the middle of the world's largest nautical/shipping routes with over 50% of the world's nautical traffic. It is also in close proximity to some of the largest emerging LPG markets, including India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Eastern and Southern Africa to name but a few.
The Hambantota port provides global industry facilities, has very generous drafts and can facilitate multiple types of LPG ships. These fantastic location-based advantages combined with our expertise as an energy conglomerate, will garner tremendous benefits not just for the industry, but also for our nation," he further remarked.
Laugfs Group Managing Director Thilak De Silva said the terminal will service vessels from small pressurized vessels to VLGCs (Very Large Gas Carriers)."The terminal will be world class, employing the latest state-of-the-art technologies, equipment and systems, with the capability to export, blend and store LPG with an initial capacity of 30,000 mt."
"We have plans to enhance the capacity with an additional 15,000 MT of LPG, which will boost the handling capacity yield easily to over 100,000 MT and beyond," De Silva said.
With the capacity to accept a very wide variety of LPG vessels for import and export of LPG, the terminal offers utmost flexibility to its customers. It will also have the capability to handle local distribution of LPG through LPG road tanker trucks and will further have an onsite LPG bottling facility.
"This state-of-the-art facility will have its own dedicated LPG pipelines from the terminal to the exclusively allocated jetty at the port. One other very important feature is the compliance to global safety, operations and industry standards. It will have its own fire and total safety systems, which will monitor the site automatically around the clock with some of the most advanced fire safety systems installed including own reserve fire water system. Operations are driven through a very advanced pneumatic system to prompt more safety, HQC Chairman Li Yuping said.
