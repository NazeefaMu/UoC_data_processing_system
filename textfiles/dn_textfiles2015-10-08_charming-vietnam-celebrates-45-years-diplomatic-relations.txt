Charming Vietnam celebrates 45 years of Diplomatic Relations

In commemoration of the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and Sri Lanka, the Embassy of Vietnam presented an exciting musical extravaganza entitled “Charming Vietnam” featuring renowned Vietnamese vocalists Ila Van Bac, Thanh Vinh Nguyen and dance performances by Thi Hai Ha Nguyen, Thi Nhat Ha Tran and Thi Anh Ly Nguyen who were specially flown from Vietnam. The event was held at the Bishop’s College Auditorium on Monday October 5.
The programme included choral, solo and duet vocals by popular Vietnamese artistes and a surprise performance by Ambassador Phan Kieu Thu when she sang Nanda Malani’s Ahasa Se Oba Ananthai and several other songs in Vietnamese.
All proceeds of this musical concert will be channeled towards the charity project entitled “Naachchikalliya Housing Project” in Kalpitiya initiated by the Wings of Hope Trust, a community service organization.
The project envisages constructing 60 basic facility houses for residents of Naachikalliya who are currently living in makeshift cajan huts under trying circumstances.
