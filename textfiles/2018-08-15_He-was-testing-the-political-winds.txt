He was testing the political winds!


	



 

History-making order from the highest echelons of yahapalanaya has now gone to those manning the frontline to kick off the crash development programme designed to bring about a revolutionary upsurge in the country’s economy starting from the grassroots level. 

 


However, the departmental heads and the authorities at the district level had to suffer an agonizingly long-wait to receive the million- dollar letter from a top finance authority, authorizing the release of funds for the purpose, they say.


However, this finance authority who ever stays tuned to the developments in the country’s political scene and quite used to the ‘play it safe’ game, had kept artfully dodging the responsibility of inking the important circular letter.


Finally, a lesser mortal at the Ministry was compelled to sign the letter, they say.


Those knowing this episode have begun raising the question as to how this yahapalanaya could bring about any revolutionary change in the country with cowardly backboneless creatures at its helm, they say.
