Preity Zinta all set to get MARRIED in January 2016?

A lot has been discussed about Preity Zinta's impending marriage! While initially everyone was hoping to see her settle down with former lover Ness Wadia. The couple called it quits after a shocking turn of events! But Preity fans need not worry as the the lover girl has yet again found a new man in life! Yes! As per reports, Preity has been dating this American guy named Gene Goodenough since over a year now and is planning to tie the knot in January next year. Can you believe it?
Although Preity is yet to make an official announcement about the same but sources close enough to her to be construed reliable, have told the diarist that in January the actress is slated to fly to the US where she will be tying the knot with her American beau Gene Goodenough, in an intimate wedding ceremony.From what we know, Gene, 30-year old, works as a financial analyst in Los Angeles. As per reports, Preity and Gene met on one of Zinta's trips to the US a few years back. While talking about their secret affair, a source was quoted saying, "He supports, encourages and understands her. Gene gave her company during this year's IPL and she flew back with him to the US after the finals, as he had to return to work,"
However, a source close to Preity had earlier clarified, "Gene is NOT Preity's boyfriend. He is a very good friend. Preity's brother and little niece live in the US and she visits them regularly. She therefore has a lot of very good friends in America."
Now is it really wedding bells for PZ or no? Only time will tell! But until then, keep watching this space for more updates on the story! BollywoodLife
