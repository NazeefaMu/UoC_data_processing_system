The State Ministers have decided to have a meeting during the next parliamentary week, to decide on what action they should take with regard to the non-assignment of subjects to them by their respective Cabinet Ministers, it is learnt.

It is learnt that only President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and International Trade and Strategic Development Minister Malik Samarawickrama have shared their Cabinet responsibilities with their State Ministers through gazette notifications.

The other State Ministers have now decided to take action against their Cabinet Ministers. Initially they intend to complain to the President.

State Minister of Vocational Training and Skills Development Palitha Range Bandara told Daily Mirror that he and his affected colleagues would meet together next week in Parliament.

“We are planning to meet the President and the Prime Minister after that,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
