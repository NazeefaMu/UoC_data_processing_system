Heads to roll at Gentlemen’s Game


	



 

Captain Cool is said to have received an invitation to run for the main chair of the Gentlemen’s game this time round.

 


He has received this invitation from no lesser person than a very high authority in yahapalanaya, they say.


The one already occupying the Game’s main chair now while holding a deputy chair elsewhere is set to enter the fray again. However, most high-ups in yahapalanaya including the Big Two are not happy with his ‘innings’ and they hope that he will step down with grace.


Meanwhile, some interested parties have suggested appointing an interim committee headed by Captain Cool. 


However, a rival group is already set to send a petition to the international body in a bid to preempt such a move.  All present indications point to the possibility of the race for the Game’s main chair turning into a veritable ding-dong battle, they say.
