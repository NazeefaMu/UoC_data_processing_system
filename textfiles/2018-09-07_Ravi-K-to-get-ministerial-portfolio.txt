UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake, who resigned from his ministerial post after coming under scrutiny with regard to the role he allegedly played in the bond scam that came into the open last year, may get a ministerial portfolio once again.

It was reported that the party hierarchy had decided to seek the opinion of the Attorney General on the matter.

A decision was taken by the UNP hierarchy to seek the Attorney General’s opinion on whether a case could be filed against Mr. Karunanayake following a request made by him to the UNP Politburo requesting that justice is done if no court case is to be filed against him.

A member of the UNP Politburo told Daily Mirror that Mr. Karunanayake had also informed them that President Maithripala Sirisena had already told him that he has no objection to him being appointed a minister again.

“The party had decided to see whether there is a possibility of re-appointing Mr. Ravi Karunanayake as a minister following a request made to us by him. We have decided to seek the opinion of the Attorney General on this matter,” a UNP politburo member said. (Yohan Perera and Anjula Maheeka Weeraratne)
