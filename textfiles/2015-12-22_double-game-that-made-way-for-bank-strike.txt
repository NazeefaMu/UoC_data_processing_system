Double game that made way for bank strike


	


Government decided to obtain an injunction from courts against the recent general strike by bank employees and instructed an official of a leading state bank to take steps to obtain the court order.
The bank official did obtain the injunction against the bank union, but too late to prevent the strike. By the time, the injunction order reached the union, they were already on strike.
Many government high ups highly perturbed over the strike, wondered how the union went ahead with it when there was a court order issued against it.  
Inquiries made later revealed that the bank head had initially dragged his feet on paying the court fees for the injunction order saying there were no ‘financial provisions’ for making this payment.   
There was another sensational revelation: the bank bigwig is a consultant to several trade unions including the bank employees union.
By the way, more interesting details about the role played by the bank high up are in the pipeline, they say.
