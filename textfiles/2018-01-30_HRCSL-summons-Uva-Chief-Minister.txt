The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has summoned Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake to report to the Commission on February 1 for an inquiry into the incident where he is alleged to have forced a Tamil girls’ school principal in Badulla, to kneel in his presence.

Meanwhile, the Centre for Human Rights and Research said in a statement that this was the first time the HRCSL had summoned a Chief Minister.

The HRCSL launched an inquiry into the incident based on two complaints made by Centre for Human Rights and Research Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon and the Ceylon Teachers' Union President Joseph Stalin.

Earlier, the HRCSL had summoned the Uva Province educational authorities and the school principal to obtain statements on the incident. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
