Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky yesterday allowed the prosecution to send the CCTV footage relating to the suspicious vehicle that chased Thajudeen's vehicle on the day he was found dead, to the Colombo University for further examination.

Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake informed court the prosecution was in need of getting more clarified details about the unidentified vehicle that had chased Wasim Thajudeen's vehicle.

The Prosecution also said the DNA test report on the recovered 19 femur bone pieces and seven bone pieces of the chest area at the SAITM laboratory by the CID was still pending.

Earlier, the CID and a team of experts searched the SAITM Laboratory based on information revealed during the investigation that the former JMO Ananda Samaraseka had dispatched few body parts of Wasim Thajudeen to the SAITM.

Then the recovered body parts were sent to the 'Genetech' to conduct a DNA test using DNAs of Thajudeen's mother.

Additionally, in line with the earlier court order, the Sri Lanka Medical Council submitted a comprehensive report in court informing the current progress of the inquiry conducted by the council against former chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara on the irregularities reported during the first autopsy of the late Thajudeen.

The prosecution said that the suspects -- former SDIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Perera -- had been charged under Sections 113 (Conspiracy) and 32 (Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention) of the Penal Code, and that according to the provision in Section 13 of the Bail Act, a person who had been charged with an offence punishable with death or with life imprisonment, shall not be released on bail except by a judge of the High Court.

The former SDIG and the former Crimes OIC have also been charged with causing the disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, using it to shield the offender and conspiring under Clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code.

Considering that the suspects had already filed revision bail applications in the High Court, Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky re-remanded the suspects till February 2.(Shehan Chamika Silva)
