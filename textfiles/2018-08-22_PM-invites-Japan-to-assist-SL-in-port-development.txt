Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the visiting Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera that Sri Lanka expected assistance from Japan to develop ports in Sri Lanka.

The Premier expressed these views when the Japanese Minister called on him at Temple Trees Tuesday evening.

He said countries around the Bay of Bengal would achieve a rapid growth in the coming years and that Trincomalee Harbour would become a vital port by then.

Minister Onodera in response said that he expected to visit Trincomalee to get an idea about the area and the port.

During the meeting, the Premier highlighted the importance of signing a defence agreement between Sri Lanka and Japan.

He said Sri Lanka always remained committed to the free Naval movement in the Indian Ocean as highlighted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
