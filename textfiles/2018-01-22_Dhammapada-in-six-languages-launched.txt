Writing the introduction to this beautiful rectangular- shaped book, is Venerable Anuruddha Thera who has mentioned that it had been published with the view of disseminating the authentic message of Buddha to the public.   

The first copy of the book was presented to Chief Incumbent of Sri Sammbuddhaloka Viharaya of Madiwela, Venerable Weligalle Pannaloka Thera by author Ven Anuruddha.   

The Dhammapada is the best known and most widely read text in the Pali Tipitaka is included in the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka. It has been recognized as a world religious classic.

"Composed in the ancient Pali language, this anthology of verses constitutes a perfect collection of the Buddha’s teaching"



Each verse in the Dhammapada was originally spoken by the Buddha in response to a particular episode. Accounts of these, along with exegesis of the verses, are preserved in the classic commentary to the work, compiled by the great scholastic Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa in the fifth century C.E. on the basis or material going back to very ancient times.

The contents of the verses, however, transcend the limited and particular circumstances of their origin, reaching out through the ages to various types of people in all the diverse situations of life. For the simple and unsophisticated the Dhammapada is a sympathetic counsellor; for the intellectually overburdened its clear and direct teachings inspire humility and reflection; for the earnest seeker it is a perennial source of inspiration and practical instruction.

Insights that flashed into the heart of the Buddha have crystallized into these luminous verses of pure wisdom. As profound expressions of practical spirituality, each verse is a guideline to right living.

The Buddha unambiguously pointed out that whoever earnestly practises the teachings found in the Dhammapada will taste the bliss of emancipation.   

Venerable Anuruddha is also the Vice Principal of Sri Siddhartha Maha Vidyalaya, Kalapaluwawa. Copies of this book could be purchased by contacting following numbers – 2792840, 0714 392876
