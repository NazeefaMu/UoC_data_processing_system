The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the government should reveal the MoU signed with a Chinese Company to lease the Hambantota port and claimed that the government was bound to do as it was appointed to uphold good governance not only in political sector but in the economic sector as well.

JHU national organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the government should ensure transparency when entering into agreements and MoUs if not it would lead to suspicions of mega deals just as what happened in the previous regime.

“The government should be transparent when entering any trade or other agreements. But we do not see such move taken by the government. This will arouse suspicions among the people that mega deals were happening under these agreements,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
