The joint opposition today alleged that Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka was directly involved in the awarding of the tender to supply coal for the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant (LCPP) when he was Power and Renewable Energy Minister.

Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said a parliamentary select committee should be appointed to look into the coal tender controversy and take action against those who were responsible.

“The arrangements to award the tender had been made by Minister Ranawaka. But, after the ministries were changed, Ranjitha Siyambalapitiya was draged into the case because he signed and finalized the deal,” he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
