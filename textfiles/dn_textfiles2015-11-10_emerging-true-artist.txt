Emerging as a true artist

Music – the link that connects this world with just a click of an on/play button – connects you not only to the feel of that music but to the person who puts it out as well. So much is expressed in the words, the melody and feel of a song.
One man who is making a sensation in the music hub of Colombo and Australia was dubbed by Daily Mail UK as the “next Justin Timberlake”. Julian Simonsz needs no introduction as Colombo has already chosen him as the Best Male Artist at the recently concluded Yes FM Home Grown awards 2015 and will also hold his first ever solo show in Sri Lanka on February 27, 2016.
Julian wowed the judges (Kylie Minogue, Ricky Martin, Will.I.Am and Joel Madden) at the Voice Australia Season 3 show. All four judges turned as he began to sing and after going from one person to the other he finally chose Will.I.Am to be his coach.
T’nC got together with him during his brief stay to know more about who he is.
“Growing up I was brought up into a very musical family. My grandparents actually met through music…so naturally my uncles, aunties and all my cousins had music around them at all the get togethers naturally. I guess as I decided to further my education I didn’t really go down the music path”, Julian began telling his story.
“Music was something that was always little bit in the background. I was more in Creative Arts so I did a Bachelor of Industrial Designing and I realized later that I really didn’t want to pursue that. Before that I did a little bit of production at home – I bought a basic home studio set up where I would muck around and make beats etc.
Then I found this course – bachelor of Sound Production/Audio Engineering at SAE Melbourne and I realised I wanted t o learn the technical side because I always wanted to become an audio engineer. My main focus in music was the vocals even thought I played a little bit of instruments here and there. In Australia this industry is very tough and expensive – especially if you want it done professionally. I guess it got to a point where two three years I finished the course – I was about to get married and I was 28 at that time – for me I felt like my life was starting to fall into place and I had direction. That was the time I thought ‘it was now or never, I’m going to audition for something’. Throughout the years I was not very confident about myself. I was really shy and it took me years and years to even sing in front of Nelu”.
Voice Australia
“There were 10,000 entries that were allowed and out of that there was a process of narrowing it down until it got to a number where there was couple of auditions in front of the Executive Producers and CAO of Universal Music of Australia. By then they had broken the number into 150 which was the blind audition and was televised. Out of those 150, 9 of them who performed had the chairs turned around by the judges and I was lucky to be one of the 9.
“For years and years I watched the Australian Idol, X Factor and then the Voice and as you watch them you are like “I wish I was on the show”. And finally to be on it and be in front of Will.I.Am and have the opportunity to work with someone so elite – it was an honour to see the man in flesh. I’m still taken back every time I think about it – it’s like a dream. Kylie Minogue is the most adorable person ever.
“Choosing Will.I.Am was done strategically. Even prior to the audition I was like “fingers crossed if anybody turns around – it’s a blessing”. I had to try so hard to not stop singing when they turned around and I was about to like cry. Kylie was the first one to turn around and this changed my whole judgment. Then my mind was going all like ‘what do I do…I want Will.I.Am but she turned first’. Will.I.Am for me was someone I idolize as an entrepreneur and a man of many talents. I wanted to emerge as an artist, I produce music as well and I run two other businesses – I just wanted to learn as much as I could.
“Prior to the voice, I did a couple gigs here and there - and it’s hard to make a name and back then I didn’t have any social media accounts like Facebook etc – I was against all that. A year before the Voice I created my own Youtube channel which gained a good response. This encouraged me more and even to have comments by random people around the world listening to music encouraged me to do the Voice”, Julian adds.
“I had been working on music but I never released that because that was something like years of mucking around. But the show really gave me that push and the platform to emerge as a professional artist. I was actually the first to release my music from the show. As soon as the contracts were done I had already worked on my EP and it was ready to go. I didn’t want to use other people or artists to gain anything.
Wife to manager
Apart from his music life, Julian’s love life has a story too. Nelu and Julian actually knew each other from the time they were 2 or 3 years old. Her family migrated to Australia when she was 2 years old.
“My grandfather got a phone call and was told that there is a family coming over there from Sri Lanka and could you please look after them until they settle in and find their way. We became family friends but then they moved to the other side of the city and we lost touch up until were 15 years old at my grandmother’s funeral. I didn’t even who she was and soon we became best friends for a long time and well the story goes on”.
They went overseas for the first time and they did a Euro Trip. They ended up in Paris on the last day of their Euro Trip.
“I had organized for us to walk our way up to the Eifel Tower and fortunately to set the mood at Midnight – the lights turn off and white sparkles just come and it was perfect timing and was the time to pop the question.
“Nelu always had a thing for event managing. Within the Sri Lankan community in Melbourne she used to host a lot of functions. She was a natural at doing that and she had a passion for it”, he stressed.
The Julian Simonsz band
The Julian Simonz band consists of four guys – Nick, Michael, Gareth and James. It’s a different bunch of boys who are very talented. “I worked with a production company called MSquared and I met the two boys Michael Best and Michael Paynter. Michael Paynter was on Season 2 of the Voice. That production company co-wrote and produced my EP. Michael Best is working under them now but prior to that he was Michael Painter’s best friend. He’s the one who produced two acoustic tracks for me. Michael Best, Gareth and James are in a band while Nick is a master of any instrument.
“Sri Lanka is going to see something special as these boys are incredible”, Julian adds.
So Sri Lanka, I guess you guys need to mark February 27, 2016 as you are definitely going to witness a concert by a musician who will definitely keep on making you ask for “one more”! So save it and be there!
