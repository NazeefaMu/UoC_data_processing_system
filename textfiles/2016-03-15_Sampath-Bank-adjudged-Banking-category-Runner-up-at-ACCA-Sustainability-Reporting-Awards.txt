Sampath Bank, a highflyer in its corporate, social and sustainability efforts, has recently been adjudged Runner-up in the Banking Industry category for the second consecutive year at the prestigious Sustainability Reporting Awards 2015, organised by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Sri Lanka recently at The Kingsbury, Colombo. 


The ACCA Sustainability Reporting Awards intends on assisting organisations in demonstrating corporate integrity and accountability in businesses. Sampath Bank’s continuous commitment towards these goals has proved rewarding in terms of positive recognition and long-term benefits to the company and its communities. 


Since its inception in 2004, ACCA Sri Lanka’s effort to encourage sustainability, which is highly valued by investors seeking assurance that a company shows awareness of its responsibility towards its stakeholders, has been a crucial stepping stone towards emphasizing the need for integrity, governance and socially responsible business practices in Sri Lanka. 


The main judging criteria of the ACCA awards was based on  completeness, credibility and communication, where the purpose of the award would reward, recognize, encourage and raise awareness of responsible corporate entities that create an impact on the environment and society.
Speaking on this achievement, Sampath Bank Chief Operating Officer Nanda Fernando said, “Having been recognized and honoured for the second time, gives us a great sense of pride and is a testament towards our commitment of embracing our people, our planet and our economy. We are committed to stimulating meaningful change to our nation whilst safeguarding the future of the planet, creating tangible value to our people and also ensuring the stability and profitability of our institution through the combination of financial strength and a structured economy. Sampath Bank will continue its responsibilities and embark on a forward journey of value creation that focuses on creating sustainable advantages for all our stakeholders.”  A Sustainability Report is a published report on the social impact, environmental commitment and economic development of a company’s procedures, which orchestrates a link between corporate strategy, governance and commitment, to a sustainable society, environment and economy.  It further raises awareness of corporate transparency issues and increases accountability towards its stakeholders. This enables stakeholder awareness of the organisation’s true value, improves reputation and brand loyalty by emphasizing its combination of long-term profitability with social justice, environmental care and ethical behaviour.
