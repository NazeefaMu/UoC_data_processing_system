AIA Insurance is proud to partner the Everest Expedition as Johann Peiris takes on the world’s tallest mountain. In 2016, Jayanthi and Johann were the first Sri Lankans to undertake the challenge of summiting Everest. But while Jayanthi stood on top of the world, Johann had to make a tough choice and turn around due to technical difficulties – he was just 400 meters away from the top. And now, he is going back to settle some unfinished business!

As Johann starts his journey with renewed commitment, dedication and determination, AIA will stand by him as his life insurance partner. AIA Chief Marketing Officer, Nikhil Advani said “We were rooting for both Johann and Jayanthi reaching the summit in 2016…and were saddened that Johann wasn’t able to make it to the top on his first attempt. We know that Johann’s passion, discipline and preparation will result in the second Sri Lankan standing on the top of the world. We are proud to play a small role in helping Johann achieve his dream.” 

AIA CEO Pankaj Banerjee added, “As a company, AIA is committed to helping Sri Lankans live life to the fullest and in helping them achieve their dreams for themselves and their families. We see Johann’s climb as a reiteration of the importance of never giving up on your goals, no matter how challenging the task. And of course, we see it as a matter of national pride as well, to have a second Sri Lankan climb the world’s highest mountain. Interestingly, AIA’s logo has Mt. Everest on it, making this a very special sponsorship for us!” 

Johann expressed his reassurance at having AIA on-board “I’m going back to Everest because I refuse to give up on my dreams. Over the past two years I’ve built up my courage and strength to go back to Everest to fulfill my dream. It gives me great strength and assurance to have AIA as my life insurance partner as I take on this enormous feat.” 

He added “It means a lot to me to be able to take the Sri Lankan flag back to Everest and have it flying high at the peak of the world once again. It will be an achievement that will make me proud to be Sri Lankan!”
