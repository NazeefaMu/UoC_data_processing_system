While saying that the Central Bank’s former governor Arjuna Mahendran, the mastermind of the bond scam claimed to be the largest financial fraud in Sri Lanka, is still missing, Deputy Leader of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU),Madumadawa Aravinda said today they would complain to the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) about Mr. Mahendran going missing.

He told a news conference that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was connected to Mahendran’s disappearance.

“It was Premier Wickremesinghe who said he would take responsibility for the appointment of Mr. Mahendran who is a citizen of Singapore. How can we further trust the PM when he says he would bring Mr. Mahendran back to Sri Lanka? Everybody wants Mr. Mahendran to arrive in Sri Lanka and prove his innocence or guilt on the controversial Central Bank bond issue. It is questionable as to why the government appointed OMP in haste during the recent unrests period. However, we presume the OMP would consider our case and act efficiently to bring Mr. Mahendran back to Sri Lanka,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
