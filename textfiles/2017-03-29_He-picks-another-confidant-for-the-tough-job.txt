He picks another confidant for the tough job


	



 

The Green leader’s confidant from Matara currently handling foreign matters is strongly tipped to take over the public purse shortly, they say.

 


Many purohitas, Diyawanna members and well-wishers who attended a commemorative pinkama held at his residence the other day had showered him with warm greetings when he admitted that that he had already been offered the challenging job.  He had also emphasized that he agreed to accept the new job as Number Two pressed him, but on his own terms.


One of the conditions he stipulated was that the austere and soft-spoken ex-banker now playing deputy elsewhere be allowed to share his new subject as the State purohita, sources say.

   
Meanwhile, the once Green -now turned- Blue politico from Matara already playing second fiddle to the current holder of the public purse is to be raised to the top team status, they say.
