Fresh from the success of the roll-out of several J Series smartphones, Samsung Sri Lanka has another delight in store for Galaxy fans with the launch of the Samsung Galaxy J6 in Sri Lanka, the first J series smartphone with flagship features such as the Infinity Display and the cool new Chat Over Video feature. The Samsung Galaxy J6 is the latest smartphone to join Samsung’s ’J’line-up and is highly budget-friendly at an affordable price starting from Rs. 36,390. The smartphone has sleek curves and an ergonomic design with elegant style and comfortable grip.
