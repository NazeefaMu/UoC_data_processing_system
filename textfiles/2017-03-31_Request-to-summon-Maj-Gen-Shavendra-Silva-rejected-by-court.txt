The request to summon Major General Shavendra Silva before the Court in connection with the disappearance of former LTTE leader Sinnathurai Sasitharan alias Elilan during the war period was rejected by the Mullaitivu Magistrate M. Samsudeen yesterday.

The request has been made by Elilan’s wife Ananthi Sasitharan during a Habeas Corpus court hearing claiming that 12 individuals including Elilan had gone missing after they surrendered to the security forces.

However, submitting evidence at the Court Major General of Regiment 58 Kalinga Gunawardena stated that he was not aware of such a surrender and it was Major General Silva who was the head of the regiment during that period.

The Magistrate has rejected the request made by Mrs. Sasitharan due to objections raised. (Romesh Madushanka)
