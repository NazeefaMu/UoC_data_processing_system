Their way of combatting ‘Kasippu’


	



Law enforcement authorities in the Puttalam district had warned on time those engaged in manufacturing and selling Kasippu (moonshine) in a far-flung district to suspend their illegal operations until the conclusion of a temperance seminar billed to be held on Monday in Puttalam with the participation of the Big Boss. 

 


As a result, the entire district witnessed a Kasippu-free weekend and many a regular tippler had to turn away from sale joints highly dejected, they say.
