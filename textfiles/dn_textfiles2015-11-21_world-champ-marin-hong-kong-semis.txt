World champ Marin into Hong Kong semis

Hong Kong, Friday: World champion Carolina Marin brushed off Thailand's Porntip Buranaprasertsuk to book her place in the Hong Kong Open semi-finals on Friday.
The Spanish player had her sights firmly set on her sixth big title of the year as she dismissed Porntip 21-12, 21-13 in 42 minutes.
Marin has had a strong year, winning the world title in August and shooting up the rankings to number one after starting the year ranked eighth.
"I am very happy with my performance because last week I lost against Wang Shixian, it wasn't a good game for me," said Marin, referring to the Chinese world number six.
"But I changed my (mindset) because I want to get the title here."
