One leg is still in the other camp!


	



 

The main spokesman for the Group 16, the gabby one from central hills has not so far joined the JO representing Pohottuwa. He and his colleague from Wayamba are said to be still batting for Number One. 

 


However, the man from the central hills has not severed ties with the former strongman either, they say.


This former main spokesman of the rebel group who vanished into foreign parts unknown soon after the group’s formal merger with the JO has now come back home. Soon after his return, he had phoned up the former strongman to assure him that he was with him despite the delay in entering the 
JO ranks. 


The former strongman had then asked him why he was keeping away despite having played the main matchmaker role in the recent past.


The man known for his quick wit had explained that he was keen on joining the JO along with ‘Wayamba Malli’ who was a little bit hesitant and he proposed to cross the floor with ‘Malli’ the moment the latter made up his mind to accompany him.


“It’s a cinch he will make up his mind to take the plunge soon,” he had assured the former strongman, they say.
