Seeking popularity at others’ expense!


	

A group of local politicos had organized a ‘bread and seeni- sambol’ dansala for the huge crowds arriving from all parts of the country to watch a historic Perahera pageant.




However, a prominent politico in the area had got a Grama Niladhari buddy to stick posters all over the city claiming the sole credit for holding the dansala, they say.


The Grama Niladhari who carried out the poster campaign for the politico is said to be serving in a cotton growing area. Earlier he had served in a division of ‘vanniyale-aththo fame’.
