India must support NPC plea for probe into genocide: VCK


	

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) Leader Thol Thirumavalavan on Wednesday urged the Indian Centre to support the resolution passed by the Northern Provincial Council in Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council in March 2015, demanding a thorough probe and report on the genocide of Tamils.
In a statement in Chennai, Thirumavalavan said evidences for the genocide had been given in the resolution which detailed the forced surgeries on women to prevent child birth, forced abortions and massacre of over 140,000 Tamils.
Tamil Nationalist Alliance Chief Minister CV Wigneswaran had said the new government had not taken action to restore the 6,500 acres snatched by Lankan military from Tamils.
According to the New Indian Express, Thirumavalavan has said the new President Maithripala Sirisena was a minister in former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s cabinet, while General Sarath Fonseka, who implemented the genocide had become his military adviser, he said.
In such a situation, the question was whether Tamils would get justice if Sri Lankan government itself conducted the probe, Thirumavalavan said.
Sri Lanka had sought US help to postpone tabling the report at the UN Human Rights Council at the UN session in March 2015.  Sirisena was also trying to get Indian government’s support, the VCK leader said and asserted that the Centre should not help the Lankan government.
The Centre should support the NPC resolution and introduce it in the UN meeting, he added.
The NPC resolution had said “The UN Security Council should refer the situation in Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court for prosecutions based on war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide”.
PMK leader S Ramadoss also made a similar plea urging the Centre to reject requests from Lanka to support its efforts to scuttle the UN probe report.
