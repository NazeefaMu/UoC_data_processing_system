Norochcholai breakdown a result of new shoddy contractor: JVP


	

Stating that the breakdown of the Norochcholai power plant was a result of giving the construction contract to a party which had done a shoddy job, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today said an investigation has to be carried out to determine who was at fault.

JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said it is obvious that the contractor had constructed the plant at a low quality and they had no expertise in the field.

As a result the power plant had broken down on several occassions.

“This government has the responsibility of carrying out an investigation about the matter because they had so much to say about the power plant when they were in the opposition,” Mr. Hearth added. (Yohan Perera)
