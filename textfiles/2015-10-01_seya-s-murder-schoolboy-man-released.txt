The 17-year-old schoolboy and 32-year-old man who were remanded in connection with Seya Sadewmi’s murder were today discharged by the Minuwangoda Magistrate.
They were released by the magistrate as there was no evidence to prove the case.
The CID today informed Court that the DNA samples of the two suspects do not match those recovered from the body of the murder victim Seya Sadewmi. (Tony Karunanayake)WATCH
