President Maithripala Sirisena said today voters had a responsibility to elect only qualified and untainted candidates for the next parliament.
He said legislators who are committed to serving the people while upholding the decorum and dignity of parliament should be the ones who the people should elect at the August 17 general election.
“People should use their intelligence, knowledge and their experience of what happened in the past when casting their vote,” he said when addressing those who had gathered at the BMICH at the launch of the two books authored by Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe.
The President pointed out that the legislators had lost their reputation because they had failed to fulfill their responsibilities on behalf of the ordinary citizens of this country.
He said legislators, state officials and diplomats should always be committed to fulfill the people’s aspirations.
