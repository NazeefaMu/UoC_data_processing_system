The National Organizer of the National Freedom Front (NFF) Piyasiri Wijenayaka said that his party leader Wimal Weerawansa should apologized to the nation over his recent statement that Parliament should be bombed.

Wijenayake, speaking at a media meeting held at his Gampaha residence yesterday (25) said Parliamentarian Weerawansa’s remarks was a serious matter and could be seen as an attempt to incite others to bomb the Sri Lankan Parliament.

He further said that the statement was uncalled for and does not reflect the party’s view and also expressed the parties regret to the 225 members of parliament in this regard.

He assured that the matter would be taken up by the central committee of the party and a decision taken about what action would be taken against the member for this utterance. (Thilakarathna Dissanayaka)
