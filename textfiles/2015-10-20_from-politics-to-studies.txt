This former Ministerial one campaigned with his heart and soul for the victory of the deposed strongman and if the latter had won he was to switch from Education to Finance in the future regime, they say.
Now that his political plans have gone haywire, the senior politico is set to take a holiday from active politics to concentrate on an academic pursuit.  He is to do a research on the vintage Sino-Lanka Rubber-Rice-Pact for his doctoral thesis and he has been awarded a fellowship by China for the purpose, they say.  
On hearing about the senior politico’s latest pursuit, a yahapalanaya Ministerial one with a doctorate quipped: “Many take to politics because they fail in studies. It’s surely news when someone in politics goes back to studies.”
