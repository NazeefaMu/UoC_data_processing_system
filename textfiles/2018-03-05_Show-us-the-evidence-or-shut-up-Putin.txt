‘Show us the evidence, or shut up’: Putin


	



 

   Russia, (Daily Mail), 3 March 2018 -   
Vladimir Putin has claimed there is still no hard evidence that Russian nationals interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that everything put forward so far, including the indictment against 13 of them, amounts to ‘yelling and hollering’.   


He made the comments in a sit-down interview with Megyn Kelly which aired on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt on Friday.   


It was their second meeting - Putin sat down with the former Fox star at the start of her NBC career last year.   


During Friday’s interview, he suggested that the evidence described by in Mueller’s indictment was not proof of interference and not enough for him to take action against the people it accuses.   
‘I have to see first what they’ve done. Give us materials, give us information,’ he said.   


The 13 Russians were charged with an array of crimes but it has never been expected that they would be extradited to face justice.   You must have people with legal degrees 100 percent you do and people who are well educated who must understand that we, Russia, cannot prosecute anyone if they have not violated 
Russian law.   


Putin continued: ‘... you have to understand what it takes is an official request to the general prosecutor of the Russian federation.   


‘Give us a document. Give us an official request.   


‘This has to go through official channels, not through the press or yelling and hollering in the United States Congress.’
