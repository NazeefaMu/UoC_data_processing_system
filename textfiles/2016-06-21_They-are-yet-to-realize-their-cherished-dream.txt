They are yet to realize their cherished dream


	

There are two Diyawanna members who are very unhappy that they have yet to get a chance to enjoy a foreign trip, of course, at public expense. 



 

One of these two ‘cry babies’ is from the Puttalam district and other from Mahanuwara, they say.


“The duo are highly upset that they got no chance to travel abroad at least once whereas some of their colleagues have already made several foreign jaunts,” an informed source said.
