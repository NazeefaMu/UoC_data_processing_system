You want it - got it!

When it comes to women's clothing there are two things that they love wearing the most and basically have more of that than any other piece of clothing. The underwear department of a lady's closet is always full. Today's woman is all about being independent, sexy, being fit and being on the go. And when you are that you don't want wardrobe malfunctions troubling your day.
Taking this and many more into consideration, Amante is now a girl's best friend when it comes to buy that perfect bra, brief, lingerie to spice up life and sportswear for those fitness addicts growing in the country.
A visit to their flagship store at Racecourse made me realize there's more to a woman's intimate clothing than just lingerie. The store has unveiled four new collections and they are already making good sales. Achala Hendavitharana, who is one of the many talented designers for Amante explained to T&C about the new collection and what's going hot hot off the counter.
Active Wear
We first took a look at the Active Wear. Now the Active Wear has introduced the Crossover Cami which is like the upgraded version of a Tank Top and suiting to premium lifestyle fitness. This range caters to a lifestyle of active needs coming in neutral colours. Then there are the shorts which come in 3 quarters and extremely new to the collection. There is also the Cross Back Top, 3 Sports bras - Low, Medium and High Impact - and you can match it with the high-waist shorts that help you push in the ugly bulge that we are struggling to get rid of.
The fabric used for them is breathable fabric and are seamless. These fabric allow all the vapour from your body to absorbed and get rid of all that sweaty and icky feeling.
The MAS Intimate in Biyagama is known to be the one best Seamless factory in South Asia. The reviews for the Active Wear have been positive and with Colombo going on a very healthy spree, ladies love to show those results of the workouts in attire best for fit for it.
Swim Wear
The Swim Wear category has truly thought of every woman's need. It's not about just a bikini and a one piece to suit a medium size lady but it caters to those ladies who feel shy about getting into even a one piece. They have introduced a Skirtini (combo of shorts and bikini bottom), Halter one piece, Tummy controller piece and the Twisted Bandeau. As said before this collection caters to every need and every body type. When speaking to the sales ladies about which piece that goes off the shelf here fast - (I expected the twisted bandeau) - they said the Tummy Controller is a fast sale amongst the ladies. With a personalized service given to each customer they have identified what their customers need.
My personal favourite the Twisted Bandeau - truly does come with a twist. The design is made in two colours and the wearer has the choice of mixing the colours or just going with one colour - in just one twist :).
Panty Wear
Panties - well what can I say about them. Ladies do love to keep upgrading that part of the closet very often. And at Amante, the choices are simply remarkable. There are three silouhette that come in Medi, Thong and Hipster. The French Tanga is new addition and really matched up to the classic French tanga. For a very intimate affair a pick from the champagne rose colours and nude colours will help you spice things up a little after dark.
The Hip Hugger has the mesh back with the side seams a little wider than the normal hipster. And there's also a lot of lace work that has gone to all of them. Who would not love a little bit of lace in their favourite clothing?
Sleep Wear
So from all those above we finally end the talk with Sleep Wear. Two new colours have been introduced to their collection - Maroon and Dark Orchid. Their Night T-shirts are the hot sellers. The weather we have these days makes you want to get into one of those Tees and just wait in bed the whole day with a good book, movie or hot beverage. The night Tees come with matching shorts and trousers that also have the beauty of a little lace work on the waist area and on the buttons of the Tee. All of them come in Small to Extra large sizes.
Amante was launched in 2007 in India and subsequently was launched in Sri Lanka in 2012. The best part of wearing something from amante is that you feel proud that what's been sewn and reaped here is gone worldwide and making its rounds on ramps of the famous fashion cities of the world. Their designs are made to fit any body type. And one thing woman find hard when it comes to shopping, is finding the right size and amante truly caters to everyone's needs.
In addition to the exciting range of lingerie, the amanté boutique offers a collection of exclusive fashion bras and matching briefs in-line with international fashion trends. So to get a more a closer look at these new collections and perhaps to add them to your collection, then head on down to shop GS06, Race Course Mall, Colombo 7.
