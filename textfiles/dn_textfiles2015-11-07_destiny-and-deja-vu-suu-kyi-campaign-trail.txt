Destiny and deja vu for Suu Kyi on campaign trail

MYANMAR: The last time Myanmar held a nationwide election, Aung San Suu Kyi languished under house arrest while her party's landslide win was simply ignored by the country's brutal military rulers.
Twenty-five years later, the democracy champion is free to hit the road, criss-crossing the nation and drawing large, jubilant crowds in an attempt to clinch what observers are hoping will be Myanmar's fairest vote in decades.
For Suu Kyi, the November 8 polls are a watershed moment in a life entwined with the turbulent political struggles of her homeland, shaped by decades of brutal junta rule that only began to ease in 2011.
The daughter of independence hero General Aung San, Suu Kyi, 70, has headed non-violent opposition to the country's military rulers in a three decade role that has come at great personal cost.
Detractors say her reputation as a human rights icon has diminished in recent years as she plunged herself into Myanmar's febrile politics, often choosing hard pragmatism over the idealism of her house arrest years.
But the Nobel Peace Prize winner still commands huge loyalty among supporters of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party and she remains a magnetic force for those wanting to see Myanmar shake off its military past.
- 'Charismatic bonanza' -
But Suu Kyi has been here before and knows well that an election victory does not guarantee power in Myanmar.
Prior to her first stint of house arrest in July 1989, Suu Kyi spent months on a tiring -- and often personally dangerous -- campaign trail.
The NLD's landslide victory the following year was dismissed by a junta that then jailed many of Suu Kyi's allies and kept her confined to her lakeside Yangon home for much of the next two decades.
Myanmar has since morphed from a hermit state into a booming economy open for business since the military ceded power to a quasi-civilian reformist government in 2011. "But two big factors that haven't changed are the charismatic bonanza enjoyed by Aung San Suu Kyi and the enduring grip of the military elite," Nicholas Farrelly, director of the Myanmar Research Centre at the Australian National University, told AFP.
"For many Myanmar voters she is the defining figure of their country's anti-authoritarian struggle. They imagine that the democratic destiny halted in the 1990s is now in reach."
Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945 in Japanese-occupied Rangoon -- now called Yangon -- during the closing stages of World War II.
