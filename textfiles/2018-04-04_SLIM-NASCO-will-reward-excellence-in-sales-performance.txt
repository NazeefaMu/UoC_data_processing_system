The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) announced the launch of the 18th SLIM National Sales Congress 2018, Sri Lanka’s premier award ceremony to recognize and reward the performances of the sales force in the country. Entries are now open for the 2018 awards and SLIM calls on outstanding sales performers around the country to send their entries before 18th May 2018. 

Over the last 17 years, SLIM NASCO has risen to become the pre-eminent awards, which recognizes and rewards the sales forces of companies and industries, across Sri Lanka. As a national level event, SLIM NASCO is unique over the other industry awards in the country, creates motivation, training and learning opportunity and self-development for sales personnel as a core element of its Awards.

“SLIM NASCO Awards have become an essential tool of recognition within the corporate sector in Sri Lanka,” says Pradeep Edward, President of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing. “We want to motivate and raise the bar of the sales profession in Sri Lanka, while attracting talented and passionate young people to this profession. SLIM NASCO 2018 will ensure an experience which goes beyond mere participation in an Award, to a transforming experience where a deep sense of focus and pride in the sales profession will be instilled.”

SLIM NASCO award is the only national-level awards Ceremony where a sales person can be recognised as a champion among the rest of others.

As like every year, SLIM NASCO 2018 offers a training by a team of eminent sales and marketing professionals in the country followed by the gala event. The main objective of SLIM NASCO is to reward and motivate the sales professionals in Sri Lanka, by inspiring them to reach the full potential of themselves, while contributing to the growth of the organization they work for.

This year too, there are 22 industry categories under which the nominations are called for. For the first time, the awards are grouped into five focus areas: Territorial Managers, who are in the management grade of the company; Sales Executives and Sales Supervisors; Front Liners who deal directly with customers and have frontline responsibilities – and three new areas have been introduced for this year which are: Sales Support staff (Executive/Non Executive), who are professionals, not directly involved in selling to customers but support the sales function; Regional Sales Manager (RSM)/ Assistant Sales Manager (ASM) who are responsible for sales in a specific region/s who reports to NSM/SM and Sales Manager (SM)/National Sales Manager (NSM)/General Sales Manager who overlook the entire sales function of the company and responsible for the sales strategy development.
