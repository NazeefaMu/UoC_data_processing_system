Forces had no intention to harm civilians during war - Mahinda S.


The Sri Lankan military forces had no intention to harm civilians during the time of the war, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
"The Army, as a policy, refrained from such activities. But, if there are individual incidents where civilians were affected, they have to be investigated," Samarasinghe said addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday.
The minister said the government would investigate the murder of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga and the disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda.
"Such investigations will restore the international community's faith in the Sri Lankan government," he said.
The minister said President Maithripala Sirisena was widely respected by top international leaders at the lunch hosted by the UN Secretary General.
"The Sri Lankan President sat among the most powerful world leaders and that alone was a honour for the country," Samarasinghe said.
He also commended the role played by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in restoring the international community's faith in the Sri Lankan government.
"Although this is an SLFP press conference, we should not fail to commend the role played by the Prime Minister," the minister said.
