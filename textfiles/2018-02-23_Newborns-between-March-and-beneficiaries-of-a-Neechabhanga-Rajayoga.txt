Newborns between March 3 and 26, beneficiaries of a Neechabhanga Rajayoga


	



 

Venus will enter the zodiacal sign of Pisces at 11.43 hours on March 2 and Mercury too will move into Pisces at 06.56 hours on March 3 to form a Venus – Mercury conjunction in this sign. 

 

How Neechabhanga Rajayoga arises
Venus attains exaltation (Uchcha) in Pisces whereas it is the sign of fall or debilitation (Neecha) for Mercury. According to the Astrological principles, there are several planetary positions that nullify the Neecha status of a planet leading to the rise of powerful Neechabhanga Rajayoga. One of them is the Neecha planet being placed in conjunction with the Uchcha planet in the same sign. Therefore, this is an instance where a planetary conjunction occurs leading to the rise of Neechabhanga Rajayoga. 

 

Favourable effects of Neechabhanga Rajayoga
The Neechabhanga Rajayoga makes the native powerful, wealthy, virtuous and famous. According to ancient seers, one would reap the beneficial effects of Neechabhanga Rajayoga during the combined Dasa periods of the debilitated planet and the lord of the sign that hosts the yoga-generating combination. 

 

Yoga ceases from March 26
The Neechabhanga Rajayoga-producing Venus – Mercury conjunction will end when Venus moves into Aries at 15.47 hours on March 26. This means all children to be born between 06.56 hours on March 3 and 15.47 hours on March 26 this year will become the beneficiaries of this Subha Yoga. 

 

Other yogas and favourable effects in the offing
Those to be born into the 12 Ascendants from Aries to Pisces during the above period in addition to being fortified with the Neechabhanga Rajayoga, will become the beneficiaries of several other yogas or very favourable effects according to the Bhava-positions in their horoscopes. The Subha Yogas or favourable effects resulting from an exalted Venus in Pisces for the 12 Ascendants are as follows:
