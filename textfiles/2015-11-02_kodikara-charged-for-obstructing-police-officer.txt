	The Cinnamon Gardens Police today filled a charge sheet against UPFA western provincial councillor Upali Kodikara at the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court for obstructing a police officer from performing his duty at the BMICH on October 16.
	The Police told the Magistrate that they would process the computer evidence relating to the incident on the next calling date.
	Counsel R.A.P. Ranawaka appearing for Mr. Kodikara requested the Magistrate to remove the restraining order given by the Magistrate preventing Mr. Kodikara from making any statements to the Media about this case because he wished to clarify the wrong news items published in the government newspapers.
	However, the Magistrate refused the counsel's request and extended the restraining order preventing Mr. Kodikara from making any statements to the Media on this particular case.
	Mr. Kodikara was earlier released on bail and allowed to go abroad on a tour organised by WPC members. The case was postponed to January 18. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
