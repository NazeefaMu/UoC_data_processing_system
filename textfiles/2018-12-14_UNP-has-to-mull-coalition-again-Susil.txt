UNP has to mull coalition again: Susil


	

The United National Party (UNP) would have to think of forming a coalition Government if it were to form a Government, UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said.

Addressing a news briefing yesterday, he said that although Ranil Wickremesinghe obtained 117 votes at the Vote on Confidence in Parliament, the UNP had only 103 seats in Parliament, when the TNA votes were deducted.

“If the UNP were to form a Government, it will have to ally with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). However, the TNA had categorically said that it would not join anybody to form a Coalition Government,” MP Premajayantha said.

“When a coalition Government was formed between the UPFA and the UNP in 2015, then the UNP had 106 seats whereas now it is further reduced to 103. It means that it is questionable as to with whom the UNP is going to form a Government,” he added.

Meanwhile, referring to the statement made by Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament in which he said they would further strengthen the powers of the Provincial Councils, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the existing powers in those councils were quite adequate.

“The 13th Amendment to the Constitution made the Provincial Councils strong, which has caused enough damage to the country. Hence, there is no necessity to grant more powers to them,” he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
