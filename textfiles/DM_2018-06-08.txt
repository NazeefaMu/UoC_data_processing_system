A Government that itself is the Opposition
	
  The two parties are playing into the hands of the former President Rajapaksa 
  Presidents outburst seems to be a resurgence of the bickering 
  The President accused monkeys for the price hike of coconuts  
President Maithripala Sirisena has been making startling revelations since lately. He expressed hopes in mid-May that the GDP would rise by about 2 or 3 per cent if the rain continued, while the people living on the banks of several rivers in the country were anxious about a devastating flood.
He said this despite his Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has attributed the countrys current economic recession, after their Local Government Elections defeat to the floods in the Kelani Valley in 2016, among other factors.
Then on May 30, he surprised the entire country including those who toiled to make him the President with a question as to who compiled the 100-Day-Programme on which his entire campaign for the 2015 Presidential Election was based.
He said this in a tone that rejected that programme as an unrealistic strategy.
The President made another statement this week blaming the monkeys for the price hike of coconuts and said that people, who should blame the monkeys, were blaming the Government.
He was explaining how one-third of the crops in the country was being destroyed by monkeys and other wild animals. However, his claims cannot be totally denied by anybody in spite of them sometimes seeming inappropriate and sometimes surprising.
The action against the TNL transmission centre in Polgahawela also might be an extension of the strife
Most baffling among these statements was the one about the famous 100-Day-Programme and the occasion it was made also interesting as it was the 76th Birth Anniversary commemoration of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who laid the ideological foundation for his ascension to the high post of Presidency. It is unlikely that people except for a few of his close associates would have believed what he said about the 100-Day-Programme at the function held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
He said that with only 47 United National Party (UNP) MPs in Parliament, a programme had been prepared in a calendar form to be implemented within 100 days while asserting that the right thing that should have been done was to dissolve Parliament on the very next day after he was sworn in.
He implied that he was not only unaware as to who prepared the 100-Day-Programme and was not in agreement with it during his election campaign. And he at the same time grabbed the credit for certain achievements of the Government under that programme, such as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, pointing out that without the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by him they would not have seen the light of the day.
One can argue that the President was in the dark about the programme when it was prepared as he was deeply involved with his election campaign. The common candidate of the Opposition who had just left the Government and almost the entire SLFP, except for a few MPs and a segment of the party at the grassroots level, was with the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The burden of organising and implementing the common candidates campaign was left to the main party of the Opposition, the UNP.
The burden of organising and implementing the common candidates campaign was left to the main party of the Opposition, the UNP
The UNP might have prepared the programme without the knowledge and consent of their common candidate, but in the belief that there was no reason for him to oppose it.
And it can be further argued that the candidate might have seen the programme and its impracticability in the middle of the campaign, but put up with it since it was not a time for the parties teamed up to oust Rajapaksa to fight each other.
And also the programme was readily accepted by the civil society groups that had joined hands with Mr Sirisena due to its reformist nature.
However, it is unlikely that the people including most of the close associates of the President might have accepted his claim on the programme as he had not shown an iota of a sign of his views on it for the past three and a half years.
And the programme seemed to have had his blessings and the support of the SLFP group that broke away from former President Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership along with him, throughout the 100 days, when some of the 100 points of it were implemented.
The President rightly but by implication argues that it was absurd to put forward such a programme by the UNP at a time when the party had only 47 MPs in Parliament.
He also rightly boasts that it was he who gave the necessary Parliamentary support as the new leader of the SLFP, to give effect to the main items of the 100-Day-Programme such as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution that was passed in Parliament in April 2015 and the Right to Information Bill (RTI).
It is the very support he gave the UNP to pass these legislative pieces in Parliament that now stands against him when he attempts to convince the country that he was sidelined when the 100-Day-Programme was compiled.
On November 21, 2014, the day Maithripala Sirisena announced his candidature at the Presidential Election that was to be held in January 2015, he also declared that he would appoint UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe his Prime Minister once he assumed duties.
He kept that promise. Yet, the question remains as to why he did so, without doing the right thing - dissolving the Parliament.
Did he intend to appoint a Prime Minister without a programme  100-Day-Programme or something else- to be implemented
In fact, had he dissolved Parliament on January 10, 2015 it would have been the right thing as his team, though led by the UNP, would have swept the electorate, since it was a time when they were fresh from an incredible Presidential Election victory, which had demoralized the Rajapaksa camp and there would have at least been a stable Government now.
The Presidents outburst seems to be a resurgence of the bickering between the two main parties that form the Government, the UNP and the SLFP, that has been fluctuating for the past two years.
The action against the TNL transmission centre in Polgahawela also might be an extension of the strife.
The infighting had come to a peak after the humiliating defeat of the UNP and the SLFP at the February 10 Local Government Elections with the President reportedly seeking the opinion of the Attorney General to sack the Prime Minister.
After exploring so many options by both sides, such as instituting a Government by the SLFP with the support of the Joint Opposition and forming a Government by the UNP on its own, both sides had decided recently to put up with each other.
The defeats at the Local Government elections of the two parties in the Government was attributed to the Governments inaction towards the development of the country in general, and immediate welfare measures in particular.
It is clear that with the new wave of fighting the two parties are playing into the hands of the former President Rajapaksa, who recently said that President Sirisena performed the duty of the Opposition.

Afghanistan announces  week-long ceasefire  with Taliban
	

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has announced a week-long ceasefire with the Taliban to coincide with the holiday marking the end of Ramadan. 
Afghanistan today said it was pausing its fight against the Taliban for Eid, the holiday that caps off Ramadan, but operations against other groups including al-Qaeda and Islamic State will continue. 
The ceasefire will last from the 27th of Ramadan until the fifth day of Eid-al-Fitr, President Ashraf Ghani tweeted from an official account, indicating it could run from June 12-19 on the Western calendar. 
It was not immediately clear if the Taliban had agreed to the ceasefire, which would be the first for Eid since the US invasion in 2001. We are checking with our officials regarding the ceasefire announcement, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP. 
The Taliban have steadily expanded their presence in recent years, capturing a number of districts across the country and carrying out near-daily attacks, mainly targeting Afghan security forces. The surprise move comes days after a gathering of Afghanistans top clerics in the capital Kabul called for a ceasefire and issued a fatwa against suicide bombings and attacks. 
The Taliban had denounced the gathering, insisting that its jihad, or holy war, against foreign invaders was justified. 
It instead urged the clerics to side with it against the occupation. 
Ghani said his government supported the clerics call: The government of Afghanistan not only supports the unanimous fatwa announcement by the ulemas (scholars), but also backs the recommended ceasefire, he said in a statement

An embarrassing introduction
	

A former purohita had to suffer much discomfiture when a leading politico made a loaded comment about him while introducing him to a Buddhist prelate at a religious ceremony held in a temple recently, they say.

The leading politico presenting the former purohita to the monk had said: This is. hitapu amathige putha! (former ministers son)  He had always been with me! He is also one among the sixteen who recently crossed over to the opposition from the government!
The former purohita who looked highly embarrassed by the unexpected introductory comment looked on with a sheepish smile, they say.
By the way, this former purohita is said to be set to join the leading politicos political party.

Appoint commission to probe bond issues from 2008 to 2015: Marikkar
	
UNP MP S. M. Marikkar yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint another committee to probe illegal activities pertaining to bond issues from 2008 to 2015.
We urge the President to appoint another commission to probe how loop holes in the law were used to play illegal games through bond issues, MP Marikkar said in Parliament yesterday afternoon.
There is a wrong perception that the bond scam in 2015 was the only robbery that had taken place in this country. Arjun Aloysius had sponsored night races during the last regime while former Central Bank Governor Niward Cabraals sister was a director of Perpetual Treasuries but no one talks about these facts, the MP added.
He said names of those MPs who had accepted cheques from Aloysius should be revealed soon, so that the dignity of MPs who had not accepted money could be safeguarded. (Yohan Perera)

Argentinas  noble goal for sports boycott of Israel
	
A golden boot award for Argentina for displaying moral courage and cancelling its final warm-up match against Israel in Jerusalem ahead of June 16 World Cup in Moscow, in what could be construed as chastisement of Israels criminal policies in Gaza.
Values, morals and sport have secured a victory and a red card was raised at Israel through the cancellation of the game, Palestinian Football Association chairman Jibril Rajoub, said on Wednesday, as peace loving people all over the world rejoiced with Palestinians in celebrating the achievement of this noble goal.
Argentinian striker Lionel Messi and his teammates are the new champions of freedom and anti-colonialism, for they took a stand against injustice. Fellow striker Gonzalo Higuain said the cancellation of the match was the right thing to do.
Some 39 years ago, it was Sri Lanka which attracted world headlines for taking a courageous stand and refusing to play a match against Israel during the 1979 cricket world cup for International Cricket Conferences associate members. The tournament was crucial for Sri Lanka, for victory would ensure entry into to the world cup to compete with full members. Despite the walkover conceded to Israel, Sri Lanka won the associate members tournament and went on to beat India in a tournament shocker, in what could be interpreted as a reward for standing up for justice and morality.
Lionel Messi: Champion of freedom
Those were the days when Sri Lankas foreign policy had a moral content displaying political courage to oppose colonialism or oppression in whatever form or wherever it took place. Insisting that non-alignment should be the theme of Sri Lankas foreign policy, veteran diplomat Jayantha Dhanapala in a newspaper article last week lamented that he saw little evidence of it today when I look at the newspapers and read about foreign policy statements by spokespersons especially with regard to Palestine, the Middle East and tonuclear disarmament.
Coming back to morality: Notwithstanding regular allegations about corruption in sports, Argentina, like Sri Lanka then, has proved that sport is still made of far superior moral fibre than politics. But sadly, the stab in the back comes for the oppressed Palestinians from the Arab world itself. While Argentina cancelled the friendly match in deference to Palestinian suffering, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates sent teams to take part in the first leg of the Giro dItalia cycling race in Israel, in breach of the Arab boycott, in place since 1948.
Razan al-Najjar: Angel of mercy
Morality is in the core of any sport. Sport is rule-based and teaches what is right and wrong. It inculcates values and the virtue of being magnanimous in victory and resilient in defeat. Children are introduced to sports at a tender age. When they take part in pre-school sports meets or play a game of carom or hop-scotch with siblings at home, they learn to play the game according to the rules. No parent or teacher will teach a child how to cheat in a game.
In contrast, politics, in general, is a continuous struggle for power at any cost. There is little or no place formorality in politics.
While immorality is the norm in politics, however, there are exceptions. Yes, politics and sports have come together as an effective mix to fight the wrong. Sri Lankas decision in 1979 not to play the game against Israel was a morally correct political decision. So was Argentinas cancellation of its planned tour to Israel this week.
The high point of this rare blend of moral politics and sports was the 1977 Commonwealth Gleneagles agreement which called for the effective boycott of sporting contacts with South Africa which had adopted the abominable apartheid system upholding the supremacy of the white race. Two years later, Commonwealth leaders meeting in Lusaka adopted a declaration opposing all forms of racism.
These Commonwealth measures, propped up by non-aligned countries principled foreign policies in support of freedom struggles worldwide, contributed in no small measure to end institutionalised racism in South Africa and to enable freedom fighter Nelson Mandela to become the president of the country, though he, like todays Palestinians freedom fighter, carried the oppressor-given label of terrorist.
Like South Africa then, Zionist Israel has been a racist state since its illegal founding in 1948 following a 1947 United Nations resolution adopted at a time when more than two thirds of the worlds countries, mostly Asian and Africa nations, had not become independent or UN members. As recently as Tuesday this week, Israels parliament, Knesset, disqualified a private members bill that called for all citizens to be treated equally, rejecting the argument the state must recognise the rights of its Arab minority  some 20 percent of the population -- as equal to the Jewish majority. Israel treats its Arab citizens as half citizens and practices discriminatory policies, a fact that has been endorsed by the 2004 and 2005 US State Department country reports and Israels own Or Commission report in 2000.
When the Non-Aligned bloc was powerful in world politics in the 1970s, Israel remained a pariah state, condemned for its illegal occupation of Palestinian lands and for continuing the detestable European legacy of colonising the weak, of course with the unstinted support of the United States, which has chosen to ignore morality in its foreign policy.
But with the Non-Aligned Movement losing its clout following the 1991 demise of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union, and with the Arab world embracing Washington, the Palestinians became international orphans, looking up, in a desperate hope for peace, to the US, the very nation which funds, arms and encourages Israel to oppress them with impunity.
If nations had adopted morality as the guiding principle of their foreign policies, the 21-year-old Palestinian medic Razan al-Najjar, the angel of mercy who had saved many lives, would not have been killed by an Israeli sniper last week.
Most Non-Aligned countries are cozying up to the US or have conveniently taken up the position that the peace process set in motion by the 1993 Oslo deal between Israel and the Palestinians should be given a chance. Nay, under pressure from the US, they scaled down their morally correct stand against Israel.
With the peace process now virtually dead or being buried by US President Donald Trumps Zionist-friendly policies such as shifting the US embassy to Jerusalem, the Palestinians only international friends are the global justice activists spread around the world. They have launched the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, calling on peace loving people and all those who condemn injustice and oppression  people with a conscience  to penalise Israel for denying the Palestinian people their freedom.
It is encouraging to know that many sports stars and celebrities are supporting the BDS campaign.
If the peace loving people around the world want to do something for the Palestinians, then they must keep the BDS campaign going. It is time to show the red card to Israel; it is time that the United Nations adopted a resolution calling for the boycott of all forms of sports contacts with Israel until it ends its apartheid system and recognises the Palestinian peoples right to freedom.

Australia to provide $A700,000 for de-mining in SL
	
Australia is to provide renewed support for the humanitarian de-mining efforts in Sri Lanka committing $A700,000 in assistance over the next two years through a partnership with the Mine Action Group (MAG) and Sri Lankan organisation, Devlon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH), the Australian High Commission said today.
It said this new funding would provide vital additional mine clearance capacity in Mannar, Vavuniya and Kilinochchi Districts of the Northern Province and would allow many families to return to their land, re-establish lives and reconstruct critical assets.
Australia has been one of the largest contributors to de-mining efforts in Sri Lanka over the years, contributing $A20 million (around Rs 2 billion) since 2009, it said.
Sri Lanka acceded to the international Mine Ban Treaty in December 2017, with the treaty entering into force for Sri Lanka on June 1 this year. Australia welcomes this important step, which builds on the commitment in Sri Lankas National Mine Action Strategy for the country to be mine impact free by 2020, it added.
It said the news that Australia had renewed support for de-mining in Sri Lanka was announced yesterday in Geneva during the Intersessional Meeting of States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty  the first such meeting attended by Sri Lanka as a State Party.

CNN's Anthony Bourdain dead at 61
	
Anthony Bourdain, a gifted storyteller and writer who took CNN viewers around the world, has died. He was 61.
CNN confirmed Bourdain's death on Friday and said the cause of death was suicide.
"It is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain," the network said in a statement Friday morning. "His love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time."
Bourdain was in France working on an upcoming episode of his award-winning CNN series "Parts Unknown." His close friend Eric Ripert, the French chef, found Bourdain unresponsive in his hotel room Friday morning.
"Tony was an exceptional talent," CNN President Jeff Zucker said in an email to employees. "Tony will be greatly missed not only for his work but also for the passion with which he did it."
Bourdain was a master of his crafts -- first in the kitchen and then in the media. Through his TV shows and books, he explored the human condition and helped audiences think differently about food, travel and themselves. He advocated for marginalized populations and campaigned for safer working conditions for restaurant staffs.
Along the way, he received practically every award the industry has to offer.
In 2013, Peabody Award judges honored Bourdain and "Parts Unknown" for "expanding our palates and horizons in equal measure."
"He's irreverent, honest, curious, never condescending, never obsequious," the judges said. "People open up to him and, in doing so, often reveal more about their hometowns or homelands than a traditional reporter could hope to document."
The Smithsonian once called him "the original rock star" of the culinary world, "the Elvis of bad boy chefs."
In 1999 he wrote a New Yorker article, "Don't Eat Before Reading This," that became a best-selling book in 2000, "Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly.
The book set him on a path to international stardom.
First he hosted "A Cook's Tour" on the Food Network, then moved to "Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations" on the Travel Channel. "No Reservations" was a breakout hit, earning two Emmy Awards and more than a dozen nominations.
In 2013 both Bourdain and CNN took a risk by bringing him to the news network still best known for breaking news and headlines. Bourdain quickly became one of the principal faces of the network and one of the linchpins of the prime time schedule.
Season 11 of "Parts Unknown" premiered on CNN last month.
While accepting the Peabody award in 2013, Bourdain described how he approached his work.
"We ask very simple questions: What makes you happy What do you eat What do you like to cook And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions," he said, "we tend to get some really astonishing answers."
Bourdain's death happened after fashion designer Kate Spade hanged herself in an apparent suicide at her Manhattan apartment on Tuesday.
Suicide is a growing problem in the United States. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a survey Thursday showing suicide rates increased by 25% across the United States over nearly two decades ending in 2016. Twenty-five states experienced a rise in suicides by more than 30%, the government report finds.(CNN)

Dreamless lives
	

Ever since the dawn of time man has been fascinated by dreams and their meaning. In ancient times they were associated with supernatural connotations and often believed to be portals to the spirit realm. Religious texts too are replete with instances of vexed protagonists seeking interpretations of dreams they are plagued with,  la Mahasupina Jathaka of the Tripitaka or Joseph & the Pharaoh of the Bible. In modern times the varying theories offered by researches span scientific disciplines ranging from psychiatry and psychology to neurobiology, but a unified one remains a Gordian knot which is yet to be unravelled. And thus dreams have become inextricably part and parcel of an average human beings life cycle. But what of the ones who are incapable of dreaming Strange as it may sound there exists a condition which renders an individual so. This is known as Charcot- Wilbrand Syndrome. 

During REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the brain mimics activity similar to that of the waking state. Although the eyes remain closed during this stage, they move rapidly in all directions

Charcot-Wilbrand Syndrome, also known as Defective Revisualization or Irreminescence is a disorder which is characterized by a combination of visual agnosia or the inability to perceive visual images and re-visualize them and the overall global cessation of dreaming. In 1883 Jean-Martin Charcot, a French physician-who is famously known as the Father of modern Neurology- was studying a patient claiming to have lost the ability to consciously recall imagery or possessing a dysfunctional minds eye, which may have been due to a formation of a blood clot or thrombus within the posterior cerebral artery. In 1887 Herman Wilbrand a German ophthalmologist encountered an elderly female subject with bilateral posterior cerebral artery thrombosis. This subject displayed a complete inability to dream coupled with an incapability to recognize familiar places, a condition known more recently as topographic agnosia. In addition a condition known currently as prosopagnosia, or the inability to recognize familiar faces was also noted in said patient. These two scientists were the first to record their findings with regard to this condition. 
The causes of this affliction is multifactorial; ranging from acute onset focal brain damage due to hemorrhage, thrombosis, trauma or due to long standing chronic processes affecting the function of the brain such as a tumour growth or diseases such as Alzheimers Syndrome. In individuals experiencing a lack of visual imagery during sleep, lesions of the posterior regions- particularly of the occipital lobe (responsible for visual processing) & temporal region (associated with perception and recognition of auditory stimuli, memory, speech)- of the brain have been conjectured. When one considers the aspect of global dream cessation pertaining to this syndrome the parietal lobe of the brain (connected with perception of stimuli, movement, orientation and language) is suspected.
However in certain instances, lesions involving the area between the occipital and temporal lobes also have displayed dream cessation. This leaves the exact location of the brain responsible for dreams somewhat in doubt. Various modalities of detecting this affliction exist through advancements in science in the modern age. One such modality is a Polysomnography Test (PSG) which assesses & records the biological changes during sleep through concurrent monitoring of the electrical activity of the brain via an Electroencephalogram (EEG), eye movement during sleep via Electrooculography (EOG), heart rhythm (ECG), and muscle activity through Electromyography (EMG).

The breathing pattern becomes increasingly erratic and an increase in heart rate is also seen. The EEG reading resembles that of an EEG in wake time

To better understand how a PSG test works a general idea of the sleep cycle is required. Typically the sleep cycle of a human being consists of five stages. The first four stages fall under non-REM sleep while the fifth and final stage (the deepest phase) is known as REM sleep. During REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the brain mimics activity similar to that of the waking state. Although the eyes remain closed during this stage, they move rapidly in all directions. It is during REM sleep that the most vivid dreams occur.
The breathing pattern becomes increasingly erratic and an increase in heart rate is also seen. The EEG reading resembles that of an EEG in wake time. Skeletal muscle paralysis or atonia accompanies REM sleep and it is theorized that this is an evolutionary precaution hard-wired to protect an individual from injury during sleep. The PSG test compiles a summary in the form of a score utilizing data collected from all these various sources. This test also aids researches in identifying the REM sleep stage and are able to wake the patient mid-REM sleep to ask for dream experience; which in normal patients would enhance their recollection and dream count. The lack thereof can be suggestive of Charcot Wilbrand Syndrome. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is another way which can be used for detection. This assesses brain activity due to alterations in blood flow and oxygenation in response to neural activity. When a particular brain area is more active it consumes more oxygen which results in an increase in blood circulation to that area and the fMRI can utilize this data to create an activation map of the brain. The maintenance of Dream Journals is a simpler and more straightforward method which may be used to detect this condition.

Akin to the ancient shamans of yore who purportedly explored the realm of dreams, modern day scientists continue to seek answers to the phenomenon known as dreams utilizing cutting edge technology and research methodologies. Perhaps in time, we will find the answers to these questions; questions whose answers have eluded us since the dawn of time.

Effects Venus produces in the 12 Bhavas
	
DM Astro 43

The planet of Love and Beauty  Part 3

In 1st Bhava or Lagna: An attractive appearance and a magnetic personalityIn 5th House: attractive children,mostly girlsIn 7th House: a charming wife or adevoted husbandIn 9th House: High office in the stateIn 12th House: Unhappy love affairs

By A. S. Fernando
In the previous two articles, we mainly discussed the results Venus produces in signs.
We propose to discuss in this article the effects Venus produces when he is in each of the 12 Bhavas or Houses.

Attractive appearance
Native born when Venus is in the 1st House or Lagna is attractive and pleasing in appearance. The person is endowed with a magnetic personality. Native in his lifetime would not suffer severe physical pain, loss of wealth or deprivation. If the native is a female, she would be vivacious and skilled in fine arts. Native would be an expert mathematician, artiste or a writer. If Venus is in his own sign or exalted, the good effects would increase manifold.
If a strong Venus occupies the 2nd House, the person would be a poet. If Jupiter conjoins Venus, there would be much wealth and learning. A male native would get a charming wife. The subject would enjoy delicious drinks and sumptuous meals. But if the 2nd House falls in Sagittarius (Dhanu), marriage might not be a success.

Skills in arts anda good home
Venus in the 3rd House bestows skills in arts, affection and regard for brothers and sisters, high recognition in society, a bright intellect and help from neighbors and relatives. Venus in the 3rd also gives enjoyable short journeys.
In the 4th House, Venus gets Digbala. Among the good results to come from Venus in the 4th House are gains due to inheritances, a good home, home comforts, comfortable conveyances, an affectionate mother, success in educational pursuits.

If a strong Venus occupies the 2nd House, the person would be a poet. If Jupiter conjoins Venus, there would be much wealth and learning. A male native would get a charming wife

Attractive children, many daughters
The 5th Bhava is also a good place for Venus. Venus in the 5th gives attractive children, mostly daughters, happiness, affable manners, gains from speculation, knowledge and a sharp intellect. When Venus is in the 5th males are attracted to females and females to males.

Faithful servants
Venus in the 6th is not powerful. Venus in this bestows faithful servants and good health. This position is not favourable for father. If the sign is Libra or Capricorn, Venus produces very good results like elimination of foes and redemption from debts.

A charming wife
Venus being the Karaka of the 7th House at times gives in excess what that House represents. A male would get a charming and persevering wife and a female a devoted husband. Venus also confers popularity, gains from business partnerships, and a happy married life. If in Capricorn, the native may develop extra marital relations and there would be danger to the spouse if in Scorpio and Venus would make the wife barren if associated with Sun in the 7th House.
Venus is the least harmful in the evil 8th House. Venus in the 8th House poses danger to mother, but assures gains from marriage and a peaceful death.

Leaning towards a righteous living
The 9th Bhava is a very favourable place for Venus. Venus in the 9th bestows a high office in the state, an inclination towards a righteous living, love of religion, artistic talents, and travels abroad, pilgrimages. Venus in the 9th is very favourable for father.
The 10th is also a good place for Venus. Venus in the 10th gives a high position in the state, a wife from an affluent family, career success, help from superiors, gains from occupations and general prosperity.

Popularity andmany friends
Venus in the 11th produces very favourable results. Large profits from business, a good pay from occupation, an aptitude for literary work, joy of the company of beautiful women, much popularity, and many friends come from Venus in the 11th.
The 12th House is not a favourable House for Venus, for any planet for that matter. Venus in the 12th portends unhappy love affairs, secret intimacies with women, and an excessive desire for sexual pleasures. A strong Venus in the 12th, say for example in the Libra sign makes the native a popular social worker and he would receive benefits from paternal uncles and aunts.

Election recount, Baghdad bomb, fuel Iraq tensions
	

BAGHDAD REUTERS June 7-- Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr called on his followers on Thursday to remain calm after an explosion killed 18 people in his main stronghold in Baghdad just hours after parliament called for a recount of votes in an election his bloc won. 
Sadr, a nationalist who tapped growing resentment with Iran, scored a surprise victory in the May 12 vote by promising to fight corruption and improve services. He said in a statement that a committee would be formed to investigate the blast, with findings presented to him within three days.  He called for patience and self-control, the statement from his office said.  At least 18 people were killed and more than 90 wounded in Sadr City, a blast the Interior Ministry said was the result of the detonation of an ammunitions cache. 
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in a statement storing ammunition in a residential area was a crime and ordered an investigation into the incident.

EU wants SL to maintain zero tolerance for hate speech
	
The European Union (EU)has encouragedSri Lanka to address issues relating to religious and ethnic hatred and to maintain zero tolerance for hate speech and crimes.
This was stressed by a delegation of the EUat the third meeting of the Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights under the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission which was held in Brussels on Tuesday.
The meeting took place in the context of Sri Lanka being granted better access to the EU for its exports under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) in May 2017.
In a statement, the EU said the Sri Lankan Government has made progress in protecting and enhancing human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country.
A number of important measures have been taken, including the operationalisation of the Office on Missing Persons, the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the passing of the Right to Information Bill, it said.
The Working Group reaffirmed its commitment to promote and protect human rights domestically and globally and to collaborate on the effective implementation of international human rights instruments.
Meanwhile, the EU delegation stressed Sri Lanka the importance of addressing areas of concern, especially torture, violence against women and the need to combat corruption.
The EU drew attention to the importance of Sri Lanka making prompt and concrete progress in fulfilling international commitments on human rights and labour rights as well as environmental protection.
There had beenadetailed exchange of information on many important ongoing reforms, such as the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure Actto bring them in line with international standards, and the status of the Constitution.
The participants agreed on the need to make further progress on reconciliation.
To this end, the full implementation of the UNHRCResolution remains a priority. The EU reiterated its readiness to continue supporting the Government in advancing national reconciliation, the statement said.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group will be reported to the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission to be held later this year in Brussels. The Joint Commission will then assess the progress achieved since the recentmeeting.
The EU delegation was led by Caroline Vinot, Head of Division for Regional Affairs and South Asia of the European External Action Service while the Sri Lankan delegation was led by Shobini Gunasekera, Director-General for European Union, Commonwealth and Multilateral Treaties Division of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

Its the development, stupid
	
The lunacy of chasing behind 2020 Presidential Candidates
	We have to question the greed and selfishness of these urban middle-class political brokers
We have hit the rock bottom and cannot afford to go after odd personalities again
Everything national is everything that is decided as important to Colombo
None of these brought by Colombo middle-class had anything to do with serious issues of the people
Their burden is how he could be slotted in as a candidate for Free Market Economics
What is the most important issue or issues in Sri Lanka today Going by mainstream and peripheral online media, one is the hype over a list of 118 MPs supposed to have received money from Perpetual Treasuries, now speculated to be around 164.
Another is what President Sirisena said about the 100-Day -Programme.
Yet another is the sealing of a transmission tower of TNL on alleged illegal transmissions.
There is yet another that keeps revolving around all these and that is about who the 2020 Presidential Candidates should be. They are all fringe issues of little importance to peoples daily life. What is wholly absent is the discourse on major issues that led to a socio-economic crisis.
This is a country where everything national is everything that is decided as important to Colombo. That too, to the Colombo middle-class.
They are the largest segment in urban life with a surplus income for shopping.
This urban middle-class is politically divided on ethno-religious affiliations showing how primitive they are despite their professional qualifications and exposure to the modern world.
Their hasty search for a Presidential Candidate for the 2020 Presidential Election proves beyond doubt that they are also selfish and greedy for political power with Sinhala Buddhist dominance.
In the absence of Mahinda Rajapaksa for the 2020 Presidential Election, the extremist Sinhala Buddhist sentiments within the Colombo middle-class believe Gotabhaya could fit in well as another Rajapaksa.
Their burden is how he could be slotted in as a candidate for Free Market Economics.
Thus his compassionate preaching about a peaceful society, that can promote investments and market freedom.
Yet, the self-appointed civil society activists representing the moderate and compromising Sinhala Buddhist Colombo middle-class would not want to get thrown out from their jockeying saddle on this Yahapalanaya Government.
Three and a half years gone and they still continue with the Rajapaksa phobia with small talk about Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe being their 2020 Presidential Candidate.
Three and a half years gone and they still continue with the Rajapaksa phobia with small talk about Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe being their 2020 Presidential Candidate
There is also the battered and bruised SLFP, wanting to contest 2020 Presidential Election, not knowing how and with whom. Sadly, all these claims for 2020 Presidency are about individuals; about picking and presenting another presidential candidate to suit the urban middle class. One who they believe could win the Presidential Election and provide them with the governing saddle to continue with this free market economy.
In 1994, Chandrika Bandaranaike who with her popular Sinhala film idol husband Vijaya Kumaratunga broke off from parental SLFP and was thereafter stranded was brought back to the party to replace Sirimavo Bandaranaike as a new face for the Presidency.
After two terms as President that had nothing for the people, she was forced to nominate Mahinda Rajapaksa for the 2005 Presidential Election.
Even her closest cabinet allies like Mangala Samaraweera backed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the most preferred candidate of the Sinhala Buddhist constituency.
In 2010, the same urban middle-class thought Rajapaksa could be ousted by a uniformed war-veteran. But for the ordinary Sinhala Buddhists, it was the ever-smiling Rajapaksa with his maroon shawl, who remained their Sinhala King.
Again in 2015 January, Colombo civil society activism backed by international interests wanted a candidate who could defeat Rajapaksa the dictator.
Thus a single issue Common Candidate emerged as a Sinhala Buddhist.
That Sinhala Buddhist Common candidate Sirisena won in 2015 January, not because the Sinhala Buddhists wanted Rajapaksa defeated, but because the Tamil people who made him president in 2005, wanted him ousted in 2015. So did the Muslim people.
None of these candidates brought by Colombo middle-class activism ever had anything to do with serious issues the people needed answers for.
Their campaigns to choose candidates never had any discourse on major issues that need far-reaching solutions.
None of these candidates brought by Colombo middle-class activism ever had anything to do with serious issues the people needed answers for
Education is a total mess from school curriculums to teaching staff, from horribly competitive exams to university education and academia. Health Services, the medical mafia has turned into a sickening racket has preventive health miserably left out for a thriving private health industry.
So, is unplanned commuter transport with flyovers at a heavy cost to people leaving city traffic at snail pace. Housing is a massive private construction sector that pushes out poor people from the city.
The Plantation sector is left at the mercy of extremely corrupt and rowdy politicians, who exploit the poor labour, election after election.
The State, including law enforcement, the Judiciary and the Public Administration are inefficient, lethargic and corrupt at every level. The war-affected in the North-East is left without answers to their immediate issues and at the mercy of Sinhala Buddhist extremism.
There is no discourse in finding answers to these major issues that had gradually and continually grown within the free market economy and is never challenged by any political party including the JVP.
These are never seriously discussed for answers by the Colombo civil society leaders, including professionals and the academia. Let us remind ourselves, we have been with this free market economy for 40 out of the 70 years, since independence. During these 40 years, beginning with the IRDPs in 1978 from Kurunegala, all district programmes carried out in two phases with foreign donor assistance had been complete failures.
From President R. Premadasas Gam Udava through Foster Parents Scheme for poor rural childrens education, from the 200Garment Factory Programme to the first direct focus poverty alleviation scheme Janasaviya turned Samurdhi under Chandrika Kumaratunga Presidency-everything had flopped on the rural poor. They remain poor within this free market economy, which is essentially city-centric. In short, rural development cannot get rooted in a city-centric free market economy.
It is in such context, this Government is once again promoting the same old free market theory in yet another new dressing  V2025.
It is in such context, Finance Minister Samaraweera believes he could revolutionise the village with his Gam Peraliya.
The irony in all this is the ignorance of urban professionals and the academia, who want to maintain the status quo within this free market economy.
They, therefore, want people to continue believing FDI is what helps development. Yet they fail to say what this society has gained during the past 40 years from trillions of rupees the people had to forego on incentives given to these investors as duty waivers, tax holidays, tax and duty concessions and billions spent on special infrastructure development with electricity
provided free.
Added to all that is the violation of Workers Rights and environmental disasters.
There is no balance sheet on that.
This hazardous free market economy is only a city-based, city-centred market growth and it is so in all countries that tied up with the global free market economy.
It is so even within the mega growth that China is spoken about. During the past four decades after Deng Xiaoping opened the gates, the Chinese political bureaucracy has turned into one of the most corrupt leaderships on earth.
With that corrupt leadership, the Chinese economic growth is limited to urban areas along the South-Eastern coast. There is no discussion about massive poverty in rural China that would question what development is, in a free market economy.
The 2015 Year Book compiled by the National Statistical Bureau of China says the major urban areas like Beijing and Shanghai on the SE coast have an annual per capita income of 48,532 and 48,841 Yuan respectively.
Neighbouring Jiangsu and Zhejiang record an annual per capita income of 34,346 and 40,393 Yuan respectively.
In contrast, rural provinces like Gansu (6,277), Qinghai (7,283), and Xinjiang (8724) far interior in West China, and Guizhou (6,671) and Shaanxi (7,932) in Central China have less than 9,000 Yuan annual per capita incomes.
Meanwhile, a research organisation based in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy in China published their Hurun Report in 2016 that said 153 members of the Chinese National Peoples Congress are worth 650 billion US dollars in terms of wealth acquired.
At an average, it is 4.2 billion US dollars per member. In the US Congress in 2015 the wealth of a Congressman was only 3.5 million US dollars.
Official Chinese reports accept, of the 3,000 members National Peoples Congress 20 per cent are billionaires. On March 1, (2018) the NYT published an article titled Chinas Parliament is a growing billionaires club.
Quoting Victor Shih, an Associate Professor at the California University, San Diego who is an expert on money and politics in China, it said, is a member of the National Peoples Congress affords considerable protection to the wealthy.
Such is growth achieved by the new imperialist giant that is China.
In very comparative terms this degenerating growth that has little to do with decent development, is more or less the same in India and in other countries including ours in Sri Lanka.
We have to ask ourselves is this the development we want
We, therefore, have to question the greed and selfishness of these urban middle-class political brokers.
Those who are promoting handpicked characters for 2020, should be asked how they define development and how different will their economic model be from this free market economy.
We have hit the rock bottom in socio-economic and cultural life and cannot afford to go after odd personalities once again, at another election.
Vote for a stupid, who knows next to nothing about development and major issues people need answers for. It is development and not Presidential candidates we need to discuss.

Lawyer sues cops for stifling his professional rights
	
Claims his rights to represent a female victim was prevented by the Negombo HQI
A lawyer, who visited the Negombo Police Station to represent a female victim, and was allegedly prevented from discharging his duties by a senior police officer, has filed a complaint with the Supreme Court for the violation of his professional rights. 
Having heard the case the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed for the fundamental rights petition filed by counsel Priyalal Sirisena against Woodler Udayakumara the HQI of Negombo Police and Sub Inspector Madushanka Dias. It is alleged that the duo had allegedly violated the lawyers professional rights. 
The petitioner Sirisena, an Attorney-at-Law, had also stated in the petition that he had filed that he was verbally abused by the HQI Woodler at the Negombo Police Station. He was represented by attorney Lakshan Dias at the Supreme Court. 
In his submission Counsel Dias had told the court that the two police officers had violated the rules imposed by the Inspector General of Police to ensure rights of lawyers to make representations at police stations. The counsel further informed the Supreme Court that the two respondent policemen had prevented the lawyer from participating in the police inquiry on two occasions. He had also informed that HQI Woodler had later called the lawyer to his room and verbally abused him.
Its mentioned in the petition that Attorney-at-Law Sirisena had provided legal support to a victim-a lady- who had continuously been abused by her husband, a member of a business family in Negombo. The victim (wife) had left her husband, but was later forcibly taken back by her husband. The victim had managed to escape again and was living in hiding when she sought legal assistance for her protection. Sirisena had filed action at Negombo Magistrates Court and obtained a court order preventing the husband from abusing the wife. However, she had been summoned by the Negombo Police on a complaint lodged by the husband, who was unable to locate the place she was hiding in. At the inquiry the two policemen had allegedly forced the woman to return to the abusive husband.
The counsel further informed the Supreme Court that the two respondent policemen had prevented the lawyer from participating in the police inquiry
When Sirisena informed the policemen that there was a court order against the husband, he had been ordered out of inquiry room. The two police officers have allegedly prevented the lady from receiving legal assistance from her lawyer. After removing the lawyer from inquiry room, HQI Udayakumara Woodler had allegedly made perverse requests from the wife, compelling her to return to her abusive husband and also to embrace him, inside the inquiry room. When Sirisena had objected to the move by the Police to handover the wife to the abusive husband, HQI Woodler had called him into his inquiry room and verbally abused him.
The Police Commission is conducting a separate inquiry into the alleged actions of the twopolice officers. 
Counsel Lakshan Dias further pointed out that the police intervention was made two days after Magistrates order. However the respondent (police officer) has produced the inquiry notes to court, indicating that the inquiry was held before the Magistrates order was issued. The counsel pointed out that this is a fabricated document. The same document had been produced to the PoliceCommission as well. 
The Supreme Court, after hearing submissions of the counsel for the petitioner, granted leave to proceed and fixed a hearing for December 14.

No Knuckles land given to investors: Kiriella
	
Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday rejected allegations that a land belonging to the Knuckles mountain range had been given to investors to carry out various projects.
He told a news conference that there were no projects as mentioned by some and vowed never to allow that land to be adulterated now or in the future.
The minister said the land demarcated for certain development projects were outside the mountain range and obtaining Cabinet approval for such projects was essential.
Eco-friendly agricultural and dairy farm projects have been proposed to be set up outside the Knuckles mountain range. They are only proposals and nothing implemented yet. However, as a ministry, we will not allow the mountain range to be damaged. We have not given any land inside or outside Knuckles to any investor. We wish to invite media personnel and environmentalists who are quick to make allegations to visit the site and check for themselves. Parties who level these allegations should provide us with evidence and later investigate these matters, he said.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) said Minister Kiriella had instructed them not to carry out harmful projects within or outside the area belonging to the range.
I have not signed any document that allows the acquisition of land belonging to the mountain range, he said.
However, the Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform (MONLAR) had claimed that some 21,000 acres of land belonging to the Knuckles mountain range (Dumbara range) had been given to several close associates of ministers to carry out various projects.
MONLAR member and environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara said earlier that these lands which were managed by the State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantation Limited had been given to close associates and relatives of two powerful ministers. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: Nonallergic Rhinitis is common, but overlooked!
## Section: Medicine

Nonallergic Rhinitis is common, but overlooked!
	

Have you ever started sneezing all of a sudden and developed a runny nose on top of that; which worsens your day The issue becomes more frustrating when this happens following your favourite cheese filled Burgher or Honey topped Apple pie and you start wondering why me! 
Patients presenting with these symptoms are most likely suffering from what is called Non-allergic rhinitis. This is a common medical condition with signs and symptoms resembling those of Allergic Rhinitis or Hay fever. This condition develops without any IgE mediated immune mechanism acting against a specific triggering factor. In fact, it doesnt involve the immune system in order to drive a causative mechanism against an allergen (allergy causing agent). 
In order to discuss more on this topic, we thought of having a chat with Dr. Solith Senanayake, Registrar in Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, University of Sri Jayawardanapura. 
All that sneezes are not allergies-that is the first thing to keep in mind says Dr. Senanayake. 
NAR is best defined by the chronic presence of one or more of the four following cardinal symptoms of rhinitis in the absence of a specific etiology (such as an immunologic, infectious, pharmacologic, structural, hormonal, vascular, metabolic or atrophic cause: 

Sneezing 
	Rhinorrhea 
	Nasal congestion 
	Postnasal drainage 
For it to be considered as chronic symptoms the condition should last for over a year. 
How does Non-allergic rhinitis occur
The exact etiology for nonallergic rhinitis is unknown and often confirmed after ruling out other possible allergic conditions and infections. However, car exhaust, cigarette smoke, hair spray, perfume, latex, smog and dust can trigger the particular symptoms in most individuals. Some people may also develop nonallergic rhinitis following weather changes, consuming of hot and spicy food, consuming alcoholic beverages and drugs such as NSAIDS (Ibuprofen), antidepressants etc. 
Even though, Nonallergic rhinitis can affect children and adults. It is more common among the middle-aged and involves symptoms which last longer than usual-may be around the whole year underscored Dr. Senanayake. 
As far as the scientific basis is concerned, there is no clear-cut pathophysiology for non-allergic rhinitis, but several mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain what is happening within the body during the reactions following an exposure to certain substances. 
These include Entopy (local nasal IgE synthesis with negative skin tests), Nocioceptive dysfunction (hyperactive sensory receptors) and autonomic nervous system abnormalities (hypoactive or hyperactive dysfunction of sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves in the nose). Even though these terms sound a bit complex, the basic concept is that there is no involvement of the immune system in nonallergic rhinitis as opposed to allergic rhinitis. 

How would patients present
Patients with this condition will often present with vague features which do not carry any evidence of usual allergic reactions. 
Stuffy nose, runny nose, Post nasal drip, impaired sense of smell, cough and phlegm will be the most common complaints where itching, reddening of eyes and difficulty in breathing may be quite unusual. In addition to these features related to rhinitis one may also complain of systemic symptoms such as body aches, sleep disturbances, memory problems etc. 
However, it is always better to look for any triggering factor or allergen before jumping to the mere conclusion of non-allergic rhinitis because even health care professionals make the diagnosis by excluding the aforementioned, pathology, he said. 
People with this condition would wish to know how they are treated fornonallergic rhinitis. 

Dont be hesitant to seek medical advice
Nonallergic rhinitis might not be a dangerous problem or always affect the quality of ones life like other health issues, but it is always better to identify the issue. By doing this you can avoid any triggering factors, if found which will keep the debilitating symptoms away. 

Treat the cause
Medical interventions for this condition usually depend on the underlying precipitating factors. Your doctor will do certain tests on you and for whom an allergic cause cannot be found by allergy skin testing or serum specific IgE immunoassay (Immunocap/RAST) for environmental aeroallergens are classified as having non-allergic rhinitis. 
For an example, if the triggering factor involves a viral infection, the patient will be advised to bed rest and stay hydrated until the infection resolves spontaneously, which in turn will improve the symptoms of non-allergic rhinitis. 

Avoid triggers
This is a MUST to practise in case you come across any specific cause which is thought to be initiating symptoms related to nonallergic rhinitis. 
For an example, you might need to change your current occupation in an Asbestos factory if you think the symptoms are caused by the recurrent exposure to dust and micro particles. 
If the symptoms are found to be occurring after having a particular medication, it is advisable to seek medical help to find an alternative drug which will not act as any triggering factor.


Symptomatic treatment
Fortunately there are many drugs available to relieve these symptoms which should more or less be handled with care to be on the safe side; specifically with proper guidance of a health care professional. 
 Intranasal steroid sprays- These are most effective if the dominant nasal symptom is congestion, but they have also shown proven benefits for rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching. 

Intranasal antihistamines 
	Oral antihistamines 
	Ipratropium- Helps to decrease the secretions by inhibiting the nasal parasympathetic mucous glands 
	Decongestants 
	Nasal saline irrigation 
Rinsing your throat and nose with salt water and taking antihistamines will reduce the night-time congestion and aid sleep. 
Some individuals might have to take nasal sprays, decongestants or steroid sprays in case of chronic attacks. For example, if symptoms are identified to occur while on airplanes by previous experience, then intranasal steroids or antihistamine sprays should be used before boarding the planeDr. Senanayake said.
When asked why people get affected later the doctor had this to say.
Untreated nonallergic rhinitis can result in complications such as Sinusitis, Eustachian tube dysfunction, Otitis media, nasal polyps, impaired smell (anosmia) and Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. 
Even though, non-allergic rhinitis is not a life threatening condition, it is important to seek timely medical advice in order to go ahead and reduce the negative impact on the quality of life concluded Dr. Senanayake.

Overcoming the  Everest challenge

Islanders Jayanthi and Johann do the unthinkable as they climb to the top of the world with the backing of well-wishers and supporters and a fair share of good luck
Exactly 731 days after duo Johann Peiris and Jayanthi Kuru-Uthumpala put Sri Lanka on the world map of mountaineering by conquering Mount Everest on May 21, 2016, Peiris, like Jayanthi two years ago, summitted the mountain on May 22, 2018, at 5.55 am (Nepal time). He became the second Sri Lankan to accomplish this arduous mountaineering mission, having failed to reach the summit on his first attempt, in 2016, when accompanying Jayanthi, due to problems in his
oxygen tank.
Sharing the Experience
Johann Peiris returned toSri Lanka after the proud achievement on June 01. Sharing his success, he spoke to media representatives at a press briefing. 

Sri Lanka taken to the top of the world - Credit - Facebook
I felt such a sense of deep pride for my country while flying the Sri Lankan flag at the summit. It was an indescribable feeling. My first attempt to summit the Everest was a dream, but on the second attempt, the dream was even bigger. It had to happen this time. I knew what to expect this time because I was in better physical shape and had a clear mind. 
Johann and Jayanthi launched their book Everest, a journey with Jayanthi Kuru - Uthumpala and Johann Peiris on January 29, 2017
It was a clear day without clouds or terrible storms. The weather was just perfect and I summited Everest earlier than planned because of the perfect weather. It was a wise decision to summit the mountain on that particular day. The Sherpas even said a clear day like that hadnt come for years. The view was amazing and I couldnt believe that I had made it until my Sherpa said, This is it, you are there at the summit and there is nothing beyond this. Someone had to tell me that I was on the top of the world. It was such a beautiful view, it was unbelievable. Actually, I cannot express the feeling I had being on the top of the world, he said jubilantly. 
The mountaineering experience this time was quite different from the first attempt since the second was sponsored. Enthusiastic Sri Lankans came forward to fund his journey to the summit and back, contributing 100 rupees for each step with the monies raised through the online campaign Climb Everest with Johann. There are more than 80,000 steps to the peak and each step was funded by well-wishers. 
This achievement wouldnt have been possible, but for the support, I received from all partners in this adventure. Special mention must be made of all those who participated in the Climb Everest with Johann initiative, sponsoring every step I took up the mountain. This victory is yours too. I am hopeful that my achievement will inspire others to dream big, go out and achieve theirs, he said. 
Celebrating the Victory
People thought we were mad at the beginning because we were Sri Lankans coming from the sea level and were rejected again and again. Finding sponsors was hard. We didnt give up and were determined to make it. The total cost was USD 58,600 (LKR 9, 272, 151 - Nine million, two hundred seventy - two thousand, one hundred fifty-one). But collecting funds for the second time was much harder. The total cost was around 70,000 US Dollars. (Rs. 11, 097,800 - Eleven million, ninety-seven thousand, eight hundred rupees) This successful climb would have remained a dream if I wasnt financially supported by the sponsors, especially the Multinational companies. 
When I returned to Sri Lanka in 2016, it was devastating and I said I would never go back. But I always kept saying that its the calling of the mountain; something you cant resist. So I was there for the second time. Ayubo.life came to me saying there is a nice opportunity to go there for the second time, and they came up with this public walk idea. So it happened like that despite me not being ready for it, he noted. 
The Second Attempt
Johann said that the ascend happened in stages and it had taken nearly two months. He had left the island on April 04 and started the climb from the Lukla - Base Camp on April 07. They had climbed another mountain on the way. The climb had lasted for more than two weeks and served as part of the training program, which was used to acclimatize his body to the harsh conditions, up there in high altitude. He was slowly ascending and descending, step by step. We had planned to summit the mountain on May 23, but a change in the weather forced me to reach the top on May 22. 
The mountaineering experience this time was sponsored by enthusiasticSri Lankans
His first attempt to the peak in 2016 with Jayanthi was unsuccessful because he was forced to turn back at 8,400 metres, a mere 448 metres short of the summit. This was due to a shortcoming in the oxygen tank. He would have remained as a frozen landmark at the peak if he had decided to summit. Looking back it was a wise decision to start descending after coming so close of realising his dream. Johanns teammate Jayanthi was also present at the occasion and she joined in to share the experience. 
Actually he is my hero and its this time that my victory was complete. He couldnt make it to the top in 2016, therefore my victory was incomplete. Both of us cried when I descended Everest (In 2016), knowing that we wouldnt be able to reach the place again. He is a positive thinker and later it influenced me as well. Even if there are dreams we need to fulfil, sometimes we dont have that mentalenergy she said. 
Johann said that he had stopped for a while at the same place he had during the first time and remained there for a few minutes. He had done this just to look around and make it sink into him that that this was the place he had stopped when he first did the climb two years ago. He said he really enjoyed every step had taken from there onwards. 
Coaching Youngsters
The informal group Himalayan Foundation Sri Lanka is advising the young and energetic mountaineers in Sri Lanka, who dream to climb mountains outside the country. The group consists of five to seven members, who have done mountaineering outside Sri Lanka, and have been to the Everest Base Camp or gone beyond. We plan to give advice to Sri Lankas younger generation which wishes to take mountain climbing because there is a lot of information which is not correct. Hence we want to make sure that we are sharing our experiences voluntarily. We did several rock climbing training programmes, one in Yakkala and one in Horana, just a week after Johann reached the summit, Jayanthi concluded. 
Challenges
In the first attempt, Johann had seen the death of a fellow mountaineer and this time too, he had thought he wouldnt be able to make it, but said these thoughts shocked him, even if he was doing the climb for the second time.

Johann, a world renowned bridal dresser from Colombo, has had more than one calling in his life. His interest in exploring began with explorations in the Knuckles Mountain range with his father at an early age. This passion then encouraged him to conquer the mountains in Sri Lanka and around the globe. His first exploration was summitting the Thai - Burmese Border in 2005 which was followed by reaching Everest Base Camp (17,590 Ft) in 2010. He also climbed Island Peak (20,305Ft) in 2012 and Mount Kilimanjaro (19,340 Ft) in 2014 apart from his attempt to reach Everest(27,559 Ft) in 2016. 
Success story 
Johann and Jayanthi launched their book Everest, a journey with Jayanthi Kuru - Uthumpala and Johann Peiris on January 29, 2017, in which they share the story of the exhilarating climb to the summit. 
The team J & J - Johann and Jayanthi- are doing research on their next big adventure. Well wishing Sri Lankans and supporters are looking forward to seeing how these two conquer the bigger mountains in the world, together. They say It is not about conquering the mountain, but yourself. The duo have already offered inspiration and become role models to the young Sri Lankans who are dreamingof the unthinkable.

Penalize MPs who took money from Aloysius: JO
	
Joint Opposition MP Shehan Semasinghe yesterday requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take some action to prevent the MPs who had admitted that they have taken money from Perceptual Treasuries Limited (PTL) OwnerArjun Aloysius,from humiliating other MPs.
Two members of Parliament have already said that they have accepted money from Aloysius. Statements made by these MPs could result in public generating a negative perception on other MPs. Therefore we request you to take some action to prevent this, Mr. Semasinghe said.
Joint Opposition MP Ranjith Soysa said MPs who have actually accepted money from the PTLare in an attempt to cover up their misdeed by getting into the camp of those who have not made any deal with Aloysius.
He therefore told the Speaker to reveal the names of those who have transacted with the Perpetual Treasuries Chief.
MP Bandula Gunawardana said important issues in the country are going unnoticed as a result of the Bond issue and with the reports of MPs taking money from Aloysius.
"Government is to introduce a trade policy which is harmful to the nation and the House loses the opportunity of discussing other major issues because of the Bond drama, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Politicians wearing mantles of Saints. Aint it quaint
	
We live in a country where people have short memories, this includes politicians who often suffer from selective amnesia as well
Within the UNP too, those who were once photographed kneeling at the feet of the former ruler
Several promises which were given have been honoured, and in addition we have the Ambulance service which was Minister Harsha de Silvas brainchild, a gift from the government of India
It is unfortunate that some sections of the electronic and print media choose not to mention the tributes but persist in giving maximum publicity to criticism of the PM
There have been a spate of politicians recently marching in as Saints, trying to cover their past sins with a saintly cover, going so far as to court ethnic minority communities who were harassed by them, even in their time of prayer, during their tenure of office. State sponsored violence was the trademark of that time.We live in a country where people have short memories, this includes politicians who often suffer from selective amnesia as well! There were several statements recently which displayed this mentality. Those who were famed for violence in various forms now parade as saints, pointing fingers at the government in power forgetting their own murky pasts, when they were leading segments within the powers that were. Their own record, academic and otherwise, are proof that they know little or nothing of the economy, rule of law or good governance. Then we have the former ruler, shedding crocodile tears about recent murders. How many innocent people were murdered and protestors shot at during his time. He seems to have forgotten the Rathupaswella, Chilaw and Katunayake incidents where people lost their lives after they were shot at by Defence forces, the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge and the disappearance of Pradeep Eknaligoda, whose weeping wife kept going and still goes from pillar to post desperately
trying to get to the bottom of this tragedy. No heed at all was paid to public outrage, or ending the violence which continued unleashed with perpetrators unapprehended. Journalists, rugger
players, so many other innocent people were killed during the past regime. He even refuses to debate with Minister Mangala Samaraweera, one recalls his reluctance to debate when he was invited to do so at the height of his power by Ranil Wickremesinghe. One of the sons, announces that the former ruler as the man responsible for winning the war, will not deign to face a debate. He also chooses to forget the way Sarath Fonseka, once hailed as the best of the best by them, was treated in an inhumane fashion, and thrown into jail. I think his refusal stems from the fact that he is well aware that the two people who challenged him to debate, can outtalk and outwit him, unlike some people who continue to be fooled by him. It is as strange a phenomenon that when some are caught out, in one way or another, their signature tune seems to be. I dont know, I cant remember. We have another famed political jumper who has jumped several times, who did this recently.
Within the UNP too, those who were once photographed kneeling at the feet of the former ruler, when they did a political jump, are now wanting a change in Leadership of the party. They have no right whatsoever to make this demand.They were not with the party during tough times, but only came back when they sensed that the party was on a winning streak, just before the Presidential election. They were not harassed, intimidated nor were they victims of violence as many UNPers, including MPs and Ministers who stuck with the party through thick and thin were, during those years. They should instead go to their electorates, tell the people what this government has achieved and prove their worth. Several promises which were given have been honoured, and in addition we have the Ambulance service which was Minister Harsha de Silvas brainchild, a gift from the government of India. This has saved many lives and been a great boon to people in several areas. We also have freedom of speech to write or say what we want, without fear of white vans, a symbol of the former rule. Of course the government still has much more to do and achieve, promises to keep and more than ever, to bring to book perpetrators of crime and corruption of the previous regime. This has to be given priority. The appointment of Harin Fernando as spokesman and as Head of the publicity machine of the party is a good move as this has clearly been the weakest arm of the party. Harin must get this moving on the road as soon as possible as time is short and memories even shorter! 
The government still has much more to do and achieve, promises to keep and more than ever, to bring to book perpetrators of crime and corruption of the previous regime. This has to be given priority
The Mahanayake of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Chapter The Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavansa Thera recently commended the PMs patience, intelligence and appropriate stance. It is unfortunate that some sections of the electronic and print media choose not to mention the tributes but persist in giving maximum publicity to criticism of the PM. This is hardly unbiased journalism! The PMs example in not raving and ranting against the constant character assassination thrown at him, has always been his forte. He takes all this with the cool, patrician composure that he was born with and turns the other cheek. He has never been in a hurry to gain power, has never tried to throw out leaders by force or undemocratic means and got the leadership of the party at his own pace, in his own time. He was loyal to all previous Leaders. He always did his duty by the party and its previous Leaders with infectious zeal and probing intellect. But the time that we live in today, demands that he has to be tougher, instill more discipline, act decisively and move swiftly against the culprits of the former regime.Inaction on this front is the main criticism thrown at the government. 
The government still has much more to do and achieve, promises to keep and more than ever, to bring to book perpetrators of crime and corruption of the previous regime. This has to be given priority
He is a devout Buddhist and perhaps the words of the Buddha on compassion towards enemies, stressing that ignorance was the cause of human frailties and faults have undoubtedly inspired this attitude. As a Christian, I am also reminded of the words of Jesus Christ on the cross, Father forgive them, they know not what they do!

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today told Parliament that leaders of political parties representing Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) should decide on its members in the said committee, who had allegedly held transactions with Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius.
Speaker Jayasuriya said this in response to MP Shehan Semasinghe, who requested the Speaker to remove members of COPE, who had carried out financial transactions with PTL Chief Aloysius.
We appreciate the efforts you have made to safeguard the dignity of MPs but we request you to remove the COPE members who had received cheques from Aloysius, Mr Semasinghe told Speaker.
Speaker Jayasuriya in response said leaders of political parties whom the COPE members belong to, should decide on it and that he would take it up with those political party leaders on the matter. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Radicalised Stockholm truck attacker jailed for life
	

STOCKHOLM AFP June7, 2018- A Swedish court on Thursday sentenced a radicalised Uzbek asylum seeker to life in prison for terrorism after he mowed down pedestrians with a stolen truck in central Stockholm last year, killing five people. 
The assault, which mirrored other truck attacks in 2016 that left scores dead in France, Germany and the UK, occurred as Sweden grappled with the aftermath of having taken in more migrants per capita than any other country in Europe. 
Arrested hours after the April 7, 2017 attack, Rakhmat Akilov, 40, who swore allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group on the eve of his assault, told the court during his trial that IS members had given him the green light on encrypted chat sites to carry out a suicide attack in the Swedish capital. 
The Stockholm district court convicted Akilov of terrorist crimes for five murders and 119 attempted murders in one of Stockholms busiest
shopping streets.

Semages paintings on exhibition
	
Kalasuri Dr. Jayasiri Semage will hold his solo exhibition of paintings titled Splendour of Art at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery, Colombo 7 from June 15 to 17. The exhibition will be opened for public viewing on 15 June at 5.30p.m. 
Dr. Semage is an internationally renowned Sri Lankan painter who has brought fame and recognition to the country. He was born in Ambalangoda, a town which has produced many artists of repute. He had his primary education at Dharmasoka Vidyalaya in Ambalangoda. He showed signs of being a promising artist even in school. While still being a student he held a solo exhibition of his paintings at the National Art Gallery in Colombo. The exhibition was opened by the former Director of Education S.F. de Silva. The exhibition received rave reviews from the press. After leaving school Semage joined the former Lankadeepa newspaper as an artist. Its Editor O.B. Dhanapala, who realised Semages talents, promoted him as the Chief Artist.

Unlike many other artists, Semage didnt get involved in commercial art. It was mainly because he had built his own identity as a traditional artist due to the influence of Sigiri and Ajantha paintings. In 1974 he went to Malaysia on an invitation that was extended to the Lanka Kala Sangamaya. He held an exhibition of Buddhist paintings. While in Malaysia he received the rare opportunity of painting murals at the Kuala Lumpur Buddhist Temple and the Penang Buddhist Vihara. On his return to the island, Semage was recruited as an artist to the Publicity Division of the Peoples Bank. Thereafter he toured many countries such as Thailand, Sweden, Switzerland,
Singapore, Oman and Nepal and held his solo painting exhibitions. When he held an exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland, one of his paintings titled Rata Rakina Deth (The Hands that feed) was selected to be exhibited permanently at the United Nations Headquarters. This type of rare honour was granted before to eminent painters such as Michael Angelo, Picasso, and Leonardo da Vinci. 
Semages forte is Buddhist paintings. As a result his services have been solicited to adorn Vesak pandols that were put up at the entrance to Temple Trees during the former President R. Premadasas regime. He also put up pandols at Gam Udawa exhibitions. His giant pandol at the Asia Pacific Exhibition held in Fukuoka, Japan attracted a large crowd. He was the only painter selected from Sri Lanka for the task. What is remarkable is that the pandol was exhibited for six months. Later he participated at Expo exhibitions held in many countries. The Sri Lankan pavilion designed by him attracted the attention of the international community. 
Semage has done the murals at the Mangala Vihara in Singapore and Lumbini Temple in Nepal. His murals can also be seen at Sri Bodhirajarama Vihara in Boralesgamuwa and Sri Priyarathanaramaya Temple in Dehiwala. About two years ago Semage exhibited his Buddhist paintings at the Mangala Vihara and the Buddhist Library Hall in Singapore. At present he is getting ready to hold exhibitions in Singapore and Malaysia, two countries where his paintings have received public acclaim.

A female white-collar high-up currently serving on secondment in a division handling matters relating to rights of the people at the august assembly has become a terror to the staff there, they say.

This female often found in an ugly mood would find some reason to harangue the staffers working under her, though it behooves her to conduct herself with some measure of decorum given her status.
This high-up had been seconded for service at this division following an official request that a competent professional be assigned mainly for the purpose of assisting the Diyawanna politicos on legal issues relating to the protection of rights of the people.
This female had reportedly been a headache to those at her original place of work as well, they say.

Social media put on red alert
	
Social media users in the island are once again under pressure with the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) warning that there could be a total ban on the use of social networking websites if they are used irresponsibly. 
The biggest warning came from none other than President Maithripala Sirisena a few days ago when he said that it was disturbing to see comments in social media harming the integrity of families and negatively impacting national security and ethnic harmony. The President had made these comments after declaring open a new court complex in Welisara, on May 31. 
The month of May, among other celebrations, also sets aside a date to take note and underscore the importance of media freedom. Initiated by UNESCO, the third day of May has been set aside for this purpose with the tradition beginning in 1993. Sri Lanka has a growing community of internet users which has now been exposed as having an addiction to the use of social media websites, apart from being prolific viewers ofporn websites. 
But what has driven fear into the Governments top officials is the harm that is being caused through hate speech and mud-slinging at judges and politicians via social media. The President has shaken social media website owners by saying that he is one of the most affected individuals who have been affected by mud slinging in their websites. The chorus that wants social media website users put in their places also includes a disgruntled Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. The Speaker went on to comment in newspapers a few days ago that he was of the opinion that social media were being harnessed to spread hate and mobilise people to cause harm to others.

What is so important for social media websites to follow some guidelines is the fact that they borrow content from mainstream media products such as national newspapers and television. What makes these social media websites look like disruptive monsters is the doors that have opened for users to comment without restrictions and screening. Most website users spill hate on content thats borrowed by mainstream media. 
We saw the damage the social media did during the communal violence that took place in the Kandy District. This led to a social media blackout in the island. The ban was a defeat for social media users because the GoSL labelled themas irresponsible. 
The Sunday Ravaya Newspaper, which recently featured Prof. Cherian George, a campaigner for media freedom, in a recent article, highlighted that all media, including newspapers, had to enhance the belief people have in their content. In the article George also speaks of disgruntled journalists working for mainstream newspapers moving to websites to continue with their careers. George adds that in countries like India, Hong Kong and Thailand wealthy philanthropists fund news websites because they see an importance in the existence of independent media institutes which present the public with balanced, informed news. 
What social media websites lack is this balance. The rapid globalisation of news and websites being backed by modern technology, have made censorship difficult. As a result news banned in one country is easily available in another. One good example for this is the outside world knowing whats happening in China despite the Chinese Government curtailing media usage intheir country. 
In the wake of these threats on social media, its fitting to recall that an Indian author by the name of Madhavi Goradia Divan penned a book titled Facets of Media Law in 2005. The book was launched at a time when social media were gaining immense popularity. But in a review of the book published in Indian magazine Fontline the author is quoted in saying every democracy gets the Government it deserves and every society its media. Sri Lanka cant be an exception.

You cannot focus on anything anymore at work, and its taking its toll on your performance and your sense of well-being. You doze off in front of your computer and during office meetings. And even if you try with all your might to focus on work, you fail. This disaster is most probably a sign of poor concentration. Wandering from one thought to another wont let you concentrate on one specific thing for long. The need to engage in work, that requires higher concentration for longer periods, is impaired by poor concentration. This condition often leads to boredom and drains mental energy, says Dr. Shavindra Dias, Consultant Psychiatrist and Senior Lecturer of the Psychiatry Department, Medical Faculty, University of Peradeniya. 
Concentration problems can occur at any age. Children will perform poorly at school and adults may have extra challenges at work and in their family lives. Concentration problems disrupt your daily life, work and areas connected to society. Therefore learning how to improve concentration is an important and necessary skill. 
Concentration isnt simple as paying attention, but also involves blocking out distractions like irrelevant thoughts and sounds. When the ability to concentrate is at its highest you can work easier, faster and better. Focus and being alert help you achieve your optimal working state. Concentration becomes an issue when you are unable to focus and get your work done. You might find your phone, background noises and your own thoughts getting in the way of working. 
Collins English Dictionary states, the length of time a person can concentrate on something is concentration span. Attention and concentration are crucial factors for creating memories. The concentration span depends on the age of a person. Some people are better at concentrating for longer periods. 
Concentration levels vary depending on the following factors: 

Dedication and interest in the task. 
	Ability to complete a task
	Physical and emotional state
	Supportive environment with fewer distractions

Concentration Span 
Attention and concentration are crucial factors that create memories. The concentration span depends on a persons age. Some people are better in retaining concentration 
Symptoms of Poor concentration
Forgetful 
	Being easily distracted
	Taking a long time to finish a task
	Having a hard time reading 
	Possible causes of concentration problems 
	Poor sleep and rest
	Worry
	Physical pain
	ADHD
	Brain Tumour 
	Fluorosis 
	Hyperthyroidism 
	Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) 
	Electrical Hypersensitivity
	Copper toxicity
	Depression
	Hypoglycaemia 

Attention DeficitTrait (ADT) 
People with ADT are highly distracted and are impatient and wont be engaging in a thing for long. This condition mimics the Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), a genetic neurological condition. Those with ADT find it difficult to stand interruptions and more than 44% of them are self  interruptions. 
These issues slow down performance making you think any task is more difficult than it really is. Anger, fear, impatience, and annoyance make it difficult for you to handle tasks. In such instances you fear that you wont be able to keep up with work demands. This perception sets off a stress response and time urgency, which constrict the brain and drives it into a crisis mode. You start feeling that your survival is at stake when undertaking whatever task. 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 
Lack of concentration can be an illness called ADHD. Inattention and hyperactivity/ impulsivity are the key behaviours of ADHD. Children and adults both have this disorder while children are more hyperactive and its obvious in their pre-school age. Now the world is understanding that children do grow up to be adults while possessing ADHD. People presented with this condition are restricted with regard to paying attention. People with ADHD have more inattention severely, and it occurs more often and is of an interfering nature. The condition reduces the quality of the persons work in office or at school. 
How to overcome concentration problems 
Such people are advised to deal with worries by writing them down.
Constantly worrying about other things while engaged in work disturbs concentration. Thoughts will lead to relationship problems, issues with money and effect your past and future if you let your mind go berserk. If you find you are distracted by worries, note these down and your mind will be free once you do it. Then deal with those problems later. 

One thing at a time
Our brains are designed to handle one thing at a time. Therefore the neurons in our brains are forced to function in a similar capacity for several tasks while multitasking. Researchers have found that we cannot handle more than two or more high cognitive tasks at one time. Even if someone believes they can multitask, what really happens is neurons shifting from one task to other, causing stress and slowing down productivity from 40% to 100%. 

Switch between high and low attention tasks
Take breaks of 15 minutes after concentrating heavily and when you feel tired. Then do some less complicated work before switching back to the serious matter. 
Take breaks
Our minds can focus intensely on tasks for eight hours a day. Therefore, divide your work into one hour long segments with 5  10-minute breaks between tasks. Taking 10 - minute break for an hour, getting up and having a walk, relaxing, stretching, going to the bathroom or having a drink (tea, coffee or water) would help to relax your brain and your focus will be much sharper when you return to work. 
Make a to-do list
Schedule your tasks around your energy levels at the beginning of the day. Do difficult work when you have the highest energy level. Queue those according to the importance and urgency of tasks and do the hardest ones first. 
Listen to music
Listen to instrumental music while working, or when you need to concentrate. Instrumental music (Without words) produces background noise and that can keep your wandering thoughts engaged. Some people are using various apps to retain concentration and ignore distractions by listening to steady, monotonous and undistracting sounds. 
Understand your emotional self
Its the on-off switch for learning and for peak performance. It adds to the quality of your focus. The better you understand yourself and your emotional hot buttons, you will be able to hold yourself in the right emotional state of focus. 
Engagement
You must be interested and motivated to pay close attention. Without attention, it is difficult to concentrate. Usually many of us lose our concentration due to lack of interest in what we do. 
Practise Mindfulness 
Meditation can help improve attention, reduce stress levels, anxiety and depression. Mindfulness helps your thoughts to focus on a single idea, which is why it is great for improving concentration. Try meditation at least 10  20 minutes a day. 

Medications that help
When lack of concentration becomes a disturbance there are medications that help. These can be taken regardless of age. Not being able to concentrate on for longer hours during exams also contributes to failure. This is because some students arent good at concentrating for several hours. Certain drugs are used in treating attention deficiency , but only a specialist can prescribe those medications. Increasing study hours day by day helps students who have
concentration problems.

Tendulkar's son to play against Sri Lanka
	
Arjun Tendulkar, son of the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, was named in the India under-19 squad thatll tour Sri Lanka next month. India are due to play two four-day and five one-day matches against the island nation. However, Arjun has only been picked to feature in the two four-day ties.
Delhis Anuj Rawat will lead the side in the four-day format while Aryan Juyal has been named skipper for the limited-overs ties. Arjun, who is 18 years old, was part of the under-19 camp held in Dharamsala last week. Unlike his father, Arjun falls more in the bracket of a bowling all-rounder. He had taken a four-for and slammed a 27-ball 48 earlier this year while participating in the Spirit of Cricket Global Challenge in Australia.
Arjun has also represented Mumbai in the under-14 and under-16 formats. In the Cooch Behar Trophy last season, Arjun had played in five of the six games and taken 18 wickets in the tournament, including two five-fors and a four-wicket haul. He, however, had a poor return with the bat, scoring just 94 runs in five innings at an average of 18.80.
Arjun is one of the most-followed junior cricketers owing to his fathers stature, which also attracts extra scrutiny and dealing with massive amounts of pressure. Ever since his teenage days, comparisons have been drawn between the father-son duo which had even prompted the former Indian skipper to step in and urge his son to be left alone.
Last year, Arjun was seen bowling at the India nets during the home series against New Zealand in Mumbai while a toe-crushing yorker that he sent down to Jonny Bairstow in the nets in England, had left the latter with an injury scare. However, hes yet to make a mark of his own and would want to use the under-19 opportunity to good use.
Earlier this year, Arjun had opted out of the Mumbai T20 league since he wanted to remodel his bowling action which he felt wasnt ready for competitive tournaments. According to several reports, his father, who was also the brand ambassador of the league, was learnt to have guided him to take the decision.(Hindustan Times)

The gimmick has backfired on her
	

A prominent purohita grooming his daughter to be a party candidate at the upcoming provincial polls had arranged for her to launch a concessionary bank credit scheme for the people in the area as a vote- winning gimmick.

The people had happily obtained the loans under this credit scheme thinking it was a godsend, but they have now begun slamming the politicos daughter finding that that they are compelled to pay relatively a high monthly interest on the loan they eagerly obtained, they say.
Some of those who have fallen into this credit trap are reportedly openly vowing not to vote for the politicos daughter, come the provincial polls.

Towards a nation of singers and taxi drivers
	
If we dont embolden the blue collar worker enough, we will get a nation of engineers who know, who can and will quote statistics, but who cant get the job done
Economic imperatives are aligned with the gig economy
We want to educate our children into careers that empower a brain drain which, if left unchecked, may take away or push out more than 25% of the population
A friend of mine pointed out not too long ago that nearly every Sri Lankan parent wants his or her child to be a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer, an accountant, etc. This friend, who was clearly incensed by it, contended that if everyone wanted to become a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer, or an accountant, No one would want to acquire the skills necessary to repair a leak in their homes, or on a wider scale, the skills necessary to get rid of garbage dump collapses and other issues which clearly need hands-on expertise that paper qualifications and white collar professions do not pass on. The gist of the argument was the same argument I pointed out weeks ago in this paper: if we dont embolden the blue collar worker enough, all we will get is a nation of engineers who know, who can and will quote statistics, but who cant get the job done. Its like identifying where a transmission line has tripped and gone off, but without the necessary fleet of workers and inspectors who know how to get up and fix that line.
However, this friend was bothered less about the divide between blue collar and white collar than the (even more) perennial and fundamentalist divide between those who take to professional fields and secure jobs at the cost of those career options which are seen at the fringe and are hence not favoured as much. Chekhov wrote beautifully, there is evidence to suggest that his encounters at Sakhalin Island, traumatic as they were, helped him perfect his prose. Is there any reason to suggest that he would have been better if he remained a doctor, without taking to literature he characteristically quizzed me. Of course, I was stumped, in particular because some of the worlds greatest and most loved writers, like Bulgakov, Somerset Maugham, and the immortal John Keats, dabbled in, if not took to, the field of medicine. If doctors learned to read and write, if they could versify, the world would be a better place, a teacher of mine, reflecting on how compartmentalised weve become, put to me one day.
Sri Lanka has always faced a higher education problem. Of those who qualify for entrance to a local university, only very few actually get in. To top it all, a rigid arithmetic formula designed to address inter-regional disparities ends up preventing candidates living in privileged areas from making it beyond their A Levels. One student I know, from a Colombo school, had to sit for his A Levels thrice. On all three occasions he had received exceptional marks (three As, to be specific), but because he was from Colombo, and because he had studied in the Science stream (heads up the most difficult stream to get through in the local syllabus), he had to perform more exceptionally than students from less privileged areas who had got in with two Bs and one C. One could call this a tragedy, a necessity, or a twist of fate and karma. I prefer to see it as a consequence of the way we look at education, and the problems attendant on what we privilege and what we think our children and students should become.
I know and know of students who say they regret choosing Science for their A Levels. I know and know of students who, after trying Science out for one or two years, feel so famished that they switch to a subject which tests their so-called right brain (Art, Media, Geography, History, Economics). All this is part of a tragic roundelay: we want our children to become doctors and engineers, forgetting that medicine and engineering are two fields in Sri Lanka which, paradoxically, push their practitioners to leave their country in search of better prospects, and greener pastures, elsewhere. We want to educate our children into careers that empower a brain drain which, if left unchecked, may take away or push out more than 25% of the population (that is, the percentage of the young, between the ages of 18 and 25, resident) in the future. This is a risk we are taking with the young, and the irony is that only a small proportion of those who pass out from their A Levels, and qualify for entrance into a university, actually go beyond what theyve done. If there is a bottleneck somewhere, there must be a solution somewhere. The solution, as always, is to look for alternatives.
Thats where alternative career options come into play. Take any school, particularly from the more affluent suburbs within Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, and chances are that the number of those doing Science for their A Levels vastly outstrips that of those who do Maths, Commerce, and the Arts (and in that order). In the early days, being a doctor or a lawyer was seen as a status symbol in a context where a village, or an entire region, boasted of only one or two practitioners in those fields. Now, with the democratisation of knowledge and the drive away from specialisation (ironically, the gig economy, or the economy of Uber and PickMe, has enabled people to work with multiple jobs, two, sometimes three, and very often within the same day), along with the wave of protests and notoriety which have greeted doctors (over SAITM) and engineers (particularly over those at the Electricity Board and their ambivalent preference for coal over renewable energy), people, particularly young people, who have been encouraged to pursue other options, are pursuing them well enough. They are not rich mansion owners by any stretch of the imagination, but they are doing much better than those who labour on to be practitioners of the more renowned professions. Clearly, economic imperatives are aligned with the gig economy.

Being productive means working at a job that you are happy with, so happy that it translates at the end of the day to more work, more output, and a better deal for both the consumer and the producer

There are those who suggest that the gig economy works well in countries where productive sectors are declining. While true, this rakes up the inevitable question, What is productive and what is not productive Sound engineering, advertising agencies, and of course taxi cab services, are for me the definitive sectors of the gig economy. (Sound engineers can be part time lecturers or musicians, copywriters at advertising agencies are now increasingly being recruited as part timers or freelancers, while taxicab services, whether multinational or localised, are thriving in Sri Lanka through drivers who work at night and work during the day in other, more respectable and formal occupations.) It took a great many months and years for the gig economy to catch up with Sri Lanka, or rather for Sri Lanka to catch up with it, but chances are that once weve caught on fully with it, it will be here to stay for a long, long time. Which brings me back to that question I posed before: What is productive
To me, being productive means working at a job that you are happy with, so happy that it translates at the end of the day to more work, more output, and a better deal for both the consumer and the producer. Medicine is a productive field if its practitioners fall fairly and squarely into this definition. If they do not fall into it, they start looking for greener pastures, and once they embark on their search, their quest, this inevitably leads them elsewhere. If productivity is to flourish, thus, theres no harm in carving paths in other jobs and other areas, especially the arts, where the very definition of a good job done is to come up with a work that satisfies its client. Contemporary society has found a way of compounding art and commerce; the necessities of the one are those of the other, and through advertising, artists have discovered a niche. Of course, one can argue that for every successful music entrepreneur, there will be a dozen others who will fail and flounder. But thats how creative industries operate: a grand phenomenon built on the failures and flaws of its predecessors and its past.
I have never understood this obsession over driving children into respected fields parents prefer nowadays and chances are I never will. While they have justifiable reasons, the statistics and the trajectory of those sad statistics into the future do not justify those preferences for science, engineering, accountancy, and law over the arts, economics, history, media, and geography. After all, if this were a nation of scientists and engineers only, and if those scientists and engineers didnt know a thing about how other fields operate, we wouldnt have much to pin our hopes on, with respect to the future of the country or the future of those who take to science and engineering.

Will donate Aloysius money to charity: Sujeewa
	
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe, who was accused of receiving monies from the W.M. Mendis Company affiliated to the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. (PTL) said today that he would donate the three million rupees his campaign team had obtained to social welfare if Speaker Karu Jayasuriya or a Chief Prelate asked him to do so.
He said that he would resign as MP if any one could prove that he personally received funds from the PTL.
Addressing a press conference at his residence in Colombo MP Senasinghe said although what happened was irreversible he would do the right thing to ethically correct the fault.
It was like having a heart attack. When I first heard of these cheques I was shocked for several minutes. Then I realised that had to face it. I did politics with Principals and I know that I have not conducted anything illegal. I will do politics until people support me and will leave when they stop, he said.
MP Senasinghe stated that the incident was a small tsunami, which struck him in his political career and was not used to such allegations, therefore he felt like he was entering into actual politics.
He also said according to the dates of the cheques it was clear that the money was supposed to have been received for the 2015 General Election.
MP Senasinghe explained that it was his crew consisting of several friends who have voluntarily conducted the election campaign for him, received the funds.
He said in 2015, there was no information that the Mendis & Company Limited were attached to Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL).
Not even my friends knew about the connection, he said.
If I knew this I would never let my campaign team receive the money as Im not ready to put mud on me or my team by receiving Rs. 3 million for a campaign that costs Rs. 30 to 35 million, he said.
He also said that he was labelled as Footnote Gang for revealing Bond Scam damage, however; he and MP Ajith Perera were the only MPS to raise their voice in Parliament to take legal action against the Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) while other Parliamentarians were just shouting holding the Central Bank Governor responsible.
MP Senasinghe added that he maintained a fund of Rs 10.1 million for women at present as a social work and therefore had no need for money from any controversial company. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
