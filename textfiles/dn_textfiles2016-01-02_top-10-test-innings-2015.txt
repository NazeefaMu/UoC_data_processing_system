Top 10 TEST INNINGS of 2015

Kane Williamson - 242* v Sri Lanka, Wellington

The year started on a remarkable note for Williamson, New Zealand's rock-solid No 3, and that innings set in motion a successful 2015. The situation was thus: New Zealand faced a deficit of 135 when their second innings began, and were 75/1 when Williamson - who top-scored with 69 on day one - came out to bat. Wickets fell, but Williamson was unmoved. At 159/5 the lead was just 24, when out walked BJ Watling. What followed was a world record sixth-wicket partnership of 365 that slammed the door on Sri Lanka. Williamson's career-best effort was made from technique, application and determination harking back to an era where such innings were the hallmark of great Test batsmen. In the process of that priceless 242, he became the fastest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs, beating Martin Crowe's record by three innings. When the curtain falls on Williamson's career - and Crowe had predicted him to smash all of New Zealand's batting records - that unbeaten double-century may stand out.
Ben Stokes - 92 v New Zealand, Lord's

This was England's best performance of the short two-match series at home with New Zealand, and one that spurred them onto a 124-run win in the first Test. The hosts had slumped to 30/4 inside the first hour but in the company of Joe Root, the 24-year-old Stokes launched a counter-attack that epitomised the tone of England's summer. In a partnership of 161 in 32 overs, the left-hander smacked 92 from 94 balls - at one stage he crashed 31 in 13 deliveries - and after stumps revealed that being promoted to No 6 and told to play his natural, aggressive game allowed him to bat as he pleased. For a batsman whose previous Test at Lord's contained two ducks, that whirlwind 92 against Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Matt Henry - each of whom were plundered - was a fine achievement. And it sparked something in Stokes, who came out to bat in England's second innings and achieved the fastest Test century seen at Lord's, off 85 balls.
Adam Voges - 130* v West Indies, Dominica
Voges had floated around Australia's domestic circuit for the better part of 12 years before making his Test debut at the age of 35, and he promptly became the oldest cricketer to score a century on Test debut, batting 247 deliveries for an unbeaten 130 that lifted Australia from 61/3 to 318 - a lead of 170. Support was hard to find for Voges, with only the No 11 Josh Halewood (39) scoring more than Steve Smith's 25. Leaving it all for the debutant to do, Australia were eventually indebted to Voges' hundred which set up a nine-wicket win in the first Test. It was an impressive achievement for anyone, but making it sweeter for Voges was the fact that he stood firm with his work attitude and determination to secure a Baggy Green. "I'll take it," he said after the second day's play. "People have been saying I'm the oldest guy for a lot of things. It's been a lot of hard work, so I'm very happy."
Sarfraz Ahmed - 96 v Sri Lanka, Galle
Pakistan's reliable wicketkeeper-batsman was to the fore in Galle, where his sixth-wicket stand with Asad Shafiq turned the tables on Sri Lanka. From being five down and 182 runs behind the home team's first-innings total on the fourth morning of the first Test, Pakistan were driven to a lead of 117. Central to that was Man-of-the-Match Sarfraz's approach: 86 balls, 96 runs, 13 fours. Displaying his range of strokes, some orthodox and some far removed, the 28-year-old eased the pressure off Shafiq while frustrating Sri Lanka. Critically, his tactics against Rangana Herath were eye-catching; often taking guard well outside leg stump, Sarfraz both swept and drove inside-out off the wily spinner to push the score forward. He missed a century by four runs, but the match award was just reward for his exceptional innings.
Younis Khan - 171* v Sri Lanka, Pallekele

Few would have given Pakistan chance of getting 377 after their poor showing in the first innings of the deciding Test at Pallekele. That they achieved that record chase owed in heaps to the 37-year-old Younis, who faced 271 balls in his unbeaten 171 that sealed the series 2-1 over Sri Lanka. Pakistan were 13/2 in the second innings, but with Younis and young opener Shan Masood (125) they were resuscitated and put on their way for the highest team run chase ever. This was Younis' 11th score of 150 or more, the most by a Pakistan batsman, and he also became the first batsman in Test history to score five fourth-innings centuries. "It was not easy, but I have my own expectations from myself, to do well when the team is under pressure. I take the onus on myself to take my team to victory," said a modest Younis after accepting the match prize.
Joe Root - 134 v Australia, Cardiff

The innings that shouldn't have been, but turned out to be everything for England as the Ashes started at Sophia Gardens. Overhead conditions in Cardiff strongly indicated it was a bowl-first pitch, but Alastair Cook had no hesitation in opting to bat. At 43/3, his decision looked silly. Root inside-edged his first ball onto his pads, then nicked his second delivery, a lovely curling away swinger, but was dropped by a diving Brad Haddin behind the stumps. He never looked back, driving, cutting and flicking his way to a match-winning 134 from 166 balls that helped set the stage for England to retain the Ashes. It truly was an innings worth its weight in gold, for by pushing and running constantly Root's approach gnawed at Australia and helped counter a very slow surface. England ended the first day on 343/7 and pushed on to 430, which proved instrumental in a 169-run win.
 
Dinesh Chandimal - 162* v India, Galle

The most counter-attacking hundred of the year, and one that turned a precarious situation into a famous defeat of India. When Sri Lanka went into the lunch interval on day three at 108/5 with a deficit of 84 runs, it appeared that things could quickly go downhill in the afternoon on a surface that was assisting spin. Instead, Chandimal denied India for two-thirds of the second session in a partnership of 125 with Lahiru Thirimanne, scored at over five runs per over, then added 89 in brisk time with Jehan Mubarak, before moving from 111 to 162 in 45 deliveries while batting with the tail. His unbeaten 162 form 160 balls was Chandimal's fourth Test hundred and his best yet, featuring bold and brazen shots - including one reverse-sweep for six off Harbhajan Singh - that toyed with India's bowling. It wasn't always pretty, but you have to salute a batsman who backs his instinct in such pressure situations. Most importantly, that innings set up a Sri Lankan win.
Alastair Cook - 263 v Pakistan, Abu Dhabi

In today's era, Cook proved that there is room for the dour, stonewalling efforts required to save Test matches. Perhaps the last Test opener with the gumption for a marathon innings where a higher price is put on defending rather that run-accumulation, the England captain played the third longest Test innings in history - a monumental effort that spanned 528 balls in 836 minutes. Pakistan's 523/8 ate up 151.1 overs, and England's best shot at avoiding a defeat was to bat out time. Cook did precisely that during his awesome 263, where the next best was Root's 85. He was seventh out with England's total at 549 in 190.1 overs, showing the way for his team-mates. In the end, England came within striking distance of an improbable win after Pakistan collapsed for 173 in their second innings. That they came anywhere close was down to Cook.
Ross Taylor - 290 v Australia, Perth
The track was flat, but to go past Australia's first innings score of 599 took something remarkable. Taylor marked his guard with New Zealand 87/2 and went on to enter cricket's record books during the course of his excellent 290 which lifted the visiting team to their highest total against the hosts in a 53-match history dating back to 1946. Foremost of those was a breaking a record that had stood for almost 112 years, that of the highest individual score by a visiting batsman in Australia. Taylor's career-best 290 from 374 balls surpassed England batsman Tip Foster's 287 scored in Sydney in December 1903 and overall, only England great Len Hutton's 364 at Lord's in 1938 stands as the highest score against Australia after Taylor's sublime effort. With Williamson (166) for company and then batting with the tail, Taylor helped New Zealand to 624 before he was last out, slog-sweeping Nathan Lyon to deep midwicket where the substitute Jonny Wells held a good sliding catch.
Ajinkya Rahane - 127 v South Africa, Delhi
Rahane's stroke-filled 127 from 215 deliveries was a critical factor in India beating South Africa at the Feroz Shah Kotla for a 3-0 win. It was also the first century of a low-scoring series and the longest individual innings of a series dominated by the ball on rank turners.
The Kotla surface was not one such, but still required plenty of application and skill, and it was fitting that Rahane was the man to reach a significant landmark for it was at this venue that he made a forgettable debut in 2013.
This excellent hundred lifted India from 66/3 to an eventual 334 all out and with it Rahane has also pushed his batting average in India from under eight to 24.85. Rahane's fluidity harked back to his sublime Lord's century of 2014, and for sheer value it will rank alongside that match-winning effort. TNN
