Bunka awards 2015
From the Land of the rising Sun....

Both Japan and Sri Lanka have emerged from the depths of despair and share a common understanding of the bitterness and the senselessness of war. For Japan the one event that almost crippled it, was the Hiroshima Nagasaki bombings. For Sri Lanka it was the war against the LTTE that claimed the lives of countless youth. But they have also a shared interest in arts and culture. So it is these similarities and experiences that have enabled them to sympathize with each other, understand each other and recognize each other strengths.
The Bunka Awards are presented annually by the Japan Sri Lanka Friendship Cultural Fund which was established in 1993, on the initiative of the Japanese Solidarity Association and the Japanese Commerce and Industry Association in Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the Embassy of Japan. The Bunka Awards are aimed at encouraging and promoting Sri Lankan artists with artistic talents in such fields as drama, theatre, dance, music, painting, sculpture, pottery, photography, lyric writing, literature, video animation and visual arts. For the past twenty one years, 118 mid-career individuals and organizations received Bunka Awards for their creative activities in culture and arts.
“Japan and Sri Lanka have had a very good relationship for many years in the field of Arts and Culture which brings about true understanding. I would like to congratulate all the Bunka Award winners. This is an encouragement for all in the field of Arts and Culture in Sri Lanka. We hope this will be a bridge between Japan and Sri Lanka in the field of Arts and Culture,” Ambassador of Japan, Kenichi Suganuma.
This year the following six Sri Lankan artistes received the prestigious Bunka (Cultural) Awards.
* Dileeka Abeysekara (Music/Vocal)
* Nadeeka Guruge (Music/Composer)
* Dr. Saumya Liyanage (Drama/Acting)
* Kapila Poogalaarachchige (Music)
* Lakshmi Sriharan Dance (Bharatha Natyam)
* Academic Players (Kelaniya University) Drama/Theatre
“During the long years of association between Japan and Sri Lanka there have been visits to each country by government officials of each nation. We have had various cultural exchanges. I thank the Ambassador for facilitating this function and giving our local artistes the necessary encouragement. Our Sri Lankan artistes are essential to this country. They are essential components of the country,” said Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development & Cultural Affairs, S.B. Navinna.
The highlight of the Bunka Awards presentation ceremony was the live performance by each award winner, displaying their versatile talents which merited their selection.
Dileeka Abeysekara certainly was the nightingale of the evening with her powerful voice and perfect pitch. Her voice which has been nurtured and tempered with years of practice and experience certainly made an impact on the audience. Nadeeka Guruge, the soulful musician certainly must have had his lesson from a deity of music with his soothing and ethereal music.
Saumya Liyanage and his troupe delivered a swashbuckling performance which was a very good piece of acting. Mr. Kapila Poogalaarachchi, the maestro in black directed his singers with aplomb and his commanding personality brought out the best in them. Poogalaarachchige talent was evident with his inimitable style. Lakshmi Sriharan was the epitome of Bharatha Natyam with her dance that was majestic and perfect. Her dancing was of the highest caliber. She moved like a great cat mesmerizing everyone. The Academic players delivered a frightening performance stunning everyone with its intensity, but the talent was there.
Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development & Cultural Affairs Hon S.B. Navinna graced the occasion as Chief Guest alongside Ambassador of Japan, H. E. Mr. Kenichi Suganuma. Mr. Naoto Honda, President of the Japanese Solidarity Association of Sri Lanka, Mr. Carlo Fonseka, Co-Chairman of the Fund and other distinguished invitees including members of the diplomatic Corps and several renowned Sri Lankan artistes were also present on this occasion.
