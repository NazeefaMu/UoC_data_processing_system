A wise man once said that the greatest legacy one can pass onto one’s children and grandchildren is neither money nor materialistic things accumulated in one’s life, but a legacy of character and faith.
K.Sivagananathan, an innovative banker, is one such who lived up to those words.


He is defined as a mighty oak, a devoted and caring husband who fulfilled his responsibilities to the fullest, a dutiful father, a guru who moulded leaders for tomorrow, an officer with great ability and a  banker who created a different era.


His 14th year remembrance was commemorated recently by his family and colleagues at the ‘Annual Memorial Oration and Memorial Trust Awards Ceremony’ which widely acknowledged  his work, contributions and influence on the banking industry.


According to Association of Professional Bankers of Sri Lanka President Shashi Kandambi, he was a legend in Sri Lanka’s 
banking industry.


“He headed numerous prestigious committees, always looking to initiate to develop the banking industry in Sri Lanka, he also took a great interest in banking education and there are many students in the banking industry today because of him including my self,” she fondly remembered.


One of the major contribution he has done to the industry was the strong link that had been established between the Sri Lanka institute of bankers and the  institute bankers of London as he had played a major role in formalising this arrangement as he wanted to raise the professional standard of bankers on par with international standards.


For his part, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne, who delivered the Memorial Oration, said that he remembers K.Sivagananathan as  a senior at the time he joined the industry as a management trainee in 1984.


“From Mr.Siva to Central Bank former governor A. S. Jayawardena, they did not treat us like brats though we were much younger, they treated us like colleagues. Often engaging us in debates in financial issues,” he said reminiscing the past.


“Today I stand here as a deputy minister among other responsibilities thanks to Mr. Silva and other seniors,” he said.


“He always comes to work by 7 in the morning, dressed in white. He had a such a cracking pace of activity, never complaining and always with a smile on his face,” Wickramaratne shared what other bankers had said about him.


K.Sivagananathan rose to many ranks in different institutions including the Senior Deputy General Manager of  BoC, with a determination not only to succeed as a professional but also to transform the industry landscape and give back to  the industry which continues to be a driving force behind the nation’s economy. After his retirement from BoC he continued to work within the industry as the CEO in Janashakthi Insurance Company PLC and there after as a consultant to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.


It was following his untimely demise and discovery of a letter written by him, requesting of  formation of a trust,  K.Sivagananathan Memorial Trust was established in 2002, to provide assistance to educate and support growing talent within the bank and finance sector in the country.


“The trust was orientated as a humble request from him as he had asked from whatever the savings we have, to be able to give to that pack to the population of Sri Lanka in educating them in banking and finance,” recalled his son Nathan Sivagananathan.


Apart from his innovative contribution to the bank he was involved in many new concepts as a solution to the banking industry such as  pioneering  in introducing automated tele machine, home banking, specialised travels and several other products
When it was his turn to speak, Bank of Ceylon CEO D. M. Gunasekara, who was the guest of honour, said that   K.Sivagananathan is a great person whom he respected 
a lot.


“He was a gentleman and a social worker, a dynamic worker, a disciplinarian who possessed a golden heart, always had  a charming smile and a majestic personality, he always stood for justice and fair play,” he said.


“He was innovative and assertive, he had a pleasing personality who was popular among his colleagues, a man with less words, a man who helped without expecting anything in return, a man who wanted to help anyone who came to him,” he went on 
to say.


Emulating the audience on   K.Sivagananathans personal life, Gunasekara said that looking at his contribution done towards the industry one might think that he was fully committed to his career neglecting his family, “But it was not the case, he helped his siblings in numerous ways after the demise of his father, he was a loving father and a husband as well,” he said.


“In the era of digitalisation we need more bankers like Siva, bankers who are capable of managing the future beyond challenges,” Gunasekara stressed.


In his concluding remarks, he requested the young bankers to learn from late K.Sivaganathans life story, adapt what is relevant and apply it to their lives.
