Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak arrived in Sri Lanka this morning for three-day official visit.

A proposed bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) between Malaysia and Sri Lanka will be a key agenda during Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s visit, the Malaysian Star reported.

The Malaysian Prime Minister will discuss the matter with Sri Lanka’s President Maithripala Sirisena in a bilateral meeting tomorrow.

“Both leaders will discuss the way forward for the FTA,” the charge d’affaires at the High Commission of Malaysia in Sri Lanka, Zainal Izran Zahari, told Malaysian media in Colombo yesterday.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between both countries.

Najib’s trip, which is to reciprocate Sirisena’s visit to Malaysia in December last year, will also be his first official visit as Prime Minister.

During his visit, the Prime Minister will meet Sri Lanka’s business leaders, the Malaysian community and representatives of Malaysian companies in Sri Lanka, including Dialog Axiata and Hyrax Oil Sdn Bhd.

Najib and Sirisena will also witness the signing of three memoranda of understanding (MoU).

The Malaysian Prime Minister accompanied by his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, several ministers and Government officials, including International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Reezal Merican and Malaysia’s Special Envoy on Infrastructure to India and South Asia Tun S. Samy Vellu.
