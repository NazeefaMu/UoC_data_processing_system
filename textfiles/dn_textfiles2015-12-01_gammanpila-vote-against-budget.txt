Gammanpila to vote against budget

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya will vote against the budget in Parliament, party General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference at the party office at Pitakotte, Gammanpila said certain members of the common opposition were still undecided whether to vote in favour of the budget or oppose it.
He said these members would take a firm decision on the matter in the coming week. Gammanpila said they did not obtain the signature of the former President to the no-confidence motion against the Finance Minister for strategic reasons.
“There are two other ministers in the UNP who are more suitable to be proposed to the post of Finance Minister,” he said.
Gammanpila said his firm stand was that Members of Parliament and public servants should be entitled to duty free vehicles.
“Today it had been proved that the budget was a mere document without any foundation. The University Teachers’ Association was keeping mum about the problems which had cropped up in the country.
The whole country was eagerly awaiting the Association’s response to these problems,” he said.
Wimal Weerawansa, Prasanna Ranatunga and several other MPs were unable to sign the no-confidence motion due to other pre occupations. Some were on visits abroad, Gammanpila said.
Ministers like Dr, Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickremaratne and Kabir Hashim have a good knowledge in economics. A person who had a good knowledge in economics would not vote in favour of the budget, he said.
Gammanpila said a large number of UPFA parliamentarians including Chamal Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa already signed the no-confidence motion against the finance minister.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya publicity secretary Thushara Dissanayake said a powerful minister in the government had already started to harass their General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila.
He alleged that two officers of the Special Presidential Investigation Unit left for Australia at 1.10 a.m. to meet a person called Brad Saddin in search of some information to implicate Gammanpila.
