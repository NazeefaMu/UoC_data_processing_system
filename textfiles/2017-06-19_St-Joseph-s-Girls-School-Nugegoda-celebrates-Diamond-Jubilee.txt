On August 8, 1942 the Rt. Hon. Masson, the Archbishop of Ceylon blessed and opened the first building of this school designed by Rev. Fr. Legoc.  
Three Irish nuns who were eminent educationalists and firm disciplinarians served as principals for over two decades. They were Mothers Raphael, Baptist and De Sales respectively. There was a glamorous nun named Mother Dolores in charge of the Home Science section.  
It was during the time of the first principal that the school anthem was composed by Mrs. Alfreda de Silva, the Elocution teacher of the Convent. “Sursum Corda” our school Motto, came into existence and we its students uphold it. Three school houses were created being Anne Marie, Gonzaga and Leonide, a fourth Sebastian was later incorporated.
