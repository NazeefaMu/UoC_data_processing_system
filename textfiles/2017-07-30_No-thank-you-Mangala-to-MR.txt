Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has told former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that there was no necessity of the latter’s help to govern the country, as he (ex President Rajapaksa) had left them a 'mess up'.

In a twitter interview, former President Rajapaksa said he was open for discussion with anyone including President Maithripala Sirisena for the sake of the country.

In response to this, Minister Samaraweera tweeted back saying 'NO THANK YOU! Certainly not your advice on how to govern the country. Look at the mess you left, for us to clean.'
