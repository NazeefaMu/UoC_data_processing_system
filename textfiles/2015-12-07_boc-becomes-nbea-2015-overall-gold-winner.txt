Bank of Ceylon (BOC) was at the forefront at the 2015 National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA) with a massive victory- winning the Overall Gold award and becoming the winner in the categories of Banking sector, Excellence in CSR, Excellence in Local Market Reach and Extra-Large category and the runner-up of Excellence in Capacity Building. 
The event, which was held at Hilton Colombo, was graced by British High Commissioner James Dauris. The bank’s General Manager D.M. Gunasekara received these awards on behalf of the bank. 
NBEA is one of the prime award ceremonies that recognizes business organisations that make a significant contribution to the socio-economic development of the country through exemplary business practices. For the 2015 assessment, the NBEA has further tightened its evaluation criteria to take cognizance of the contemporary requirements, new focus areas and to enable more opportunities to describe why they should be considered excellent. 
BOC closed its 75th year on a magnificently high note in 2014, by recording the highest ever profit before tax (PBT) in the bank’s history as well as in the Sri Lankan banking industry of Rs.20.3 billion, achieving a growth of 29 percent compared to the previous year. This was the highest profit earned by a single Sri Lankan business entity for the year. Post tax profit stood at Rs.13.6 billion, a 12 percent growth. The bank’s assets grew by 11 percent to Rs.1.3 trillion for the year 2014. 
BOC’s balance sheet is the strongest in the industry with over one trillion assets and was the first Sri Lankan entity in the country to pass this milestone. Leading in every aspect of banking and financial services, it has doubled its assets, deposits, loans, and shareholder’s wealth and enhanced its brand value to Rs.38. billion in 2015. The bank currently serves over 11 million customers from all walks of life. Serving the Sri Lankan community for over 76 years with true dedication and commitment, it has brought hope and happiness to many under privileged local communities through significant social development projects covering five areas of education, infrastructure development, preserving national heritage, health care, sports and entrepreneurship.
Setting an unparalleled benchmark in the Sri Lankan banking industry, the bank has been recognized by a number of reputed international and local institutions.
“The bank has consistently succeeded in contributing to the growth of the nation and being recognized for this genuine effort significantly, further encourages and strengthens our capabilities to deliver more for the country whilst thanking all our stakeholders including our valued customers, the government and the dedicated staff of the bank for the support and encouragement extended towards the bank,” stated Gunasekara.
