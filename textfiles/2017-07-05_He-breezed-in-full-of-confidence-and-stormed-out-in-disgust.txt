He breezed in full of confidence and stormed out in disgust


	



 

A firebrand Green party deputy from the Colombo district who wanted to meet a same party purohita representing a district in the deep South called at the latter’s Ministry the other day.

 


By the way, this deputy waged a big battle within the party some time ago to promote the image of this purohita in a bid elevate him to a high rank in the party.  


When this deputy called at the Ministry, an office aide told him to sit in the visitors’ lounge for a while as the purohita was busy. The deputy waited for about half an hour and finding no summons forthcoming, stormed into the purohita’s office.


The deputy, now angry at being cold-shouldered, briefly stated his business and asked the purohita to do the needful given his personal interest in the matter. The purohita who quietly listened to the deputy told him that he had to call for a report before he could move in the matter. 


The deputy, however, insisted that the purohita should act using his discretion and authority, given the urgency of the matter. But the purohita stood his ground saying that he had to follow the usual formalities before taking any concrete action. The deputy appealed again, but his onetime ‘hero’ remained unmoved.  An exasperated deputy walked out vowing never to see the purohita again, not before berating him in choice Sinhala and dashing the file he was carrying on the floor, they say.
