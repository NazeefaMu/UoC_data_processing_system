Floundering ‘monera’ about to crash-land?


	

This state-owned undertaking called the pride of the island nation has been carrying the national flag of the country high in the air throughout the globe for several decades. Due to years of mismanagement, this national venture went on the rocks and it is now being run at a terrible loss. 


When the yahapalanaya government took office, its top brass decided to put back the faltering undertaking upright. They appointed several big names in the corporate sector to the board of management. They squeezed in a few political favourites too to certain 
high positions. 


However, everyone including the employees of the national venture who were highly elated that the glamorous ‘monera’ would take off for a new era of successful flying are in tears today. For the hand-picked appointees to the board of management having forgotten a sacred job entrusted to them have got split into two factions and are embroiled in a protracted feud. The feud had taken a turn for the worse with several purohitas entering the scene to side one faction or the other, they say. 


The chairman now marking time attends office only two days a week.
A crash-landing of the entire venture is not far off, unless the authorities in the highest echelons lose no time calling an end to the strange goings-in at its top level, 
employees say.
