Right of Reply Amrit Muttukumaru responds to ‘Outsider’


	

‘Outsider’ has also become an apologist for CBSL Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy 

My Rotary membership was unlawfully terminated twice after I blew the whistle on RI wrongdoing

It is disappointing that the legal system is abused to thwart exposé of wrongdoing

I re-iterate - RW must initiate transparent measures to bring Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka to face due process for his role in the alleged Bond Scam

Although on principle I do not respond to cowards afraid to place their names upfront, I am making an exception in this instance to expose those squirming with my public interest undertakings particularly ‘naming & shaming’. I have done so with responsibility to which wrongdoers have no credible answer other than unleash mercenaries in different forms for different rewards. This will not deter me. 

 
My article in the ‘’Dailymirror – “UNP ‘Politburo’ set up for internecine war between Sajith, Navin?” has sent ‘Outsider’ evidently a rabid acolyte of PM Wickremesinghe who views the world with ‘dark glasses’ into panic mode.  


I am no apologist for anyone. In my said article I inter alia stated:  


“The Yahapalana Government has only itself to blame for keeping the door wide open to give the Rajapaksas another shot at leading this country”  
I have also referred to the “traumatic Rajapaksa led years”  


I ask ‘Outsider’ why is RW not holding those concerned accountable?  


‘Outsider’ trivializes my call for “real reforms” in the UNP by the puerile question – “Does Mr. Muthukumaru expect the farmer and fisherman to come to ‘Sirikotha’ and offer advice?”   


Outsider’ refers to a plethora of alleged egregious wrongdoing under the Rajapaksa presidency which include when Nivard Cabraal was CBSL Governor. I again ask why is RW pussyfooting on these allegations? What is he afraid of? 



Governor Indrajit


 ‘Outsider’ has also become an apologist for CBSL Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy. 

 
I re-iterate that Governor Indrajit has an obligation to carry out a transparent investigation into alleged instances of blatant tax evasion and money laundering identified by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry probing the issuance of Treasury Bonds. This is particularly so in the context of the European Union designating Sri Lanka as a ‘high risk country for money laundering’ subsequent to the ‘Financial Action Task Force’ placing the country on its ‘grey list’ reportedly from November 2017. Governor Indrajit who assumed office as CBSL Governor from 3 July 2016 must bear some responsibility. This designation is serious. Under the circumstances, which ETHICAL entity will want to invest in Sri Lanka?  


In the context of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) being at the centre of the worldwide efforts for the prevention of money laundering, the CBSL’s stance is untenable. ‘Outsider’ refers to my views on PEPs as a “witch-hunt”!  While in no way suggesting that the mere listing of names and entities in tax havens is indicative of wrongdoing, it is disappointing that Governor Indrajit has completely ignored my e-mails commencing 30 August 2017 on determining the legitimacy or otherwise of the offshore accounts allegedly held by Sri Lankan citizens in tax havens revealed almost two years ago in the ‘Panama Papers’. In this connection particular reference was made to the offshore account allegedly held by the Chairman of a leading private sector bank linked to a company in which Governor Indrajit was a director until almost the day he was appointed CBSL Governor.

Canard  


‘Outsider’ has gone ballistic after my demand that RW must “Publicly apologize to the 6.2 million voters who were duped by reneging on the promises given in the run-up to the 8 January 2015 presidential elections” by stating:  


1) “Mr. Muthukumaru is used to apologising in court!”  


2) “Mr. Muthukumaru is no stranger to courts”  


These canards need to be nailed once and for all.

After I questioned the integrity of Rotary International (RI) one of the largest NGOs in the world which solicits and receives huge donations on the back of purporting to be an ethical entity which include the unsuitability of two persons from Sri Lanka to hold high RI office, they both sued me for Rs. 100 Million each alleging defamation. They both initiated a settlement on IDENTICAL undertakings which prohibits all parties including me from writing on issues concerning each other. Does this not demonstrate the UTTER FALSITY of the alleged ‘defamation’? I agreed to the ‘Settlement’ due to time and cost constraints.   


My Rotary membership was unlawfully terminated twice after I blew the whistle on RI wrongdoing. Notwithstanding my exposé both these persons went on to hold high RI office. One of these persons was even appointed “special ambassador to attract foreign investment” by RW. I do not wish to speculate on how much of FDIs came in due to his efforts!  


The questionable integrity of RI include accountability for the US $10 Million ‘Schools Re-awaken’ project with donor funds to rebuild/rehabilitate 25 Tsunami devastated schools.   Subsequent to some of my public interest undertakings one of these persons alleged a breach of my part of the undertaking and reported me for ‘Contempt of Court’. In order to avoid the administrative inconvenience involved and for the purpose of settlement I did apologize for the alleged ‘Contempt of Court’. It has nothing to do with any defamation which ‘Outsider’ has mischievously insinuated. I am only stating these facts for the sole purpose of setting the record straight. It is disappointing that the legal system is abused to thwart exposé of wrongdoing.   


I re-iterate - RW must initiate transparent measures to bring Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka to face due process for his role in the alleged Bond Scam which will include communicating with Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong. RW has a moral obligation to do so since he has consistently defended him no matter what at every turn.
