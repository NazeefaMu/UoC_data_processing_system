Superstar Rajinikanth will hand over keys to 150 homes built for Tamils by Gnanam Foundation on April 9 in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, according to a statement released by Lyca Productions, IANS reported.

As part of his visit, Rajinikanth is also expected to speak at a public meeting and plant tree saplings.

"Named after Lyca Group chairman Subaskaran Allirajah's mother, the foundation has built these homes at a cost of Rs 22 crore and the project was completed over a period of one and a half years," read the statement.

Following the civil war in 2009, the foundation has been working extensively in key parts of Sri Lanka to rebuild roads and schools.

The homes have been built for displaced Tamils in Sri Lanka.

Rajinikanth's upcoming Tamil science-fiction action film "2.o" is being bankrolled by Lyca Productions.
