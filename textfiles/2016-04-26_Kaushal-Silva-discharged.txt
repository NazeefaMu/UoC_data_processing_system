Sri Lankan cricketer Kaushal Silva, who was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Colombo after being hit by a ball on the head, has been discharged today following medical treatments, SLC medical committee member Professor Arjuna Silva said.

Kaushal was admitted to the hospital last Sunday after he was hit by a ball on the head during a practice match held in Pallekale Cricket Stadium.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) stated the doctors had confirmed that Kushal has suffered a ‘mild concussion’ and that he was completely fit for physical activities.

“He was under strict observations for past 36 hours. Kushal will take good rest for coming days and will continue practices from early next week,” the SLC added.
