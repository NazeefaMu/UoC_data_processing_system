A protest demonstration would be held by the Joint Opposition on Monday, July 3 at the Trincomalee town over the Government’s alleged move to handover the Trincomalee China Bay oil tank farm to the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the JO Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said in a news conference yesterday.

He said that they would gather all the anti-Government forces to compel the Government to revise its decision to sell country’s assets.

MP Alahapperuma said, under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s patronage and the participation of several civil societies, the JO’s National Assets Protecting Centre would organise the event.

He said the Trincomalee Harbour and the land that belonged to it was also planned to be sold to the IOC, with the China Bay oil tank farm.

“We invite everyone who suffered under Unity Government’s actions to come forward and support to stop its moves, which would harm the country,” he said.

It was learnt that the JO’s move to compel the Government to halt its decision to on oil tank farm to IOC was backed by the Petroleum Corporation Unions.

Meanwhile, MP Alahapperuma said the Unity Government had become MS & RW Auctioneers, who keep selling the country’s priceless assets to China and India.

He also said the Joint Opposition would put an end to selling country’s assets with the support of the people. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
