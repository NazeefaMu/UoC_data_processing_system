UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa over the weekend denounced allegations that he had obtained a cheque from Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius.

Minister Premadasa responded to an allegation made by Member of Southern Provincial Council D. V. Upul.

Mr. Upul who threw challenge at Mr. Premadasa asking him to submit an affidavit to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and prove that he had not obtained money from Aloysius.

Mr. Premadasa responded to this allegation while speaking during a ceremony to donate a bus to Viharagala MV in Sooriyawewa recently.

“I am not a robber who had taken money from Aloysius. I can swear by my late father President Ranasinghe Premadasa and my mother that I have not obtained any cheques or cash from Aloysius,” Mr. Premadasa said.

He said one who had accused him of taking money from Perpetual Treasuries Chief is a person who is engaged in trafficking drugs in Hambantota.

“Those who are accusing me are engaged in trafficking drugs using ‘easy cash’ in the district. I will not hand over affidavits to any one just to please drug traffickers in the Hambantota District,” he added. He also accused Mr. Upul of being involved in the underworld activities.

Mr. Premadasa said he will only answer to people in this country. “I am a politician who does not go after perks. I use what I get as a minister to the Sevana fund so that it could be used to provide shelter to the homeless,” he also said.

He said one should follow the teachings of Buddha who had said one has to have credibility before preaching. (Yohan Perera)
