Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dassanayake today rejected the bail application filed by President Maithripala Sirisena's former chief of staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) former chairman P. Dissanayaka who were in remand custody on charges of accepting a Rs.20 million bribe.

The magistrate ordered that the suspects should be kept in remand prison until the case was over as it involves a huge amount of money. (Farook Thajudeen and Shehan Chamika Silva)
