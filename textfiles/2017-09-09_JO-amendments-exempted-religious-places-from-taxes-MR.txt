Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that the Joint Opposition (JO) submitted amendments to the Inland Revenue Bill to ensure that no taxes would be imposed with regard to any place of religious worship.

He said the government accepted these amendments and included them in the Bill.   

“Otherwise, places of religious worship would have been taxed like all other institutions,” he told a group of journalists in Kandy.  (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
