Grand reception was in vain


	



 

Elaborate arrangements had been made to accord a grand reception to a foreign delegation headed by a high political authority of that country at a very important state venue here. 

 


In fact, the organizers had liberally spent money on this reception which was to feature a variety of cultural features like dances, drum beating and conch-shell blowing.


The delegation was billed to arrive at the venue at 10.30 in the morning and the dance troupes and other artistes were waiting to go into action at the scheduled time. However, the foreign delegation had suddenly arrived at the venue shortly after 10 in the morning heading off the grand reception arranged for them and thus sending much effort and money that went into it down the drain, they say.
