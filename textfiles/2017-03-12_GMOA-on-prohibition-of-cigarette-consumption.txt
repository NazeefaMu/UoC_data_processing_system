GMOA on prohibition of cigarette consumption


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) questions the Cabinet paper on restricting cigarette consumption within the country which is to be presented in parliament this week.  

Addressing a press briefing, the Association Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa said they have fair reasons to believe that due to the desires of a few people, there is an attempt to delay the issuing of the Cabinet paper on restricting the cigarette consumption.

“We have handed over tenfold proposal to President Sirisena to minimize cigarette smoking in the country, while describing the harmfulness of tobacco on September 9, 2016. The proposals were prepared after a broad study on the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,” he said.

To verify the people’s right to live, Dr. De Zoysa said that smoking could pose threat to health not only to the smoker but also to the people around them inhale and become passive smokers.

However, Dr. De Zoysa said that nearly six months had passed after handing over the proposals to the President and banning cigarettes being sold in single sticks, was a key proposal by them which has not been implemented as yet. Also he said that the government should introduce a licensing system for the sellers and should restrict the selling outlets in order to safeguard the people’s health.

“We have reasons to believe that the Cabinet paper is being delayed deliberately for the sake of a few individuals in the government. Implementing the recommended proposals sooner than later would help to protect the people from smoking-related ailments,” he said.

He said that the Association will stay alert on the government’s move to restrict cigarettes consumption in the country and said they believe that the President and the Unity Government would submit the Cabinet paper in this regard to Parliament immediately. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
