Pentecost 2017


	

The Inter-Church Fellowship (ICF), which is an informal interdenominational fellowship, is holding its seventh annual Pentecost event on Saturday, 17th June. The event brings together people representative of the entire Christian community – Roman Catholic, Mainline, and Evangelical. The spirit of ICF is to build bridges of friendship and trust, spanning the diversity of the community. The Pentecost event draws both lay people and clergy, in all three language media into a celebration with the intent of interaction at all levels of the community. Praise, worship, prayer, insightful messages and an opportunity for fellowship are all included in the programme.

 
Pentecost marks the event that brought the disciples of Jesus together after his ascension and energized them with the power of the Holy Spirit, changing the fearful and reticent into fearless witnesses of Jesus. With His power they effectively communicated the message of the love of Christ to a negative world. Pentecost was when they ‘came together with one accord’ and it is recognized today in all traditions of the church.

ICF’s theme for the event this year is ‘Together in the Spirit.’ It is the power of the Spirit of God in the church which enables its service to the community in love and compassion. Speakers from each of the major groups of the Christian community will bring messages in Sinhala, Tamil and English, portraying a united and reconciled community.  


ICF warmly invites Christians from all traditions to this event. Pentecost 2017 will take place at the Kollupitiya Methodist Church, from 9.00 am to 12.00 noon on Saturday, 17th June 2017. It will be a memorable event with the participation of worship groups and choirs from different groups, and well accepted speakers from the three main Christian groups – Roman Catholic, Mainline and Evangelical. It is an event not to be missed.
