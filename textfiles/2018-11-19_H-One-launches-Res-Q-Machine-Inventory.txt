Samath Fernando, CEO, H One, introduces Res.Q Machine Inventory to the apparel industry

Leading full-service IT solutions provider, H One, announced the launch of Res.Q| MI; an all-encompassing machine management solution designed with both large and small-scale factories in mind.

This cloud-based solution, developed by Sri Lanka’s trusted IT solutions provider, was launched at a private event attended by industry professionals.

Res.Q Machine Inventory is a revolutionary new asset management solution which leverages the capabilities of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology for the management, protection, and maintenance of one of the most vital assets of the apparel industry: its machinery.

The apparel industry is in a state of rapid change, where speed and efficiency are critical to a manufacturer’s success. Any setback in the functioning of its equipment is certain to incur severe losses – losses that with the right technology, can be significantly curtailed. One of the critical issues related to factory equipment in the apparel trade, is the efficient management and identification of its machines. 

Although the exchange of machinery between facilities - on a ‘loan’ or ‘rental’ basis- is a common practice across the industry, there has never been an efficient mode of automating and optimising these processes to productively monitor these movements. As a result of poor asset management, the production facility is at risk of incurring phenomenal expenses, effectively holding back the entire business with this loss. Res.Q|MI  is designed specifically to cater to such scenarios in any factory environment; facilitating the easy tracking of machinery -with just a click of a button- irrespective of where the machine is located at the time.

Guests at the Res.Q Machine Inventory launch observe information provided by the asset management solution 

Each machine is assigned a specific uniquely identifiable NFC tag which contains information, from the machine’s unique ID, its transaction history, break downs and service records. The machine management solution includes smart notifications, rent-in and rent-out calculations, as well as complete visibility of available machinery, allowing for manufacturers to exhaust all available machinery before resorting to renting machinery. With Res.Q Machine Inventory, facilities will be automatically notified once a machine has completed its rental time period.

Res.Q Machine Inventory also aids the commerce of the apparel industry with machine maintenance, for manufacturers can now ensure that their machinery is functioning at its optimal performance and also monitor a detailed record of its maintenance and service history of every machine.

In order to further ensure that all machinery is consistently functioning at its optimal performance -and with minimum down time-, Res.Q |MI is designed to give production facilities complete visibility of all available machinery. The system instantly notifies the relevant personnel as soon as a machine is detected as offline, allowing for the manufacturing facility to track the issue and take immediate corrective action.

Repair work for every machine is updated to the system via a mobile application paired with the NFC tag, and as a result a comprehensive record of the service and maintenance history -including spare part management- of each machine is monitored and immediately accessible. 

Another responsibility factory managers bear is the tedious task of manually managing needle supply to each machine or operator. Res.Q |MI’s in-built ‘Needle Management Module’ helps manufacturers address these issues, from needle management to needle issuing at the shop floor. This NFC technology-based module helps facilities streamline the needle monitoring process by recognising each machine and operator with unique ID tags, systematically recording each authorisation and bringing forth visibility to the entire process in real-time.  

H One replicates a factory floor setting at the launch of Res.Q Machine Inventory

At the launch of this cutting-edge machinery management solution, key stakeholders and potential investors were introduced to the many benefits of this effective and paperless new technology, and H One once again proved its mettle as the country’s primary innovative technology solutions provider, by once again serving the industry with yet another unified, integrated cloud solution for strategic IT modernisation aligned with the emerging needs of the business. 

“The key to any IT service is to make it easy for clients to have access to information which may otherwise involve a tedious process to accumulate,” said H One Chief Executive Officer, Samath Fernando at the launch. “This is exactly why we designed Res.Q Machine Inventory: an all-in-one solution for factory maintenance, enabling precision in tracking and maintenance with enhanced flexibility so that they can manage their machinery requirements on-site, which ultimately allows for well-informed, and intelligent decision-making.” 

Since its establishment in 2008 -as a progression from the Hirdaramani Group legacy spanning over 120 years- H One has become the forerunner in business intelligence solutions. The firm is a Microsoft Tier One Partner, Gold Cloud Productivity Partner and a top-ranked Microsoft Large Account Reseller serving the largest number of Enterprise Agreement customers in Sri Lanka. In both 2016 and 2018 H One was recognised as Microsoft Country Partner of the Year for Sri Lanka, in addition to winning O365 Partner every consecutively year since 2013.

The launch of Res.Q Machine Inventory is the newest addition to its solutions portfolio following the release of the resourceful QMS (Quality Management System) just last year. Staying true to its commitment to servicing the industry with innovation in apparel manufacturing with its business intelligence capabilities, H One also has plans to release a Skill Profiling tool to track employee performance, and hopes to serve markets beyond the region as well.
