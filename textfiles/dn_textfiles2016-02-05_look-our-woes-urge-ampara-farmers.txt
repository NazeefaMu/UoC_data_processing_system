Look into our woes, urge Ampara farmers

 
Problems faced by Ampara district farmers in selling their paddy should be looked into, members of the Uoorakkai Farmers' Committee of Thambiluvil said.
They said action should be taken by the officers to solve these problems or else they would be compelled to give up paddy cultivation in the future.
It is alleged that paddy farmers of Uoorakkai Kandam face several issues when selling paddy to the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB).
Uoorakka Farmers' Committee president G.V. Gnanasooriyam said: "Our own experience in the Ampara district shows that the PMB satisfies neither the producers nor consumers. We are skeptical as to whether the PMB is practicing any marketing strategies.
All Sri Lankans consume rice and yet the PMB is unable to market any. Officials at stores in our vicinity are not issuing any thing it purchased during the last season."
He made these remarks at the District Development Committee meeting presided by Digamadulla district TNA MP K. Kodieswaran held at the Thirukkovil DS office.
A PMB official said the PMB will stop buying paddy once the funds allocated to them are exhausted even if there is room in the stores.
