Diyawanna hopefuls jumped the gun


	



 

Proclamation of the dissolution of Diyawanna had witnessed some Pohottuwa Diyawanna hopefuls across the country putting up life-size cutouts, banners and posters in a mad rush to announce their candidacy at the coming polls. 

 


Most of those aspirants were former heads of local bodies and former provincial council members, they say.


The former strongman, now the controversial Number Two, had been both surprised and amused to find some party hopefuls had decided to contest on the party ticket even without his nod or knowledge. All these hopefuls had also made it a point to display the leader’s mug as well on these posters to support their credentials as party nominees. 


What had greatly amused the former strongman was that some local politicos had put up posters claiming to be the party’s National List nominees, they say.
