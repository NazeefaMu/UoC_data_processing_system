Ranjit Ella was an unassuming guy


	



The late Ranjith Ellepola was much loved by his schoolmates during his stay at Trinity College Kandy 

 

Ranjith Ellepola was also known as Ranjit Ella or Ceeg Ella by his friends. He was my special buddy at Trinity College Kandy. His name was actually an honorific bestowed upon him for his remarkable ability to extend the breath of a cigarette far beyond its commercial life. Ranjit Ella was an unassuming guy who shunned the limelight. But he was always present at every escapade and on every unholy occasion. He was a humble man and a friend to all. He had no enemies. In our senior years, a few of us, took liberty from school and spent most of our afternoons at ‘Gustaff’. I am sure Ranjit you will see this, from the beautiful place you are in, and recollect the enjoyable times we had there and smile. It was a haven, a hideaway where we shared our lunch, indulged in a siesta or engaged in heated debate usually on very minor matters or simply gossiped and joked about anything and everything. Ranjit Ella contributed much to the bonhomie of the place and possessed an unparalleled native wit, coupled with an ability to deliver grounded advice. He was always ready to laugh.

Yet for all the life we had as boys and men and as husbands with family, when the maker cometh, we have no choice but to leave. Ceeg my friend there is deep, deep sorrow in your parting so young, but also joy in the knowledge that you will achieve Nibbana far sooner than any one of us. I make this statement considering your character and high values you possessed. You were a fine man, a fine husband to Sama and a fine father to Ayodhaya, Chulaka and Bahanuka. All of us, your friends, join to say a prayer for you and wish you a wonderful and peaceful life in the hereafter.   
Your friend 
and buddy
