China discouraged investing in SL after Port City project: G.L.
	
	Confidence and certainty of the Chinese government in investing in Sri Lankan projects were lost due to the contradictory statements made by several government authorities towards the Chinese funded Port City project, former Foreign Minister G.L.Peiris said today.
	Speaking at an even named Panel Discussion on the Future Development of the Colombo District held today at the Grand Monarch Hotel, Thalawathugoda, Mr. Peiris said there is a trend of Chinese investors declining to invest for Lankan origin projects since they have been discouraged by the government after the January 8th General Election.
	One minister says the Port City construction was halted, while another minister says it is not," he said.
	The General Secretary of the UPFA Susil Premajayantha and UPFA candidate Dilan Perera were also at the event.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Premajayantha alleged that the UNP government which created the sordid chapter of the Batalanda saga of killings and tortures between 1988 and 1990 is nowadays trying to substantiate the death of former Havelock's Rugby captain, Wasim Thajudeen by pressing the authorities to exhume the body.
	He asked the UNP as who would prove justice to the youths killed in Batalanda. (Piyumi Fonseka)

If I win, I'll probe Thajudeen's murder: MR
	
	Kurunegala district UPFA candidate and ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa said he would probe the killing of ruggerite Wassim Thajudeen if his party was elected to office at the general election.
	He told a packed news conference held today to discuss a host of election-related issues and his political stance that the murder should be probed to ascertain the truth. He said this by way of a response to a question asked by a journalist.
	It had been alleged that those linked to the Rajapaksa regime were behind this murder and according to reports three Presidential Security Division (PSD) personnel are said to have had a hand in it.
	The Magistrate's Court has ordered the exhumation of the body for further forensic examinations. Mr. Rajapaksa said this had happened in 2012, but suddenly, the government had reopened the case during this election for political purposes.
	They were in power for the past six months. They could have done it. But, they did not. They waited till now to implicate me in this case, he said.
	Mr. Rajapaksa, flanked by other UPFA leaders including Susil Premajayantha, Wimal Weerawansa and Dinesh Gunawardane, said he made certain mistakes during his tenure, but would not allow anyone to take the law into their hands in future.
	Expressing confidence that the UPFA would win 117 seats at this election, he said he intended to have a close rapport with President Maithripala Sirisena. Responding to a question about the statement that he would be denied the premiership, he said, Lets see about it after August 18, 2015.
	Commenting on the alienation of the minority communities from the UPFA, he said he took a political stance in support of Muslims both locally and internationally. Referring to his role in the campaign for the liberation of Palestine, he said there was an international conspiracy to create a rift between his government and the Muslims.
	Mr. Rajapaksa said if elected to office he would implement his election manifesto while carrying forward the projects outlined in his Mahinda Chintana polices presented previously.(Kelum Bandara)

Sri Lanka's security not at risk: Minister
	
	Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today assured the people that Sri Lanka's security was not under threat and that the LTTE would never be allowed to regroup or be revived ever again.
	He told a news conference that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters were spreading rumors that the country's security was at risk.
	The minister said LTTE supporters might be regrouping in other countries but they would never be allowed to try their pranks in Sri Lanka.
	President Maithripala Sirisena was elected on the promise of protecting national security and sovereignty and integrity and the UNFGG manifesto is based on this policy and our plans for the next five years. National security is in the forefront of everything, he said.
	The minister said on January 8, the people rejected these baseless allegations as empty rhetoric and would do so again on August 17 as well.
	With regard to the investigation into allegations of the Rs.800 million financial transaction between former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the LTTE through the RADA, the minister said they had unearthed more information on this matter and would take legal action soon.
	I invite Mahinda Rajapaksa to an open debate to prove his innocence, the minister said.
	Underworld gangsters close to the Rajapaksas' were allowed to operate during the previous regime and the white van culture which thrived at that time with those opposing the regime being its victims. After January 8, the white vans went missiing and so did underworld activities. The white van culture doesnt exist anymore, he said.
	The minister said certain individuals with vested interests were using underworld gangsters to create problems so as the embarrass the government.
	Investigations are being carried out into this matter and details would be revealed soon, he said.
	Commenting on allegations of federalism levelled at the JHU, the minister said Mahinda Rajapaksa was the one who supported federalism in the 1990s.
	It was we who changed his mind and convinced him to support a unitary state. The people must be aware that we will never support a federal solution, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
