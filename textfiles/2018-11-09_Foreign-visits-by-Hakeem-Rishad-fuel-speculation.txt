Foreign visits by Hakeem, Rishad fuel speculation


	

The decision by Leaders of both the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Rauff Hakeem and Rishad Bathiudeen respectively to leave the country in a hurry on Tuesday night had invited much speculation and tongue wagging in local circles.

The reasons for this sudden departure had many persons in political circles wondering whether this was a precursor to them leaving the Ranil faction and going over to the Mahinda faction. This line of thinking was given even more weight as the duo was seen going in for a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena prior to departure from the island.

When inquiries were made from a spokesperson for the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress about the sudden foreign visit by former minister Hakeem, he had replied that the leader had gone abroad for personal reasons and that he would be back soon. (Sujith Hewajulige)
