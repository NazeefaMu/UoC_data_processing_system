“No permanent friends in politics!”


	


The Western Province Chief Ministerial one was engaged in a serious political discussion with his party colleagues the other day on how they could secure a victory at the upcoming local polls.
The Chief Ministerial one called upon the participants to come up with their proposals to be considered in working out a polls winning strategy.  Practically all former heads of local bodies and provincial councillors present expressed the view that they would find it difficult to make a good showing at the polls unless they campaigned under the leadership of the former strongman.  In response to their collective opinion, the Chief Ministerial one drew their attention to a head of a local body looking after a maritime stretch South of the city. “You all know this colleague,” he continued pointing his finger at the particular local politico. “He is well known in the country as a faithful follower of our former strongman. Now you listen to him and after that decide whether we need the backing of the former Big Boss to win the upcoming polls…”    
Taking the cue from the Chief Ministerial one, the head of that council began addressing the gathering. “I have been branded as a follower of the former Big Boss.  Some claim that we cannot win polls without his weight behind us. I cannot subscribe to that idea… It’s a fallacy to say that.” “There! Now you heard what he had to say,” interposed the Chief Ministerial one. “He as a faithful ‘golaya’ says that we can do without the support of the former Boss at the upcoming polls and that settles the issue. Now let us continue our discussion…”
A Betel leaf senior who was amazed at the U-turn made by the head of the local body, a one-time henchman of the former strongman quipped: “There can be permanent enemies in politics. But surely there are no permanent friends in politics!”
