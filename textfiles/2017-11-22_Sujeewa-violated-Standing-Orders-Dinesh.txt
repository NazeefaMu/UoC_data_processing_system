Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane said today that State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe, who criticised the conduct of the President at a press conference on Tuesday, had violated the Standing Orders and the Constitution by doing so.

He said the Constitution and the Standing Order 78 had provided clear guidance with regard to the conduct of the President.

"Mr. Senasinghe had made a statement criticising the President during a press conference. It was a violation of the Standing Orders and the Constitution to criticise the President and the country," he said.

Mr. Gunawardane requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to look into the matter adding that allowing to do so, would lead to the violation of SOs and the Constitution in future.

The Speaker informed Parliament that he would look into it.

MP Ranjith Zoysa said the statement made by the State Minister was undermining the Presidential Commission appointed by the President to look into the issuance of Central Bank Bonds. (Ajith Siriwardana)
