He gets a timely warning!


	



 

A certain Betel party state purohita whose name is invariably mentioned in connection with the impending group crossover to the opposition had the other day made a surprise visit to the ‘Pohottuwa’ political office in Battaramulla. 

 


The state purohita hailing from the Puttalam district, after exchanging friendly greetings with his old colleagues, had not only taken a number of selfies posing with them, but also had posted a comment on his Facebook page saying that he called at the Pohottuwa political office.  Meanwhile, a well-seasoned politico from the prominent political family from Giruwapattu who carefully observed the buoyant behavior of the state purohita had told him: “Malli, don’t be in such a neck-break hurry to demonstrate your loyalty to Pohottuwa. Go slow. Otherwise, you too may have to do a stint in the state-run lodge - a fate staring in the face of our family members today.”
