A Kuwaiti woman has pledged to pay Kuwaiti Dinar 3,300 to her Sri Lankan housemaid to prevent the authorities from slapping a ban on her to hire overseas domestic workers in future, Al-Anba Daily has reported.

The incident has happened after a representative from the Sri Lankan embassy filed a complaint with the Office of the Director-General of the General Department of Residence Affairs Major-General Talal Ma’arafi.

According to the Arab Times, the official has said in the complaint that the housemaid sought refuge in the Embassy after the employer refused to pay her money for four years under the pretext of saving the money on her behalf.

It has been reported when the maid told her ‘madam’ that she wanted to leave for Sri Lanka, the latter refused to pay her money.
