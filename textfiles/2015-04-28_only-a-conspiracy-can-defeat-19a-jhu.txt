Historically it will be one of the most wrong decisions if for some reason the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not enacted in Parliament, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Chairman and MP the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
He told a news conference that if this were to happen it would only be as a result of a conspiracy.
The Thera said the 19th Amendment had been approved by the Supreme Court as well and added that it was essential to introduce the electoral reforms as well.
“I hope all the parties such as the SLFP, JVP, TNA and SLMC will support the new Constitutional Amendment,” he said and added that the Pivithuru Hetak organisation had relentlessly campaigned for constitutional reforms.
“We requested the previous government to introduce constitutional reforms but they ignored our plea. So we had to topple that government. We hope the new government will take steps to introduce the 19th Amendment,” the thera said.
