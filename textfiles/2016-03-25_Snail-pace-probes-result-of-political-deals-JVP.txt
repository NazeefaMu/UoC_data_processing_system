Snail pace probes result of political deals: JVP


	

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today that when considering the slow pace of the investigation process it wondered whether the Government had entered into political deals with those alleged to have committed fraud and corruption during the tenure of the previous government.

“We have submitted relevant documents to the FCID, the Bribery Commission and the Courts regarding these incidents. But the investigations are proceeding at a snail’s pace. We urge the Government to hasten the investigation process,” MP Vijitha Herath said.

He said the Government’s explanation for the delay in the investigation process was not acceptable and release of former MP Sajin Vaas Gunawardene on bail is one of the incidents which points fingers at the Government entering into political deals with the miscreants. (Ajith Siriwardana)
