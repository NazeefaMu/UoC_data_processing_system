	The University Grants Commission (UGC) has decided to increase the university intake by ten per cent for the next academic year based on the results of the 2015 GCE Advanced Level Examination released this week, officials said yesterday.
	UGC Chairman Mohan Silva said his office would wait for the results of the re-scrutinized answer scripts as requested by candidates. He said for the first time the candidates sat the exam under the new stream titled ‘Technical Scheme’ in addition to the four other streams that existed previously.
	The UGC is planning to introduce ‘28 technology-based degree programmes’ at 12 universities.
	“Of these 12 universities -- the Ruhuna, Kelaniya and Sri Jayewardenepura universities have expressed their willingness to start separate faculties for this stream. Colombo University will have a similar faculty later,” Prof. Silva said.
	He said the UGC would encourage all the universities to have such faculties.
	The previous annual intake of students stood at 25,000. (Kelum Bandara)
