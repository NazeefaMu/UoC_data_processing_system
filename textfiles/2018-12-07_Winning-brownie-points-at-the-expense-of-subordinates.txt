Winning brownie points at the expense of subordinates!


	



 

A star-sporting khaki high-up in a district South of the city is said to be deploying his subordinates in a diverse extraneous activity designed to win brownie points from political bigwigs in the district, they say.

 


His subordinates are not granted leave even for an urgent purpose like taking a sick child to a physician as they are constantly required for certain odd jobs which have nothing to do with their normal duties.


This high – up has made it a practice to summon subordinates away on leave for special traffic duty and arresting army deserters and suspects under court warrants.


This high-up has the knack for getting around the political bigwigs in the district no matter what the government is, for his personal benefits, they say.
