A triangle in a tangle


	



 

A fair and lovely Diyawanna member in yahapalanaya had found herself in a mortifying situation recently.

 


She paid a sudden visit to a young fellow member hailing from Ratnapura area. In fact, the duo had been long standing friends.


Comfortably settled close to each other on a settee, they were immersed in a heart to heart chat when lo and behold the fair one’s husband suddenly appeared before them unannounced. 


The young husband was livid when he found her wife had even put an arm round her friend’s shoulder. An altercation that ensued was about to escalate into fisticuffs when several security guards who rushed to the scene had pulled the two belligerent ones apart and made a modicum of peace.


However, the irate husband was still swearing at his wife as they walked out of the place together, eye witnesses say.
