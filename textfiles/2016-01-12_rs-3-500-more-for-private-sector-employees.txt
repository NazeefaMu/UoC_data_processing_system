The government on Tuesday presented an amendment paving the way to grant private sector employees a salary increment of Rs.3,500.
The regulation on the salary increment is being submitted by Labour Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne under Section 63 of the Wages Board Ordinance.
Therefore, sub-paragraph (a) of that regulation will be substituted to Rs.1,500 instead of Rs.400.
The paragraph (b) will be substituted to Rs.2,000 from the earlier Rs.500. (Yohan Perera)
