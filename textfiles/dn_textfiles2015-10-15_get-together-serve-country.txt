President asks university lecturers
Get together to serve country

President Maithripala Sirisena invited university lecturers to get together with commitment to serve the country with their knowledge, understanding and professional experience, irrespective of political divisions.
The President made this appeal when he met university lecturers at the President's Official Residence recently. The meeting was held to obtain the assistance of university lecturers to national development. "If anybody in the government is engaged in fraud, corruption or indiscretion, I will take action against them," the President said.
President Sirisena asked them to contribute the way forward which demonstrates specific characteristics of a government based on Good Governance. "Every attempt by the new government is not for private expectations, but for fulfilling common aspirations," he said. The President said this is the best time to employ the knowledge gained as intellectuals, for the benefit of the country.
He pointed out their ability to contribute to the national development programme through the engagement with researches required by the country.
University lecturers said they would do their best to bring the victory to the good governance programme.
