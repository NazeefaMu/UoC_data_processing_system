This is a story of a tragedy that had befallen a family due to the recent floods.   A university graduate daughter had lived with her mother and elder sister in a very enchanting village called Athwelthota in the district of Kalutara. Due to the landslide that occurred in this area recently, their house had been destroyed, and the whole village was filled with tears.   

As a result of this landslide, a large mountain range had fallen, covering the Baduraliya-Kalawana road and filling a part of Athwelthota water fall with earth. This is how this tragedy struck three families mercilessly.   

Having read her degree from the University of Sabaragamuwa, the victim named Priyanthi Pushpakumari (26) spent her life with her dear mother. According to the guidance given by her mother, she was able to build a house in the same place where they lived with high hopes of life. She was in the fervent hope of getting married to a youth in June, with whom she had developed a love affair while she was in the University.   

In spite of the fact that she had applied for employment, she did not get a suitable position in keeping with her qualifications. However she had decided to get married. Shattering all the hopes she had pinned on her life for a bright future, this tragedy had struck them unexpectedly.   

The family members of this house, K. Wimalawathi (65), her elder daughter Chamila Pushpakumari (32) and the younger daughter, Priyanthi Pushpakumari (26) lived together, sharing the ups and downs of life without depending on anyone. Wimalawathi’s husband had passed away about 5 years ago due to a cancer, after her elder daughter had got married.   

Having gone through all the trials and tribulations in their life, Wimalawathi was able to give her elder daughter in marriage and give higher education to her younger daughter. However, they had to face this unexpected tragedy. The other daughter, Nilanthi Pushpakumari who lived separately after marriage was able to escape from this tragedy.   

This is how she explained this unfortunate incident.   

“ I lost my mother and two sisters unfortunately. Our mother devoted her whole life for us. She carried out her duties towards these two sisters, keeping them at home. My younger sister finished her University education and came home with the hope of building her house and arranging her wedding. 

But, sadly that all her hopes were shattered. Before facing this tragedy, my mother telephoned me and asked whether I had been inconvenienced by the floods. She said that our house was not affected although the surrounding areas were submerged with water.

The river had overflowed due to the floods, but we never thought that our house would be destroyed by a landslide.  I am now faced with the problem of bearing up this tragedy. I could only wish them a good life in a future birth.”
