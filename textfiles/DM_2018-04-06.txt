Globular Earth vs. Radio Communication  Challenging theories in aid of tech advancements
	
If Marconi believed in physicists or was vulnerable to criticism of skeptics, no long distance communication would be available
Scientists bend or change their theories and invent new theories when their predictions go wrong
Western domination is prevailing over us by means of western science and technology
Ideas that seem weird or foolish in the view of current western science can be very useful ideas one day
We live in a world where the use of technology is seen everywhere. Our computers, mobile phones, television and lot of other things we use are results of technology.
When the word technology is mentioned the next word that comes immediately to our mind is science. Technology and Science; what a nice combination! What a collocation! Im sure you think these enhanced technological equipment are necessarily results of advanced scientific theories. Yes. I agree with you to some extent. However, what you are experiencing now is western science and western technology. Western domination is prevailing over us by means of western science and technology.
If we say western science is a medium for imperialism, many people (mostly the educated) start worrying. Are you going to the age when people thought the earth was flat Are you that mad What a nice world we are in now with this technology! You are going backward. How do we have this advanced technology without the utmost guidance of science Keep that rubbish with you. Most people would say. They would go much further and recommend a punishment. Dont use your computer; dont use your mobile phone; stop logging into Facebook; dont use internet. They are precious gifts of modern (western) science. If you are against it, dont use those things at all.
Most of them dont know that ancient Indians and Sri Lankans knew earth was a globe. I wrote about that explicitly in a previous article (Published on 2018.02.12 in the Daily Mirror). The funny side of the punishment is that most people dont know the story behind how wireless communication originated.
Radio waves and Marconi 
There was an Italian engineer named Guglielmo Marconi. Most of you may have heard of him. He was the inventor of radio and was a Nobel laureate too. Marconi had a great interest in radio waves. At that time radio waves were only used for scientific experiments and no one thought of using it as a long distance communication medium. Scientists said radio waves cannot be used for long distance communication because they are just like visual light. Therefore, the range of radio waves doesnt extend beyond the visual horizon. Marconi proposed to create radio communication systems and his proposal wasnt accepted in his homeland. However, Britain showed interest and he created several communication systems for the British.
Then Marconi was asked to create a transatlantic telecommunication system. It was supposed to facilitate direct wireless communication between America and England. He accepted the challenge and began to work.
Radio communication is done using electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves go along straight lines. Physicists at that time said that radio transmission between America and England was impossible because of the globular shape of the earth. The straight line attaching America and England is located inside the surface of the earth. As the waves that Marconi used were not powerful enough to penetrate the earth surface, it was thought as impossible to transmit radio waves between England and America.
Marconi didnt care much about these arguments and continued his work. Physicists and skeptics who chided Marconi continuously for his ignorance of physics were eager to see him fail. They thought Marconi was no more than a fool who believe that the Earth was flat. However such talk didnt deter Marconi from continuing with his work.
Then Marconi did a test and transmitted letter S in Morse code. Skeptics continuously attacked Marconi saying it was not a blind test because he knew it was the letter S which was expected to be transmitted. Marconi did several tests again, but skeptics and physicists kept on chiding Marconi.
Physicists and skeptics
However, when Marconi finished his work it was the skeptics and physicists who were dumbfound. It worked. Marconi sent a message from Canada to Nova Scotia in 1902 and in 1903 President Roosevelt sent a greeting to King Edward VII through the Massachusetts station Marconi built in 1901. In 1904 Marconi started the first commercial transatlantic service to send news summaries and in 1907 he started the first regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service. Marconi had the last laugh.
What happened to the physicists and skeptics They struggled with the problem as to how this was possible. Then physicists came up with a solution. They invented a new concept named ionosphere. They said there is a layer in the upper atmosphere which consists of ionized gas molecules. This layer reflects radio waves. The radio signal from America was transmitted to Europe after two reflections via the upper atmosphere.
This story explains how weird ideas aided advancement in technology. This is against the common belief. People usually think technology is strictly bounded by science. However, if Marconi believed in physicists or was vulnerable to criticism of skeptics, no long distance communication would be available today. Perhaps no ionosphere either! In the same way ideas that seem weird or foolish in the view of current western science can be very useful ideas one day. This story questions the usage of western science as the measuring instrument of knowledge.
Skeptics, realists and rationalists tend to label anything which cannot be explained by western science as a myth. If the things which were proved to be wrong by western science have become useful concepts one day, how can we reject anything on the basis that there is no western scientific explanation
Scientists bend or change their theories and invent new theories when their predictions go wrong, just as inventing the concept of ionosphere. Therefore, you shouldnt be afraid of western science or skeptics if you believe in reincarnation, karma, astrology, heavens or gods either. Who can say you are wrong just because they are non scientific
Marconi later became a member of the Fascist party of Benito Mussolini. Some of the Marconis patents were controversial. There were some people who claimed they invented the radio before Marconi. However, Marconi was the person who popularized radio communication systems.
As I mentioned in the beginning of this article we should invent our own science and technology to get rid of the domination of western science. We have to go against the established western scientific dogmas. We should not fear them. The so-called well-established ideas and proofs were challenged and beaten in the history of western science and technology too. Why cant we

Growth disorders in children
	
Each one grows and matures differently. If your child doesnt seem to be growing at the normal growth rate give his/her age, there is a fair possibility that such children may have a growth disorder which could affect individual development. The Health Capsule got in touch with Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital to shed more light on the topic

Growth disorders in children can be identified when the child has reached an age where physical development is quite prominent. If you notice that a childs height develops slower or rather faster than other children of the same age, there is a chance that the child may have a growth disorder
A growth disorder means that a child has an unusual growth. For an example, if your child seems to be growing slower or faster than other children of the same age, it could mean that the child has a growth disorder. It is important to remember that growth is a slow process and is measured over months and its a complex process between genetic, nutritional and hormonal factors. If there is no visibility of growth, the delay could be due to an underlying health condition or it could simply be due hereditary factors Dr. Karunaratne said. 
Some common growth disorders in children include, 

Growth hormone deficiency 
	Constitutional growth delay and delayed puberty 
Growth Hormone Deficiency
Growth Hormone Deficiency is a disorder that involves the pituitary gland which produces the growth hormone and other hormones. The growth hormone is needed for normal growth and development in children. 
Constitutional growth delay and delayed puberty
According to Dr. Karunaratne, constitutional growth delay and delayed puberty are common conditions in which puberty and its associated growth spurt occur at a later age than usual. 
Growth disorders in children can be identified when the child has reached an age where physical development is quite prominent. If you notice that a childs height develops slower or rather faster than other children of the same age, there is a chance that the child may have a growth disorder. When it comes to younger children, for example in infants, you could identify growth disorders if you pay attention to their weight and the ability to gain weight he added. 
As much as pathological reasons may be the cause for these growth disorders, the chances that these growth disorders are due to hormonal reasons are very likely. It is also extremely important that you pay attention to the genetic factors as well. For an example, the delay in growth and height could be due to genetic factors. The child may have parents who are either short or tall, and these genes may have been passed on to them. For an example, pygmys have a resistance to the growth hormone and its an inherent factor. These factors undoubtedly play a major part when it comes to the initial diagnosis. 

The most prominent symptoms of growth disorders other than the short stature are mostly hyperthyroidism in neonatal children. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland doesnt supply the proper amount of hormones that the body requires
The most prominent symptoms of growth disorders other than the short stature are mostly hyperthyroidism in neonatal children. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland doesnt supply the proper amount of hormones that the body requires. Thyroid hormones are important because they modulate energy metabolism and influences growth and development. The growth hormone (GH) is essential when it comes to the growth and development in children and this is produced by the pituitary gland. Too much growth hormone is also known to cause gigantism in children. Damaged pituitary glands are common in most children who seem to have growth disorders. Growth is a complex process and its of utmost importance that you pay attention to genetic, hormonal and nutritional factors when it comes to diagnosis and treatment thedoctor concluded.

Infighting cost them the chair
	
A main political party was in a position to easily take control of a mini-governing body in an area of rock-city fame because it commanded the majority in it, but it had lost the chair of the body to a party that had returned a lesser number of members,they say.
The rival Pohottuwa group was able to grab the chair of this local body due to the majority group woefully riven by dissention failed to field a unanimous choice for the chair.
The in-fighting in the majority group had started when a deputy purohita wielded his clout to have his wife elected to the chair which had sparked off immediate objections from some other members of the group who themselves were eyeing the position.
Finally, when the vote was taken, a dark horsefrom Pohottuwa won the chair.
Meanwhile, the activists of the majority groups political party are reportedly berating the members they returned to the mini-governing body using strong terms for turning the victory they offered them into a debacle.

## Title: Is Social Media an Addiction  or Illness 
## Section: Medicine
## Date: 6 April 2018 10:41 am
Is Social Media an Addiction  or Illness 
	
Its difficult to recall a period in the past which was similar to the past few weeks where the attention of the Sri Lankan general population was on social media and the internet. This was because of a temporary ban on social media, brought upon due to a lot of hate mail and visuals posted on this type of media which was threatening the peace in the country. The ban was extended to such a level that some even sought the assistance of the law, claiming it was a violation of human rights. In our attempt to reminisce and analyse this blackout of social media we decided to obtain the views of Dr. Kosala Amaranayake, MBBS, MD (Psychiatry) Consultant psychiatrist, Lecturer at the Teaching Hospital Peradeniya and Department of Psychiatry and Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya. 
Q Is there any good in social media  
One can argue that there is no good at all in social media. However in a superficial outlook people tend to infer that there are more advantages in social media than disadvantages. For example if you want to get hold of a childhood friend that you havent seen for years, all it takes is a matter of a few seconds of doing a search and one can locate this friend in social media. These efforts can be followed by sending a friend request. If the friend is operating under his true name, definitely you will find the friend on the social media within seconds. Then if you want to send a message you can send it within a fraction of a second. Not just the message if you wish to send that particular person a photo of yourself, you can use your phone with high definition camera and send a high quality photograph. However if social media is used responsibly only for the above reasons there is no doubt that there are more advantages compared to disadvantages in using social media. However is this the real picture of social media today 
Q Can someone be addicted to social media Is it an illness 
Some of the recent research studies reveal that people can be addicted to social media. But the recent classification systems of psychiatric disorders (ICD 10 and DSM 5) do not categorize these kinds of addictions as illnesses. However there are enough reports which suggest that some who are addicted to social media and the internet are being treated by psychiatrists considering the harmful effects caused by such tools in communication to the user.

If you want to check whether you have issues with social media, internet or to find out whether these tools have affected your life, ask the following question from yourself  

Are you obsessed with thoughts of using social media  
	Has the time you spend with social media increased over time  
	Do you use social media despite knowing its harmful effects 
	Do you feel lonely when you dont use social media  
	Do you neglect other alternative pleasurable activities to use social media 
	Do you use social media to distract your loneliness 
	Do you find it difficult to stop having access to social media  
 If your answer is yes to many of these questions there is a high possibility that you are negatively affected by social media or Internet. 
Q What are the negative effects of social media 
American Journal of Preventive medicine reports that people who use social media more often are more likely to be isolated in society. The Forbes journal reports that social media stimulates the feeling of sadness in many folds compared to the feeling of happiness. And at the same time it reports that social media curbs the skill of assessing the success of life correctly due to the fact that social media, most of the time, over estimates your achievements and underestimate your weaknesses. 
Many researchers worldwide report the detrimental effects of social media on children and adolescents. Sabatini and Sarracino from Italy report their research findings by using 50,000 social media users. They have come to the conclusion that people who use social media more often lose the trust they have in society. 
On the other hand people who excessively use social media may be having psychiatric conditions like depression and anxiety disorders for which they are using social media to cope up with the symptoms of these mental conditions. 
The electronic equipment used to access social media like computers, smartphones, tabs are an integral part of social media. Childhood and the adolescent period are the times that children acquire life skills. Therefore whatever negative effects their psychological development brings during this period can badly affect their whole life. 
When there was no social media or electronic equipment, children used to spend time with their parents, peers, siblings or the environment. This led them to acquire new social skills and improve existing skills. It is a known fact that the new generation of children and adolescent are spending most of their time with electronic equipment. This leads to poor development of physical as well as psychological skills leading to physical disorders like diabetes and psychological disorders like depression, anxiety disorders and etc. 
Poor impulse control is a major contributing factor of various types of problems seen in the modern society. This can range from a simple road traffic accident to a murder. Some of the studies revealed that social media, computer games and the internet can have negative effects on impulse control. These effects can be either direct or indirect.
Some studies identify anger in people who use violent games. These past times cause changes in the brain anger control centres. On the other hand the patience we acquired from waiting till the postman delivers the letters to the doorstep has vanished with the technological development. Now we are used to getting a reply in the form of a message, email or as a post on social media in double quick time. Some researchers hypothesize that these effects can impair a persons ability to control anger. 
The child who watches or experiences the violent character in the computer games or cartoons he or she watches, tries to mimic it. The shooting incidences occurring in most of the countries around the world provide good examples of these effects. Most of the countries are now in the process of making legislations either to ban or control violent cartoons, computer games etc. 
Due to lack of experience and considering only a limited number of factors when they make decisions, children tend to draw wrong conclusions and try to believe fully in what they see. Some capitalise on this psychological concept and operate with fake profiles in social media and to abuse children physically and psychologically. 
Q If you or your child is addicted to social media or using electronic equipment what must you do

Set the maximum time limit to one hour of using electronic equipment if your child is between 6 years and 12 years 
	Set the maximum time limit to half an hour of using electronic equipment if your child is between 2 years and 6 years 
	Do not allow children under 2 years to use such equipment
	Dont use your smartphone to ease the feeding of the child 
	Always let children use the electronic equipment with Parental Control option. 
	Dont allow children to be isolated with electronic equipment and always make them use it under supervision. 
	Do not allow children at all to watch violent content in films, cartoons, social media or in games 
Q What message would you give to the public on the careful use of social media 

Limit the time you spend on social media 
	Have self control when using social media 
	Do not post all your activities on social media 
	Be cautious when you communicate through social media, specially when you are depressed and anxious 
	Do not watch violent, impulsive content on social media 
	Do not believe everything as it is when you see something on social media 
	Do not believe what you see in social media as the reality 
	Always think that excessive social media usage is a waste of time 
	Do not compare your life with what you see in the social media. 
	Minimize exposing your personal life matters through social media 

The recent advancements in technology, the use of social media and the electronic equipment has been rapid. Using them without control leads to various physical and psychological consequences. If you are cautious and use them with control the detrimental effects of using social media and electronic equipment can be minimized. Dr. Amaranayake concludes this discussion leaving you to carefully think over whether the advancement of the technology has presented you with advantages or disadvantages.

Kavi Alexander  A poet of Sound The alchemy of the masters moving  molecules of air,  we capture by
	
This is where I learned that if one wanted to succeed one has to have an iron will and be incredibly disciplined
Improving reception or rather obtaining the best reproduction of sound turned out to be his lifelong passion
Sooriya Village attracts a lot of people who either in appearance or life are sadhu-like
Ive seen Kavi Alexander seated under the coccolaba tree at Sooriya Village, apparently one of the only two such trees in Sri Lanka, the other being at Peradeniya. With long hair and a longer beard, greying, Kavi looked quite ascetic. Except for this fact he was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. 
Sooriya Village attracts a lot of people who either in appearance or life are sadhu-like, so seeing Kavi seated there did not pique my curiosity, not even when he would stand up to greet people with hands clasped in the form of worship. 
Udena Wickramasooriya had told me about him months before. I did not remember what he told me. Thats because I am not into music the way Udena is. However, when Udena says you must meet this guy about anyone, I make a mental note of it. 
So Kavi Alexander was there. He had been there for more than a week. He even had a press conference which I was not too keen to attend. There are auspicious times for certain things and they cant be forced, I firmly believe. 
One auspicious morning, I said hello to Kavi. He duly stood up and greeted me. And then we talked for what seemed like hours. 
Official sanction was hard to get. Kavi realized that it was a minefield and that one needed to be a politician to get things done
Kavi Alexander was born in 1949 and spent his early years in Ratmalana and Mt Lavinia. He attended St Thomas College, Mt Lavinia. Perhaps it was all there already in his genes for his mother played the Karnatic violin, but apart from that first memory Kavi distinctly remembers going to church with her and listening to the radio: I was glued to Radio Ceylon; I wanted to put up antennas all over to improve reception. 
Improving reception or rather obtaining the best reproduction of sound turned out to be his lifelong passion, but he didnt know it back then. 
Kavi left Sri Lanka in 1968 and went to Paris. He was a hippie, he says. In Paris, he realized that his life would be in the arts. Perhaps in poetry or in sculpture or something else, he wasnt quite sure. 
I got an opportunity to play in the cast of the Hair production in Paris. As it turned out I was the only one who didnt take the clothes off. I was very Asian in that way. I wore a traditional white Indian outfit. Sri Lankas Ambassador to France at the time, Tissa Wijeratne, came for one of the performances with his wife and complimented me on this. He said Kavi, you are the only one who has not lost it! 
Hair had been running for a year by the time he joined the cast. All the dressing rooms had been taken by that time but two musicians, one French and one American, had invited Kavi to share their dressing room.  Wherever he went he made friends, apparently. He moved again, this time to Brussels. Maybe he was restless but in all likelihood, he followed his heart. Thats what took him to Mudra an experimental school run by the French choreographer Maurice Bjart. Bjart, the son of a French philosopher has spent some time in India where he had encountered Yoga and had been, in Kavis words, flipped out by Bharata Natyam which had later inspired him to produce the ballet Bhakthi. The six months he spent at Mudra was a life-changer for Kavi. He had turned up in jeans and believes that Bjart had probably felt that Kavi was passionate and deserved to begiven a chance. 
It was an amazing experience. This is where I learned that if one wanted to succeed one has to have an iron will and be incredibly disciplined. The idea behind Mudra was that it was not just dance but everything associated with dance; lighting, make-up, carpentry, everything. The first lesson actually was yoga! Anyway, I found my purpose there. I wanted to start a recording company. I wanted to record the music I love. And I decided that it had to be in the USA and not Europe.  Interestingly, Kavi, while still a schoolboy had written to John F Kennedy, volunteering to be an astronaut. The story got distorted of course. There are friends from that time who still tell me you are the bugger who wrote to Kennedy and got a reply! Thats not true. Kennedy never replied. 
Kavi set up his recording company, Water Lily Acoustics, in 1984. Not surprisingly it was an uphill battle. 
In Paris, he realized that his life would be in the arts. Perhaps in poetry or in sculpture or something else, he wasnt quite sure
I was scraping by. The company was always under-capitalized. Maybe the turning point was when I went to Ustad Ali Akbar Khan in California. I went to his school and said I wanted to record his concert. He looked me up and down. He agreed. So the next day I went, set things up, and recorded. He wanted me to put it out. That was the first record. It was a gift, in fact. Now I could say I recorded Ali Akbar Khan! 
Today Water Lily Acoustics is a Grammy Award winning record label and has recorded the great masters of both the West and East. Kavi is a purist, a perfectionist. He wanted and succeeded in capturing the music he loved in its purest form, especially the music of the Eastern world.  I realized that the great Eastern musicians had seldom been recorded properly, with care and attention on sound quality. The recordings that existed were of poor quality. 
Kavi has to date recorded Indian greats such as Padmavibushan Ustad Dr. Ali Akbar Khan, Padmabushan Professor V.G. Jog, Padmavibushan Pandit Jesraj, Padmabushan Dr. N. Ramani, Ustad Imrat Khan, Ustad Zia Fariddudin Dagar, Padmashri Dr. L Subramaniam, Padmashri V. M. Bhatt, Padmashri Kadri Gopalnath, Padmashri Ustad Rashid Khan, Chitravina N. Ravikiran, Swapan Chaudhuri, Guruvayur Dorai and T. H. Subashchandran. He also recorded the younger artistes, for example Dr. V. Balaji, Pandit Ronu Majumdar, Sukhvinder Singh Namdari, Abhijit Banerjee, Druba Ghosh, J.G.R. Krishnan, Thiagarajan Ramani, Shweta Jhaveri, Viji Krishnan andSangeetha Shankar. 
He has also recorded South American, Asian and African musicians, symphony orchestras including the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, the Saint Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, and the Hungarian National Philharmonic Orchestra, in addition to prominent North American and European musicians, many of whom are multiple Grammy Award winners. Music from recordings released by Water Lily Acoustics have been featured in the sound tracks of six major Hollywood films: Dead Man Walking, Two Days in the Valley, Primary Colours, Angel Eyes, One Hour Photo and Meet the Fockers, and also the Bon Jovi documentary The Circle. 
He has also paired musicians from diverse cultures, and the very first to pair and record Indian musicians of both the Karnatic and Hindustani schools with their Persian, Arab and Chinese counterparts, a trend copied byothers much later.
Today Water Lily Acoustics is a Grammy Award winning record label and has recorded the great masters of both the West and East

Kavi, for all his success, has pretty much the persona one is likely to assume when seeing him for the first time, seated under a tree, minding his own business, but quick to get on his feet and greet with hands clasped whoever says hello to him.  I live a hermits life. I live in the USA but I didnt know about 9/11 until two weeks later. 
Hes been away for decades but hes still very much rooted in Sri Lanka. 

I eat red rice imported from Sri Lanka, so I get all the minerals from my country. 
And yet, theres one dream that remains unfulfilled, he says. Kavi has for years wanted to record pirith. 
Manik Sandrasagara came up with the idea around 2005. This was during the war. We corresponded.
Manik told me that it was all insane. He felt that as a Tamil and the first Sri Lankan to win a Grammy, if I recorded the Buddhist chants it would have some impact. I had already recorded Quranic recitations and wanted to go to Ethiopia to record the Coptic liturgical chants. I found sense in what Manik said. I knew about the different Nikayas, but wanted to bring them together in some way, record them all, put the records together in a single box with four compartments. Something like that. CDs, booklets. 
It never happened. Official sanction was hard to get. Kavi realized that it was a minefield and that one needed to be a politician to get things done. Manik died. Kavi gave up. 
Kavi has been in Sri Lanka for almost a month now. He stays at Sooriya Village, upon Udenas invitation. He conducts workshops, talks about music and recording, traveling once to Batticaloa which is due to circumstances his ancestral place. My parents were from Jaffna. They came to Trincomalee by sailboat. It had taken them three weeks. Then they took a bullock cart to Batticaloa. Unfortunately they both died in the cyclone of 1978. Batticaloa is beautiful. I love the place. I visited my parents grave. 
Hes happy being here, this hermit who travels the world looking for great music which he can record for posterity, this sound-man who ironically is as much about silence as he is about music, this archivist of musical alchemy. Hes all about love, a different kind of love one might say.  Water Lily Acoustics has a website and the home page has a verse from Rumi which says a lot about the idea, the work and the man. Its an appropriate end point to this piece about this timeless man. 
Love is that whichnever sleeps,nor even rests, nor staysfor long with those that do.Love is languagethat cannot be said,or heard.

MIG aircraft deal: Six suspects noticed
	
The Colombo Fort Magistrate today issued notices on four individual suspects and a Ukrainian and Singapore business institutions during the magisterial inquiry on the US$14 million loss caused to the government when purchasing four Ukrainebuilt MiG 27 aircraft in 2006.
Among the suspects named in the report filed by FCID were two Singaporeans, two Ukrainians and a Ukrainian and Singaporean business entities. FCID requested court to direct the suspects to report to the FCID to record further statements.
Based on the evidence filed in Court, Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the two institutions and the suspects appeared to be directly involved in the MIG 27 transaction and as such the Court could consider issuing notices despite questions on the jurisdiction of the Court in issuing notices on foreign individuals.
Notices were issued on Singaporeans T.S. Lee and N.G. Lay Kim and Ukrainians  D.A. Peregudov and Mykola Kulayrkaiv and Belimsa Holdings and D.S. Alliance.
The case was fixed for June 29.
Earlier, the FCID confirmed the arrest of the first suspect, former ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga and told Court that the steps were being taken through the Foreign Affairs Ministry to bring him to Sri Lanka. (Yoshitha Perera and Shehan Chamika Silva)

MONLAR alleges Knuckles land given to associates of ministers
	
The Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform (MONLAR) claimed that 21 000 acres of land belonging to the Knuckles Mountain or Dumbara Range had been given to several close associates of some government ministers in order to carry out various projects and added that immediate steps should be taken to stop these proceedings.
MONLAR member environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara said in a statement on Wednesday that these lands which were managed by State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantation Limited had been given to close associates and relatives of two powerful ministers.
6 192 of 9 675 hectares belonged to State Plantations Corporation and 2 363 of 3 693 hectares belonged to and Elkaduwa Plantation Limited from the lands attached to the boundary of Knuckles Conservation Forest have been given accordingly. A total of 21 400 acres were given to these minister-associates, he said.
He said these lands had been given several companies including for a large-scale chicken farm, mineral mining of quarts and a large-scale hotel project. He also said that these proceedings were continuing by violating the provisions of the National Environmental Act in an illegal manner.
He said the Dumbara Range was a special biodiversity zone which contained climatic variations and added that it would not be permissible to get such a valuable resource destroyed because of the misuse of the lands belonged to it.
The related authorities should take immediate measures to take over the private forest lands which belong to the Knuckles Conservation Forest to the Wildlife Conservation Department. The politicians do not have any authority to give away those lands despite these lands being protected under a special legal frame, he added.
He said the government was in an attempt to establish a completely open economy by implementing new liberal economics by following the conditions of the International Monetary Fund and added that immediate steps should be taken to defeat these moves.
Meanwhile, Forest Conservation Departments Conservator General Anura Sathurusinghe told the Daily Mirror that the alleged lands were not included within the areas of the Knuckles Mountain range and added that those lands did not belong to the department accordingly.
Mr. Sathurusinghe said they had not yet been reported of such an incident as of now from the related authorities.
However, the department is going to take over several lands in the boundary of the Knuckles Mountain in the coming days. Therefore, we will check on these allegations in order to clarify whether those lands belonged to such lands which we would acquire, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

No faith motion triggered crisis in Govt.: Dinesh
	
Joint Opposition leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday the no-confidence motion had triggered huge crisis in the government where it would lose two-thirds majority in Parliament, which would create issues for the government when enacting certain Acts and Bills.
He told a news conference in Parliament complex that for the first time in history, some ministers in the Cabinet had voted against the Prime Minister and added that it was a beginning of a huge crisis.
A group in the government voted in favour of the no-confidence motion presented by us. The Prime Minister no longer has the majority support in the government, he said.
Mr. Gunawardane said it was the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which saved the Prime Minister under certain conditions.
He said even though the government was able to secure power in Parliament with a majority of MPs, it would not be able to address the issues of the people.
The government has no plan to address peoples issues, he said.
Mr. Gunawardane said the opposition leader R. Sampanthan should resign from his post as he voted against a no-faith motion aligning with the government.
We will force the Speaker and parliament to remove the opposition leader who voted against the no-faith motion with the government. The position should be given to the group headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Recruiters order SL women to take contraceptives before working in Gulf
	
Sri Lankan women who take up domestic work in the Middle East(ME) to support families devastated by conflict are being targeted by recruitment agents who order them to take contraceptives before leaving, the Guardian reported on Friday.
Six recruiters licensed by the Sri Lankan government has said they could provide an employer with a three-month guarantee that a maid would not become pregnant.
An agent from Gulf Jobs in Colombosaid: Before we can send a maid, there is a medical check-up by the government and no one can influence that. But once the medical test is done  there is a device we can give them. If you want it, we can arrange it.
While no women were prepared to speak openly about being forced to take contraceptives, the Guardian has found that many recruitment agencies make migrant workers take Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive that lasts for three months.
Rahini Bhaskaran, coordinator of Migrants Network, a migrant rights organisation, said women were so desperate for work that they complied unquestioningly with the stipulations of recruiters.
Most women dont know what the injections are for. They are not told anything about it, she said.
Bhaskaran believes the contraceptive serves a double purpose: covering up potential sexual assaults by recruitment agents and serving as a guarantee to prospective employers in the Gulf that workers will not get pregnant.
Some women think its necessary  to have sex with the agents to go abroad. The agents coax women, even promising marriage in some cases, and then abuse them, said Bhaskaran.
Typically single, divorced or widowed, or married to men who are no longer able to work, the women are victims of a growing pattern of abuse and coercion by agents and employers.

The experience of Saroja is indicative of the abusive behaviour that many endure. In 2016, a man turned up at her home in a small village in the northwith the offer of a job in the Middle East.
They came looking for me. They told me I could earn well if I went abroad and that they could help me to look after my family, she said.
Sarojas son was ill and thewar had left her husband disabled and her five sisters widowed.
Struggling to shoulder the burden of caring for her extended family single-handedly, she accepted the offer. She sold her jewellery to pay the agency the equivalent of 200 euros for training, and left her village inJaffna to take up employment as a household maid in Saudi Arabia.
But Saroja found it impossible to keep up with the cooking and cleaning required for the family of 12. She couldnt send any money home to her family because she was never paid. Then her demanding boss turned abusive.
My employer, he started beating me. I complained and he ripped off my clothes and I was just left in my underwear, she said.
Tamil women who endure such ordeals abroad are often stigmatised, as the need to work counters cultural tradition. Nonetheless, there are, and recruitment agencies fly in 40,000 foreign women a month to keep up with demand.
People are forced to do these things because of economic problems, said S.Senthurajah, executive director of Sond, an organisation that raises awareness of migration issues.
Women have far less opportunities here for employment. If shes poor or a widow, shes excluded from the community. We do our best, but its not enough,he said.
According to Senthurajah, the dangers have become accepted to the point where it is almost expected that women who migrate to work in the Middle East will face abuse or assault at the hands of their employers.
When a woman goes abroad its implicit shes going to be sexually active. The chance is high for abuse,he said.
Swairee Rupasinghe, coordinator for labour migration at the International Labour Organisation in Sri Lanka, said there was an economic imperative for recruiters to make women take contraceptives.
I see why the recruitment agencies organise it  because if found pregnant they would have to bare the cost of repatriation of the worker, so its in their interest to enforce it, said Rupasinghe.
Rothna Begum, womens rights researcher at Human Rights Watch saidmigrant domestic workers in the Gulf are treated as commodities by agencies and employers to the extent that their bodies and their choices are no longer theirs at the point of migration.
When they go into employment, its this power dynamic that allows exploitation and abuse to flourish.
After eight months in Saudi Arabia, Saroja eventually arrived home with less than a dollar in her pocket.
The agency keeps coming back telling me how poor we are and that I should go back for my children, she said.
But Ill never go back to Saudi Arabia again. I got nothing from it except pain. Im holding on to life just because of my children,she said.

Sri Jayewardenepura Uni organises Strangers 2018 The biggest adventure in life is to
	
Life is either a great adventure or nothing, yet the biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. While walking through the paths of life we come cross many strangers. 
Strangers is a leadership programme with adventurous games and activities organized by the Marketing Management Association (MMA) of the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce (FMSC) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJP). The Strangers is the only Sri Lankan inter-university room organized by a
single department.
The Strangers has its origins back to the year 2013. This event is exclusively for the first year students of the FMSC with the prime inception of strengthening friendly bonds among the fresh blood. While enriching their inspiration, motivation and a pinch of creativity and imagination, it provides a useful opportunity where one can learn and experience the fun of competing andteam spirit.
Accordingly, with the prime intention of strengthening tomorrows leadership by improving mental and physical fitness along with promoting good health and well-being, the programme, Strangers assist the participants to be fully equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes. Strangers commenced its opening ceremony on the 11th of June 2015 at the Kasa Gas Sewana of the USJP, with the participation of students from both local and foreign universities, several Sri Lankan artistes along with the other distinguished guests from the university, and the corporate sector. Strangers 2013 led off with the inauguration ceremony at the kasa gas sewana of USJP for the fourth time, with a magnificent step forward by opening up the romping adventure game to corporate members. Participants were clustered into ten groups. The adventurous game began and was conducted in Belihuloya and Ella for three days at a stretch, followed by a grand awarding ceremony.
The Strangers is an extraordinary opportunity to build Sri Lankan tourism, and most importantly, Strangers engages in various activities. Last year Strangers shouldered a special project regarding Dengue prevention and awareness. This year, Strangers 2018 is looking forward to launching many more innovative projects.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has instructed military leaders to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria as soon as possible and told them he wants Arab allies to take over and pay for stabilizing and reconstructing areas liberated from the Islamic State, according to senior U.S. officials.
In a meeting with top national security aides Tuesday, Trump backtracked on his public insistence that the troop exit was imminent, now that the militants were close to 100 percent defeated. Pressed by the president to tell him how much more time they needed to finish the job, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford Jr. said it would probably be months, not years, officials said.

In a letter sent to President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday, HRCSL Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama had explained that the HRCSL was the only body in the country which was permitted to handle the clearance protocol for UN Peacekeeping troops.
Dr. Udagama said that HRCSL received applications of 204 soldiers with a letter dated December 21, 2017 by the SL Army however before it concluded the clearance proceedings the HRCSL learned through reports that some 49 soldiers were sent to Lebanon.
She said that when inquired the Army confirmed that it had sent the troops to Lebanon.
We were astonished to hear this as the Army officially knew that it cannot send any troops on UN Peacekeeping missions without the clearance from the HRCSL. We were not informed that there was an urgent need to send 49 soldiers to Lebanon. By sending the troops without HRCSL clearance the Army had violated the agreement with the HRCSL, she added.
Dr.Udagama had stated in her letter to President Sirisena that the cooperation of the institutions which sends troops for UN Peacekeeping missions including the Tri forces and the police as an essential fact for the success of the duty. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

A still from the tele series Deveni Inima
Its happening at last; people are lining up on the streets and sitting in front of their television sets expecting a story that makes sense, flows, and rings true. They are tired of the perpetually elongated plot-lines, the exaggerated, facile acting, the false sense of expectation they get from the typical mega-series. Why should they feel otherwise The world has got smaller, busier, more hectic, while schoolboys, schoolgirls and teenagers are being bombarded by an onslaught of impossible deadlines and syllabi and classes, one after another. Obviously they dont want to feel left out by the art they purvey. They want movies, TV serials and plays that actually move them. In this sense, art has got closer to advertising; audiences dont want to feel that theyve been cheated. 
In advertising, that is the best kind of advertising, you dont bother to read the copy; you get carried away by the visuals, the best of which communicate the ideas that have been briefed on to be delivered. If this is the true function of advertising, I dont see any problem in bringing it closer to art, particularly since art, by its very definition at the hands of self-proclaimed auteurs today, seem to have been contorted to mean any object that requires a separate frame of reference (like a brochure) for its meaning to be clear. To these auteurs, technique is the magic word thatll make up for every and any flaw that besets their work, which is why so much of what they make is depressingly self-conscious, or makes them aware of their own self-touted greatness. The movies they shoot are hollow. But thats the elephant in the room and what their supporters in the press want to hide. 
If movies thrive on a culture of facile symbolism then television thrives on a culture of childish idiocy. Serials like Deveni Inima are an offshoot of the theme, overdrawn and hackneyed though it is, of young, naive love
Serious ideas 

People say its tough to film a serious idea or stage a play about serious ideas. Id beg to differ, if by serious ideas you mean themes that engulf a story to such an extent that human beings are presented as types rather than fleshed out individuals. At the end of Michelangelo Antonionis Blow Up, for instance, the dispossessed hero, bereft of any piece of evidence with which he can prove a murder that (he thinks) only he saw, plays imaginary tennis with a mime. The idea this was supposed to bring out (pick your favourite; the emptiness and sterility of contemporary society, the un-knowability of truth and reality, the agony of catharsis  so many, in fact) is there, laid down in clear-cut terms. But this expressionism, this in-your-face attack on modern, bourgeois life (which Blow Up spends a lot of time mincing and roasting, by the way) seems to say so much without saying nothing worthwhile. When the directors have nothing to say, they naturally resort to the easiest way of saying it: through the use of symbols. 
When artistes resort to these symbols, they arent really being inventive or for that matter expressive. They are merely making use of the meanings that audiences give to them. Asoka Handagamas Channa Kinnari, one of the most indecently beautiful movies Ive ever seen, suffers from this impediment in its portrayal of the boss (Tony Ranasinghe) and suffers even more after its first half, when that boss and the protagonist (Swarna Mallawarachchi) meet at the funeral of the latters husband. Even in an otherwise visionary and ambitious work like Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna, which is greater in every respect than that recent paean to sexual identity and liberation, Frangipani, the use of symbols, especially that last sequence where, after our protagonist is led away by the police, a little girl provocatively sports a moustache, is (for the lack of a better way of putting it) so obtrusively symbolic that we lose the larger meaning the story tried to highlight. (Need I mention the pacifier-sucking doctor, played by W. Jayasiri) We are so captivated by the in-your-face apparentness of this tiny detail that we are led to forget the rest of the narrative. Unfortunately, that is not a strength. 
If movies thrive on a culture of facile symbolism then television thrives on a culture of childish idiocy. Serials like Deveni Inima are an offshoot of the theme, overdrawn and hackneyed though it is, of young, naive love. Its a theme thats been treated elsewhere, with more intelligence, by other writers and directors, but as with all such themes its been bogged down and simplified over the decades in a very crude way. When trends are set down by scriptwriters, other scriptwriters and directors are quick to follow them; not just Deveni Inima, but also Sidu (what episode would we see next, and what plot-line it would delve into before casually moving away from it), which revolved around the little monk Soratha despite the fact that it has nothing to do with the little monk, because his popularity proved to be so unavoidable, as time went by, that the writers had to change the plot to focus on him; this split over to the television remake of Handaya, which also has a little monk-figure (that the film did not have). Its condescension at one level; television producers assume our preferences, then dish them out one after the other hoping to get higher ratings, through us. 
Imagined, fantasised juvenile versions
Deveni Inima appeals most discernibly to the demographic that none of its leading players comes from: pubescent or pre-pubescent, predominantly school-going, and more often than not male. In other words, the actors are all playing out their imagined, fantasised juvenile versions of themselves. The changes in mood- from friendliness to confrontation and vengeance- which demarcate the relationships between the male students in it, are so incongruous. Sometimes I wonder whether the story is heading somewhere at all; perhaps all were reacting to in a mega-serial like Deveni Inima are the predictable elements and details: the forever unfulfilled girl, the forever cricket-playing boy, and the forever-doomed-to-be-alone-and-bespectacled sidekick. We identify with these characters, who happen to be types rather than individuals, because we want to be like them in real life; in our schools and in our tuition classes and, if were lucky enough, with our girlfriends! 
If Deveni Inima is said to be corrupting our youth, the same way that, decades ago, a book or film like Golu Hadawatha was, its simply not true. Mainstream television shows arent corrupting our youth, theyre alienating them and idiot-ising them in more ways than one. Theyre profoundly shallow the same way that art house movies are shallowly profound; they play on what audiences expect them to play on, without providing anything substantively new. 
One of the most peculiar qualities of the modern sensibility is its habit of treating the young as the adults they are not while considering them as naive and gullible. Deveni Inima puts this quality to (despicably) good use, firstly by casting overgrown actors and then by turning them to undersized, juvenile versions of themselves. This has the effect of jacking up the ratings, since through that crude method both adults and youngsters are lured in, never mind the fact that nothing new comes out of the episodes in the first place. I think the more accurate indictment to throw at these shows, consequently, is the fact that its obfuscating to and cheating on the youth. More than 300 episodes on, we are seeing the same characters engaging in the same things, perhaps a little more strongly. The truism that familiarity breeds contempt doesnt work out in our television industry; thats why these rehashed, recycled elements and plot-lines still enrapture audiences. The young of today are being tricked, and grossly so. 
Deveni Inima appeals most discernibly to the demographic that none of its leading players comes from: pubescent or pre-pubescent, predominantly school-going, and more often than not male
But then theres that trend I pointed out at the beginning; this demographic clamour for more and dont want a work of art to upend them and their expectations. If they still indulge in the fantasies of a Deveni Inima (which, by the way, are rather male-centric, since its audience happens to be schoolboys who dream of schoolgirls who in turn dream of schoolboys chasing them), they are indulging in the way those fantasies tend to project their idealised versions of themselves; who can sing perfectly, strum the guitar perfectly, and entrance any girl they want the way they want. The movies, particularly the art house movies, pretend that we dont know whats going on in them (so the director has the opportunity to explain everything to us); the mega-series, like what Ive outlined above, pretend that we know everything thats going on in them (so the scriptwriters dont have to add anything new to the narrative). On both counts, its a subtle and insidious form of condescension, and on both count, stereotypes and cardboard cut-outs eventually become the norm. The only real difference is that the former are obscurantist and the latter populist. But when accounting for this difference, theres really nothing that separates one from the other. Audiences are clamouring for more of what these films and shows cant deliver; an honestly conceived, fleshed out story that neither leaves you in the dark nor makes you feel titillated by the tropes in them that play on your adolescent fantasies. Our youth should ideally be the yardstick by which we measure the popularity or lack thereof of our cinema and television industry. Thats why we should welcome a Ho Gana Pokuna, a Koombiyo, and more recently, a Vaishnavee.

Brazils Lula likely to go behind bars
	
RIO AFP JANEIRO, April5, 2018 - Brazils former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was almost sure to go to prison next week after a Supreme Court ruling likely doomed his plan to return to power in October elections, leaving Latin Americas biggest country in a divided, angry mood Thursday. 
Lawyers for the founder of Brazils leftist Workers Party can wait until Monday to file a final, purely technical appeal with the lower court that in January sentenced Lula to 12 years and one month for corruption. 
The appeal would almost certainly be quickly rejected and Lula, once one of the worlds most popular politicians, would be ordered to start his sentence immediately. 
Lula, who despite his legal problems leads easily in opinion polls ahead of the upcoming presidential election, had hoped the Supreme Court would grant him liberty while he appealed his conviction in higher courts.

Computer Vision Syndrome ruins your vision  !
	
your wellbeing

Do not stare at digital devices in total darkness
	Computer vision syndrome affects 75% of people who work on computers
Computer eye strain has become a major job-related complain. The problems range from physical fatigue, decreased productivity and more work errors. University of Iowa Health Care says computer vision syndrome affects 75% of people who work on computers. 
From dry eyes, redness, eye fatigue to headaches theres a catch  all terms for any screen induced- discomfort: Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) says Dr. M. Wijayatunga, a retired Consultant Eye Surgeon who was attached to the Ragama Teaching Hospital.
Dr. Wijayatunga says that despite the causes for CVS being many, the most prominent symptoms are dryness and fatigue in the eye. It is also referred to as Digital Eye Strain. 
The longer someone stares at digital screens, the chances are high to develop CVS. And those who are already having dry eyes for other reasons, might find it really difficult to stare at the digital devices for long, adds Dr. Wijayatunga. 
The wetness of eyes depends on the tears. Blinking brings a thin layer of tears, which are produced by the lacrimal glands situated above each eyeball. The glands are secreting a small amount of tears. A film of tear fluid is spread across the eye surface by the eyelids. This thin film of tears include three layers - oil, water and mucus. Oil layer stops evaporation of water layer by covering it. Tears prevent dryness by coating in the eye as well as saving it from outside irritants. The sole oxygen and nutrients provider lubricates the eyes smoothing the surface of our eyes, so that light is refracted correctly enabling us to see clearly. explains Dr. Wijayatunga. 
The science of blinking
We forget to blink while staring at a digital screen (mobile phones, laptop, or the monitor) and continue looking, which causes dry eyes in return. The average person blinks some 15 - 20 times per minute and while staring at a digital screen they dont blink once per minute. As a result, the eye becomes dry, causing grittiness and irritation. Dr. Wijayatunga says. 
The official scientific journal of the National Academy of Sciences in United States, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science published the results of a scientific research of blinking, conducted by a group of Japanese scientists. They guessed the blink might be a subconscious activity, a mental resting point, to briefly shut off visual stimuli and allow us to focus our attention better. 
Symptomsof CVS
The WebMed says; research reveals that between 50% -90% of people who work at a computer screen have at least some of the following symptoms. 

Dryness
	Irritation
	Red eye
	Headaches
	Blurred vision
	Tearing
	Eye strain and pain
	Neck and shoulder pain
	Discomfort in the eye
Causes for CVS

Poor lighting 
	Glare on the digital screen
	Air Condition machines  The humidity in our country is high compared with cold countries and therefore we dont have the dry eye syndrome. But the dryness is high within an Air Conditioned room and the protective layer of tears evaporate swiftly causing threats to eye health. 
	Staring at electronic screens for a long period of time. 

Rule of 20
Every 20 minutes, look away from digital screens at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This gives your eye muscles a rest and helps ward off fatigue and strain. Follow these tips for relief

Focus half a minute at a distant object, at least for a few seconds. 
	Try to blink as much as possible to keep your eyes moist. 
	Keep a water basin if you are in an A/C room, somewhere closer to you so that the humidity will protect your eyes from drying up. 
	Use digital devices consciously. 
	Have a routine comprehensive eye exam. 
	Wash or wipe your face with water to avoid dryness and irritation. 
	If you have any refractive problems in the eyes, meet your doctor and wear glasses. 
	If you are using an old style monitor (CRT), go for a LCD monitor. 
	Adjust the brightness and contrast of the monitor, screen to a comfortable level. This level depends on the lighting of surrounding area. Try to keep a good harmony between the lights in surrounding area and lighting in the monitor. 
	Dont wear reading glasses for computer. Use proper eye wear while using computers especially if you are older than 40. If you are staring at the computer for more than 5- 6 hours, use glasses which prevents dryness and protect eyes from radiation of digital screens. 
	Enlarge the font or page size so that you can read without straining eyes. 
	Close blinds which are disturbing to the eyes. 
	Do not stare at digital devices in total darkness. 
	Maintain good posture and do not sit too close to the computer. It should always be at an arms length. 
	Do not hold your mobile phone so near to your face; closer the object it is harder for the eyes to focus on. 
	Restrict the amount of time you are spending in front of electronic screens. 
	Children who play with mobile phones and computers for longer hours might develop eye fatigue, which is common with adults too. This is critical for the eyes of children because their eyes are growing, Dr. Wijayatunga said.

Daddy is fine and Im coming home
	
Poisoned Russian spys daughter
Yulia Skripal (who was poisoned along with her ex-spy father) has spoken for the first time since she was attacked with nerve gas as she revealed her daddy is fine and that she will be able to leave hospital within days.
The 33-year-old said her strength is growing daily and thanked the people of Salisbury for helping her and her father, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66.
The attack left the Skripals in a critical condition, but it was revealed last week that Yulia was getting better, while her father was still in a critical but stable condition.
Her statement was released during a press conference by ambassador Alexander Yakovenko, in which he repeated Moscows denial of responsibility for the attack. 
Mr Yakovenko said Russia had not produced the Novichok nerve agent, adding there was a lot of suspicion about Britain over a string of deaths of Russians in the UK. Todays development could prove key to the investigation into the attack, as Yulia could soon be able to tell police about the moments before they collapsed in a park.

I hope that youll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence
In her first statement since coming out of a coma, Yulia said: I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily.
I hope that youll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence.
It comes after Mr Skripals niece Viktoria revealed that she had received a phone call from Yulia at 10.30am this morning.

## Title: Engaging in a traditional job is not a hindrance to Rupikas livelihood

Engaging in a traditional job is not a hindrance to Rupikas livelihood
	
We live in a time when traditional employments are becoming endangered occupations in the face of the development of the society with science and technology. The young men who have got used to adopt their style with new trends, thinking in terms of scientific and technological development, have turned a blind eye on such jobs for reasons best knownto them in thismodern society.
However, there are many women who have never hesitated to take up challenges in life even amidst the difficulties. This is the story of a woman who is engaged in shaping and fabricating iron in a traditional smithy which is considered to be obsolete today. 
Journalists have gone to meet a woman who was engaged in striking and shaping red-hot iron on an anvil holding the piece of iron with finger tips like a head of a rattle snake. She works hard like an iron from morning till night ignoring the sweat with which her whole body is covered. She is H.M. Rupika Damayanthi whose place of work is a smithy located in Maharachchimulla area in Alawwa. 
Although she was sharpening a blade of a knife, chewing betel, she kindly beamed at the journalists in a gesture of receiving them. 
She asked, Gentlemen, what made you to come this side Are you going to write to a newspaper Pleases wait a little, the blade of this knife is out of shape. It can be brought back to the natural shape when it becomes red hot. Let us talk after finishing that work.
In the meantime, she began to put some pieces of coconut embers on to the blade and struck the blade with a hammer keeping it on the anvil. Its noise echoed and re-echoed in the environment. She got the help from her assistant, Nandasena to strike the blade in turn using two sledge hammers, disregarding the
continuous perspiration. 
Now, the shape of the knife is brought back, she said.

When delving into her past life story, she said, I was born in 1983. Our parents took great pains to bring us up and educate us. I studied up to the G.C.E. O/L examination and did not pursue further education. I did sundry work without wasting time. In the meantime, I came across a good husband who loves me. He is K.M.Sugath Kumara. I had never gone to a smithy when I got married. 
I was born in 1983. Our parents took great pains to bring us up and educate us. I studied up to the G.C.E. O/L examination and did not pursue further education. I did sundry work without wasting time
She said further that her husband had started a smithy close to her home and began to make various kinds of domestic tools such as knives, machetes, chopping knives, spikes for husking coconuts and coconut scrapers with the assistance of Nandasena. Having gained an experience of making tools with them , she was able to work in the smithy alone. 
With the passage of time, they were able to start a smithy on a leased land in Maharachchimulla town. She said it is a successfully on-going business with a good income and the iron- products are sold at the weekly fairby her husband. 
According to her, any kind of domestic tools can be made by them and with the good income gained by their profitable business, they lead a good life with their two children who are in grades eight and five. Arrangements are being made by them to impart good education for their children while working and doing
household chores. 
She said proudly that it is not the difference between the male or female that matters in doing an industry successfully but the grits, guts and determination that lead to their success. 
There are many women who struggle with iron like Rupika to achieve the success of their forward march towards a better life, but the crux of the question is to ask whether this kind of women had been given a due place in society as a moving force 
The time has come for the government to give a due place to women, and we all have to appreciate the role being played by women towards the development of the society.
