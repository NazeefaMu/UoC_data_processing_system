Sebastianite Sandaruwan going great guns

 
Sandaruwan Fernando scored an attractive unbeaten 101 runs against Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya in their inter-school around first elevent cricket match worked off at Moratuwa.
During the course of his epic knock he had fourteen hits to the rope and faced 161 balls and occupied the crease for 271 minutes and Palians replied with 271 with their Skipper Himasha Liyanage too missing a very well compiled knock of 195 runs which is their highest score versus either schools.
Sandaruwan was mainly responsible for the Sebs big score of 321 for 8 declared which enabled Sebs to beat Palians on first innings by 50 runs. In their first essay he was unlucky to be run out and missed a well deserved century by three runs and had he scored a century in the first innings he might be the first Sebastianite to achieve this rare feat to score twin centuries in a school encounter at their home grounds. He is coached by Imal Boteju, a former Nalandian cricketer.
