Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera today said he would be always standing to safeguard the Rajapaksa family just as he did in the past.

Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, Minister Amaraweera said he is personally against any harm done to the Rajapaksa family. Further he said he is making this statement excluding the allegations on the Rajapaksa family of financial frauds and other corrupt actions.

Meanwhile, he said the Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP) would not break up and no one would be able to divide it as they have taken steps to avoid the splitting up of the party.

“The SLFP has decided to re-organize the party through ground level programmes. We have also planned to continue with the district level conferences. There is a weakening in the women’s organization of the SLFP and we have taken steps to re-organize these organizations with a new spirit. In addition to that we have taken steps to empower the central organization also," he added.

Further he said the SLFP had successfully held conferences in Northern Province which is a significant factor for reconciliation. There is a noticeable development in the participation of Tamil youth at these conferences.

“We are in terms that the country is our priority, not the party. We are working towards the betterment of the country. Nevertheless we would not ditch our party also,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
