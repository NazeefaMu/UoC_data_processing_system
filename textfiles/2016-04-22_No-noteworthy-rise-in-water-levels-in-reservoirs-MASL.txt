There was no notable change in the water levels in the major reservoirs even though heavy showers were experienced in the catchment areas in the past couple of days, the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) said today.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, MASL Water Management Secretariat Director Thilaka Samaratunga said the water had still not started filling into the reservoirs despite the heavy showers. “Although no significant improvement was witnessed in the water levels of the reservoirs, this would have a bearing on the production of power as there are adequate water resources available,” she said.

She said the only issue was in the Kotmale Reservoir as the water levels there were low in comparison to the other reservoirs. “The water levels of the Kotmale Reservoir had only shown a one or two per cent rise even with the showers experienced in the area recently,” she added.
