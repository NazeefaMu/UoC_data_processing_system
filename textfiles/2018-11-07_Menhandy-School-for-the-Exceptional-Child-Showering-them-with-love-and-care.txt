The lack of resources and knowledge in caring for the differently abled children, not forgetting the social stigma associated with them, has made life difficult and challenging for these individuals. They deserve to be treated better, shown more love and given attention compared to other children. Taking care of these differently abled children is costly and becomes a burden for parents of low income families. In an era where there are less than a handful of schools catering to the differently abled children in Sri Lanka, ‘Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child’ has done creditably well. 

 


The school which commenced with only five students later expanded to an institution catering to 32 students affected either by Autism, Hyperactivity, Down’s Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy


Located in Dehiwala, ‘Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child’ is a day school for the differently abled and also for children with special needs. ‘Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child’ Director Satha S. Rajanayagam, a chartered accountant by profession, had come up with the idea of establishing such a school when he was in Seychelles and volunteered in a school for the differently abled children and children with special needs. Eventually, when he returned to Sri Lanka with his wife, he wanted to make his dream a reality by starting ‘Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child’.



The school was established in 2013 and registered under the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare. The school which commenced with only five students later expanded to an institution catering to 32 students affected either by Autism, Hyperactivity, Down’s Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy. ‘Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child’ aims to cater to students hailing from low income families while providing them with daily transport, meals and swimming lessons, training in dancing and special therapies. They engage in fun activities like making cards, which are later sold for fundraising initiatives. 


‘Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child’ was initially established with a personal investment and later attracted donations from well-wishers, individuals and the corporate sector. These contributions helped immensely in the school’s development

The School currently lacks a van and a three-wheeler to meet its daily transport requirements. They are looking for volunteers to join their staff, which has a strength of only 10 members. The staff at ‘Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child’ also emphasised that individuals can celebrate their birthdays, anniversaries and other especial occasions at this institute because they are of the opinion that sharing such happy occasions with these children will be immensely 
helpful to them.
