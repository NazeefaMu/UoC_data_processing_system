Fertiliser subsidy not cut - Gayantha

Parliamentary Reforms, Media Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said the government had not curtailed fertiliser subsidy to farmers.
He was addressing the press during a Cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary complex yesterday. The minister said the government has increased the allocation for fertiliser subsidy by Rs. 2,500 million, when compared to the allocation by the previous government.
"The previous government's allocation was Rs. 35,000 million, we have allocated Rs 37,500 million to provide fertiliser subsidy. The opposition is trying to mislead the public," he said.
"It is the previous regime which distributed substandard chemical fertiliser to farmers leading to the to the spread of kidney disease. Our attempt is to give the money directly to the hands of farmers, so that they could decide whether to buy compost fertiliser or chemical fertiliser of a good standard," the minister said.
He noted that the government had also banned the importation of several harmful agro-chemicals as a measure to control the chronic kidney disease (CKDU).
Meanwhile, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the fertiliser subsidy has been extended to all farmers including those who cultivated paddy, tea, rubber, coconut and vegetables. The minister added that the rapid spread of CKDU was alarming. "Politicians should not be bankrupt to the extent of protesting against progressive proposals. We have to allocate millions from this budget to install dialysis machines and RO plants," he said. "These are heavy burdens for the Government. This is a worse threat than the war," the minister said.
"Therefore we need to encourage farmers to get rid of chemical fertiliser," he concluded.
