Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will go before the Presidential Commission probing the bond issue and will answer all that is asked from him in detail, sources from his office said yesterday.

Sources from the Prime Minister’s office told the Daily Mirror that he will provide details on 16 matters pertaining to the bond issue as requested by the commission.

It is likely that he will go before the commission next week, these sources said.

This follows an assurance given earlier by the Prime Minister to appear before the Commission to provide answers to the references allegedly made to him by several individuals in the course of the probe carried out into the bond issue. (Yohan Perera)
