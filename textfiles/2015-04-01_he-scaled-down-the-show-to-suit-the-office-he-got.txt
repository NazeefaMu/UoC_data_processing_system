	A high-up in the new government from Uva summoned his active supporters in the district for a powwow at his residence a few days ahead of the swearing-in ceremony.

   He told them: “I am getting a good portfolio at Cabinet level. So you people should arrange a grand reception for me on my return from the swearing- in ceremony.” “Hurrah!” the supporters cried out in glee. “We are going to put up cut-outs, banners and posters everywhere. We will turn the entire area into one big carnival.” Well-heeled with funds from a generous master, the enthusiastic followers lost no time in buckling down to the task on hand.
Highly pleased with the pomp and fanfare organized by his faithful followers, the politico dressed in his Sunday best left for Colombo for the swearing-in.  Once at the main secretariat, the politico found to his shock and dismay that he was billed to get only a deputy office. However, he soon resigned himself to the unforeseen situation deriving solace from the thought that something was better than nothing. Then he remembered the grand reception befitting a VIP of Cabinet rank organized by his followers.  He immediately rang up the supporters who played a lead role in organizing the reception. “Dismantle all pandals and cutouts, remove all banners,” he told them.
The supporters who were working day and night to make the event a success, were taken aback by this order. “Why do you want to send all our efforts down the drain? Haven’t they given you what you expected?” they asked.
“I am getting something – a deputy office and it is not worth making a big fuss about!” was the politico’s stock reply to them all.
