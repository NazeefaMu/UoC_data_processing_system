A Flydubai Boeing aircraft has suffered a bird strike while landing at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) this morning resulting in a flight delay of more than six hours, a Flydubai spokesman said.

He said the flight carrying 166 passengers landed at the MRIA at 7.15 am and departed at 14:32  pm and that an engineer from the Jet airways had to be called in to MRIA to attend to the aircraft as engineers from the SriLankan airlines were not permitted to attend to repairs of Boeing aircraft.

“Flydubai flight FZ551 from Colombo to Mattala experienced a bird strike on landing at Mattala Airport. As a result, the return flight from Mattala to Dubai was delayed by 6 hours and 42 minutes and passengers were provided with refreshments in the terminal. We apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused to their travel schedules,” the spokesperson said.
