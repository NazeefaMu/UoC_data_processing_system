The newly appointed 12 member committee which was elected in a secret ballot of the UNP Parliamentary Group will act as a permanent politburo of the party, Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.

The politburo members would therefore be: Navin Dissanayake, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Harin Fernando, Ranjith Maddduma Bandara, Mangala Samaraweera, Ajith P Perera, Eran Wickramaratne, J C Alawathuwela, Ruwan Wijewardene, Gayantha Karunatilleke, Nalin Bandara and Asoka Priyantha. UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa and Assistant Leader Ravi Karuanayake will be ex-officio members of the politburo.

“This committee will be a permanent one as it was elected in a secret ballot and will have the power to make decisions for the party. Its initial task will be to decide on new office bearers of the party,” Mr. Kariawasam said. He said new office bearers will be appointed before April 30, 2018.

Accordingly, the Minister said the new general secretary and other posts will be decided upon by this committee. He revealed that General Secretary Kabir Hashim, Treasurer Eran Wickramaratne had already resigned from their positions from the party and others will also follow through shortly.

The Minister also said the present leader Ranil Wickremesinghe will remain as per the party constitution which says whoever holding the presidency or the Prime Minister’s post should be the leader of the party. (Yohan Perera)
