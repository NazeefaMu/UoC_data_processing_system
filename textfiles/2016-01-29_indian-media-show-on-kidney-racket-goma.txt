The Government Medical Officers Association of Sri Lanka (GMOA) yesterday alleged the recent ‘Indian media show’ on the kidney racket which allegedly involving some Sri Lankan doctors was handled by an Indian anesthetist who had been sacked by a Colombo based private hospital.
GMOA Secretary Nalinda Herath said according to sources, the particular Indian anesthetist was a close relative of a Superintendent of the Indian Police who was handing investigations into the alleged kidney transplant scandal.
The Indian anesthetist had been working in the kidney care unit at the Sri Lankan private hospital, Dr. Herath said.
“After he was interdicted over certain reasons, he allegedly threatened the administration of the private hospital that he would somehow stop carrying out kidney transplants in the hospital. We are yet to verify his name and other details. Once we get them, we will be provide them to the media,” GMOA Secretary Dr. Herath stated.He also accused the Indian media of trying to damage the reputation of the Sri Lankan medical industry through this case because the GMOA openly objected the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) to be signed with India.
