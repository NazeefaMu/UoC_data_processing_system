Matale Somu has written 25 books in Tamil, among which are several novels, short stories, literary pieces and travelogues. His book on ‘the wonders of Tamil indigenous medicine’ was his masterpiece, acclaimed by many scholars interested in this discipline. Although he lives in Australia, he still remembers his motherland, language and his people. And that is the reason why he is appreciated by the Tamil literary circles nationally and abroad. He is also acclaimed for his writings on themes pertaining to the living conditions of his people. This book under the title ‘KANDY SEEMAI’ depicts the sufferings and anguish of these people during their departure from India to Sri Lanka during the 1820s.

The title is of some significance. During the 19th Century the upcountry was known as Kandy and the word SEEMAI literally refers to England, but idiomatically it refers to resourceful. Hence the meaning is resourceful Kandy or upcountry where there were opportunities for employment and well-being. Matale Somu has done a historical research by analyzing the information from writings of The British who lived during the same period. The novel is mostly based on authentic historical facts as revealed by Professors K.M.De Silva, Basthiam Pillai and Balasingam in their studies, on the same period of British rule.  

The first copy of this novel will be presented to Omar Hassim, a  philanthropist. A review of the book will be done by Thilakaraj M.P.. Literary luminaries like Telbedde Joseph, P.P.Devaraj and Antony Jeeva are expected to grace the occasion.
