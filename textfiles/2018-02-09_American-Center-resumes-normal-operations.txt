Operations at the American Center in Colombo which is being operated by the US government has returned back to normal, the US Embassy said a short while ago.

“The U.S. Embassy has returned to normal operations,” the Embassy said in a tweet.

The Daily Mail reported that the US House of Representatives had narrowly passed a sweeping bipartisan budget deal, ending an hours-long government shutdown and clearing the way for huge increases in both defence and domestic spending.

The 240-186 vote sends the 400 billion dollars (£287 billion) spending plan to President Donald Trump, who has promised to sign it.

Passage of the measure came over the opposition of Democratic leaders who demanded the promise of a vote to protect “Dreamer” immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.
A band of tea party Republicans was also against the legislation over what it sees as spiralling spending levels.

The government shut down at midnight on Thursday after Kentucky senator Rand Paul blocked plans for a quick senate vote, blaming his fellow Republicans for being “complicit” in the looming return of trillion-dollar budget deficits.
