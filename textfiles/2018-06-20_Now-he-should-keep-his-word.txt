Now he should keep his word


	



 

Several Green members were engaged in an animated discussion in the assembly lobby the other day. 

 


The topic was the latest rumour that some backbenchers were to be raised to deputy and state level. 
Most of them were inclined to believe the rumour. They appeared exited and hopeful. However, one young member from the South pooh-poohed the very suggestion. “Are you all mad, Machang?”  he derided their expectations. “Take my word…This will never happen…!”


A gabby Banda from Wayamba spoke up: “This is not a mere rumour. I know for sure that some of us are going to become deputies and state level ones soon!”


 The young member from the South again dismissed as rubbish the prospect they all seemed excited about.  “I am not as gullible as you are!” he said. 


The Wayamba man was not prepared to let his assurance be disdained. “There is no use in arguing about it!” he said: “Are you prepared to take a bet on it?”


The member from the South readily accepted the challenge and said: 


“Okay. If what you say doesn’t come true, you should move on your bum from the entrance gate up to the council here. If it comes true, I will crawl the distance the same way! On my bum!”
And the duo shook hands on it!


A few days later, the Wayamba man saw his colleague from the South at a distance and hailed him: “Machang, what about the bet?”  Pat came the reply: “That stands! Get ready for the bum walk!”
What the member from the South never expected happened a week later. Both members involved in the bet found themselves raised to deputy level. 


Now they all are looking forward to the spectacle of the member from South paying the penance of pushing himself forward on his posterior from the entrance gate to the council for losing his bet!
