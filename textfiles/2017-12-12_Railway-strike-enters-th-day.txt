Railway strike enters 6th day


	

The Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA) said today it would continue with the work stoppage now on its sixth day despite President Maithripala Sirisena requesting all strikers to report for work

Earlier the President requested the strikers to report for duty considering the difficulties faced by the people and the students sitting the GCE O/L examination.

RTUA co-convener Lal Ariyaratne told Daily Mirror if the President or the Prime Minister intervenes in resolving railway strike, the union would consider operating trains at least for the sake of students sitting the GCE O/L examination.

He said none of the higher officials had intervened in resolving this matter and were determined to continue the work stoppage. Mr. Ariyaratne said the unions have been called for discussions today at Sethsiripaya in Battaramulla.

"We have been compelled to continue with the work stoppage because instead of resolving this matter the President had declared the railway services as essential service.

Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation and Transport Ministry said steps were being taken to operate at least 40 trains to enable students sitting the O/L examination and other train travellers.

Railways General Manager Mahanama Abeywickrama said seven trade unions which had joined the railway strike had reported for duty. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Darshana Sanjeewa)
