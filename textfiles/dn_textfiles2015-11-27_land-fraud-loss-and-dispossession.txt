In the land of fraud, loss and dispossession

This essay is a continuation of the article 'Land fraud, land loss and land rights', published on November 23. It addressed the issue of land fraud, land loss and linked problems. This essay deals with precautions that land owners and buyers could undertake in order to prevent land fraud, reforms and change that need to be brought in and also the extent of land dispossession in Sri Lanka.
What land owners and buyers need to know
Despite the efforts made to curb the presence of land fraud in Sri Lanka, it is still a prevalent issue. There are several precautionary steps that a land owner or buyer can take to reduce the incidence of land fraud.
An important step to take is to check the title to your land at least every six months or so, this is especially important to those that own property which they do not occupy at present, as it is these types of property which are prone to be subject to fraud. If neither the property nor the title to the property is checked regularly it allows room for fraud to take place as someone can forge documents and sell the piece of land and it could be years before the absolute owner realizes that now his title is under dispute. Not maintaining your property also allows room for squatters to takeover and challenge the owner's rights through adverse possession. As a land owner one should also never part with their deeds, except through a lawyer, the reason being that giving out photocopies of your deeds to third parties or brokers could result in the copies being used to create fakes of the original deed.
It is also important to follow the law when buying property, rules even if they are non-compulsory are nevertheless in place as a guideline to ensure that fraud is minimized, thus it is important to follow these rules. The general principle should be 'Buyer Beware', ensure that as a buyer a search is conducted in the land registry to look for legal title to a land. Secondly keep in mind that a good bargain should not be motivation to rush into a sale, do your due diligence, have a surveyor measure the land and establish boundaries, talk to neighbours, make sure the seller is who he says he is. It is also important to find out whether there are any disputes over the land and whether there are conflicting rights that may place your title in question in the future. A deed should be signed by a notary only if the owner is well known to the notary, or in the alternative the owner could provide two witnesses who should be very well acquainted with the owner and the notary.
Finally it is important to be aware about Title Registration and Bim Saviya. At present Deed Registration is practiced in Sri Lanka and Title Registration is being implemented, thus once it is implemented, as a land owner one will be able to register their title to land. It is important for the public to have knowledge about land titling systems in Sri Lanka. Even with the government attempting to educate the public it is not sufficient, especially concerning land owners that live abroad or land owners that live in rural areas with little education or access to the internet.
Where is reform required?
The need for reform in land law in Sri Lanka is necessary at both a policy and legal level. Reform needs to take place in a wide array of areas, without which we leave ourselves vulnerable to serious macro-economic consequences.
There is a dire need for more property research in Sri Lanka, with the changeover to Bim Saviya, property research is needed now, more than ever. Research not only on the effects of Title Registration and how effectively it is implemented is necessary but also whether Sri Lanka actually needs the Bim Saviya, and whether it will undermine and cause conflict with other legal systems in Sri Lanka such as Thesawalamai law or Muslim law.
The need for the Bim Saviya and indefeasibility of title in Sri Lanka has been brought into question; indefeasibility of title will result in several innocent parties losing their land or money in the event fraud takes place, thus research into alternative schemes such as Defective Title Insurance needs to conducted. At present the attitude towards Title Insurance is extremely skeptical in Sri Lanka, thus we need to engage in more research to develop it and tailor it to Sri Lanka. When it is a legal requirement to purchase insurance for something as simple as buying a vehicle, it is rather surprising that land transactions that carry a lot of value are not expected to be insured, without insurance there is no consumer protection.
Another area requiring reform is rules relating to Notaries. The Notaries Ordinance at present is a comprehensive and well-functioning set of rules, if applied. Reading the Notaries Ordinance one can see how strictly it governs the practice to avoid fraud. The Notaries Ordinance needs to be made mandatory, and the notarial rules need to be enforced; thus when notaries renew their licenses yearly, they would only be able to do so if they had familiarized themselves with all the new legislation issued for that year. The quality of processing in notarial practice needs to be improved. Another reform that needs to take place concerns the implementation of the Bim Saviya, the proper identification tools need to be implemented alongside the E-land registry such as biometric scanners, GPS and advanced surveying systems.
An increase in land fraud means that the default rates for land mortgages are likely to increase; where a borrower is delinquent in paying the mortgage back, and banks have no choice but to sell the house, and only at this point do they realize that the title of the house/land is in question and they are unable to recover the loan provided. This not only affects the economy adversely but also makes banks more skeptical of borrowers, which is worsened by an unreliable land titling system.
Land dispossession in Sri Lanka
When talking about the issue of land rights and land loss, there are two main issues that come to mind. The first being land fraud which is perpetrated on the law and the second topic for discussion being land dispossession. Especially after the war, land dispossession of people in the North and East is extensive and very little has been done about it. Land dispossession took place through the possession and re-distribution of lands belonging to Muslims either through force or duress by the LTTE in the North, East and areas contiguous.
The State also further took over land for State led developments. Even though in theory all this is based on law, it left a considerable number of people without land or sanctuary. While the progress concerning resettlement of displaced persons has been slow, even the progress made has been in conflict with environmental concerns. There are issues raised surrounding habitation and colonization of land reserves and state owned land including ones around nature reserves for new settlements.
The issue of land dispossession is extensively discussed and there is a lot of awareness about it, nevertheless not even 5% of those that had been expelled from their land have been able to resettle even though it has been nearly quarter of a century since dispossession took place. One of the reasons is now ownership is claimed by others taking over through administrative fiats, which have been the subject of a few longstanding fundamental rights cases or by people that managed to encroach on the land during the war.
While the ethnic and cultural impact the war had on our country is slowly being resolved, those that suffered the most because of it are left without a home. The resettlement initiatives that are underway have unfortunately been in conflict with environmental concerns, with road networks and permanent housing coming up in areas of land reserves and nature reserves, creating questionable conditions for the survival of wildlife in areas that were specifically declared forest reserves under gazette notifications.
While progress is being made it is unfortunate that the issues pertaining to land are not looked at with the severity it should be. Culturally and traditionally it is so important for people to own land in Sri Lanka given that we are an agricultural nation; it's our bread and butter. Land loss in Sri Lanka especially for someone on the lower end of the income scale is something that has much more than a financial impact; it threatens the fundamental values and very mettle of our existence, so why is this not being addressed better? Why are we foregoing a constitutional right? Sri Lanka is one of the few countries where according to some laws women cannot own land; it is almost audacious that this is accepted in this day and age. Land rights need to be pushed on the agenda as a serious issue; the conversation needs to begin.
