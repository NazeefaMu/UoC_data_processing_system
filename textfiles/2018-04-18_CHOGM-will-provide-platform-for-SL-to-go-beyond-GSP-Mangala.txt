Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, who is in London, UK to attend the Commonwealth Forums, yesterday said the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) would provide a platform for Sri Lanka to expand its trade ties beyond the GSP+ concession of the European Union (EU).

The Minister said similar to the country receiving the GSP+ concession, it should strengthen trade relationships with other countries during the CHOGM-2018 in London.

“The summit which is being held at the heart of CHOGM, London, will bring us many benefits. On Monday, we had discussions to strengthen financial and trade relation at Guildhall, London where the Commonwealth Business Forum’s first session was commenced,” he said.

He said tomorrow, President Maithripala Sirisena will deliver the keynote speech at the Business Forum. (Sunil Jayasiri in London)
