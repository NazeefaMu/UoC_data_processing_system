Swadeshi Khomba illuminates

The Swadeshi Industrial Works, the market leader in Sri Lanka for herbal personal care products, has sponsored the “Aloka Poojawa” of the historic Dambadeniya Raja Maha Viharaya for the 14th consecutive year.
Dambadeniya was the third kingdom in Sri Lanka and the Viharaya was built in the reign of King Parakramabahu II. The Dalada Perahera was begun to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic, which was kept there for 13 years. The illumination is done under the theme; “Swadeshi Khomba Aloka Puja Sathkaraya”.
Swadeshi Chairperson Amari Wijewardene said Swadeshi being a Sri Lankan owned company, considers safeguarding the culture and traditional heritage of Sri Lanka by supporting such activities as this annual Aloka Pooja, a duty and also a debt the company owe towards mother Lanka.
She further observed, Swadeshi illuminates places of worship in the country for the benefit and ease of all worshippers and also with the intention of educating younger generation on the importance of safeguarding the country’s culture and heritage. The illumination is followed by a colourful cultural pageant which highlights Sri Lankan traditions and history. 
Swadeshi also supports the Aloka Poojas of Kataragama Kiri Wehera, Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya, Devundara Uthpalawarna Sri Vishnu Devalaya, Redigama Ridi Viharaya and Rathnapura Maha Saman Devalaya.
The pioneer and market leader in the herbal personal care category in Sri Lanka, the Swadeshi Industrial Works, was incorporated in 1941
