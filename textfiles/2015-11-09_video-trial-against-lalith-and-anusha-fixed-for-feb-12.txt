The trial against former presidential secretary Lalith Weeratunga and Sri Lanka Telecom Regulatory Commission's former director general Anusha Pelpitawas fixed for February 12, 2016 by Colombo High Court Judge Kusala Sarojini Weerawardane today.
They are charged with misappropriating Rs.600 million belonging to the SLTRC.
The Attorney General had on an earlier occasion indicted the suspects on charges of misusing SLTRC funds to purchase and distribute ‘silredi’ to voters during former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s election campaign.
Judge Weerawardane has summoned five witnesses to appear in Court on the trial date.
The two suspects were released on a cash bail of Rs.100,000 each with three sureties of Rs.1 million each.
The investigations were carried out by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). (Shehan Chamika Silva)
