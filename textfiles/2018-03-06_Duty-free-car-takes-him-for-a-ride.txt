Duty-free car takes him for a ride


	



 

Most politicians seek a Diyawanna seat making a solemn vow to expend their time, money and energy for the wellbeing of the hoi-polloi and there is no actual need for them to get a duty-free vehicle every five years. And what these Diyawanna members do has now become ‘an acceptable practice’; they immediately sell their duty-free vehicle to some wealthy person for a hefty price with the promise to regularize the ownership transfer after five years given the five year-mandatory bar to selling the vehicle to a second party.  

 


Following this practice, a certain politico of a main political party, now a purohita at state level had quietly sold his duty-free vehicle. However, when this ‘unofficial owner’ of the vehicle called on the state purohita with necessary documents to get its ownership officially transferred to him, the latter had chased the man away after refusing to sign the papers.  Now the poor man taken for a ride is reportedly consulting legal opinion in a desperate bid to legally hold on to the ownership of the vehicle, they say.
