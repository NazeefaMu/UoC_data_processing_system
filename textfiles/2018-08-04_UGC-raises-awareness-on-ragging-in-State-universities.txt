The University Grants Commission (UGC) is carrying out a series of advertising campaigns in national newspapers to make students and parents aware of possible methods to mitigate ragging and violence in State universities, sources said.

The UGC in a newspaper advertisement on Thursday said it treated all students enrolled in State universities and other higher educational institutes on equal level as guaranteed by the Constitution.

It also said no student should cause any inhumane treatment, mental torture, physical or sexual violence or humiliation to another student on personal integrity. It said the Prohibition of Ragging and other forms of Violence in Educational Act prohibited such behaviour.

“Anyone found guilty of such offences will be non-bailable and can be punished by court with rigorous imprisonment up to ten years followed by permanent expulsion from the university. The UGC hotline 0112123700 is open 24-hours for students to inform the authorities of such incidents. This is also possible via the newly-launched mobile application for university students. There is a special centre established at the UGC to look into such matters. All parents are advised to be vigilant on the behaviour of their children,” it said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
