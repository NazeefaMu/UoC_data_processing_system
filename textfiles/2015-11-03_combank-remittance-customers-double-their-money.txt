Thirty two customers of Commercial Bank (ComBank) whose inward remittances were routed to Sri Lanka via the bank had the good fortune to receive more than was originally sent, in many cases, doubling their money under a promotion conducted recently by the country’s largest private bank. 
The promotion was open to those who used one of four remittance services offered by the bank, e-Exchange, MoneyGram, Ria and Express Money.
