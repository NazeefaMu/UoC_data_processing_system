Best hotel view  in EUROPE


	



 

Sipping cocktails on a roof terrace overlooking the Aegean, taking a dip in your own private plunge pool and enjoying a breakfast fit for a king or queen in the Greek sunshine - does it get any better than that?


An island dramatically reshaped in the 16th century by a huge volcanic eruption. Its villages, fame for their white-washed buildings and azure blue rooftops, nestle on cliffs that form a half-ring around a submerge crater. 


And Canaves Oia offers guests a view across this that must be one of the best in all of Europe. Santorini really is a special place. 


Open-air swimming pools and sprawling five-star villas burrow into the clifftops and there are stunning views of the Aegean no matter which way you look.


And It treats to the finest sunset one have ever seen.


It is the luxurious five-star suite at Canaves Oia that makes time in Santorini extra-special. 
With a bed so big and comfortable to the villa’s very own swim-up Jacuzzi pool 
In fact, the only thing that makes you want to leave the plush surroundings of the villa every morning was the blazing Greek sunshine and the opportunity to kick back with some freshly-shaken cocktails on the resort’s roof-top terrace.


Boasting an infinity pool and giant double-bed size sunloungers, you can be in heaven sipping mojitos while taking in the panoramic Aegean views.


After tucking into a superb breakfast on the patio outside the bedroom. Delivered to the suite every morning, one can enjoy fresh eggs, homemade granola, American-style pancakes and infinite amounts of fresh tea and orange juice. 


And it was the perfect opportunity to soak up the stunning views as the sun rose across the sea.
I couldn’t get enough of the views - they are a world away from the sights many of us face on a daily basis in the London rat race.


With pretty much guaranteed sunshine from April to October, the climate is ideal for sun seekers. And aside from sunbathing, life here doesn’t get much more stressful than exploring Greek cafes, boutique shops, candlelit restaurants and jazzy bars.


Boat excursions here are a winner, too. 


Sailing out on the calm Aegean with the sun beaming down on the face, it’s well worth venturing out onto the sea just to see the stunning backdrop of Santorini from the water. 


Seeing the white-washed buildings and famous blue roofs while bobbing around miles out to sea was heavenly, as was the cold complementary beer we were offered to sip as we breezed around the island.
