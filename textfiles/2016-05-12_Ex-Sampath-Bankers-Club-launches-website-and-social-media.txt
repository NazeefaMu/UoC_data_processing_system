Ex Sampath Bankers’ Club launches website and social media


	

Ex Sampath Bankers Club which was inaugurated in January this year took another step forward by launching its website, and its Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and YouTube accounts, at a ceremony held recently at the BRC Lounge in the presence of Hiranthi de Silva, the President, the members of the Council and some members of the Club. 


The launch was done by the Chief Guest Janaka de Silva, the inaugural General Manager / Chief Executive Officer, Sampath Bank and a Patron of the Club.


The main objective of launching these electronic channels is to facilitate communication between the Club and its members. The members can now send in their suggestions and contributions easily as well as for the Club to disseminate information about its future activities to its members. This will also facilitate those Ex Sampath bankers who have still not joined the club to send in their application for membership along with their life membership fee. This is another example of the IT leadership that Sampath Bank has been displaying from its inception which helped to revolutionise Sri Lanka’s banking industry.  


Janaka de Silva, issued the following message to mark this historic occasion.         “It is with great pleasure that I send this brief message on the launch of the website and the Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and YouTube accounts of the Ex-Sampath Bankers Club. These will provide powerful channels not only to promote fellowship but also to rekindle the ‘Spirit of Sampath’ irrespective the different careers and endeavors we have chosen to pursue. The absolute loyalty and commitment to the institution you serve and the maintenance of the highest professional and ethical standards in whatever you do for the sheer joy of it is in essence the spirit which was inculcated in each of us from the very first day at Sampath. I am certain that all members will participate in the activities undertaken by the Club from time to time and contribute positively towards the furtherance of its objectives. I wish to take the opportunity to commend the President, the Council and those who worked tirelessly in placing the Ex Sampath Bankers Club in the cyber space”.


The development of the website was handled by Ex-Sampath Banker Jayantha Alwis through his company Sethis Outsourcing (Pvt) Ltd. Free-of-charge.
