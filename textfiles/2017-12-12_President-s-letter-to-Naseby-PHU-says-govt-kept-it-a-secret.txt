President's letter to Naseby: PHU says govt. kept it a secret


	

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday said a letter of thank sent by President Maithripala Sirisena to Lord Naseby had been kept concealed by the government due to the pressure of Tamil separatists.

Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said Lord Naseby of the British House of Lords made a statement in UK Parliament in October saying no war crime was committed in Sri Lanka.

“The President has sent a letter on behalf of Sri Lanka thanking Lord Naseby. This should be commended but neither Sri Lanka nor the UK knows about this letter,” he said.

He said a cover letter issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary has been attached with the President’s letter.

The MP said this cover letter, which was addressed to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in the UK, says the High Commissioner herself should handover the letter and the contents of the letter should not be shared with either Sri Lankan or British Media.

“Why this secrecy? If there is any faction which the President should be afraid of when expressing his opinion, it is the Tamil separatists. We have a question whether the President was aware of this secrecy,” he said.

However, when contacted, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said there was nothing out of ordinary about sending a letter of this nature along with a letter of the President of Sri Lanka as they come under ‘privileged communication.’ (Lahiru Pothmulla)
