[Children]-19.11.2015

Rainy days
Dear Children,
Have you ever heard the saying “The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain?” And have you ever wondered what it means? Well, when it's raining nobody can stop it, so the best thing is to let it to rain! Rainy days are like bad times. Do you know why? As the American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson says bad times have a scientific value. These are occasions a good learner would not miss. We all experience bad days at least once in a while. Such days help us learn how to face hardships and emerge victoriously. Bitter days teach us how to be patient.
And back to our topic, rainy days teach us how to finish our work on time without delaying. I am sure your mother might have asked you to put your clothes out to dry before it rains. All want to be at home ‘before the rains.’
There are many poems and songs written on the rain. Have you ever heard the poem “How beautiful is the rain?” Let me give you the first four lines of it. “How beautiful is the rain? After the dust and heat, In the broad and fiery street, In the narrow lane, How beautiful is the rain!...”
However as you know the rain is not so ‘beautiful’ always. It can be quite the opposite. As you know rains can play havoc across the country. These days many areas of the country have been affected by floods. Many people live in temporary shelter. So the rains can be a blessing as well as a curse. Remember nothing is good in excess.
Why don't you pen down your thoughts about this rainy weather or draw a sketch and send us.
Bye for now,
Aunty Sanju
Dogs
The dog is a domestic animal. This four-footed pet has a tail, sharp claws and sharp teeth. It eats rice, bread, meat, fish, milk etc. It has thick hair, but some species possess thin hair. It may be of different colours: white, brown, black, or a mixture of these colours. Dogs are of different species and different sizes and looks.
The dog is a faithful animal. It can easily accept good training.
At night, it guards its master's house. It accompanies its master to the jungle to take active part in hunting, by tracking down the game. It has a very strong sense of smell. It is specially trained by the police or military departments for smelling the traces of crimes and finding out the culprit, either indoors or outdoors.
The dog is generally found to be treated in the human society as a member of the family, as they are useful to man in many ways.
Big size dogs, such as Alsatians, Golden Retrievers, etc, sometimes resemble wolves, tigers or panthers. With training, they are ferocious.
The small size dogs are tamed mainly for the pleasure of the master, because they are not so strong as to fight or defend themselves from stronger animals, thieves or rogues. But some of them look pretty and are loved as ‘darlings'.

Deepavali
Deepavali or Deepali means a collection of lighted lamps with which the houses and temples are decorated on the occasion of the festival Deepanvita. The festival falls every year on the day of the new-moon in the month of October, when Goddess Kali is worshipped and the dwelling houses and temples and also public places belonging to the Hindus are beautifully illumined with hundreds of rows of lighted lamps.
The Deepavali illumination signifies the rays of hope and prospect for a higher life lit in millions of hearts of the Hindus. Deepavali symbolizes the aspiration noticed in the Brihadaranyaka Upanisadic hymn:
Tamaso ma Jyotirgamaya
(Lead me from darkness to light). Mrityor ma Amtitamagamaya
(Lead me from death to immortality).
Thus the festival of Deepavali is not merely a festival of merriment, but it is a pointer to higher life.
The origin of Deepavali is mixed with various myths and legends, such as the killing of the demon called Narakasura by Sri Krishna, or the destruction of Ravana by Sri Ramachandra. The inner mean­ing of Deepavali is the overcoming of the evil by the good, the advancement of evolution of mankind to the supreme goal.
On the occasion, the Hindus exchange good wishes and greetings, and distribute sweetmeats, various presents and new clothes amongst their friends and relatives as a gesture of love and affection.
