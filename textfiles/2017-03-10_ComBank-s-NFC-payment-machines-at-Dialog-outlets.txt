Commercial Bank of Ceylon has entered into an agreement with Dialog Axiata to install its near field communications (NFC)-enabled point-of-sale machines at key Dialog outlets islandwide. 
Using NFC  technology, first introduced to Sri Lanka by Dialog, Commercial Bank customers visiting Dialog outlets can simply tap their Visa or Mastercard credit cards on the machines to carry out payments, and cardholders no longer need to hand over their cards to outlet staff. 
The units are already in operation at 17 Dialog outlets islandwide and the ‘Tap n Go’ feature enhances security while transactions below Rs.5,000 do not require a signature – expediting checkout. Commercial Bank has been a leader in the adoption of NFC technology in Sri Lanka’s banking sector. Dialog first introduced NFC touch technology to Sri Lanka in 2012 with the Touch Fuel Card. 
In 2013, Dialog introduced the NFC-powered Touch Travel Pass and the Smart Sticker, enabling customers to conduct transactions with a simple touch.
