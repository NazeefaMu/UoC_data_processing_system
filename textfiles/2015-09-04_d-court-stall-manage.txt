Supermarket food court stall managers watch out!


	

Raids will be carried out at supermarket complexes in the city by the Colombo Municipality Public Health Department due to the increase in complaints of the standard of food and beverages sold at the food courts of the shopping complexes.
When conducting several health related programmes, health officials discovered houseflies, rats and roaches in food courts in supermarket complexes in Bamabalapitiya, Kollupitiya and Narahenpita.
CMC Chief Health Officer (CMO) Dr. Ruwan Wijeyamuni said that although cooking was not permitted in ground floor stalls, it was a law that was often violated that led to poor hygiene.
“Kitchens of these food court stalls are not properly maintained. Ants, houseflies, rats and roaches have been seen by customers on several occasions. We are investigating whether the food and beverage items are also contaminated by such vermin,” he said.
The CMO went on to say they would obtain samples of food and beverages sold from these places.
“We will send them to be tested and if we find them to be contaminated we will take legal action under the Food Act,” Dr. Wijeyamuni said.
He said raids will be conducted by health inspectors at every supermarket complex within the city limits soon.
The public are encouraged to call 0112676161 for complaints and reports of any instances of sub-standard food and beverage items sold at any supermarket complex, stall or restaurant.
He added that complaints will be filed with the Central Food Safety Unit of the CMC and action will be taken thereafter by health officers. (Piyumi Fonseka)
