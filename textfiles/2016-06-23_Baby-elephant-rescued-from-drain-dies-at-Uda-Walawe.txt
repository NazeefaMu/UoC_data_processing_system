The elephant calf that was less than a month old and had been rescued from an uncovered drain in Hambantota died last night at Elephant Transit Home in Uda Walawe.

The calf had been suffering with diarrhea, because of which it was treated by a veterinarian from the Embilipitiya Hospital, Wild Life Health Management Director Dr. Tharaka Prasad said.

However, the health of the calf did not improve despite treatment.

Incidentally, at the time the baby elephant was sent to the Elephant Transit Home, it was not suffering with diarrhea.

According to Wild Life Conservation Department Officials, the calf had been sent to Uda Walawe for treatment for a fracture in its leg which was caused when it fell in the drain.

Dr. Tharaka Prasad who carried out the post mortem examination into the death of the baby elephant said that in addition to the initial cause, internal bleeding in elephant's appendix was found during the post mortem.

For further examinations, tissue samples of the baby elephant would be sent to the Peradeniya University's Medical Faculty today, Dr. Prasad said.

The elephant is said to have recovered from the fracture to its leg, its health had been deteriorating due to diarrhea.

The veterinarian who was appointed to look after the baby elephant has been transferred to Kebiliththa for another official purpose.

After that, a veterinarian had not been available at the Uda Walawe Transit Home to look after the baby elephant that had fallen ill.

Dr. Tharaka said when he came to visit and treat the baby elephant, it was already dead. (Piyumi Fonseka)
