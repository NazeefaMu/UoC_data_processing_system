He said so at the Gampaha District Development Committee meeting held last evening.
According to the plans, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, the administrative capital of the country will be expanded towards Kadawata, Kaduwela and Kottawa to create one large administrative city, in which government offices will be located.
