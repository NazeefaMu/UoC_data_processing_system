Responsible Fashion Summit, the unique platform for thought leadership, with a strong agenda to focus on action, and as part of the bigger Responsible Fashion Movement, kicked off with impact, with strong speakers, important case studies and the way forward which will also showcase Sri Lanka as a destination which has a responsible fashion supply chain and sourcing.

This unique format showcased 08 impacts that are conceptualised to showcase the solutions to the issues faced by the global fashion industry. 

“The 08 impacts that we defined are current and very pertinent as pillars to build solutions on, it’s also very current, it covers areas from Design to Disposal, it includes production, retail, community, designers, every stakeholder of the supply chain. This makes this movement unique and this summit as the platform where knowledge of subject matter experts is converted into action, we have given a 5 year plan, almost like a report card to see our progress every year. Sri Lanka has the advantage and can take the lead engaging and including global stakeholders. This structure has a format to evolve with solutions. Very excited with this.” Says Ajai V Singh, Founder of The Responsible Fashion Movement  



The overall vison of the Responsible Fashion Movement is to encourage the stakeholders, in an inclusive manner, to be Responsible, to stay Accountable and together make the fashion Clean. The global fashion industry currently reels under enormous pressure as it has been consistently creating negative impact to the society and the environment. The countries in different regions of the world are grappling with the issues and this a need to come up with solutions, the reality also is that issues in different parts of the world are different, based on what part of the supply chain they belong to, and the environment they live in.

Sri Lanka has enjoyed high compliance standards since last few years and more companies are joining in to meet the compliance standards, it has managed to set the benchmark in the region. The Responsible Fashion Movement aims to take this forward by creating an eco-system from Design to Disposal and open this eco-system to any brand or organisation in the world to engage and use the fashion supply chain to make positive impact.

The first edition of the Responsible Fashion Summit, saw three panel presentations, staring with the UNESCO Ambassador and a global fashion icon Bibi Russell, who is highly celebrated globally for her work in developing communities under the banner fashion for development.

The final presentation was done by the teams that participated in Sri Lanka’s First Fashion Hackathon “Making of the Green Tee”, an initiative that was started by the Responsible Fashion Movement last year, engaging fashion design students from universities all over Sri Lanka to design an eco-friendly t-shirt.
