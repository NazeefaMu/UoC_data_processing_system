In its constant quest to reach customer service excellence, Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) launched a revolutionary customer transaction online portal that takes customer convenience to higher realms. 


CDBiNet, a true reflection of CDB’s continuous pursuit for convenience is an online finance platform that offers an expansive range of facilities with the simple click of a button or via your smartphone, for the very first time in Sri Lanka’s finance industry. From enabling the opening of savings accounts and fixed deposits to utility bill payments, application for VISA debit cards, fund transfers, information on leases and loans and online payments of these installments, CDBiNET augments this expansive range of innovative facilities by adding the FB Friends transfer facility which is a first for the finance industry in the country.  


With this focus on constantly pushing boundaries in technologically driven customer solutions, CDB has added another exciting dimension into this equation by having a weekly draw for customers who register with CDBiNet, offering an iPhone7 as the coveted prize. In fact, the accessibility presented by CDBiNet through smartphones is well entrenched into the platform’s revolutionary persona, as it enables the download of the mobile app onto any smartphone via the Apple App Store or Android Google Play.


CDB MD/CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara explains that CDB’s over twenty year history has been one constructed around meeting and exceeding stakeholder expectations. “Our customers are integral to our success and in this era of intense competition, it has been stimulating to see our team use cutting edge technology to develop products that take us towards that constantly improving bar of customer service excellence.” Adding that CDB continues to retain its conventional corporate persona while pushing frontiers in technology innovation, Nanayakkara states that CDB maintains that perfect balance of adding value to both offline and online service strategies, “because our customer will always be the catalyst upon which we build our business on.”
