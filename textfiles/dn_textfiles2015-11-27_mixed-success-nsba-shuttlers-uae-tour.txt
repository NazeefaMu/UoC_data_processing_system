Mixed success for NSBA shuttlers on UAE tour

Sri Lankan badminton stars representing the Nationalised Services Badminton Association (NSBA) enjoyed mixed fortunes during a tournament held in the UAE on Saturday.
The shuttlers found themselves in unfamiliar territory having little time to acclimatise for a one-day competition organised by Desert Cubs Cricket Academy (DCCA) in Sharjah for the touring Sri Lankan side.
