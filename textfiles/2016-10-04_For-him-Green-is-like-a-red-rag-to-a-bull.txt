For him, Green is like a red rag to a bull


	



 

A group of Green party supporters who had taken the initiative to accord a public reception to a certain political leader at Pelmadulla have been placed in a dilemma following an order received from a powerful white-collar bigwig to dismantle the pandal erected in connection with the ceremony. He had also given a call to an MP in the area not to allow the pandal to come up.  

 


This bigwig attached to the office of a very high political authority had gone livid with anger on hearing that the picture of a non-Blue party leader is prominently displayed at the apex of the pandal which is painted entirely in green. 


By the way, the organizers had already got clearance for erecting the pandal from the law enforcement authorities.


The powerful bigwig who had earlier held a commission in the army had worked in this office even under the former strongman, they say.
