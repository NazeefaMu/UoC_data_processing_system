A 32-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday by Railway Security Officers on charges of possessing elephant tail-hairs and 50 grams of heroin.


“It is illegal to possess elephant hair under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1986,” a Railway Security Officer said.


The arrest was made when the man was smoking the heroin inside the lavatory of a Kandy intercity train while it had stopped at the Fort Railway Station.


The Security Officer said the man was not in possession of a valid train ticket nor a platform ticket.
The suspect was handed over to the Colombo Fort Police.(Chaturanga Pradeep)
