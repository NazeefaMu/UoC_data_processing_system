A Sri Lankan travel agent had been arrested in Mumbai on Wednesday for allegedly trying to fly to Sri Lanka with three Bhutanese women, the Times of India reported today.

The women had told cops that the accused had promised them high paying jobs in a men’s spa in Iraq. Cops suspect he may have intended to force the women into the sex trade.

Sahar police caught Mohiuddin Fayaz (41) from the international airport after immigration officials got suspicious and checked his papers to find that he was “trafficking” the women using fake Indian passports.

The victims had paid Rs 6,000 each for the supposed jobs. Mumbai cops have provided for their food and accommodation and informed the Bhutan embassy in India so that the women can fly back to their homes.

“Fayaz confessed to having arranged passports and visas for the women after getting in touch with a female agent from Bhutan. The woman agent introduced him to the three women in Delhi. She told them that they would be paid well for working in a men’s spa. They were also promised payment for the first six months of their training period,” said a Sahar police station officer.

Cops are investigating how many women have been similarly trafficked by the accused in the past. The accused got the women to Mumbai and was to fly to Sri Lanka en route to Iraq.
