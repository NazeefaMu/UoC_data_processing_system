The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs will attend the parliamentary sessions on December 18, MP Kanchana Wijesekera said today.

He told a news briefing at the SLPP headquarters at Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla that the decision had been taken following the Supreme Court verdict delivered yesterday ruling that President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to dissolve parliament was unconstitutional and illegal.

“The MPs will get the opportunity to see as to who has got the majority in parliament according to the Constitution and the Sanding Orders,” the MP said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
