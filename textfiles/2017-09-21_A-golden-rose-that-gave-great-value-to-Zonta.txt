MANO MUTHUKRISHNA CANDAPPA

Passing away of Mano Muthukrishna Candappa greatly saddened the hearts of her several friends and acquaintances. It left a void in the many organizations of which she was a vital and integral part.   


Zonta was closest to Mano’s heart. Zonta, is a prestigious international organization founded in the United States of America by a group of leading women in the professions and business striving for the advancement of status of women. Zonta is now spread over 67 countries worldwide.  

 
In the late 60s, Evelyn de Soysa along with other illustrious women like Mahes Candiah, Dr. Stella de Silva, Dr. Siva Chinnathamby, Deloraine Brohier and a group of forward looking and enterprising women in various fields of professions and in business desired to form a Zonta Club in Sri Lanka, Mano’s enthusiasm and commitment made her become the Founder Secretary. She, in her inimitable style made the organization grow, expand and bear fruit over the past five decades.   


Zonta Sri Lanka now stands proud with five Clubs serving to advance the status of women in many fields, through its distinguished membership. Mano’s contribution was recognized in many ways culminating in her being elected the 1st District Governor for District 25 of Zonta International covering India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.   


Mano was the trail blazer in recognizing women of achievement in all fields, and honouring them through Zonta Club I of Colombo. These awards were considered very prestigious by the recipients as can be witnessed by the large volume of applications that are received regularly from women applying for the award, year after year.   


Mano’s interest in the welfare of women was not limited to Zonta. The Women’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the SAARC Women’s Association, Sri Lanka Women’s Conference and many other organizations and associations had the benefit of her expertise including the Colombo Chetties’ Association and the Forum for Ageing.   


Mano’s beginning as an adventurous journalist travelling overland to Russia six decades ago, led her to make bold and courageous decisions. Her innovative ideas in fostering the growth of the Polytechnic (Pvt) Ltd., elevated the quality and standard of training young women to hold positions with dignity.  

 
Mano had an iron hand inside a velvet glove and it was this strength and will-power that led her to overcome the obstacles life placed before her.   


Her daughters Ramola and Sharadha were her pride and joy. Led by her example, they in turn, carry on her ideals with distinction. Their families with her sons-in-law Siva and Skanda and her grand children and great grand children made her very proud of them.   
She had countless friends and each one was special and important to her. She found time for them, to care, love, counsel and guide them. Her loss will be greatly felt by everyone who knew her.   


Zonta Club 1 of Colombo celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Yellow Rose is the symbol of Zonta and Mano will be remembered as the Golden Rose which gave great value to Zonta Sri Lanka.   
We miss you Mano.   
Mala Sabaratnam
