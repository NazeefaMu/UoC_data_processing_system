Delhi’s poor bear the brunt of deadly smog


	

New Delhi, (The Hindu), NOV 10, 2017 - With the air quality in Delhi hitting hazardous levels over the past few days, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) said it would meet on Friday to discuss the government’s odd-even car rationing scheme for five days, starting from November 13.Rickshaw driver Sanjay can only afford a handkerchief to shield his face from the smog-filled streets of Delhi, even as many residents rush to buy protective masks to combat the toxic menace.   


Better off inhabitants of the world’s most polluted capital are swarming sellers of face masks —costing more than the <U+20B9> 300 that Sanjay earns in a day— and high-tech air purifiers that could easily cost his annual wage.   Delhi authorities on Wednesday ordered all 6,000 schools to shut until Sunday after choking smog descended on the north of the country, while people with breathing difficulties have been told to stay indoors.   


But doctors say that none of it will be enough to prevent deaths in the metropolis of 20 million people battling a pollution crisis for the second year.   


Some streets have recorded pollution levels 40 times the World Health Organization recommended safe level since Monday, with still weather and the annual post-harvest burning of crop stubble in Punjab fuelling the crisis.   


Rickshaw drivers, street vendors and tens of thousands of homeless families endure the full force of pollution that doctors warn can do irreparable damage to the heart, brain and lungs, especially in children.
