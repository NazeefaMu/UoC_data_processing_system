Amãna Bank, Sri Lanka’s premier non-interest based licensed commercial bank, has commenced a promotion to reward its debit card holders by wiping out their bills up to Rs. 5,000 daily. 
The promotion which will run until 15 January 2016, will select winners daily, who have used their debit cards for shopping, dining, fuel, medical, travelling  etc.  
Commenting on the ongoing promotion, the Bank’s Vice President Consumer Banking and Strategic Marketing Siddeeque Akbar said “Through this seasonal promotion we take the opportunity to reward our debit card customers in addition to our seasonal discount offers.”
Amãna Bank’s Visa debit card is enabled with Smart Chip Technology, which offers greater security by storing and processing information securely, thereby ensuring our customers’ peace of mind when using the card for payments. Amãna Bank debit card customers can also opt for SMS alerts to be notified on the transactions done through the card. 
Amãna Bank is the first Licensed Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka to operate in complete harmony with the non-interest based Islamic banking model and is listed on the Diri Savi Board of the Colombo Stock Exchange. Fitch Ratings, in October 2015, affirmed the Bank’s National Long Term Rating of BB(lka) with a Stable Outlook.  The Bank was recognized as the Best ‘Up-and-Comer’ Islamic Bank of the World by ‘Global Finance Magazine’ at the 18th Annual World’s Best Banks Award Ceremony 2014 held in Washington DC, USA. 
Powered by the stability and support of its strategic shareholders including, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, AB Bank in Bangladesh and The Islamic Development Bank based in Saudi Arabia, Amãna Bank is making strong inroads within the Sri Lankan banking industry and is focused on capitalizing the growing market potential for its unique banking model across the country.
