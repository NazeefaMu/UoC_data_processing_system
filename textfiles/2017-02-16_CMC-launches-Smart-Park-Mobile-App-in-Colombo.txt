CMC launches Smart Park Mobile App in Colombo


	

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday launched a Smart Park Mobile App to enhance the services offered to motorists in the city.

CMC Commissioner V. K. A. Anura said the Smart Park Mobile App is an enhancement to services provided by Tenaka Parkings in improving customer satisfaction by providing an efficient parking management service in a professional and orderly manner to ensure a safe, secure and friendly environment.

The project includes installation of parking meters along the length of the Galle Road, R. A. de Mel Mawatha and all by-roads connecting these roads with the parking management operator being Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt.) Ltd. “We have now completed the installation of parking meters on the first phase and they are now operational. This will benefit the public and business community as the availability of vacant parking slots will increase with this new system,” he said.

The new technology implemented would enable motor vehicle user to pay using a touch card introduced by Dialog Axiata Sri Lanka or by cash, for their convenience. Further payment option will be extended through a mobile application as well in the near future.

We encourage the public to use the touch card system as a payment option for the parking meters as the machine will not refund or give back change if the cash deposit is selected as the payment option. Therefore the public is advised to deposit the exact value in notes when the settlement is made using cash.

The Dialog Touch Cards are readily available at Dialog merchant outlets in this zone as well as through with employees of Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd who have been posted next to these parking meters at the initial stage for the convenience of motorists.
