Thousands badly affected by doctors' strike


	

Thousands of hapless patients were once again badly affected by the token strike launched by the GMOA.

GMOA Secretary Navin De Soyza said the token strike was launched against the police attack on university students, the government's failure to arrest those responsible for throwing a hand grenade at the Sri Lanka Medical Council and several other demands.

Patients at the OPD, clinics and cardio-thoracic units were among the most affected.

De. De Soyza said all childrens and maternity hospitals such as the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, De Soyza Maternity Hosptal, Castle Street Maternity Hospital, Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children’s hospital in Kandy, National Cancer Institute Maharagama, Thelippalai, Jaffna, and all Emergency Treatment Units and Accidents Services were kept open with a skeleton medical staff. Colombo National Hospital Director Dr. Anil Jasingha said routine surgeries had been postponed yesterday and the OPD, Cardiology Unit and the other clinics were not functioning and admission of patients had been suspended.
