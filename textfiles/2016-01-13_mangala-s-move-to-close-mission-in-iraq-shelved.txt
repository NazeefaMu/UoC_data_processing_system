	Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera had to shelve his move to close the Sri Lankan mission in Baghdad, Iraq due to objections by a group of cabinet ministers, it is learnt.
	The minister submitted the Cabinet paper in this regard under his plan to rationalise the missions abroad.
	But his move was resisted by some cabinet ministers, including Rishad Bathiudeen, Mahinda Samarasinghe and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
	Mr. Samaraweera said that, though Iraq was a friendly nation, it was difficult to operate a mission in that country at the moment. He said it was even difficult to find an ambassador to serve in that country.
	Ultimately the paper was not approved due to requests to reconsider the move. (Kelum Bandara)
