There is a ‘madam’ holding a high office at national level. According to official records, the lady attends office in her official car from a distant place in the South, a distance of 225 kilometres back and forth.

 


 She has claimed a fuel allowance of Rs. 517,583 for the last year. She has received Rs.54,450 by way of reimbursement of the total she claimed to have paid for using the Southern Expressway during the year. She has claimed a total of Rs.271,752 as holiday pay for the year. This means the Ministry has incurred an expenditure of Rs. 843,785 on her account during the year in addition to paying her a big salary. When the top team member handling the Ministry is setting an example in simple living, the madam has become a public fund gobbler, say the employees.
