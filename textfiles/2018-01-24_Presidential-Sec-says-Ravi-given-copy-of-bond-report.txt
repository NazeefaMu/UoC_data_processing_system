The Presidential Secretariat today contradicted the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya when it confirmed that a copy of the bond commission report was given to UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake on January 17.

The secretariat’s information officer said the MP was charged Rs.5,000 for the bound copy of the report.

“The MP had requested for a copy under the Right to Information (RTI) Act,” he said.

However, on Wednesday in Parliament the Speaker dismissed claims made by the MP that he had obtained a copy of the report and confirmed that the copies of the report were only forwarded to the President, Parliament, the Attorney General and the Central Bank. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
