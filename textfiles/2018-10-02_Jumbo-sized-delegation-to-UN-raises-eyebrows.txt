Jumbo-sized delegation to UN raises eyebrows


	



 

The jumbo-sized delegation that has been accompanying the country’s Number One on his yearly visit to New York to attend the UNGA annual general sessions has been a hot topic from the days of the previous regime.

 


Therefore, it is no wonder that the current incumbent’s recent visit to New York to attend the 73rd UNGA sessions as well has become the main topic in political circles and in the public domain once again for the size of this delegation too is obviously big enough to be called jumbo!
Besides, there is an oft-repeated allegation that the country’s annual visit to New York to attend the UNGA sessions has been exploited by powers that be as an occasion to offer an all-expenses-paid- vacation for a select few including the family members of the political elite.


Several pertinent questions were asked about the composition of the 63-member delegation which accompanied No.1. One is that the top team member handling foreign affairs could have been in the delegation instead of taking four others with him on this visit.
