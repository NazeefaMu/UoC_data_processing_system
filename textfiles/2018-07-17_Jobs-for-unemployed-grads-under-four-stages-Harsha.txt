The government will provide jobs for all unemployed graduates under four stages in 2018 and 2019, Minister Harsha de Silva told Parliament today.

“The first two groups that had completed their degrees before December 31, 2016 will receive employment this year, and the remaining groups that had graduated before June 30, 2018 will receive employment next year,” he said.

Responding to a question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake whether the external graduates would be considered when providing employment, the minister said they would not be disregarded but that a Cabinet decision had been taken to give priority to internal graduates.

“Considering the appeals made by applicants, the maximum age limit for graduate recruitment has been increased from 35 to 45,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
