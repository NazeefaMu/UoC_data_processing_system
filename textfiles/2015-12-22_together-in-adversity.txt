Together in adversity


	


‘‘Thieves dining at the same table” The above phrase which reminds one of the oft-used English saying ‘Birds of the feather flock together’ is really a coinage by some of our Diyawanna members. 
There are certain Diyawanna members from both sides of the House facing serious charges at several ongoing probes.  These members dining together irrespective of their political differences at the Diyawanna canteen during the recent sittings had been a commonplace sight. This familiar sight had inspired some of their colleagues with a sense of humour to coin the phrase. 
However, these members dining together and exchanging friendly banter in a spirit of camaraderie at the canteen were often seen hurling epithets at one another across the floor during debates in the House.
