‘United action needed to make SLFP victorious’

United action is the need of the hour if the SLFP is to be made victorious, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister and SLFP Assistant Secretary Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
United action rather than division is the need of the hour if the SLFP which is the most powerful party in the national political movement is to be made victorious at the forthcoming local government elections, Samarasinghe said.
The minister was addressing a meeting of Kalutara district local government delegates held at Kalutara on January 25.
Samarasinghe said January 25 was a day of great significance to him as it was on such a day that he left the UNP and joined the SLFP 10 years ago to take oaths as a minister. Therefore he considered the opportunity he got to summon a meeting of SLFP local government delegates on January 25 to ensure party unity as a quirk of fate.
Fielding a question by media, Minister Samarasinghe said if a member of the SLFP obtained membership of another party disciplinary action would be taken against such member according to the party Constitution.
He said the meeting was summoned to build a strong organisation needed to ensure an SLFP victory at the forthcoming local government election.
If any division was caused within the SLFP the entire national political movement would suffer a tragic breakdown giving the benefit to sections bent on cliquish and communal lines. Parliamentarian Malith Jayathilleke, Provincial Minister Ranjith Somawansa, Former Minister Reginald Cooray and Provincial Council member Sumith Lal Fernando were also present.
