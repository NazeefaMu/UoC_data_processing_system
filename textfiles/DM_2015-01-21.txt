	A Diyawanna member from the Puttalam district who lost his Ministerial portfolio following the recent great change sent an SMS to an erstwhile colleague from Matara briefly explaining his present plight. The following is the text of the SMS:
Though we held high office, Machang, we did not make money. And I dont have money now. I handed over the official Ministry vehicle yesterday. I have no vehicle to go about either. I propose to buy a double cab with money borrowed from friends. I suppose you are also in the same boat Machang, have you got a vehicle go about
The ex-Minister from Matara sent this reply: I too dont have a vehicle. I asked a friend to loan me one. I may get it. True, we dont have money. But we can enjoy the luxury of a peaceful sleep. Is that not enough People might be surprised to learn that there are people like us still in politics, Machang.

	The Temple Trees was used not only as the official residence of the deposed Big Boss, but also as the hub of all his activities.
The mansion has now become the official residence of the Prime Minister under the new dispensation.
The new Prime Minister the other day did an inspection round of the official residence assigned to him along with a group of close political associates. He asked the aides to open the bed room meant for him for a look-see. An aide opened the bed room and what happened was something that they least expected. A young pooch bounced from inside the room. The aides explained what could have happened. The deposed Big Boss had forgotten to take with him his pet poodle when he hurriedly left the residence. It used to sleep under his bed.

After all, Douggie is a politician and didnt someone say that politics is the art of the possible
He met the former Madam. And he didnt cut corners in approaching the subject. Madam, we supported you when you were in office. Later we had to throw in our lot with the deposed Big Boss. But that is a thing of the past. We wish to extend our support to the new incumbent, he explained.
The former Madam who gave a patient hearing to Douggie, said: Douggie, you have missed the bus. Besides, there are no more seats in the bus to offer you. There is yet another problem: If we accommodated you, your rival group that stood by us all along is sure to leave the bus. We are sorry we cannot accept your support!

	A group of UPFA front-liners the other day journeyed to Tangalle to hold council with the former Big Boss regarding the future of the alliance.
The group included several Ministers, one of them was in charge of sports, two of them were former party secretaries and another was a former leader of the House. Among the others were the Western council member of double cross fame and the noisy Diyawanna member who had to donate his seat as part of a deal struck by the former Big Boss. 
A large crowd of supporters had gathered around the residence of the former Big Boss at the time Betel Leaf stalwarts arrived there. The visitors were pushing their way through the thick crowd when they suddenly noticed that the people had begun turning restive. And then all hell broke loose. People were hurling angry epithets and raising loud boos. They looked back to find what this commotion was about. A section of the crowd was directing their anger at two particular former Ministers who took up the rear when making their way towards the residence of the former Big Boss!
The crowd kept booing at the duo until they disappeared inside the house.
One of the two ex- ministers who received the boo treatment is a patriot whose political origin is traced to a Red party. The other is a stocky politico who had his Prime Ministerial ambitions shattered.

Port City Project: Chinese company supports SL review
	
	Amid various allegations and moves to stop the Colombo Port City Project, the China Communications. Construction Company Limited (CCCC), which is the project proponent, said yesterday it would extend its fullest cooperation to the Sri Lankan Government and the relevant authorities.
	The CCCC said it would provide all necessary information according to relevant regulations for the purpose of assessing and reviewing the Project.
	The Colombo Port City Project was undertaken after several initiatives and attempts by different prospective project proponents, to develop a waterfront property in the City of Colombo.
	The first attempt was made by the Singaporean company CESMA in 1998 on an initiative of the Singaporean Government to study the 'Colombo Metropolitan Regional Structure Plan. The final plan published on 2004, developed by the Sri Lankan and Singaporean team, proposed a Western Region Megapolis by 2030. However, the concept plans could not be implemented due to the vast cost in building the breakwater in deep water to protect the reclaimed land. The Port City became financially feasible only when the breakwater was integrated with the Colombo Port Expansion Project.
	Ranked 187th in 2014 among the Fortune Five Hundred companies in the world, CCCC as a responsible corporate, reiterates that all necessary procedures were followed in the initiation of the project.
	
	CCCC has sought the expertise of internationally reputed development consultancy firms such as AECOM (Americas premier fully integrated infrastructure and support services firm), ATKINS (Globally recognized UK based design engineering and project management consultancy), SWECO (Nordic regions leading consulting engineering company in sustainable engineering and design), JLL (US & Indias Professional Services and Investment Management Company specializing in real estate services), Pinsent Masons (UK) and PWC (US).
	Further, prior to CCCC undertaking the development of the project in 2010 an initial Technical Feasibility Study and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Project was performed by the University of Moratuwa, under the directive of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Technical Feasibility Study was subsequently approved by the Sri Lankan Government and the Environmental Impact Assessment was published for the public benefit.
	Once public inquiries were answered, the Environmental Impact Assessment was approved by government-approved agencies.
	Additionally, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was submitted by CCCC and approved after monitoring the projects environmental and coastal impact, as per the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment. 
	The total duration of the process from submitting the proposal to signing the agreement, extended to four years, to make sure that all procedures of the Governments procurement regulations were followed.
	CCCC is committed to support the Sri Lankan Governments vision of making the country a gateway to South Asia.
	Spanning 233 hectares, the Colombo Port City is currently the single largest private-sector development project in Sri Lankas long, rich and storied history. The Colombo Port City will add strong economic pillars to the countrys existing development plans to make it a viable investment destination in South Asia. 
	The project aims to create 83,000 new employment opportunities within different sectors, attract US$$13 billion in foreign investments from investors and developers across the region like India, Singapore, Malaysia and China and increase the number of tourists visiting the country during the next 30 years.
	CCCC, as a responsible corporate citizen, is fully committed to fulfilling its enterprise responsibilities through due diligence, help develop the countrys economy and communities, share common interests and goals, and contribute to the sustainable growth of the country.

Video: JVP urges CJ to resign
	
Questioning his appointment and his conduct during the night of presidential election, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged Chief Justice (CJ) Mohan Peiris to step down from his post.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing about questions over the process which led to the present Chief Justices appointment and the removal of the former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike from the post.
He said there was no motion to impeach Dr. Bandaranaiake from the post of Chief Justice in the Parliament order book and that the motion was only to examine her conduct and in such a scenario the appointment of the present CJ raises several questions.
Mr. Dissanayake asked why the CJ was present at Temple Trees on January 8 and had a private discussion with the former President because it was the practice for CJ to meet the president only publicly to discuss matters of public importance.
He said his party would take steps to remove him in keeping with provisions provided by the constitution in such instances if the CJ refuses to resign.
Mr. Dissanayake said the alleged coup on election night should be probed and the perpetrators brought to book and added that his party had proposed to the National Executive Committee that a senior police officer be appointed to probe this alleged coup and the report submitted to the council within a week.

New high end appointments trigger a furor
	
	Certain high end appointments made since the compassionate regime taking office has triggered a roaring furor in government circles.
Those unhappy over these appointments have complained to the Compassionate One that the names of some of the appointees figure prominently in the Black Book opened by the UDF stalwarts at the height of the recent hustings with a view to bringing to justice high public officials who resorted to corrupt practices to ensure a third term for the former Big Boss.
Among the big guns kicking up a row over the new appointments is former Madam, a co-architect of the alliance that brought the compassionate rule to power. She has expressed her displeasure in no uncertain terms at the appointment of a onetime crony of the former Big Boss as the Media Secretary overlooking the credentials of the lady who handled their media job in the run-up to the poll.
Meanwhile, the deposed General reportedly flew into a rage on hearing that another lackey of the previous regime was installed in the highest chair of a state-owned media institution.
However, the Compassionate One has said in response to the protests and complaints against the new appointments that he would not be able to run the administration if he started sacking one by one all the public officials who carried out illegal orders of their former political bosses. Given this stand taken up by the Compassionate One, all indications are that all new high end appointees including his own secretary and the Defense secretary will survive their new positions at least until a new Parliament is elected following the 100- day interim rule.

Video: Gammanpila says coup allegations a joke
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today that allegations that a coup had been planned by former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, G. L. Peiris and himself on the night of the presidential election were totally false and claimed that all that had taken place on that night was a discussion about whether it would be necessary to impose a curfew to prevent violence in the country following the defeat of the SLFP.
Mr. Gammanpila, speaking to the media soon after making a statement to the CID regarding the allegation of his involvement in an alleged coup on the night following the presidential election that took place at Temple Trees, said that more than one hundred people were present during a discussion which took place in the presence of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and that discussions centred around whether curfew should be imposed on January 9 in order to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the country ahead of the visit of Pope Francis.
Those who attended the meeting included former Minister G.L. Peiris, Central Bank Governor Ajith Navard Cabraal, Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the police chief, the commanders of the three forces, the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Law and Order Ministry Mahinda Balasuriya, he stated.
We were told that UNP supporters had attempted to assault one of our Provincial Councillors, Samanmalee Sakalasuriya, at a counting centre and there had been some reports of possible poll violations in Colombo. So we discussed about the possibility of imposing a curfew to maintain law and order so that there would be no hindrance to the arrival of the Pope he said.
But, Mr. Gammanpila added that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was of the opinion that the opposition would get the wrong impression if this was done and he had instructed the IGP to take the necessary steps to control the situation after holding discussions with the new President and Prime Minister. He had also instructed Presidential Secretary Lalith Weerathunga to organise the oath taking ceremony of the new president, Mr. Gammanpila said.
Mr. Gammanpila said that the claim that he had been part of an alleged coup was baseless as such a coup never existed. I told the CID everything I knew. I was present at Temple Trees from 2.30 am to 6.30 am on January 9 and a coup was never discussed during that time, he said adding that if such an uprising did take place it would be the first attempted legal coup in the world with knowledge of the Attorney General.
It is a big joke to think that Professor G.L. Peiris and I, who had never even used a catapult, had been part of a coup, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

	The unending stream of well-wishers calling on the Compassionate One ever since being elevated to the highest office has become a big headache to him.
Most of these well-wishers are really seasoned political lackeys who have been used to tasting power and perks under different regimes.
The other day two siblings who had once been very close to the deposed Big Boss called on the Compassionate One. They had earlier made known their intention to extend their unstinted support to the compassionate rule by way of setting the stage for this visit. Incidentally the two siblings are closely connected to media and cinema.
Pleasantries over, the Compassionate One inquired by way of common courtesy from the twosome whether there was any specific purpose for their visit. One of the siblings replied: Sir, we wish to do something worthwhile for your government in some official capacity.
The Compassionate One asked them what positions they wished to hold under his administration. One sibling said that he could serve on the directorate of a state-owned bank and the other said he could acquit well on an important commission.
Why should I offer you high office the Compassionate One asked. Are you seeking a reward for slinging mud at me through that website launched by that fellow to destroy my political career Do you think that I was not aware of what you two were doing behind the scene The door is there. Now get out! And they left without a murmur.

Why the deposed Big Boss stepped down
	
	
	A group of bigwigs of the previous regime loyal to the former Boss met to discuss the future of their alliance.
Several ex-Ministers who were articulate at this powwow took up the position that the party would quickly bounce back to its previous position of strength, if the deposed Boss took over the leadership again. Some agreed and some others acquiesced. Later they called on the former Boss to convey their decision.
The former Big Boss, sadder but wiser, gave an attentive ear to what his loyalists had to say. And while the discussion was on, he was also carefully observing the demeanour of each member of the group as if to find a clue to their inner thinking. Later, the former Big Boss told his visitors that he would come back to them after carefully considering their invitation.
Discussion over, the loyalists began leaving one by one. However, a few ex-Ministers remained as if they had some afterthoughts to share with the Boss. After exchanging a few minutes of small talk with the stragglers, the deposed Big Boss said: Did you observe that one was studying the patterns on the floor without making any comment during the entire discussion Was it not obvious that he did not welcome my entering the council to lead the opposition He added after a pause. You make him happy by offering this important office to him and leave me out of the scene!
So the one who once led the government side is now due to lead the opposition!
