Winning one will lead to losing two!


	

The chair of the leader of the house of the western council lies vacant for the last four months and three members vying for the post constantly hang around the new big boss, they say.
However, the New Big Boss so far has not made any move to pick anyone to fill the vacancy.
Some say that the New Big Boss is deliberately delaying nominating a member for the vacant post for a very good reason. “He fears that if any one of the three hopefuls is nominated for the post, the other two will take offence and will team up with the rebel group within the council led by the Chief Minister,” they point out.
Therefore, according to them, all indications are that the vacant chair will remain vacant until the dissolution of the Diyawanna council.
