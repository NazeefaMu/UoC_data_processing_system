Actress Ruwanthi Mangala who has thrown her hat into the ring with regard to the forthcoming Local Government Elections, spoke about her political ambitions and other important matters in an interview with the Daily Mirror. Mangala is contesting for the Kaduwela Electorate under the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) ticket.   

QWhat are your comments on increasing the quota for female candidates at the elections?   


It’s a really good move. More opportunities should be given to women in Sri Lanka. We can’t depend on men every single day. As our population remains the highest in the country, equal windows should be opened for us to showcase our talents and make a living. More rural women will contest the local elections this time. I believe that the participation of women in Sri Lankan politics should be increased so that we will be able to stand for our rights, especially for those women who are less-privileged.   

QWhat is your opinion on the contribution by women to the economy of the country?   


We all know that women have always faced institutional, political, and socio-cultural gender barriers. Women represent 52 percent of Sri Lanka’s population, but their representation is only about 5 percent in parliament. However, women at present aren’t willing to remain at home and do household work just like the women who lived during our grand parents’ days. They need to come out and break the stereotypes. I know of many women in my electorate who are engaged in some type of self-employment. They are no longer fond of expecting every little thing they need in their lives to be provided by their husbands.   

QIf you get elected, what plans do you have?   


I will do my best to solve problems pertaining to women in Sri Lanka. Once I obtain political power, I will look into their problems and do what is required. Women in my area will be provided with self-employment opportunities, financial support and other encouragement so that they can start their own livelihoods. I hope to provide them with a sound training in whatever field they hope to work in. Many women, especially old women, are deprived of financial reimbursements. I want to make sure that they get what they deserve.   

QWhat is your view on the President’s decision to reimpose the ban which prevents women from buying alcohol and finding employment in bars?   


Banning women from buying alcohol and being employed in bars is a prudent and an impressive decision by the President. Already many Sri Lankan families are suffering due to men being addicted to alcohol. If the mother of the house starts drinking, poor children will have no favour at all. Many problems will arise if women are allowed this liberty. When women work in bars, they tend to be victims of sexual harassment. As males from all walks of life frequent bars, women will be pushed to choose wrong paths. I know there are many so-called women’s organizations that are fighting against the ban. But, we have to understand that there are do’s for women and at the same time there are also limits and don’t s.   

QThe party you are contesting from was in trouble recently when actress Madusha Ramasinghe alleged that a party official demanded a sexual bribe from her in order to ensure she be given nomination. Not a single woman was there to voice against the incident.  


Since I joined the party, I have never faced that kind of experience. All the party members respect our female candidates and give us the due status. I heard that the woman you are talking about got rejected from every party in their attempts to receive nominations. I really don’t know about her mental situation at that time. However, we feel secure and respected within our party.   

QWhat do you think about the media reporting on artistes in Sri Lanka?


 It is very pathetic. Let me tell you about the recent mudslinging campaign carried out in social media against my husband Namal Udugama and me. People in Sri Lanka started bashing us without knowing the real story. They were misled by a particular politician who shamelessly used the incident to gain attention. How can some outsider talk about an incident which happened six years ago? The person who donated his kidney to my husband is too innocent and too desperate. As he was in a dire need for money, the particular politician used money and manipulated the donor in order to get his personal agenda fulfilled. Our whole family went through a very hard time. This kind of campaigns should be stopped. We were not the first victims and won’t be the last. People using social media are destroying artistes’ personal lives without mercy. All these gossip sites should be removed. If our Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna wins, I will push the heads of the party to take necessary legal actions against such bogus websites and pages. Administrators of those sites are just working for money, forgetting human virtues.
