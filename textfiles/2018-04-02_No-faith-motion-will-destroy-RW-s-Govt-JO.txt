The joint opposition (JO) said today it was optimistic of winning the no-faith motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with the objective of neutralizing his power over the government.

JO leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the the government led by Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe would be defeated in parliament on Wednesday.

MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Prime Minister would have to leave the government on Wednesday evening and a new government would be formed on Thursday morning.

“We have to remove the Premier first, then we can remove the government which is inefficient to the core. Today, the cost of living is skyrocketing, financial institutions are collapsing, strikes are everywhere and the underworld is raising its head again. This destruction is the result of the government led by the Premier,” Mr. Weerawansa said.

He said a faction of the UNP was also backing the no-faith motion and said the motion would be the first punishment given to the Prime Minister over the Central Bank bond scam. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
