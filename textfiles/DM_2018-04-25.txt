SL reiterates NPTs importance to build peace, security
	
Sri Lanka has reiterated the importance of the Non-Proliferation of the Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the global regime for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament which ensures a balanced and non-discriminatory approach to building international peace and security.
Sri Lankan Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, A.L.A. Azeez expressed these views while addressing Second Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of the Nuclear Weapons (NPT) on Tuesday in Geneva.
We support all efforts towards achieving the universalization of the NPT as the legal regime that enjoys the participation of the largest number of UN Member States including the permanent members of the UN Security Council. We also support the call for application of the full scope of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safeguards to ensure meaningful implementation of the provisions in the Treaty, he said.  
Ambassador Azeez said moving away from the realistic path to disarmament may lend itself to a possible re-emergence of an arms race, with far reaching consequences for humanity if it happened.
He said a nuclear security infrastructure linking nuclear safety regime and peaceful uses framework at the national level is pivotal to an environment which leaves no room for vulnerabilities to be exploited by persons or groups with malicious intent.
We propose that this Meeting come up with elements and guidelines that will help a time bound and pragmatic action plan and outcome to emerge at the 2020 NPT Review, he said.

SLMC rejects foreign medical team to hold clinics in SL
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) rejected to register a foreign medical team of around 150 members who had sought approval to hold clinics in Sri Lanka, a spokesman to the SLMC today said.
The spokesman told Daily Mirror that this request had been made through the Sri Lanka Navy where medical personnel attached to the Navy of some other countries including America, Australia and Japan had sought the approval to hold clinics in the North-Eastern Province for two weeks.
The Navy is making requests from time to time to hold such clinics. Similar incident has happened last year, where a group of foreign doctors requested to hold clinics in Hambantota, and the SLMC had rejected to register them, he said.
He said the SLMC had not registered them last year because the request had not been directed to them through the Director General of Health Services and added that this year the requests had been made in the proper way.
He said the registration of this medical team was rejected due to lack of details, however, the SLMC had allowed this team to participate as observers and only the local doctors would conduct medication.
He said the clinics are scheduled to hold from April 25 to May 9.
Meanwhile, the Navy said this medical team had arrived in Sri Lanka by the U.S. Navy hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) as U.S and partner nation service members participated in the Pacific Partnership 2018 in Trincomalee.
The mission in Trincomalee will continue till May 8 and will feature Pacific Partnership doctors and medical personnel working side-by-side with Sri Lankan medical professionals to exchange best practices, it said.
It said the mission included military and civilian personnel from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Peru, and Japan.
However, it also said the Navy had earlier conducted medical camps jointly with medical teams of other countries including United States and India. (Kalathma Jayawardhane and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Suspect to appear in court after van ramming in Toronto kills 10
	

DPA, 24th APRIL, 2018- The man suspected of deliberately driving a van into pedestrians along a busy street in Toronto is set to appear in court later on Tuesday.
Alek Minassian, who was arrested on Monday, is due to appear before a Toronto court at 10 am (1400 GMT), Toronto police said on Twitter, adding that information on charges will be released at that time.
The 25-year-old was arrested after the van he was driving jumped the kerb and mowed down pedestrians in the busy suburb of North York, killing at least 10 and injuring 15 others.
Similar acts in other cities in recent years have been carried out by terrorists, but Ralph Goodale, Canadas minister of public safety, said following the attack that it was too early to say whether the Toronto incident was terrorism. Goodale also said it was unknown whether the incident was connected to a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers currently taking place in Toronto, Canadas biggest city.

## Title: Take a cue from Modi

Take a cue from Modi
	
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be the best democrat or one to assure a greater freedom to media. However a few days ago he came with a fine piece of advice to his MPs on deportment and reading that one cannot help, but wish the Sri Lankan President and Prime Minister too offer the same counsel to our parliamentarians. 
We make mistakes and give masala (fodder) to media. The moment you see a camera you start speaking. Dont stand in front of the TV cameras and start preaching the country, PM Modi has reportedly said addressing the MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Indian Prime Minister has advised his party people not to play great scientists and experts by giving their opinion on each and every thing whenever theresan issue. 
Modis comments came in the wake of a rising number of crimes in the country. Some BJP MPs have commented that they didnt have any control over the trend given the countrys populationand size. 
Let the media do its job Modi had reportedly told his MPs commenting on media exposure of the incidents. He had insisted that the MPs should do their jobs and not the jobs of others. 
Modis India has 1.32 billion people. Ours is a small nation with twenty one million citizens and almost double the number of Cabinet, State and deputy ministers. Still our Government is unable to control the rising crime rate and salvage the plunging economy. 
Surely the citizens of this country are looking forward to the day President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe take a cue from the Indian PM and tell their Ministers and MPs Dont blame the Joint Opposition or the media for our own mistakes. People are tired of these excuses. Correct your mistakes instead of preaching the country with your own theories as if you are social scientists or experts on subjects. The most important thing perhaps is the two leaders convincing themselves of this reality. The citizens are tired of the habit of each and every Government member looking for scapegoats for the present sorry state of affairs in the country. 
We are into the fourth month of the fourth year of the present regime and still the majority of Government ministers and MPs are unable to make a speech without blaming the previous regime. An impression has been created that this Government cannot do anything significant development wise as the previous Government has chained them to posts. When these sob stories were started in the first year of the Government the people tolerated them. In the second year they grew tired and impatient. In the third they got frustrated and in the fourth the voters sent the strongest message by engineering a comeback for Mahinda Rajapaksa with his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). Obviously more than the popularity of Rajapaksa it was the dwindling popularity of the Government over inefficiency and other factors that pushed people to yearn for a return of a Rajapakse era. 
Other than inefficiency, the attitudes of some ministers too has become quite unacceptable. The latest in this list of ministers is Faiszer Musthapha the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government. While any civilized citizen would have endorsed the decision by the Coastal Conservation Departments to remove unauthorized constructions along the coastal belt in Mirissa by May 1, especially in the wake of the attack on Dutch tourists, Minister Musthapha is opposing the order. His argument is that the removal of unauthorized structures would hamper the livelihood of small entrepreneurs. If the livelihood of those who have put up unauthorized structures is a concern then crimes against tourists is a bigger concern for a country that is dependent heavily on tourism. Modi said that some of his MPs are trying to play the roles of social scientists and experts and theres certainly no dearth of them here in Sri Lanka as well.

Uncle-niece feud leads to another hiccup
	

A big row had broken out within the Pohottuwa party over the recent election of the chair for the major council in the gem city.

Pohottuwa had returned the highest number to the council falling short of the necessary majority and its leaders had initially decided to take the chair of the council with the support of the Blue party members as the party had returned a majority to the council.
However, the Pohottuwa lady ruling the roost in the gem city district doing a secret maneuver had got a party candidate elected the chair with the support of the Greens offering the deputy chair to a Green in return for their support. And this had triggered fireworks in the Pohottuwa party.
The breach of the initial agreement to win the chair with the support of Blues has been attributed to the protracted feud between the lady and her Uncle John, they say.
The other Diyawanna members representing Pohottuwa in the district were soon up in arms and informed the Pohottuwa Chief, the former strongman that they would no longer acknowledge the firebrand-ladys district leadership.
The former strongman had later sent for the lady and given her a tongue-lashing.
Now that the lady has fallen from grace of the party leadership, the mantle of the district leadership falling on Uncle John, a foregone conclusion, is a matter of course, they say.

Unheard sounds and faint memories of bloody white vans
	
All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candour~Walt Whitman
In the questionable days of the Rajapaksa regime, the most dreadful sound, amongst many a sound of shooting in Rathupaswela, Katunayake and post-war Jaffna, was the one that you did not hear: A white van parked outside your home.
How many men and women were forcibly shoved into the van and taken away and threatened, their bones smashed, and spirit drained, one may never know.
Among those countless shrieks and screams and unbridled impunity to those who hurt innocent men and women who happened to hold a different view from that of those in power, their broken noses and shattered bones might yet be bleeding.
How many men and women were forcibly shoved into the van and taken away and threatened, their bones smashed, and spirit drained
Those who wrote a different story, different from the garbage thrown out by the State-owned media and sycophants of the regime garbed in officials dress, had vanished.
The heart-wrenching saga of a wife going from one Government desk to another is still being written in many a newspaper page, yet she doesnt seem to get any plausible answer.
Prageeth Eknaligoda was no ordinary journalist who happened to write the Rajapaksa-fed flattering stories about the glories of the First Familys far-fetched and exaggerated triumphs.
Eknaligodas disappearance has been in the realm of news stories that would haunt the readers curiosity for many a year.
Those Government politicians at the time either maintained a muted demeanour or those in the then Opposition tried hard to bring forth this unbelievable tragedy to the attention of a placid public, invariably and tragically fell short.
Prageeth Eknaligoda was supposed to have written some investigative piece which was allegedly devastating to the collective personality of the First Family. It is more akin to a mad dictators reaction to an unfavourable account of a nasty act committed by the Family.
Prageeth Eknaligodas disappearance cannot be rotting away in an empty, socio-political quarry forever.
Even in the unlikely event of a Rajapaksa comeback in governance-territory, the body of Prageeth, still breathing or not, has to be produced (habeas corpus) to reach a finality.
Otherwise, the rule of law is absent; investigative arms of the basic governing body of any society cannot just be cut off in order to conceal the evil deeds of democratically elected Mafia bosses.
The fixers of a greedy and power-hungry members of a Family need to be exposed but how can that elementary distinction of the rule of law be made to exercise its basic function if the present-day rulers turn their eyes and ears the other way
One can still remember how the infamous Alfred de Zoysa of the Kalattewa fame was convicted of murder when the bodies of those who were murdered were missing.
Neither State-sponsored terrorism nor an impotent non-response of the State is any answer to legitimate grievances of a wailing public.
But the irony of the situation is even more heartbreaking.
A Government that was ushered in on a podium of eradication of corruption, nepotism and impunity from the rule of law, seems to be even more entrenched in its own mass of lethargy, indecision and saliva for money.
While a sad cloud of the Prageeth Eknaligoda saga is still hovering over a docile and ineffective government, those who are accused of executing this dreadful deed on a freelancing journalist and his family are still free.
And the answers dont seem to be forthcoming. That is not a complementary commentary on a Yahapalanaya Government.
The net effect of such placidity and indifference to the real world is the likelihood of the return of the villain- the Rajapaksas.
On top of the Prageeth Eknaligoda case, the incident of the daytime murder of Lasantha Wickramatunga, Editor of the Sunday Leader, the premier newspaper that went after the alleged corrupt practices of the Rajapaksas, too weighs heavily on the those who are charged with the investigation and pursuit to an end of its legal process.
Two and half years is long enough time for the investigations to produce a result, one way or the other. The snails pace at which the judicial processes are meandering gives room for suspicion and distrust in the totality of the process.
Even Rajapaksa comeback into the governance-the body of Prageeth, still breathing or not, has to be produced
Is someone deliberately instructing the investigators to go slow or not to proceed along the lines which are getting too close for comfort for some close members of the former First Family
The inquisitive public is getting weary of this disgustingly sluggish and tortuous snaking.
Lasantha Wickramatunga had friends in high places.
The then circle of diplomats and foreign envoys, especially those representing neo-liberal Western and North Western Europe, exhibited and adopted a curious, keen and encouraging stance and embraced Lasanthas fearless attitude towards going after the corrupt and degenerate. In the eyes of the public, reading or otherwise, there was only one party that had the motive to silence Lasantha Wickramatunga.
That was the regime of the Rajapaksas. Into whose closets Lasantha looked and what degradation or decomposition their contents were in, we are not able to see.
Lasantha Wickrematungas murder is a gruesome reminder of what political power, gone to the fringe, could do not only to a worthy man, it is even more of a reminder of that power that could be mustered to thwart the freedom of expression of a people, a fundamental right of human society.
Along with the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda and the murder of Lasantha Wickramatunga came the Rathupaswela and Katunayake murders of innocent civilians who chose to exercise their fundamental right, protesting against the government policies.
The murder of a Tamil journalist attached to the Udayan newspaper has been swept under the carpet.
All these are among a crowded field of journalists such as Upali Tennakoone, Keith Noyahr, and Poddala Jayantha against whom the violation of human rights had been committed.
But what stands out as a brutal reminder of ignobility of a Power Family is the mysterious killing of Thajudeen on unbelievably personal grounds. The evidence has emerged connecting very high-up personalities at the time of this murder and the public is still awaiting finality, not to mention the prison riots that claimed more than twenty-five lives of inmates.
These are all crimes, plain and simple. Killing is a crime. It is the principal and most horrendous crime one can commit.
If the criminals are not found and convicted and punished, the rule of law, upon which every civilized societal structure is founded, collapses.
Either anarchy spreads or authoritarianism of a Family Junta would begin its heinous grip on a docile and totally breakable society.
The battle for such a choice between two revolting options has been fought by the Joint Opposition (JO).
Theirs is ostensibly for a faster-developing and a more orderly society. Faster-developing; yes, but more orderly is loaded with frightening potential for the control of our basic rights; for control of minds and of every aspect of our lives. That is certainly not an enchanting prospect.
Every member of the Joint Opposition and every financier of that movement, if left to his or her own devices and demeanour, would be a dangerous parasite in our midst.
Bringing back a democratically defeated political force that is controlled at the centre by corrupt and evil predators of one single family is no option for the civil sustenance of our society.
But what is even more disheartening and depressing is what lies at the end of these arguments and debate.
A government that is purported to be founded on Yahapalanaya is sadly lacking in focus and seems unaccustomed to the vagaries of political storms.
That was the regime of the Rajapaksas. Into whose closets Lasantha looked and what degradation or decomposition their contents were in, we are not able to see.

Yet, overcoming a potentially damaging no-confidence motion, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is basking in a false sense of relief.
If he fails to pursue the wrong-doers of the last regime and bring them before the rule of law and justice, if he once again fails in that crucial task, then he might as well say goodbye to power, come next elections. If, on the other hand, he does succeed in bringing the Rajapaksas before the rule of law and secures unforgiving sentences that go with it, Ranil Wickremesinghe might have a fighting chance, that again if he manages to contain a squabbling Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and a league of Muslim parties.
The choice before Ranil Wickremesinghe is, to use a worn-out clich, as clear as crystal.
However, it could be extremely unpleasant, not to others but to himself. If he intends to remain as leader of the United National Party and also is infatuated with the idea of contesting the forthcoming Presidential Elections in 2020 as its candidate, he has only one single choice: Vigorously go after the Rajapaksas and their henchmen and pursue that judicial process to a successful conclusion.
If, on the other hand, Ranil Wickremesinghe optes to stay out of the said Presidential Election and yet continue as the UNP leader, then that might offer a more pliable leverage to would-be contestants such as Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake.

Mr. Kariyawasam, who confirmed that he had been named as the new General Secretary of the party, said the other positions will be finalized at the meeting of the working committee today.
Mr. Premadasa said the party leader had nominated the names for the posts while the politburo had expressed its views with regard to the reorganization of the party. He said everything will be finalized today. I would like to be elected to my post, he added.
Another politburo member, who did not wish to be named, revealed that some party members had informed Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe that people expected something better. Mr. Wickremesinghe, in response, had suggested a ballot where the working committee and the parliamentary group are given the opportunity of electing office bearers for the party.
Politburo members, who had expressed concern about the peoples aspirations, have then said the parliamentary group should be briefed about these views before the working committee meeting. However, it has been decided to hold the working committee meeting today (26) to obtain its approval for the nominated office bearers. (Yohan Perera)

Waffle House shooting suspect facing four counts of homicide
	

DPA, 24th APRIL, 2018 - The suspected gunman in a weekend shooting that left four people dead at a restaurant in the US state of Tennessee has been arrested, bringing an end to a manhunt that lasted a day and a half, police said Monday. 
Travis Reinking was found in a wooded area by Nashville police who were following up on a tip from a citizen. A semi-automatic weapon was found in his backpack, Lieutentant Carlos Lara told a news conference. He did not try to resist and made no statement, Lara said. 
Nashville police spokesman Don Aaron told a news conference that Reinking requested a lawyer after arriving at police headquarters. He was taken to hospital to be evaluated. He faces four counts of criminal homicide, Aaron said. 
Reinking, 29, moved late last year from Illinois to the town south-east of Nashville near the restaurant where the shooting took place around 3:30 am Sunday (0730 GMT).

WHATS NEXT & WHOS NEXT AFTER YAHAPALANAYA
	
Ecrasez linfame!Crush the loathsome thing!
- Voltaire
Neoliberalism is almost dead in Sri Lanka, and its Government is dying. The choice that is before us is which type/variety of Populism:Right, Left, Centre or Centre-Left 
Even if the JVPs 20th amendment is supported by the UNP, TNA and misguided/manipulated SLPP pundits, the people will defeat it at a Referendum because (i) they are looking for a chance to reject the Government and the Establishment (ii) the mood is for a strong state, not a weakened one (iii) the NO campaign will be led by a neo-nationalist network, as was Brexit (iv) anti-UNP voters (the mainstay of the JO-Pohottuwa) will stay home rather than vote with the UNP-TNA on anything and (v) at a Referendum, the voters do not vote on party lines, therefore party-based arithmetic is superseded by the national mood, and that mood is bitterly antagonistic to the 2015 Establishment. The 20th amendment move will only strengthen the Sinhala Alt-Right backlash and place it at the head of the agenda for regime change,just as Sinhala Only did in 1955. 
Mahinda Rajapaksa himself is easily the mostoutstanding, mature and experienced political andBy national leader Sri Lanka has.

The people have figured out the arithmetic of the minority factor too, and were reminded of it during the live telecast of the vote on the motion of no-confidence, when the leader who appointed Arjuna Mahendran was propped up by his UNP and the16 seater TNAFake Opposition (Mr. Sampanthan is merely masquerading as the Opposition Leader) with Mangala Samaraweera promising to expedite a new Constitution and Transitional Justice. The majority of the citizens know that this time around they will have to vote in such numbers that the combined weight of the structurally pro-UNP/ pro-Right minority vote will be utterly overwhelmed by a pan-Sinhala electoral tsunami.
If you put together the historically lowest point the Sri Lankan rupee has plunged to, the lowest economic growth rate the country has had in sixteen years,the massive slew of new taxes, the projected rise in fuel prices, the discontent at the UNP grassroots and the rebellion in the SLFP parliamentary mainstream, then you recognize that the Governments defeat is a known knownsomething we know that we already know. 
The only thing that is interim about the interim administration that the SLFPs CBK faction is negotiating, is the interim nature of that factions electoral existence, which will end in extinction as did the LSSP-CPSL in 1977. Even in the unlikely event of the UNP changing its leadership, it will be too little too late-- and anyway the Navin-Sajith succession struggle is already causing dissonance and fissure. 
We know how and when (at the latest) the story of the 2015 Yahapalana Government ends. It is as in the title of Gabriel Garcia Marquezs famous novel, Chronicle of a Death Foretold. We know who loses, but who and what winds up the biggest winner Nobody and no permutation or combination in the Yahapalana Government can be a winner, because the public mood is so bitterly hostile (crush the loathsome thing!). Only a candidate who is chosen, endorsed and strongly supported by Mahinda Rajapaksa, and whose campaign is spearheaded by him, stands a chance of winning the Presidency.
The people are poised to bid a long goodbye to the pro-western liberalism and its socially decadent elite.They want a strong, determined, patriotic, populist leader
So the only real questions in Sri Lankan politics today are: Who will wield state power when this Government is buried in 18 months at the latestWho will Mahinda choose
Mahinda Rajapaksa himself is easily the most outstanding, mature and experienced political and national leader we have-- a truly historic and appealing figure. As do most voters I would dearly like to see him as the leader of the country once more, and I definitely think he is the safest choice, but there is the Constitutional obstacle of the 19th amendment.
The JVPs 20th amendment is a trap to get the JO-SLPP on the side of a YES vote at a referendum for the UNP. If the UNP wins any nationwide popular vote it will efface the recent defeat at the local elections and gain the oxygen needed to recover. 
The 13th amendment cannot be abolished as it is the result of a bilateral agreement, however asymmetric. I do not wish to see the 13th amendment able to operate outside the overarching framework of the Executive Presidency. I do not believe that on a small island neighbouring a large ethnic (Tamil) kin-state, a parliamentary system can adequately manage the Northern and Eastern Provincial Councils which are closer to Tamil Nadu in every sense than they are to Colombo.
I do not wish to see a Parliament and a Prime Minister as dependent upon the sectarian-regionalist parties as I saw this present PM during the no-confidence motion. That will be the permanent state of our politics if we abolish the executive Presidency. Such a Prime Minister will be reduced to merely the Chief Minister of the Southern two thirds of the island; the Chief Minister of the Sinhalese!How can the 13 amendment be controlled by any Prime Minister who is himself/herself dependent upon minority votes in Parliament If King Dutugemunu were Prime Minister under the proposed system, he would have to secure the TNAs support in Parliament to leave Maagama to liberate and reunify his country!
All that said, we still confront a major, complex problem. The problem is that the constituency, discourse, project and ideology of any oppositional Presidential candidate should not generate (I) domestic polarization vis--vis the ethno-religious/ethno-regional minorities as well as the progressive Sinhala youth, students and trade unions and (II) bring us into direct confrontation with India, the West and possibly the Islamic world, on moral, political and geostrategic terrain in which even Russia and China cannot successfully support us.The strong, unitary Chinese state has constitutionalized the sub-system of Ethnic Regional Autonomy, the Lankan equivalent of which the Sinhala Alt-Right thinks it can dismantle/dilute while on Indias doorstep!
None of these forebodings will prevent a strong, dynamic anti-Establishment personality from rocketing into Presidential office next year. The people are poised to bid a long goodbye to the pro-western liberalism and its socially decadent elite.They want a strong, determined, patriotic, populist leader who will reverse the national declinea Putin or Erdogan. Contemporary history will shape the backlash which will naturally turn to and draw from the defining social and national experience of our lifetime: the Great War and the successful management of a classic victory. 
My conclusions: 
I. Under no conceivable circumstances whatsoever should the JO-SLPP be on the same side of the barricades as the UNP, in Parliament or outside, calling for a YES vote at a referendum on any issue! If it does so, the JO-SLPP will be switching places with candidate Maithripala Sirisena of January 2015 and providing a progressive mask for a UNP-TNA project. It would also be repeating the sad betrayal by the ex-progressive Maithripala Senanayaka at the Dec 1982 Referendum. The JO-SLPP must call for a NO vote at a referendum on any Constitutional reform, go flat out in the campaign and use the massive rejection of the proposal as a method of ousting the UNP-led Government and its SLFP puppets from office. 
II. As for the dangers of an Alt-Right driven Presidential candidacy and its aftermath as regime, the solution is to launch the dynamic, anti-Establishment political candidacy firmly under Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership;anchored, locked-in and contained within the parameters of a bloc of the JO-SLPP-SLFPRebels. Mahinda must be the Prime Minister that Putin was, not what Madam Bandaranaike was in 1994. That is the only way to reshape a fraught historical conjuncture and risky configuration of forces in which the government and Presidency may be boxed in by an extremist Sinhala Alt-Right constituency and project which will drive us beyond the prudent limits of geopolitical and geostrategic Realism.

WHAT SAY YOU!
	
Universal Health Coverage is our new slogan. It is certainly laudable. I am 86-years-old and recollect my life as a Doctor, Public Health Officer (Malariology), Director of Anti-Malaria Campaign. After joining the WHO, I served as a Malariologist in Bangladesh, Nepal and ended as WHO Representative in Bangladesh.
After retirement, served as a consultant for USAID, World Bank, UN and WHO. You may say looks pretty impressive. I remember the slogan of the 1970s Health for All by the Year 2000. Sri Lanka was represented by Health Minister Siva Obeysekara and Deputy Director General of Public Health Services Dr. Herbert Jesuthasan.Siva was a dynamic minister and organizer. We all got into the act enthusiastically.
Country governments must be convinced as well as the Opposition so that the plans formulated are carried out to meet the desired objectives and goals even if the Opposition comes into power
This is 2018. Have we achieved Health for All Ms. Obeysekara and Stalwarts like Dr. Ana Wickremesinghe former Director, Anti-Malaria Campaign and Director General of Health Services plus many dedicated doctors, entomologists, PHIs, Laboratory Assistants, Microcopists, Field Assistants played a major role in the elimination of Malaria. It was a coordinated effort, including not only the health services but allied government departments, the private sector, NGOs and the Sri Lankan community itself. The recent elimination of malaria is certainly a successful story. Sri Lanka has other health success stories as well. 
I remember in the early 1980s we were enamoured with the call for Equity in Health nationwide and then globally. Equity is something perhaps you would attain in the Garden of Eden or in a mythical El-Dorado. But certainly if we look at it retrospectively, there were for sure improvements in health in a number of receptive countries. Country governments must be convinced as well as the Opposition so that the plans formulated are carried out to meet the desired objectives and goals even if the Opposition comes into power. There are so many hot beds in the Middle East and other countries. How do we approach them 
In WHO itself, the effort must be sustained at Headquarters level with direct links to its regional and country offices. The links must be firm, responsive and sustained. The linkages within the countries are vital, if the vision and mission are to succeed. Persistent monitoring of implementation is essential with ready remedial measures to be put in place, if progress is slow. 
The Holistic approach is an essential pre-requisite for a country to succeed. Inter-country and inter-regional approaches will help the ultimate global push. Constant monitoring will assist implementation and help institute corrective measures if previous plans have failed. The bottom up approach is the most successful for continued implementation namely, village to district; district to province and province to country. The centre should be the source for country monitoring, revision and for change and implementation. 
I remember that for any health unit to succeed it is not the medical officer who is the king pin but the unit as such. The Entomologists, the Nurse, the Public Health Inspector, the Microscopists, the Field Assistants, Laboratory Staff and equipment are equally important. Quick monitoring and immediate action on spotting would be disasters are vital. Each individual in the team must feel that he is essential for it to succeed. 
The Holistic approach is an essential pre-requisite for a country to succeed. Inter-country and inter-regional approaches will help the ultimate global push. Constant monitoring will assist implementation and help institute corrective measures if previous plans have failed
As a Sri Lankan Community Physician, I must pay tribute to our pioneers in public health. I recall Dr. W. A. Karunaratne, Dr. Herath Gunaratne and a host of others who made it possible for us to achieve these remarkable vital health statistical parameters. Its not the brilliant Cardiac Surgeon with his bypass surgery or that Sherlock Holmes type physician with his admirable diagnosis and cure. But the lowly Kanu or Drainage doctors as we were contemptuously called sometime back who helped to achieve these admirable health indicators and parameters.
Time waits for no one. So let us proceed with our arduous journey to improve our health standards keeping in mind, the constraints. 
I remember my Senior Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prof. Ranasinghe, Ranaya as we used to call him remark emphatically WHAT SAY YOU!

## Title: Where have  all the suspects gone- Far, Far, away!!!
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 25 April 2018 12:34 am
Where have  all the suspects gone- Far, Far, away!!!
	
1. Do we hear loud whispers asking where have all the suspects gone Far, far away we are told!!! Should we ask why Arjuna Mahendran was last known to have been in Singapore, Udayanga in Dubai, Jaliya only the good Lord knows!!! Well definitely need to keep an eye on that since it was the director of the National Eye Hospital who gave him the green light saying that the surgery could not be performed in our island home!!!
Mahendran was last known to have been in Singapore, Udayanga in Dubai, Jaliya only the good Lord knows!!!
	Aluthgamage has been released on bail and he had the distinction of coming out with two Ministers in attendance!!
	When the present IGP took over there was a lot of optimism that he would change the Police Force for the better!!!
Now, Aluthgamage has been released on bail and he had the distinction of coming out with two Ministers in attendance!!! We are constrained to ask who is afraid of whom Finally, Red Notice has been issued on Mahendran, assuming of course, that he wont disappear to the rural India or some other country before the sleuths get him.
Cabinet Reshuffle
2. Shuffles and reshuffles, still struggling to find their way, in-fighting!!! Postponing the inevitable of who gets what!!! Karunanayake is also being considered for a Ministerial Post!!! Are we that bankrupt that we have to get these people back into the Government Our erstwhile Prime Minister has not yet bothered to tell us why Karunanayake was made Finance Minister in the first instanceNow, he is being given consideration yet again!!! Who should get the credit for this, we wonder!!!

NO LAW AND ORDER !!!
3. The country has never been in such chaos!!! Not even the illustrious Ministers know where they are going!!! How can they, when they cannot even arrive at decisions regarding portfolios How can they when they did not realise all these years that they had not concentrated on the development of the country So, we are expected to believe that they are going to do it now Who is fooling whom Lets first ask, who felt safer with all these conmen being abroad Who is really afraid of whom
What shocks and surprises does the new Cabinet hold Why are they so afraid of giving Law and Order to Sarath Fonseka, when he is the only man capable of handling it Why is the reshuffle being continuously postponed The dates are being shuffled more than the Ministers themselves!!!
4. Rape, drugs, killings, accidents, malfunctions are still happening!!! Isnt there a single man with a spine, who can stand up and bring proper punishment on all the offences that are going unpunished today
Dont we have one man who can call a spade a spade Why cant we do what they did in Bhopal, India
The Police made all four rapists walk the streets and gave the public the right to stone them or beat them up and the women really did!!! They went for the Jugular (metaphorically!!!) If India had the guts to mete out such punishment, why cant we Perhaps we need to send someone to purchase some guts from India
5. Looking around we need more than guts to get this sorry country back on track!!! Killing one another, fighting one another, accidents by the dozen, buses with passengers overflowing horning and horning always on the wrong side, when they are expected to keep to the left!!! Who gives a damn, who cares
Do the Police, the men who are expected to maintain law and order to a certain extent at least When the present IGP took over there was a lot of optimism that he would change the Police Force for the better!!! What happened to the change
Nobody can glance at a newspaper these days without a sense of revulsion  accidents, suicides and murders seem to be the order of the day!!! Perhaps it is a general feeling, that despite the Governments insistence that the economy is improving and one or two small indicators point to some growth, no one is in an optimistic mood, no one feels like spending money!!! Everywhere people are worried about what the effect would be not only on business but on life in this country in general!!!
6. The newspapers of the April 22 and 23 were full of articles and supplements on the late and great Athulathmudali!!! It is correct that there were many glitches but both Lalith and Gamini also worked for the good of the common man!!!
Karunanayake is also being considered for a Ministerial Post!!! Our erstwhile PM has not yet bothered to tell us why Karunanayake was made Finance Minister in the first instance ....
They left behind lasting monuments of their various noteworthy accomplishments that have lasted 25 years and will certainly go on for more!!! It is such a pity that the present Government cannot at least draw from their glowing examples, be guided by their entrepreneurship and strive to some extent to emulate both Lalith and Gamini.
The people are confused, they wonder if this Cabinet of Ministers cannot even decide on a date when the Cabinet is going to be changed- if it will ever happen-how can the common man ever believe what they are being told
Postponement of everything seems to be the order of the day and they- from the President down-have not yet come to grips with what they have not done, perhaps because they dont know, even now, when they are going to!!!
The shame indeed is ours, because we brought them into office!!!

A gentleman to the core
	
FREDDIE ALLES
It is almost three months since our dear friend Freddie left us. Freddie left a little too early, but his, was a life well lived. A chartered accountant by profession, he was more a man of automobiles than accounts. Freddie was a walking Encyclopaedia on automobiles be it vintage, classic, sports or modern exotic cars. His collection of cars included the rarest models of Rolls Royces, Hopmobile, Bogward Isabella, DKWs, Fiats, Alfa Romeo, MGs, Daimler, Mercedes, Opel Recard, Opel Kapitan, Citroen, Jaguars, Jowett Javelin and many more.
His cars were not merely for show, for he used his cars regularly, for private running all over the country and also at the many Sunday Runs, which he almost never missed. Freddie used to talk fondly about how he started his collection with a Fiat 500, 4Sri 4080 for Rs. 5000/- whilst working at Hayleys and how he used to race his MG in his younger days. 
Pursuant to his death early this year, his friend Nimal Wimalasuriya wrote in the Motormaglanka.lk: 
In the month of February, the Classic/Vintage car community of Sri Lanka lost one of its ardent fans. One could describe Freddie Alles with a myriad of titles associated with Classic/Vintage cars such as a Collector, Historian, Enthusiast and even a Walking Encyclopaedia; but the most apt title that one could give him was Gentleman .. . Freddie was indeed that, a gentleman to the core.
He was one of the founder members of the Mercedes Benz Club of Sri Lanka, founded in 1990 and was the President of the Club again in the year 2017 having being its President earlier too. He was one of the strongest pillars of the Mercedes Benz Club. He was also an active member of the Classic Car Club of Ceylon, a senior member of the Vintage Car Club of Ceylon, member of the Italian Car Enthusiasts Club and also in several international automobile clubs. Freddie was an asset to any club as he got involved in all aspects of club activities with absolute dedication and passion. 
I first met Freddie long years ago in the Mercedes Benz Club and we gradually became close friends. In the last couple of years, not a day passed by where we had not contacted each other, either by phone, email or Whatsapp and I just cannot bring myself to erase those records from my phone. We exchanged messages even as late as January this year, and all those messages are still intact in my phone. 
Freddie was always there for a friend and many a time when I had some little issue with an old car and phoned him to get his advice, he would be at my place sometimes within minutes to help me out. He made time for people and his knowledge of automobiles was amazing. 
Freddie was a warm, down to earth human being. He had a habit of coming up to the car to see you off and-even in his last days, suffering with acute pain he would still walk us to the car to say good bye. He helped car enthusiasts in every way possible, and some were barely known to him. He helped anyone who asked for help or had a problem. Freddie helped people and causes quietly. He was closely associated with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society and served in many capacities including that of its President. 
His love for his family was as intense and all encompassing as his love of cars. He would often send us photos of the frequent road trips he used to take with family, his visits to car museums and car shows from all over the world, of his beloved children and grand children, and pictures of him and Shanthi, his beloved wife or with his children taken when they were young or photos from his racing days. He thought the world of his family. 
The motoring fraternity lost a true motoring enthusiast. The family, a much loved husband, father, a grandfather, a brother, and we lost a true friend, a man with a golden heart. 
May God bless his soul!

Ammonia tragedy a result of ignoring proper security methods: CEA
	
The recent tragedy in Crepe Rubber Manufacturing Factory at Horana where five people died due to an ammonia gas exposure on April 19, had been directly caused due to the lack of attention to the factory's safety programme, Director General of the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Hemantha Jayasinghe said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said the factory which was operated utilizing chemical substances had not observed a due procedure to maintain a special care of the employees during the long term maintenance in the industrial activities.
Environmental experts in the Environmental Protection Unit of the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy have taken instant steps to conduct a field inspection at the rubber factory, Mr. Jayasinghe said.
A valid Environmental Protection License had been issued to maintain the activities of the Institute and it is a legally valid license from November 11, 2017 to November 10, 2018. It provides advice and conditions as how to maintain such a factory with safety methods. However, the factory had not maintained it with safety methods, D.G Jayasinghe said.
He said the CEA suspended the functions and operations of the Rubber Factory and added it looked forward to shut down the factory after considering the report of the investigations and the inspections of the CEA. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

British Council and Clarity English deploy online test preparation tool in Sri Lanka
	
Simon Creasey  Country Exams Manager, British Council Sri Lanka
British Council and Clarity English have collaborated to develop an online preparation and practice resource for the IELTS. This online tool is launched for the first time in Sri Lanka exclusively through the British Council IELTS Registration centre network. The Road to IELTS programme is designed to enable test takers to perform to the best of their capabilities and can be accessed from anywhere using desktops, tablets and soon mobile phones as well.
Road to IELTS Institutional version is a comprehensive and up-to-date practice resource aimed at tackling the challenges faced by IELTS candidates. It comprises of four key resources for each skill area, beginning with an eBook which introduces each paper and explains task types. Further resources include advice and tutorial videos by experts, a practice zone, and test practice, where candidates simulate the test experience with mock tests.
IELTS is the International English Language Testing System, the worlds most popular English language proficiency test for higher education and global migration with over 3 million tests taken in the last year. Over 10,000 organisations trust and accept IELTS as a secure, valid and reliable indicator of true to life ability to communicate in English for education, immigration and professional accreditation. IELTS is jointly owned by British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and Cambridge English Language Assessment.
The British Council emphasises and understands the importance of IELTS for students aiming to study abroad. As explained by registered IELTS examiner and Managing Director of ClarityEnglish, Andrew Stokes, Typically, overseas students accept an offer of a university place about six months before the academic year begins. However, most will not take their IELTS test until three months later, and inevitably a certain percentage fails to achieve the band score required for the course. Failing at the IELTS can drastically affect ones future.
Andrew Stokes  Managing Director, Clarity English
Clarity English is a developer of tech-based learning materials for English and the recipient of the English-Speaking Union Innovation Award and the HKICT Award for Technical Excellence (Best Product) for Road to IELTS. Established in 1994, its relationship with British Council spans over 20 projects. British Council and Clarity English also co-publish other IELTS support resources in addition to Road to IELTS.
With Road to IELTS, effective test preparation and teacher support extends beyond the classroom. The program is devised to mark students work and provide feedback on individual performance as well. According to Dr Victoria Clark of the British Council, Depending on motivation and talent, a student can raise their level of English by half to one IELTS band score in three months if they put in enough work.
Since its inception, Road to IELTS has concluded more than 4 million sessions and is utilized by more than 1,000 schools globally. A survey of 130,000 users of Road to IELTS determined that those who use it the most improve by as much as 52%.
Our IELTS Registration centre network, spans across the country. Many of them offer IELTS preparation support to test candidates and we are keen to support the partner network with quality tools for IELTS preparation. We understand that preparation is key to get desired results at the test, said Simon Creasey, Country Exams Manager British Council.
The resource comprises of more than 300 interactive exercises, 36 individual practice tests, and 24 advice videos. Road to IELTS has several features, including a countdown clock, an IELTS score calculator, a timer for exam practice, and downloadable study sheets. The My Progress function enables students to monitor performance, analyse their use of time, compare performance with other online users, and even predict band scores in the Reading and Listening tests using an interactive widget.

Cat is out of the bag
	

The soft-spoken and mild-mannered onetime Diyawanna member with a moniker that rhymes with hooray, now a governing one was transferred to the hill country reportedly after much deliberation at the highest echelons. And to everyones surprise, the governing one was re-transferred to Yalpanam even before the ink on the initial transfer order could dry up.

This sudden transfer cancellation set many wondering as to what could be the reason behind it. And many seemed to have accepted the explanation that it was a response to the popular request from the people of Yalpanam.
However, according to informed sources, there was a reason that some people in high places did not want to discuss: certain nayakes had reportedly got in touch with the authorities in the highest echelons post-haste and objected to the transfer citing a reason that the newcomer could not help.
So, the authorities meekly accepting the reason cited as a reasonable did a hurried reshuffle of transfers that suited the nayakes.
By the way, an eminent Government Agent posted to the main city in the hills years ago too had to face a similar situation, old-timers recall.
Incidents where certain great personalities had been slighted and discriminated against for reasons they could not help, had been commonplace in our neighbouring country in the recent past. Post- Independence Indias first Justice Minister Dr. B.R. Ambedkar embracing Buddhism along with several thousands of Dalits was a symbolic protest unjust discrimination against a section of the society.
Many right-thinking people, no doubt, condemn in strong terms this un-Buddhistic practice persisting in public life and consider it a matter for deep regret that of all, a section of Buddhist dignitaries in this country seem to uphold it.

By Karla Adam, William Booth (c) 2018, The Washington Post  Apr 23, 2018 - 
Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, gave birth to a baby boy on Monday morning, touching off widespread jubilation - and a few yawns - across Britain. Her husband, Prince William, 35, was by her side for the birth of their third child. 
The baby weighed 8lbs 7oz, Kensington Palace announced in a tweet. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth. Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well. 
According to tradition, news of the birth was later displayed on an easel in front of Buckingham Palace, but by then everyone knew the news. 
The roadway in front of the maternity entrance at St. Marys Hospital was lined with hundreds of reporters, speaking a babel of languages and doing stand-ups with cameras pointed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 
Prince George, 4, who was still wearing his school uniform, and Princess Charlotte, 2, came to meet their new sibling on Monday afternoon. Before walking in, Charlotte gave a royal wave to the cannonade of cameras. 
As the Cambridges got into their waiting Land Rover, William told reporters that he was very delighted, thank you.

China fails to get Indian support for Belt and Road ahead of summit
	

BEIJING REUTERS April 24- China failed to get Indias support for its ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure project at the end of a foreign ministers meeting of a major security bloc on Tuesday, ahead of an ice-breaking trip to China this week by Indias prime minister. 
The Belt and Road is Chinese President Xi Jinpings landmark scheme to build infrastructure to connect China to the rest of Asia and beyond, a giant reworking of its old Silk Road. 
India has not signed up to the initiative as parts of one key project, the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, run through Pakistan-administered Kashmir that India considers its own territory. 
Whether or not China will be able to win India round to the Belt and Road will likely be a key measure of the success of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis trip to China to meet Xi for an informal meeting on Friday and Saturday. 
But Indias foreign minister did not express support for Belt and Road in the communique released after foreign ministers of the China and Russia-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation met in Beijing. India, along with Pakistan, joined the group last year. 
All the other foreign ministers - from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - reaffirmed support for Chinas Belt and Road proposal, the statement read.

There is a leading businessman connected to a very high political family who played an important mediator role in a bid to ensure the passage of the recent no confidence motion, they say.

It is a well-known secret that it was this businessman who was the livewire behind bringing about a rapprochement between Number One and the former strongman.
The JO stalwarts charge that this businessman misled the former strongman into believing that the success of the no-confidence motion was a cinch. All stories this businessman had been telling our Lokka proved fairy tales at the end, a JO front-liner said.
The former strongman had been looking for the businessman following the defeat of the motion to give him a mouthful, but the man had gone into oblivion ever since the event, they say.

Most politicos who had made generous cash offerings to the Kapuralas conducting the poojas had conveyed to them their wish to get a good place in the new top team about to be formed.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today they would discuss the Draft Bill of the 20th Amendment with all factions including the President, Prime Minister, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and present it in Parliament in May as a Private Members Bill.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news conference that two-third majority was needed to pass the 20A and added that JVP alone could not get it enacted.
We need to discuss with other political parties about the 20A. We hope to discuss with those who support and object the Bill. This is a vital opportunity to ensure democracy in the country. We hope to get the maximum from this opportunity, he said.
He said they had finished drafting the Bill mostly and added that they hoped to seek proposals and ideas of other parties to finish the rest of it.
We will initiate a dialogue with civil society groups, intellectuals and people about the Draft Bill, he said.
He said according to the 20A, head of the State was the President while the Prime Minister was the head of the Government whereas the President was acting as the head of the State and the Government under the present Constitution.
Under the 20A, the Prime Minister is elected in Parliament. He is the leader of the Cabinet. Powers vested in the President, should be passed down to the Prime Minister, Cabinet, Constitutional Council and Commissioners appointed by the Constitutional Council, he said.
Mr. Dissanyake said some people accused them of being hasty to bring in the 20A and added that it was not haste but too late to do so.
President Maithripala Sirisena should have abolished the Executive Presidency during the 100-day programme as promised, he said.
Rejecting allegations that JVP was trying to lead the country to anarchy, he said 20A could be used to stabilize the country.
19th Amendment was an interim proposal. A new Constitution should have been passed soon after the 19th A. There has been an instability as it was not done,: he said.
Mr. Dissanyake said they were ready to discuss if someone argued that there should be a change in the electoral system with the change of the Presidency. (Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant Spewing controversy and more pollution

Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant Spewing controversy and more pollution
	
The Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant in Norochcholai has been a controversial establishment ever since its first unit was commissioned on March 2011. The Power Plant, which adds 900 Megawatts to the National Grid through three generators using coal, was constructed at a cost of US $ 1.3 billion. However in January 2018 it was reported that this establishment was operating sans an Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) and according to sources the expired licence wasnt renewed.
Adding to its list of discrepancies are various malfunctioning devices and careless operations including harmful emissions of fly-ash into the air and sea. As a result people in the surrounding areas suffer from skin diseases and conditions such as asthma. While the West is taking measures to move away from generating electricity using coal, Sri Lanka is being funded and equipped by foreign entities to generate electricity using coal power.Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on how people in the area including fishermen are being affected by the careless discharge of fly ash and the irresponsible transactions initiated by the authorities. 
We are working within the parameters of the CEA: Ministry
In his comments to the , Director-Development at the Ministry of Power and Energy Sulakshana Jayawardana said that the ESP has been repaired and Unit 1 is in its start-up process. Once completed, it will be functioning along with the other units. Units 2 and 3 are already functioning and are generating electricity. Its not a huge issue because the flame at the time of the incident and what you see now are quite different. Usually such breakdowns occur in any plant and we have to do frequent repairing and maintenance work to ensure that such incidents dont take place. We are also working within the parameters given to us by the Central Environment Authority and we are always trying to reduce emissions and pollution,said Jayawardana.
Repairs are still going on : NWPEA
Airing his views, Provincial Environmental Authority  North Western (NWPEA) Acting Director Saman Lenaduwa said that repairs are still being done and therefore they have shut down the institute. They havent told us when it would recommence. We have sent them a letter and have asked them to shut it down till repairs are complete. Their license too has expired and since theres a case in the Supreme Court they have to renew it, said Lenaduwa.
The Incident
Footage of fly ash being spewed into the sea was captured by fishermen and was released on social media. This proved how the power plant is not adhering to its environmental protection principles. The Daily Mirror learns that this incident has been taking place since February 22, 2018, but speculation is rife whether the releasing of fly ash began much earlier, in the month of January this year.
The Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) being one of the power plants devices to reduce pollution, each device should remove 300 or more tonnes of dust per day. On the other hand, the Flue Gas Desulphurizer (FGD) is used to remove the sulphur dioxide which eventually contributes to acid rain and both these devices have been malfunctioning for quite a long time. When a malfunction occurs, the 300 tonnes of dust will be released to the sky.
Once the FGD starts malfunctioning, the fly ash will be released into the sea. When the power plant was informed they shut down only on April 12, 2018. On April 11, some fishermen had seen a massive quantum of ash and dirt coming out of the pipes and entering the sea.
It was also found that Unit 1 of the ESP was running below the optimum for nearly one month. It was also found that out of the 16 chambers in the ESP, five of them were malfunctioning by this time and this has been continuing for more than 45 days which is already a violation of the law.
It has been continuing for over 75 days and the fly ash makes everybody suffer. Fly ash has dust particles which are as minute as 2.5 micron particles and can penetrate into the cell membranes of humans as well as animals. It is also carcinogenic and could attack all systems in the body. It also has a higher concentration of heavy metals and this affects vegetation and populations of fish in the area.
Adding to the controversy is the fact that the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant has also been running without a valid Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) since June last year. Even when one field is broken, the required conditions are not met and are a violation of legal requirements. 




Solar and hydro power plants are less harmful alternatives: CENS
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Centre for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS) Director Ravindra Kariyawasam said that approximately 15 years ago, 30 coal power plants in Europe were categorized as Dirty Thirty.
This also affected America because they were the first to generate electricity from coal. Now they are experiencing the harmful effects of coal and China is in the process of getting rid of coal power plants. Several reports addressing the side effects of coal power plants were exposed. The main components in coal are fossils which have been degraded into the Earth that are now being dug up. Therefore coal includes heavy metals such as Cadmium, Mercury, Arsenic and Nitrate. Once coal is being piled up, these heavy metals also get deposited in the Earth and even get washed into the sea during a shower.
The ash could be spread along a distance of over 500 metres depending on the height of the wind passage. In Norochcholai the direction of ocean winds are towards Anamaduwa, Pallama, Thambuttegama, Thabbowa, Anuradhapura and other surrounding areas. Whenever coal is burnt these ash-induced winds are generated and will affect people in the area. As a result they suffer from skin problems and other complications.
The hot water released from burning coal is released into the sea and this affects marine life. There are five types of turtles in the area and this hot water is spread right throughout the country as there are no barriers to separate this hot water from sea water. It also contributes to global warming,explained Kariyawasam.
He further said that to generate 300 megawatts of electricity, the power plant emits over 6000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide annually. For a day they release around 200 tonnes of ash directly into the sea. Another observation is that if you add half a teaspoon of Mercury all organisms would be extinct. In July 2004 I remember thinking why we are in need of coal power plants when Europe is trying to get rid of them. But they do coal mining and have to create a market for coal and for this they identified Norochcholai and it will not stop there.
According to the National Physical Plan there will be two more coal power plants in Trincomalee and somewhere near Aluthgama. We have entered into an agreement with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to support businessmen and whoever who assumes power will take these projects forward. As alternatives there are solar power plants which people think are green concepts, but they are not as green as people think. This is because they have a battery which could be used for about 10 years and it dies.
This could cause a certain amount of damage, but comparatively, solar power plants cause less harm than others. Three weeks ago, a tile was introduced in Nepal with smaller solar panels. As a result the people generate electricity at home and what is in excess is sold to the Government and they generate an income. This concept is more eco-friendly than coal and nuclear power plants. More than 60% of companies need electricity and this requirement is fulfilled through these power plants. Sri Lanka receives sunlight in abundance and we could use this as an opportunity to generate solar power. We also have the ocean around us and we could use these waves to drive turbines and generate electricity.
But in this case the Ceylon Electricity Board would have less profits. These people claim that because these coal power plants have been designed according to older methods, there are more harmful side effects. When they started Norochcholai they said they would use a micro-method to generate electricity, but this doesnt stop the ash from spreading into the atmosphere, added Kariyawasam.
Fishermen and farmers opine
The fishermen and farmers in the area have been affected for the past 10 years as the sea has gotten polluted with the waste thats being spewed by the power plant. This has resulted in the reduction of fish and affected their businesses. At the onset of this incident the visited Kalpitiya and spoke to few fishermen, farmers and people in the area. 

In a letter sent to the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant (see document on top), the North West PEA office has requested them to submit necessary proposals and documents to minimise pollution. Having failed in doing so, the NWPEA has requested the Plant to shut down necessary units and rectify the malfunctioning units immediately. However the Daily Mirror also learned that they have been continuing operations amidst such a backdrop, ignoring the requests from authorities.

The proposal made by the Minister of Buddha Sasana Gamini Jayawickrama Perera to the Cabinet yesterday banning Wesak Pandals and Danasalas was turned down by the Ministers severely objecting to the proposal.
In the midst of the opposition by the Ministers, Minister Jayawickrama Perera had opined that this was an idea mooted by the Mahanayakes.
Ministers who expressed objections had voiced saying that putting up Pandals and conducting Danasalas during Wesak had been a tradition for a long time, and therefore restrictions cannot be imposed, however a request can be made to have the Pandals exhibited on another day avoiding the Poya day, but it is appropriate time that the Dansalas are organized on the Poya Day, the Ministers had commented.

Named after historical traitors
	

It is now part of history that the Blue party group that teamed up with the JO camp to trounce yahapalanaya split up with many of them playing truant at the eleventh hour leaving the Cabal of 16 to hold the sack.

The truants have incurred so much of wrath of the Cabal of 16 for what they describe as the act of downright treachery, the latter have now baptized the two leaders of the truant group, the one from Rajarata and the other from deep South as Molligoda and Ekneligoda respectively, they say.
According to the Cabal of 16, there was another character who played a major role behind the scene to bring about the great betrayal. They have nick-named him now John Doyly.
John Doyly ` is said to be a prominent politico from the Western province.
The JO stalwarts be it during their conversations or serious discussions nowadays make it a point to refer to the three characters by their new names, they say.

No one has backbone to probe Gotas abductions: Mervyn
	
The man behind the white van culture was former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and the FCID had no backbone to investigate into the person who gave orders to the white van abductions, Former Minister Mervyn Silva said.
Speaking to the media yesterday he said without orders, nothing could have happened.The orders should have been given by the Defence Minister or the Defence Secretary he said. Gothabaya Rajapaksa should also be held accountable for the Welikada Prison riot of 2012, he said.
If anyone had connections with the underworld he had been killed and no Police inquiry was held for that, he said. Police have to conduct investigations. No politician has the authority to kill people.
Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa used Government assets for his personnel use.
Gothabaya Rajapaksa should be held accountable for disappearances overriding his Ministerial authority, not the officials, Mervyn Silva said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe along with the United National Party (UNP) was the only person who can rule this country, other than the Bandaranaikes, Rajapaksas and Sirisenas, Former Minister Mervyn Silva said. President Maithripala Sirisena should be thankful to Premier Wickremesinghe and the UNP for his Presidency.
Therefore, Premier Wickremesinghe was the only suitable candidate to contest at the upcoming Presidential Election. This Government started with a false unity.
This coalition was highlighted because of the dead-rope given by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
Reconciliation was created when King Wijeya married Kuweni, not because of Chandrika. Her reconciliation was to divide the country and satisfy individual parties, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Pompeo nomination as US secretary of state sent to full Senate
	

DPA, 24th APRIL, 2018- A US Senate committee voted along party lines Monday to send the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be US President Donald Trumps secretary of state to the full Senate for a vote.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted favourably recommend Pompeo, who currently is serving as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Trump named Pompeo last month after firing Rex Tillerson.
The vote was closely watched because Pompeo was at risk of not winning a majority, which would have been a rare rebuke of a nominee for the job of secretary of state. Other recent nominees have received the unanimous backing of the committee.
The nomination went through only after a snag caused by the absence of Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, who was away attending a funeral. Democrats objected to allowing a proxy vote, meaning the first round vote was a 10-10 tie. The vote changed to a majority for Pompeo after one of the Democrats on the committee agreed to vote present at the urging of committee Chairman Bob Corker, who lamented the partisan atmosphere on the committee.

While stating that the proposal to restrict Pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days is not a governmental decision, but a ministerial request made to people, Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera today said the request to restrict pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days still remain.
Minister Perera earlier said the pandals would be prohibited on Vesak and Poson Poya Days whilst the Government Information Department said the government had not taken a policy decision to ban dansals and pandals on Vesak and on Poson Poya Days.
He said there was no prohibition on pandals on these specific days but people were requested to not to put up pandals only on Vesak (April 29) and Poson (May 29) Poya Days to stress on the need to focus on the spiritual aspect of religion rather than on mundane activities.
We have made this request to people following a request by the Mahanayake Theras. It is up to the people to decide on whether to do it or not. However, dansals can be held on these days without any restriction, he said.
The proposal by Minister Perera to the Cabinet on Tuesday banning Vesak Pandals and Danasalas was turned down by the Ministers severely objecting to the proposal.
Meanwhile, Buddhist Affairs Commissioner General Nimal Kotawalagedara requested the people who were organizing dansals, not to use Buddhist flags in dansals but to use a yellow colour flag. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Right of Reply  Ranting of a so-called Political Activist
	
I refer to the article by Amrit Muthukumaru titled UNP politburo set up for internecine war between Sajith, Naveen The article has a monotonous repetition of what has been written before by him. 
In the above article, the writer does not seem to know or chose not to know that the politburo was appointed by a secret ballot of the UNP Working Committee and Parliamentary Committee. He says the grassroot members should have a say in the party. There are MPs who represent rural areas in these two committees. They represent, inter alia, farming, fishing, estate and rural industrial communities. Does Mr. Muthukumaru expect the farmer and fisherman to come to Sirikotha and offer advice Their inputs are conveyed through the MPs. The working committee consists of members who represent teachers, academics, lawyers, professionals and so forth. Ranil Wickremesinghe had no hand in the composition of this politburo.
Mr. Muthukumaru was strangely silent during the days of the deadly white vans. He never wrote about PEPs, Greek Bond scams, Stock Market Pump & Dump manipulations, hedging deals, SriLankan Airlines run to the ground, piling up billions in debt and the former Presidents brother-in-law as chairman, running wild with his harem
Mr. Muthukumaru is an economist by profession, yet the Daily Mirror has thought it fit to grant him the opportunity to don the cloak of an expert on bonds, a Constitutional expert and now a political expert. What a jack of all trades!
He writes to the Central Bank Governor and demands to know what action had been taken regarding the Central Bank employees named in the Bond report. I am sure the Central Bank has carried out its own domestic inquiries and appropriate action would have been taken. The governor is not bound to reply to Mr. Muthukumarus letters on internal inquiries. He is a busy man unlike the inquirer.
He also appears to be on a witch-hunt against Politically Exposed Persons - PEPs. This is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. He admits that the Central Bank has informed him that there was nothing to prevent a PEP from being a bank director.
But this activist is not prepared to accept the ruling. Instead he keeps on raving about a ministers son-in-law who is on the board of a bank.
He even wrote an article on what questions the AG should ask the Prime Minister when he gave evidence at the Bond Commission. What audacity! This is contempt of a Presidential Court. However, Mr. Muthukumaru is no stranger to courts. He wants the PM to apologise to the 6.2 million people who were duped by reneging on promises given during the presidential elections. Here again, Mr. Muthukumaru is used to apologising in court!
He then challenges the constitutionality of 19A. If not for 19A, the President would have run riot. Now Mr. Muthukumaru says it should be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament and he demands a referendum. 19A was challenged in the Supreme Court which made a few changes. It was then passed in Parliament by 215-0 with 9 abstentions. If this is not a two-thirds majority, I wonder what is!
Mr. Muthukumaru was strangely silent during the days of the deadly white vans. He never wrote about PEPs, Greek Bond scams, Stock Market Pump & Dump manipulations, hedging deals, SriLankan Airlines run to the ground, piling up billions in debt and the former Presidents brother-in-law as chairman, running wild with his harem; why was he quiet when SL squandered millions on abortive attempts to have the Commonwealth Games in Hambantota He rants over the Yahapalanaya Government but it is this very same Yahapalanaya which permits him to write the way he does with no holds barred!
He seems to be in competition with another activist who together seems to have taken it upon themselves to direct the government on how its affairs should be run.-Outsider-

Root causes of  child protection  failure and what must be done
	
Cases without solutions
There is a bright young girl aged nine somewhere in Gampaha. She should be attending Year 5 at her school, but is prevented from doing so by the school authorities. Her biological mother, who had her admitted to this school five years ago, is no longer with her. It is reported that she had been tested for HIV and that she took part in HIV awareness activities. The girl has been looked after for some time by her mothers sister and husband who are her de facto parents now.
The degradation of a human being in society is the degradation of all
	First of all, what is referred to as child maltreatment, abuse or neglect must be understood as a threat to the childs proper development
	The State intervened when things went wrong but was not there to help in the first place
	More powers rest with the police, court, health and education while service providers who must take care of a protection case from the beginning to the end remain marginalised
The scenario that developed at school is familiar. Some smart teachers got wind of the mothers associations with HIV awareness and immediately perked up their antennas. Overnight the little girl became a threat to everyones well-being. This is a typical village scenario rather than what we expect from an educational institution. But then, quite a few governmental institutions too are socialised in the same manner with prejudices, snitching and favouritism running rampant. Other children started calling this girl names and most teachers and parents ganged up and made common cause against the enemy who had to be hounded out. Only the girls class and English teachers continued to care for and support her, but with the principal taking the path of least resistance, they were helpless.
First of all, the problem must be fully approached from the ground level. Social rejection is a serious concern. Whether right or wrong, it happens within a cultural context where personal, human and relational dynamics matter
In 2015, we remember a similar incident in Kuliyapitiya where social pressures defeated public policy in the absence of an organised child protection response. A leading school in Kandy, sufficiently secular and inclusive, fortunately came forward to admit the boy to Year 1. This only solved the immediate case, and as we can see now  the problem remains. Sadly, no lessons were learnt by the authorities who are paid by the public to do precisely that. It was alarming that HIV awareness had not penetrated our officialdom whose attitudes seemed to mirror those of the less-educated and irrational parents.
Absent procedure
It would seem that in this type of case no one is really responsible. The parents of a child in this kind of predicament must go from pillar to post and rely on the kindness and sympathy of individual officials. The actual policy looks like everyone for himself and devil take the hindmost. This cannot be  but it is! What should be in place for the child
First of all, the problem must be fully approached from the ground level. Social rejection is a serious concern. Whether right or wrong, it happens within a cultural context where personal, human and relational dynamics matter. Service providers must be well aware of the ground situation  not blissfully ignorant. Decisions to be made must surely be based on such awareness. Secondly, whatever view society within a specific locality takes, the State must always clearly articulate where it stands. State officers must deal with the issue professionally, giving first place to the best interests of the child. Politicians who generally have an eye on numbers and votes may be inclined towards the view of the majority. But this should never be allowed to be the approach of our schools or education administrators. The question is whether we have dedicated and empowered officials to safeguard the child who is in a minority of one The answer is an emphatic NO!
A dominant criminal culture has also distorted child protection and turned it negative. We need to make child protection positive and happy work for resilient children to bounce back from adversity
We hear of a National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) with a set of officers who claim to work on the subject of child protection. But what is the reality The authority has yet to develop its own definitions and procedures within the governmental system. As a result, they must rely on a combination of informal actions combined with assistance from police and probation as well as established services such as health, education, social services and the Kachcheri system. Those systems operate in separate compartments and have their own language and logic. When there is no clearly-accepted protection procedure (as in this case) for education authorities to take responsibility and ensure continued schooling for the child, the three categories of officers handling protection  Probation, CRPO and NCPA officers  become equally helpless.
A proud service provider is the life and soul of any service. They are more secure and empowered within a clear procedural environment when they are conferred with both power and responsibility for child protection. Today, more powers rest with the police, court, health and education while service providers who must take care of a protection case from the beginning to the end remain marginalised, de-professionalised, unrecognised and under-resourced without proper communication, transportation and office facilities.
Three messages to set up a procedure
To view this governmental system as a whole, extricate the requisite human resources and put together a child protection team that would work solely for the child was the mandate given to the NCPA in black and white vide Act No. 50 of 1998. For various reasons, but specifically due to a lack of capacity, this did not materialise.
The ICCPR Act of 2007 introduced the childs right to protection from maltreatment, abuse, neglect or degradation. These words are wide enough to include the psychological harm and discrimination the girl in Gampaha is now facing. After the NCPA Act this was the first reminder for Sri Lankans to get together and develop a protection mechanism. What is the point of a right on paper, when the remedy is out of reach How can a remedy be provided without a service And how can a service be provided when it is not resourced and organized
The writer, Sajeeva Samaranayake, was a child rights activist with 14 years of full-time experience in child protection and served as the first Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF Sri Lanka from 2003 to 2008. He was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and passed away on April 15, 2018. Being an attorney-at-law, Mr. Samaranayake also worked at the Attorney Generals Department and served as the former Deputy Chairman of the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) and has immensely contributed his knowledge and expertise to secure the rights of children. His sudden demise is an irreparable loss to the nation.  
Years (and tears) rolled on without the NCPA policy materializing. When a document was submitted to the Cabinet in 2014 as a Child Protection Policy, there was another reminder and clarification from our highest collective executive body that work must be done to develop a common agreement between the relevant government services on a preventive and protective mechanism for children. A dedicated set of professionals have already worked to develop National Guidelines on Management of Child Abuse cases which saw the light of day in 2013. But further progress got stuck. For this to move forward considerable relationship building and cooperation must be achieved so that a sector divided into government, INGOs and NGOs, Centre and Provinces and elite professionals and social work officers become one unified sector with one agenda for protecting children.
Attitudes that need to change
First of all, what is referred to as child maltreatment, abuse or neglect must be understood as a threat to the childs proper development (over and above the applicability of criminality). Any such threat is also a threat to the development of the country. Therefore, child protection has to be an essential (not peripheral) part of our developmental plan. It must no longer be considered as charity work with madame lamayi or parivase lamayi who are not ape lamayi. Indeed, the demand for quality services has not come precisely because these children are considered unequals who can be managed with a glass of milk and a nutrition package and other handouts.
The officials who spend their time distributing these handouts must also reconsider their true vocation; that they too have a right to a proper system in which they can progress as child protection professionals. A new procedure must not be a conceptual paper exercise of an expert in Colombo but a humane exercise of learning and sharing and consolidating real experience and knowledge gained in working with children and families. Finally, the children and parents must find their voices and engage equally with services as it is their experience and ideas that must be the foundation for identifying problems and remedial actions.
A dominant criminal culture has also distorted child protection and turned it negative. We need to make child protection positive and happy work for resilient children to bounce back from adversity. Child protection started out on a very aggressive footing to punish all abusers and it relied heavily on police and prosecutors. After some time, it became clear that the continuing needs of children who came into the Government Probation system demanded more attention and that this was perhaps the real work of child protection. Criminal justice would protect the State  not the victims, and victims needed their own system. Taking care of troubled children and helping them with their needs is an arduous task which needs competent service providers, emotional resources, networking and institutional support. Locking such children as if in a prison which shuts them away from society as well as the resources that society can provide is not protection.
Aggression to be replaced with non-violence
Patriarchy and established power in families, communities, homes and schools began to see child protection in negative terms as a judgmental and insensitive approach. The State intervened when things went wrong but was not there to help in the first place. Meanwhile, the surroundings where the child lives and learns and plays  communities, preschools, schools and playgrounds, where the culture and experience of childhood is lived out was not valued and used as the first tier in a child protection system. Work was done in places  both by the government and NGOs  but this was patchy, uncoordinated and unsustained. However, what is noteworthy is that 20 years after the NCPA Act, this country possesses the expertise and experience to develop a system - if the political will can be mobilised and supportive political leadership is provided. This work however must proceed in a non-violent manner as an essential part of peace-building in the country. It cannot be over-emphasised that building a system needs strong communication skills and emotional adults  not just adults having formal power.
Give all children social citizenship - For peace in our time
What our neglected and abused children need is not any more laws and policies (that promise them all the rights under the sun, but deliver the same old attitudes) but EQUAL STATUS AND SOCIAL CITIZENSHIP. This equality is learnt and practised at home and in classrooms. What parents and teachers fail to embody  society will not know. If we were practising hierarchy, our children will continue to perpetuate this and the society will remain divided, without peace and happiness. Courage is the value that enables all other values. It requires political courage to champion this minority subject and we await a wise and brave legislator to step forward to accept this cause for the future of this country. Denial of social equality is demotion and degradation. The degradation of a human being in society is the degradation of all. While the oppressed child and family suffer, the oppressors in school are also diminished by their actions. The State and society which looks on share the same fate. This is why the protection of this one child is both a moral and legal duty.
