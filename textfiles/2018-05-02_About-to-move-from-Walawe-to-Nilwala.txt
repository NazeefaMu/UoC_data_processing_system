About to move from Walawe to Nilwala


	



 

A Betel leaf bigwig hailing from Ruhuna has decided to shift his political base to another district, they say.

 


The politico has already apprised his close political and other associates of his decision to move over to an electorate close to Nilwala ganga which is home to many of his friends and close relations.


 The Betel leaf stalwart suffered a marked decline in voter support in his Walawe electorate following his pro-Maitri role in the recent no-confidence affair. Therefore, he had decided to shift to a constituency where he could enjoy more popular support and feel more at home rather than ride the elephant-back, they say.
