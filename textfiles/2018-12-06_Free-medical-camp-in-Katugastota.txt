The Central Ceylon Muslim Ladies Union successfully conducted a free medical camp at Enderuthene, a remote village close to Katugastota.  Nearly 300 patients benefited by this camp.  More than 10 doctors and 3 pharmacists volunteered and rendered their service for this noble cause.  The President of the Central Ceylon Muslim Ladies Union Zulaiha Nazeer with the guidance and untiring efforts and assistance of her active committee members, was able to make this event a great success. A large amount of medicines were donated by well wishers.  (Hafiz Marikar)
