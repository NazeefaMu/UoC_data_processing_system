The Association of Former International Civil Servants (AFICS) Sri Lanka was launched in 1993, with the late Dr. Gamini Corea, former Secretary-General of UNCTAD, as the first President. The membership comprised a group of Sri Lankans - scientists, doctors, engineers, agriculturists, economists and administrators, who had served the United Nations family and other international organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat and Regional Banks. 

 
The objectives of the Association were defined as promoting the purposes and activities of organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international organizations; fostering friendly relations and intellectual contacts among its members, establishing and maintaining a data-base of former international civil servants from Sri Lanka for the purpose, among others, of identifying and providing appropriate expertise to governmental, non-governmental and international agencies if and when requested. This latter activity is expected to contribute to the social and economic development of the country.   


During the tsunami period AFICS rose to great heights. AFICS built a house in Hikkaduwa; carried out mental health projects in eight Grama Seva Niladhari Divisions in Hikkaduwa to reduce mental health concerns and psycho-social disorders among post-tsunami victims; assisted in carrying out a health survey of the community and a rapid assessment of drinking water practices among the target population. AFICS also initiated a scholarship fund to award scholarships to deserving students and assisted two schools in the Hikkaduwa area.   


Ably assisted by the Lions Club of Havelock Town, AFICS conducted Medical camps at the Nagaswatte Community Centre in 2016 and 2017 where checking of blood pressure, testing of vision, and examining women for cervical and breast cancer took place and patients were referred to the National Hospital, Kalubowila Teaching Hospital and appropriate Municipal clinics.   


AFICS responded to a popular request from the female members of Kirillapone Community for training facility in sewing, which they intended to use for self-employment. A four months’ course was inaugurated for eight members. AFICS submitted a proposal to find partial funding for this project to the Chairman of IDEAS, in addition to the support extended by the community to facilitate it by providing lunch and transport. Thus, this project was collaborated by Singer Company, AFICS and IDEAS. The project is being implemented successfully.   


Two members who had served with WHO played a role in the WHO Declaration of Malaria and served on the Dengue Oversight Committee which advises the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka.   
The Association also gives due consideration to the United Nations Millennium Develop

ment Goals for Sustainable Development, i.e. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger, Achieve Universal Primary Education, Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, Reduce Child Mortality, Improve Maternal Health, Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other Diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, Develop a global partnership for development.
