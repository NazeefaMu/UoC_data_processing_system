Inadvertence or sheer cussedness?


	



 

This character now holding a high political office once occupied a bench in the country’s judiciary.

 


He recently had occasion to attend a high court as a respondent in a political case.


The case was taken up for hearing in due course and when the name of this high office holder was called out, he had failed to stand up and curtsey to the court.


So, ahead of starting the court proceedings one of the judges had made it a point to remind the former judicial officer of the importance of paying due respect to the court as a court attendee.


Visibly embarrassed by this admonition, the former law officer immediately stood up and paid respect to the court with a bow, they say.
