A metal quarry located in an area of an ancient kingdom fame has become a veritable menace to the people living in the locality, reports say. 

 


People are not in a position to go freely about their normal activity in the village as they are eternally facing the risk of being hit by a random flying stone from the constant blasts from the quarry. Even some houses have been damaged by flying stones from the quarry.


A four-year-old child had recently narrowly escaped possible death when a large stone from the quarry zoomed past him.


The quarry is being operated by a close kinsman of a powerful politico.


Residents say that the local Police refuse to record their complaints telling them ‘not to hit their heads against a rock’.
