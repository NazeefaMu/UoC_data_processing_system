CB bond sales: Sujeewa ready to explain real situation


	

Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said yesterday he was prepared to explain to any commission of inquiry how treasury bonds work and about the real situation with regard to the bond auction on February 2015.

He told Daily Mirror that he had studied about bonds during his tenure as a member of Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) chaired by former Minister D.E.W. Gunasekera and while being a member of COPE chaired by JVP MP Sunil Handunetti.

“The bond issue was first probed by COPE during the term of the previous parliament and I did a study about bond auctions and how they were bought and sold. Therefore I am able to explain the real situation at any commission of inquiry,” the deputy minister said.

He said the footnotes he and others wanted inserted in the COPE report were based on the facts unearthed during the study conducted by him and other members such as Dr. Harsha De Silva.

The deputy minister said he wondered why the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the bond sales had not summoned him so far and why his name had not been mentioned at any time during the inquiry.

He said the allegation that former MP Rosy Senanayake’s son had passed information gathered during the COPE inquiry to Perpetual Treasures Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius was utterly baseless. (Yohan Perera)
