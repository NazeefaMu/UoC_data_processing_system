An ‘Aloysius’ behind H’tota port agreement: PHU


	

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday said the Hambantota Port agreement signed with the China Merchant Company was corrupt and that it was evident an ‘Aloysius’ was behind this deal.

It said a five-member committee had reviewed two proposals, one more favourable than the other, submitted by two companies to lease out the port but the government had opted to the least profitable agreement.

“The China Merchant Company agreed to provide US$ 1,888 million to the government for 99 years whereas the China Harbour Company had agreed to give US$ 3,281 million for only 50 years. China Merchant doesn’t give one third of the revenue of China Harbour for 99 years. Therefore, its evident that there is an ‘Aloysius’ behind this agreement. We will be able to expose all details near future.” PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news briefing.

He said others advised them not to provoke China, which will become a world powerhouse in future, when the former government members pledged to publicise the port under one of their governments.

“The LTTE was considered as unbeatable but former President Mahinda Rajapaksa eliminated them. Vietnam defeated the US armies. The most important incident is Panama owning the rights of Panama Canal after going against the US for three decades. If we adopt the corect method, we can defeat powerhouses,” the MP said.

While rejecting reports that the port was operated under heavy loses, he said it had continued to collect a generous profit till 2016 and had comfortably paid back installments of the loan obtained to construct the port.

He said the revenue obtained from signing the deal would not be utilized to settle the loan and that the amount of debt of the country would remain unchanged. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
