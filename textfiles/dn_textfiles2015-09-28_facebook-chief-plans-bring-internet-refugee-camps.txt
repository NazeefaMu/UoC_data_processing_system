Facebook Chief plans to bring the internet to refugee camps

UN: Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, promoted access to the Internet as “an enabler of human rights” and a “force for peace”, as he announced that his company would help the United Nations bring Internet connections to refugee camps.
“It's not all altruism,” Mr Zuckerberg said later, in an implicit acknowledgment that drawing new users to his service is also good for Facebook's bottom line. “We all benefit when we are more connected”.
Calling for efforts to ensure Internet access for everyone globally by 2020, Mr Zuckerberg said Internet connections are a dynamic tool for sharing knowledge, creating opportunities, lifting communities out of poverty and promoting peace.
“A ‘like’ or a post won't stop a tank or a bullet, but when people are connected, we have a chance to build a common global community with a shared understanding,” he told at private luncheon with business leaders at the United Nations. “That's a powerful force”.
Zuckerberg's company has faced a rash of legal trouble across Europe over privacy concerns.
The connectivity campaign calls on governments, businesses and innovators to bring the Internet to the some 4 billion people who now do not have access, organisers said.
Signing on to the connectivity campaign were U2 star Bono, co-founder of One, a group that fights extreme poverty; actress Charlize Theron, founder of Africa Outreach Project; philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates; British entrepreneur Richard Branson; Huffington Post editor Arianna Huffington; Colombian singer Shakira, actor and activist George Takei and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales.
The connectivity ambitions are at the centre of Mr Zuckerberg's advocacy effort, Internet.org, whose principal goal is to offer Internet access to about 4 billion people in the world who cannot afford smartphones or do not live near fibre-optic cable lines or cell towers.
Internet.org teamed up with phone carriers to offer free access to Facebook and other websites in developing countries like India, but critics said it restricted what people could access in what they called Facebook's “walled garden”.
In April, 65 organisations from around the world sent an open letter to Mr Zuckerberg complaining that the project violated the principles of net neutrality in the guise of “access for impoverished people”.
In the courtyard of the General Assembly building this past week, Facebook displayed pieces of the mammoth drone that it is building to beam Wi-Fi connections to places that have none.
The drone is as big as a Boeing 737 and is solar-powered. It has yet to be launched, and it is one of several efforts underway by technology companies to spread the Internet to unconnected parts of the world. Google is trying something of its own, a network of high-altitude balloons.
