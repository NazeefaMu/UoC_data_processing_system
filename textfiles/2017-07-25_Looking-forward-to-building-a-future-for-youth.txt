rime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who met the old guards of the United National Party (UNP) in Biyagama, during an event held on Saturday to mark his 40th year in Parliament as an MP, went down memory lane reflecting about his political career and also took the opportunity to stress the need for securing a future for the youth.   

“What we did in Biyagama from the time I entered politics was to build a future for the youth. It’s important to build a secure future for the youth and for the future generations,” Wickremesinghe said when he met party old guards in the Biyagama electorate.   
Premier Wickremesinghe thanked late President J R Jayewardene for appointing him as the UNP organizer for Biyagama. “I am in debt to late President Jayewardene for introducing me to competitive politics and giving me a role to play in the revolution he created in 1977,” he said.   

“Questions were raised from me as to what I was going to do for Biyagama. Jayewardene began the Mahaweli Projects and the Katunayake Free Trade Zone. Then he questioned me as to what I was doing. Accordingly we came up with a plan to develop Biyagama. Some criticize me even now. They question as to what I have done during the past two years. We had to face a huge challenge in developing Biyagama. Some people in Biyagama were involved in brewing illicit liquor. Some were producing Beedi. There was no proper road network in the area when I first became the organizer. We wanted to change these and there are more than 100 factories, diesel power plants and many more in Biyagama today. It has also become an energy hub today,” he said. He said State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene has been given the task of developing Biyagama today.

“We will make Sri Lanka a debt free nation by the year 2025. Biyagama development was implemented for the youth. Likewise this government will implement all these projects for the youth,” Wickremesinghe further said.   

He then went on to pay tribute to late Presidents Premadasa and D B Wijetunga saying they had helped him in his career. Some who entered the political field with me are no more today. They include late Gamini Dissanayake, Gamini Athukorala and Weerasinghe Malimarchchi. I pay a tribute them as well. He also paid tribute to the late Cyril Mathew from whom he took over the post of Kelaniya organizer.  During this time he took over the post of Biyagama organizer. He further paid tribute to old UNPers in the Biyagama Bala Mandala including Andrew Silva, Jaganth Rajakaruna, Henry Gunasekera, Sunil Gunasekera and Shelton Sebastian.

Meanwhile Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatileka told a media briefing that Parliament will be celebrating this special occasion this week. He said that Wickremesinghe had served the nation for four decades in various capacities, as a minister, leader of opposition and as the Prime Minister. He said that there were also those who criticized Wickremesinghe.   

Venerable Thiyawala Palitha Thera, speaking at a religious ceremony held at Kelaniya Rajamaha Vihara to mark Premier Wickremsinghe’s 40 years in Parliament, suggested that 40 development projects be implemented to mark the occasion. “Working for the people is important and celebrating your feat should be made meaningful,” the Thera said.   

A special session in Parliament is to be held to pay tribute to the Prime Minister. Several other religious programs have been organized at Kolonnawa Purana Rajamaha Vihara and at Jumma Mosques in Kolonnawa today.
