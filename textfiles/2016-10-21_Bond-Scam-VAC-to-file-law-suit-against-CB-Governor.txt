The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) affiliated Voice Against Corruption (VAC) said it would take legal action against Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, former Governor Arjun Mahendran, directors of Perpetual Treasuries and some other Central Bank officials next week.

VAC Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe told a media briefing today that the VAC had decided to file legal action because the Governor had failed to take action against the Central Bank officials alleged to have been engaged in the bond scam.

“We requested Dr. Coomaraswamy to take action against those officers who are involved in the bond scam but he had failed to do so yet. These officials have been allowed to remain in the Central Bank and bonds are still being issued at an off-market rate, which is a punishable offence," he said

Mr. Samarasinghe said this was the state of affairs during the former governor's tenure as well. "Therefore we will file action against him as well, and the directors of Perpetual Treasuries on the basis that it had caused a huge financial loss to the," he said. “We requested the CB Governor to take action to stop these scams taking placed with regard to bonds and have given him suffecient time to do so. However, we will take legal action against all those responsible because nothing is being done to penalize them." (Yohan Perera)
