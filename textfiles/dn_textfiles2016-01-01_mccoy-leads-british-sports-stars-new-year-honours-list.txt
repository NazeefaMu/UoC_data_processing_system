McCoy leads British sports stars in New Year Honours List

LONDON, WEDNESDAY: Legendary jump jockey Tony McCoy was awarded a knighthood in the New Year Honours List out Wednesday, in which British sports stars including Chris Froome were recognised for their achievements.

Two-time Tour de France winner Froome, 1964 Formula One world champion John Surtees and five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan were among those honoured. Stars from football, tennis and boxing were among those made commanders (CBE), officers (OBE) or regular members (MBE) of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, an order of chivalry.
McCoy, who becomes entitled to use the prefix Sir, rode 4,358 winners in his extraordinary career.
The 41-year-old retired from racing in April after being crowned British jump racing champion jockey for a 20th consecutive year. "It is an unbelievable privilege and honour to receive a knighthood in the New Year Honours List. I certainly wasn't expecting it," the Northern Irishman said.
"I consider myself lucky to have had a job I loved.
"The support from the public and racing community since my retirement has been overwhelming.
"A knighthood really tops off what's been a crazy and memorable year."
Tour de France defending champion Froome said he was "extremely humbled and proud" to be made an OBE after he became the first Briton to win cycling's premier road race on two occasions with his victory in July.
O'Sullivan, 40, arguably the most naturally-gifted snooker player of all time, was recognised with the OBE.
He won the 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013 world crowns.
Last year he said he did not feel he had done anything to merit an honour, only snooker titles.
"It came as a great surprise to receive my OBE," he said.
"I am extremely grateful for this recognition which is a great honour and has made both myself and my family very proud."
