Cricket Officials Nishantha Ranatunga and Sujeewa Godaliyadda had allegedly been involved in fisticuffs at the Sports Ministry this morning before an inquiry commenced, informed sources said.
Sports Director General K.D.S. Ruwan Chandra had called for the officials for the inquiry which had been launched to look into the objections filed against the candidates running for the Sri Lanka Cricket Board.  
Nishantha Ranatunga, who is running for the SLC President’s post, and Sujeewa Godaliyedda, a coordinator to Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala who is also running for the same post, had exchanged fisticuffs on their way to the inquiry.
