	The Sri Lankan Navy has informed India that there was no sign of the missing Indian military surveillance aircraft in Sri Lankan waters.
	Indian media reported that the Dornier aircraft had gone missing while on a routine surveillance mission along the Tamil Nadu Coast after taking off from the Chennai Airport on June 8 with three crew members on board.
	Navy Spokesman Indika De Silva said on a request made by the Indian Government last month, the Sri Lankan Navy warships had launched a massive search operation in the seas off the North and East.
	“They had informed us to alert them if we find any sign of the aircraft in our waters. There has been no sign of the aircraft even after a search of several days,” Commander De Silva said.
	The mother of one of the missing crew member had told PTI that the Indian Coast Guard authorities had requested the Navy to be in touch with them as part of the search efforts to locate the Dornier aircraft.
	"Indian Coast Guard Chief Vice Admiral H C S Bisht has informed me that Sri Lankan authorities have been requested to alert India if they sight the aircraft or its crew," Deputy Commandant Suresh Subash's mother Padma Shankari told PTI.
	Since then, the Indian Coast Guard, Indian Navy and Indian Coastal Security Group of state police had carried out extensive search operations in Tamil Nadu though nothing had been found. (Piyumi Fonseka)
