His protests were eyewash


	



 

A certain politico raised a hue and cry against the biggest ever PPP development project about to be kicked off shortly. 

 


The purohita turned his office overlooking the choppy seas striking the Breakwater into an operational headquarters of a sustained campaign against the deal with a leading company from a powerful country. 


However, a rumour swirling at the time also said that the campaign was a ‘boru-show’ or eyewash. 
Some people who believed that the hard-batting politico was the ‘genuine article’ were shocked and dismayed when they learnt to their surprise that he with his sibling by his side were seen the other day exchanging pleasantries with a group of high-ups from the foreign company with whom the controversial deal was to be clinched. “After all, I cannot go against a project that is intended to assure an inflow of massive funds to our country,” he is said to have told the foreign investors. 


Following this meeting that ended on a happy note, the foreign investors had left for Hambantota, they say.
