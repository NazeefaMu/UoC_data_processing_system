A Cabinet Memorandum had been submitted for preparing a survey jointly by the Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) for clear demarcation of Hambantota Harbour and its properties and the Logistics and Industrial Zone, Minister of Special Assignment Sarath Amunugama said.

He has suggested this survey plan should be prepared to clear the controversies in the relevant Gazette notifications and survey plans of the Ports Authority.

This Cabinet Memorandum has been submitted following the observation made by the Ports Authority the omission of the market value of the land to be leased out in the Valuation Report presented by the Chief Government Valuer.

HE said that the SLPA had also suggested to exclude the Man-made- island from the properties of the Port and recommend to separate the properties of the Ports Authority from the Logistics and Industrial Zone.

The Committee to examine the leasing of Hambantota Harbour has recommended to take decisions on matters relating to employees of the Magampura Harbour Management Company be taken after discussion between the Ports Authority and the Government- Private Partnership Company.
