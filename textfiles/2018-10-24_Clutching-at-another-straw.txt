Clutching at another straw?


	



 

The latest person to have come forward to bail out Khaki Chief in hot water is said to be a Buddhist monk residing in a temple in a city suburb, they say.

 


The monk is said to be a close associate of several political bigwigs in yahapalanaya.


The monk and the Khaki Chief are known to be long-standing pals.


The Khaki Chief had as a last resort had poured out his stricken heart to the monk the other day.


The monk had immediately consoled him saying: “Don’t worry.  I’ll look after you!”


This monk is said to have given a similar assurance to a former top team member as well when he was facing the threat of losing his portfolio and that assurance had miserably failed.  Some people wonder whether the assurance he had given to the Khaki Chief too would come to nothing the same way!
