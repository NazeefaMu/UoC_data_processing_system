National reconciliation and transitional justice

Hindus celebrated the Deepavali on Tuesday. Issuing a message on that occasion President Maithripala Sirisena said that "May the light of Deepavali lighten up hearts of all individuals with a collective yearning for reconciliation".
National integration, reconciliation, unity are laudable objectives. Almost approve these objectives at least verbally. However, mere pronouncement of the objectives would not lead to their achievement. How to proceed there from the status quo that exists now? What strategies should be implemented and what mechanisms should be used to reach there? What measures are necessary that would ensure the realization of the objectives? So far we have been unable to answer these questions. It is a different matter whether this failure is due to ignorance or willful neglect?
Those who hold the reins of Government always say that it is not that easy to ensure reconciliation and achieve national reconciliation after a three decade civil war and over half a century of growing estrangement, hatred and clashes among national communities. Perhaps they are correct. Yet has any genuine effort been made to do so?
Human rights violations
Human rights violations may and do occur during a war. Reconciliation is impossible without establishing accountability, ensuring non-repetition of such incidences, ensuring justice and reparations to the victims, payment of compensation and a host of other measures. Actually international experience has provided a methodology to effect such changes. In brief it is called transitional justice. The Tamil National Alliance in a statement expressing their approval for the Resolution on Sri Lanka co-sponsored by the United States and Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council has expressed their hope that transitional justice would be ensured for the Tamil people.
It is obvious that expecting transitional justice is not the same thing as bifurcation of Sri Lanka. Moreover, it is an expectation of justice within a united Sri Lanka. In other words it is a healthy alternative to separation.
Human society has traversed a long way to reach the present level of civilization. Hence customs and practices of the tribal society are inappropriate today. Then the defeated were killed in tribal clashes. It was also unavoidable due to the low level of development under which no one could produce a surplus over their immediate necessities of life. Unfortunately we have in our society some with tribal instincts and desires akin to those of the late K. M. P. Rajaratne who wanted to wear shoes made from the skin of the last remaining Tamil in the country. These obscurantist forces should be defeated for the good of the society.
Transitional justice means settling accounts with the past by a society that has inherited large-scale human rights violations. This is to be done through a series of processes and mechanisms designed to ensure accountability and justice, moral and material reparations and payment of compensation to the victims and seek truth. It also includes institutional reform and public apologies as well as steps toward memorialization.
There is, however, no single prescription that would cure all the ills of such a society. The solutions will be unique since the economic, political, social, cultural conditions as well as historical experience of different countries would be naturally different.
National reconciliation
The Human Rights Council Resolution on Sri Lanka adopted in Geneva recently contains proposals to ensure transitional justice. It has outlined several measures and processes that would lead to transitional justice.
On the other hand, whether the United Nations or foreign countries recommend or not transitional justice processes and mechanisms are imperative if national reconciliation is to be achieved. We should adopt such practices and measures to ensure justice to our own citizens who are victims of human rights violations due to the war or other causes, to develop fraternal relations among all peoples inhabiting our land and to ensure a stable peaceful climate for the development of the country. Hence it is undoubtedly reactionary to reject or ignore an investigative mechanism.
There is no unanimity in our society on the nature of the investigative mechanism that should be set up. The extremists in the Sinhala community reject any investigation. Some others are opposed to an international investigation on the grounds that it violates our sovereignty and is intended to make our country a satellite state to be used in their geo-political strategies. On the other hand a majority of the Sri Lankan Tamil population have no faith in a domestic investigation since their experience of such previous investigations was negative. That is why they clamour for an international investigation. What is proposed is a mechanism half way between these polar opposites. That is the basis for the highly vocal debate on its so-called hybrid nature. Actually what is proposed is more a domestic investigation with international technical support than a hybrid mechanism.
The need for international technical assistance arises from the weakness of our justice system and the necessity of its updating to modern international standards. Such assistance is not foreign to all developing countries. Whatever the assistance received legislation is a prerogative of our Parliament which alone could enact laws. Hence there is no question of any infringement of sovereignty as alleged by chauvinist elements.
There is also an objection to foreign funding of the investigative mechanism on the ground that he who pays the piper also selects the tune. Thus they allege that it is not the national interest that would be served by such a mechanism. It is well known that the IMF when granting assistance not only subjects the recipient countries including ours to their financial discipline but also oversees the use of the funds granted. No one talks of national interest or sovereignty. Why this hypocrisy?
Transitional justice is for all victims of human rights violations irrespective of their racial or religious differences. For example, it covers all victims of abductions or involuntary removal of persons. However, it is obvious that an absolute majority of victims are Tamil. This arises from the nature of the war itself.
Take another example. The Geneva Resolution also envisages a repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and a revision of the Emergency Regulations. These laws apply to all citizens and have been applied so. Hence heir repeal would benefit all communities. What is strange is the behaviour of politicians who object to such revision or repeal despite shedding crocodile tears on behalf of the people.
Political prisoners
Finally it must be mentioned that both the Government and the public have paid scant attention to the proposals contained in the Geneva Resolution other than that of recommending an investigative mechanism. There is hardly any discussion on the Truth Commission, reparations, compensation to victims and institutional reform etc. Even in the case of the investigative mechanism the politicians only parade their so-called success in averting allegations against certain individuals. They seem to be more concerned about the fate of few individuals who had the possibility of being indicted rather than on the fate of the mass of victims whose human rights were violated. Such behaviour on the part of government politicians could lead to the growth of scepticism about the usefulness of the proposed investigation. Why is it that any sympathy and fraternity of the rulers towards the victims is not visible in the horizon?
One incident could explain how this scepticism grows. Take, for example, the question of Tamil political prisoners. Responsible Ministers promised their release before the Deepavali. Even the president referred to a similar intention. Deepavali is over. The political prisoners are still languishing in prison. In the meantime the chauvinist Opposition claim that these prisoners are LTTE leaders which is far from the truth.
Several actual leaders of the LTTE are freely roaming the streets either rehabilitated or not. It seems that the Government leaders are also being influenced by the chauvinist propaganda. They seem to be on the defensive rather than fight chauvinism aggressively. Some of them seem to compete with the chauvinists in promoting a so-called patriotism. Those that are in prison on account of their political beliefs and activities are prisoners of conscience. They are political prisoners who cannot be categorized with ordinary criminals. Their release is a political act and not a legal one. There are previous examples of such political decisions. LTTE and other political detainees and prisoners were released earlier also on political grounds. There is no ground for hesitation and vacillation. Release of political prisoners would contribute positively to the development of national reconciliation and unity.
