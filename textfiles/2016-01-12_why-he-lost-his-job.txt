Why he lost his job


	


A consultant was appointed to a very high office of the government. This consultant is a veteran in politics who had held a number of high positions in the country. He is a good orator too. Born and bred in the hill country, he now lives in Colombo. 
When he was appointed a consultant, he said he wanted a separate cubicle equipped with all amenities. And soon a quite comfortable room was made ready for him. However, the consultant said the room was still short of one important facility. Asked to name it he said: “I want a VIP toilet for my exclusive use.” And they soon provided that convenience too. 
However, the cubicle thus constructed and furnished at a heavy cost remained closed for several months because the consultant did not turn up for work. Meanwhile, the employees of this office heard that the consultant had been given the walking papers. 
The consultant had lost his job, they say, not because he failed to attend work, but because one of his sons had made his way into the good graces of the former strongman.
