Donald Trump says he is 'last chance' as Hillary Clinton declares a 'moment of reckoning'


	

As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton criss-cross the United States in a final, frenzied burst of campaigning, the Republican has said he is the "last chance" to fix a broken country while his Democratic rival has said a "moment of reckoning" has arrived.

The two candidates in Tuesday's (local time) presidential election presented starkly different views of the nation and evoked similarly disparate reactions from crowds gathered to hear them speak.

With the cloud of an FBI investigation lifted, Mrs Clinton started her Sunday (local time) with a visit to an African-American church in Philadelphia, where she spoke of her candidacy in almost spiritual terms, as she tried to motivate black voters in the crucial swing state to support her.

Mrs Clinton ended with an evening rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, featuring remarks from Khizr Khan, the Muslim-American lawyer whose Army captain son was killed in Iraq, and soft rock from folk singer James Taylor.

"It is a choice between division and unity, between strong, steady leadership and a loose cannon who could put everything at risk".

Mrs Clinton said she was "hopeful and optimistic" about the future.

Meanwhile, Mr Trump voiced new confidence as he brought his campaign and his dark visions of a rigged American economic and political system to longtime Democratic strongholds.

In Iowa, Mr Trump said he was the "last chance" to fix immigration and trade, while later telling a rally in Minneapolis that this election "is a whole different ballgame."

"We are going to have one of the great victories of all time," he said in Virginia, comparing the US election to the Brexit vote by the UK to leave the European Union "times 50".

Overshadowing the flurry of last-minute campaigning was FBI director James Comey's latest letter to Congress, informing politicians that the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered Clinton emails — still, Mr Trump continued to seize on the issue, despite the FBI's finding.

Hillary Clinton timeline

Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump attacked one another's character as they pushed their closing arguments in the final days before the U.S. presidential election.

A psychological analysis of Clinton by Aubrey Immelman at St. John's University and the College of St. Benedict concludes that her major strengths in a leadership role are her commanding presence and confident assertiveness.

Her major personality-based shortcomings are an uncompromising, overcontrolling tendency, a lack of empathy and congeniality, and cognitive inflexibility.
