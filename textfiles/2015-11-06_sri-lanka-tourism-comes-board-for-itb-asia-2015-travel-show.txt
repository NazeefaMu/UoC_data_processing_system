Tourist arrivals have seen a cumulative arrival of 10,647 from Singapore as at September 2015 with a growth of 4.3%. ITB Asia generated a strong marketing  opportunity for Sri Lanka to showcase the country as a desirable tourist destination not only to the Singapore market but to the entire South Asian and South East Asian region. It is a market place which attracts industry members from Europe and the Middle East and will enable both the authorities and the private sector to link up with key personnel from around the globe.  This year’s show recorded almost 10,300 attendees from 108 countries (7% increase from 2014) with 760 exhibitor organizations from 73 countries making it a solid platform for Sri Lanka to market the destination to the world.
