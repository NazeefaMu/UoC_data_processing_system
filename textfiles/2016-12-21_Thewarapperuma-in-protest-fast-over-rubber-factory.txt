Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma staged a protest fast near Kobowaka Bo-Tree today in protest of a rubber factory in Bulathsinhala, Kobowaka.

The protest was launched by the residents and the deputy minister, as the factory had not stopped its operations even after the decision taken at the Bulathsinhala Divisional Development Committee to close down the factory temporarily.

The protest fast followed a complaint by residents that the factory was letting out waste into the environment without proper waste management procedures. (Bandu Thambawita)
