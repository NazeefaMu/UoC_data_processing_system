Euromoney names HSBC Asia’s Best Bank


	

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) has been named Asia’s Best Bank at Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2017.


This recognition follows Euromoney’s announcement last week that it had named HSBC the World’s Best Bank and World’s Best Investment Bank in the Emerging Markets for 2017. 
“The bank is repositioning for growth in Asia and sticking to its mission of financing cross-border capital flows and trade in a more protectionist world, even as other banks retreat to their own borders,” said Euromoney in its coverage of the awards.

The editors also highlighted the transformation of HSBC under Stuart Gulliver and its success in delivering good returns to shareholders and helping its clients achieve their international ambitions. 
The award for Asia’s Best Bank was presented at Euromoney’s Asia awards ceremony in Hong Kong. 


HSBC Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Wong attended the event, at which HSBC was also named Best Bank and Best Investment Bank for Hong Kong.


“These prestigious awards are evidence of our success in executing HSBC’s strategy as we pivot to Asia. HSBC is in a leading position across the biggest growth opportunities for our industry in Asia: continued wealth creation, the shift to digital, the liberalisation of China’s markets, the Belt and Road Initiative and financing a lower carbon economy,” said Wong.  


Head of Global Banking and Markets Asia-Pacific Gordon French said, “Clients recognise the value of partnership with a universal bank that can help them access all available sources of capital as well as balance sheet financing, risk management and transaction banking solutions. These awards reflect the strength of our platform and network.” 


Regional Head of Commercial Banking Asia-Pacific Stuart Tait commented, “Winning these awards says clearly that we provide the best services and the best advice in the market. Our collaboration with colleagues across business lines and geographies is a crucial competitive strength that allows us to develop deep relationships with clients to support their growth – both internationally and in the entrepreneurial heartlands of their home markets.”
