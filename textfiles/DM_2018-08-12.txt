Met Dept. warns of strong winds
	
The general public should take measures to prevent damages from strong winds, the Department of Meteorology warned a while ago.
There is a possibility of increase in the wind speeds to some extent over the Island and the general public to take adequate measures to prevent damages caused by strong winds, the department said.
In a report issued by the Natural Hazards Early Warning Centre at 1300 hours today it said fairly strong gusty winds up to 50 kmp/h could be expected in the Central mountainous areas of the Sabaragamuwa, Western, Southern, North-Western, North-Central and the Uva Provinces and in the Ampara and the Batticaloa Districts.
The department said that it expected that the strong winds may occur until Tuesday (14).
According to the forecast report valid for next 36 hours, showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in Galle, Matara and Kaluthara districts.
Several spells of showers will occur in North-western province and in Colombo, Gampaha and Hambantota districts. Fairly heavy falls above 75 mm can be expected at some places in Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in Kaluthara district," it said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Parker Solar Probe: Nasa launches mission to 'touch the Sun'
	
US space agency Nasa has launched its mission to send a satellite closer to the Sun than any before.
The rocket carrying the Parker Solar Probe shot up into the sky from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
It came after a failed attempt the previous day, when a last-minute alarm caused the agency to miss its 65-minute weather window.
The probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history.
Its data promises to crack longstanding mysteries about the Sun's behaviour.
The probe aims to dip directly into our star's outer atmosphere, or corona.
It is travelling on board the Delta-IV Heavy rocket, which will hurl the probe into the inner Solar System.
The probe will zip past Venus in six weeks and make a first rendezvous with the Sun a further six weeks after that.
Over the course of seven years, Parker will make 24 loops around our star to study the physics of the corona, the place where much of the important activity that affects the Earth seems to originate.
The probe will dip inside this tenuous atmosphere, sampling conditions, and getting to just 6.16 million km (3.83 million miles) from the Sun's broiling "surface".
"I realise that might not sound that close, but imagine the Sun and the Earth were a metre apart. Parker Solar Probe would be just 4cm away from the Sun," explained Dr Nicky Fox, the British-born project scientist who is affiliated to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.
"We'll also be the fastest human-made object ever, travelling around the Sun at speeds of up to 690,000km/h (430,000mph) - New York to Tokyo in under a minute!" she told BBC News.

Reconciliation taking place, says PM
	
Reconciliation was build up gradually in Sri Lanka with the movement of Southern people to the North and Northern people to the South, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment during the opening of Mahatma Gandhi Puram housing scheme in Nuwara Eliya this afternoon.
Many Sinhalese from the South are increasingly visiting the North, especially the Nagadeepa Vihara and Naga Vihara, while many from the North are visiting the South particularly to see what Colombo looks like, he said.
These visits are gradually becoming a mode of reconciliation. Northern and Southern people are more reconciled today than in the past, the Prime Minister said.
He said programmes such as the Indian funded Suwaseriya paramedical care ambulance service and the Mahatma Gandhi Puram housing scheme would bring about equality to all communities in Sri Lanka.
We launched the Suwaseriya Ambulance service all over the country, while the Mahatma Gandhi Housing Scheme, opened today in Nuwara Eliya, had brought equality to all people in the estate sector.
People in the plantation sector did not have villages and a house of their own like other people elsewhere, he said.
However, they have begun to get their own villages and houses today. They did not demand a separate state like some in the North, who were provoked by the LTTE.
Estate sector Tamils only wanted citizenship and a land of their own. The late President J. R. Jayewardene granted citizenship to estate Tamils. We have given them the land of their own today.
However, we cannot stop at that. Therefore, the Government has decided to introduce Advanced Level science streams to schools in the plantation sector and had also planned to take over the dispensaries and hospitals in the plantations in order to upgrade them, the Prime Minister added.
Also, he said Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gam Peraliya programmes would also be launched in the estate sector soon.
Prime Minister then focussed on media.
There are several TV cameras here today. All of them except for two channels are going to criticise me, he said.
Mr Wickremesinghe said the present Government faced stiff criticism and even lost a Local Government election as a result of the tax hike.
He said taxes had to be increased to resolve the debt service issue. He said the Government had managed to get on with development work while resolving the debt service issue.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech said India would always like to see a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka.
This housing scheme, funded by India will take the Indo-Lanka friendship to new stride. India has provided a grant of $350 million for housing development in Sri Lanka. This is the largest grant India had given to any country, he said.
Also, he said Tamils in Sri Lanka could use Air India direct flights to Varanasi to come and worship Lord Siva in India.
Prime Minister Modi expressed these sentiments during his pre-recorded speech. (Yohan Perera reporting from Nuwara Eliya)

Dananjaya's six wickets hand SL 178-run victory
	
Sri Lanka's Akila Dananjaya spun a web around South Africa's batsmen with a six-wicket haul to help the hosts to a commanding 178-run victory in the fifth and final one-day international today.
Sri Lanka Captain Angelo Mathews struck a run-a-ball 97 to anchor his side to an imposing 299 for eight after the hosts won the toss and opted to bat.
South Africa, who had won the first three matches of the series, appeared clueless against off-spinner Dananjaya's bag of tricks and were bundled out for 121 under 25 overs.
The 24-year-old took 6-29 to register his best bowling figures in one-dayers and helped Sri Lanka finish the series with a respectable 3-2 result. (REUTERS)
