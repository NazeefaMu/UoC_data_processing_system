The United States yesterday assured that it would remain with Sri Lanka as a friend and partner in the endeavor of developing the country.


Addressing an event held in Colombo organised by the US Embassy on Sri Lanka and US economic relations, the visiting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal said that Sri Lanka had always had tremendous potential and in fact it was tipped to become the next Japan 50 years ago.


“All the fundamentals were there including a well educated population, higher per capita of GDP and the strategic location. But the potential was not fully realised. Later on, the terrible civil conflict, and tragic natural disasters struck the country,’ she said.


She said even after the war, the lack of reconciliation kept the country divided and the economy weak, but that was no longer the case today.


“Sri Lanka again has the opportunity, the will, support, commitment, accountability, good governance, good faith and efforts by the Government.


“Now Sri Lanka can become the success economic story it meant to be. It can become the next Singapore and we will be there as a friend and partner,” she said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
