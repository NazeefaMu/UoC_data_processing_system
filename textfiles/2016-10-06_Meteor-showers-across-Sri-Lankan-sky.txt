Several meteor showers could be expected in the night skies above Sri Lanka in the upcoming days, Science, Technology and Research Ministry said today.

The Sri Lanka Astronomical Association and the Planetarium also confirmed that Sri Lankans would be able to witness two types of meteor showers, Draconid and Orionids, in October sky.

“Normally meteor showers can be seen in the early morning sky, but Draconid meteor shower is different from others. We can see it in the evening sky. It can be seen in its extreme intensity on October 6.

Orionids shower occurs due to the particles remaining from the comet Halley. In this occurrence, around 20 meteors per hour get released near the star constellation Orion and they can be noticed anywhere in the sky. It can be observed in its peak on October 21 and 22,” the planetarium said.
