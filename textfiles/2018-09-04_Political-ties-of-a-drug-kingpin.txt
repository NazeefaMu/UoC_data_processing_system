A State Corporate body is said to be having in its custody over Rs. 10 million earned from screening a film produced mainly for promoting the image of a onetime high political authority in the country, they say.




The film was produced by a Sri Lankan billionaire from a minority community currently domiciled in Malaysia.


The family members of the former high political authority had been frequent guests at the luxury home of this billionaire in Malaysia, they say.


The Malaysian billionaire’s brother, a close buddy of the family of the political heavyweight, now well known as a drug baron wanted by law enforcement authorities is said to have gone underground.
