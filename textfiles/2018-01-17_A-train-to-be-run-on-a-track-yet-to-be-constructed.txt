It is not unusual for any government in power in our country to perform magical wonders on the eve of any poll local or national. 

 


Government politicos go through a hectic time participating in events such as the laying of foundation stones for numerous development projects, commissioning of new projects and unveiling of Buddha statues and shrine rooms which are galore in the run up to an election. 


By the way. a Blue party senior who chose Uva to launch his political career was heard giving some interesting instructions to his aides the other day. “We should run at least one train a short distance on our newly built railway track in the South. That will give us a chance to hold a grand ceremony ahead of the upcoming polls.”


Then the engineers and other officials concerned told the purohita they had yet to lay the steel rails though they had already done the preliminaries like laying the ballast bed and sleepers. 


“That is no obstacle to our present purpose,” the purohita told the officials. “Let us lay the rails for some distance to run a train! Of course, we can resume the construction work at leisure after the ceremony.”


The officials had readily endorsed this suggestion saying: “Okay, Sir. That’s a good idea.”
