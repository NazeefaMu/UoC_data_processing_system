The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today threatened that it would launch a 24 hour islandwide strike on Friday if the Post Internship appointment list is not withdraw by Thursday (5).

Addressing a press conference in Colombo, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the list had been issued without the transfer board’s consent where GMOA is also part of and it was published in the social media without uploading it to the Official website which is also a violation.

Dr. Aluthge said the matter had been discussed at the GMOA executive committee meeting and the membership expressed their objection towards the commenced Post internship appointment list due to its illegality.

He said the list had been prepared by the Director of the Medical Service Dr. Priyantha Athapaththu without advicing the transfer committee, was based on a arbitrary decision.

He also charged the list was prepared disregarding peripheral hospitals of the country therefore could pose a threat to the services provided by such hospitals.

The GMOA urged the authorities to withdraw the alleged illegal Post internship appointment list and prepare a new list with the consent of the transfer committee to safe guard the country’s health services.

Also the GMOA said it would lodge a written complaint along with the Public Service Commission against the issued list seeking an immediate inquiry over Medical Service Director Dr. Priyantha Athapaththu for his arbitrary decisions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
