Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull would arrive in Sri Lanka on Thursday, the Australian High Commission today said.

In a statement, it said Prime Minister Turnbull is scheduled to meet President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister  Ranil Wickremesinghe during his visit.

Ahead of his visit, Prime Minister Turnbull said this year marks the 70th anniversary of Australia’s bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka and he was delighted to be able to visit Sri Lanka.

“I had the pleasure of meeting President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe during their visits to Australia earlier this year. I look forward to continuing our discussions on strengthening our economic links, defence engagement and our work together to combat trans-national crime particularly people-smuggling,” he said.
