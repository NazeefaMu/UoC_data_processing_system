People in Jaffna were in for a great surprise the other day when they saw their mild-mannered soft spoken governing one of the province dressed in Police uniform giving orders to his Police subordinates seated opposite a leading hotel. 

 


Some people were openly wondering whether the governing one had got into the Police uniform to convey a special message to the people at a time tensions were rising high in the North due to sporadic acts of violence being committed by a gang of ex-LTTE cadres.  


The news about the governing one’s new role soon spread to the other parts of the country and the highly surprised authorities in Colombo had begun inquiring from him what this hullabaloo was about.
The governing one had given a stock reply to all: “I only acted in a documentary film being made to create safety awareness among the general public.  After all, we, politicians are good actors. Aren’t we?”
