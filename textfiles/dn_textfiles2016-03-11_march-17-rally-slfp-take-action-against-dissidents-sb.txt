March 17 rally: SLFP to take action against dissidents: SB

 
Disciplinary action will be taken against SLFP parliamentarians participating in the so called protest rally at Hyde Park on March 17 without permission from the party, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said yesterday.
He said the SLFP will definitely take disciplinary action against SLFP parliamentarians who participate in the March 17 rally.
"The SLFP Central Committee has taken a decision that no SLFP member should participate in a meeting or rally organised by other parties other than the SLFP without prior permission from the party," he said.
Meanwhile, Gampaha district parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga yesterday said that members of the joint opposition will make their presence at the protest rally despite obstacles from the party and the government.
He said the party has not barred members from participating in rallies and events organised by the common opposition.
"The joint opposition is carrying out the duty of an Opposition.
The President has been made aware about this," Ranatunga said.
He said common opposition members, former SLFP parliamentarians and local government members will participate in the rally.
"We hope to conduct rallies at district level too in the future," he said.
