Will the cricket probe be another eyewash?

When former Sports Minister C.B. Ratnayake came out with the startling remark that Sri Lanka Cricket was the third most corrupt institution in the country behind the Police and Education Departments five years ago he was not far from wrong.
The Minister claimed that he would reveal the financial irregularities and those behind it and that he would replace the corrupt interim committee warning the officials that they could end up in court if they are found guilty of any misdeeds.
The Minister’s sensational revelation not only attracted headlines but gave the cricketing fraternity who were looking for a change some hope that there would finally be a clean-up.
But lo and behold 48 hours later, the Minister had gone back on his words and appointed the same cricket officials he had earlier vilified. The Minister’s sudden change of stance was easy to understand. He was taken to task by the powers that be that ran the country at the time and had appointed the so-called cricket officials and told in no uncertain terms that he was treading on areas which he should clearly keep away from.
While the Sports Minister's intentions were good he eventually turned out to be nothing more than a mere puppet with no authority. It seemed that the evil that was destroying cricket through corruption, abuse of power, and other misdeeds could not be easily crushed for they always gain the backing to plunder the resources from the very top.
Present Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera will be the cynosure of all eyes as he will be under pressure to act on the probe report submitted by a three-member investigation panel into the activities of Sri Lanka Cricket during the past three years. This investigation was instigated by former Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake when he decided to dissolve the elected body on the grounds of corruption and replace it with a nine-member interim committee headed by former Sri Lanka cricketer Sidath Wettimuny.
The main task of the probe committee was to investigate alleged corruption and abuse of power and authority at Sri Lanka Cricket. The committee comprising lawyers Ravi Algama, Jaliya Bodinagoda and Waruna Mallawarachchi have completed their task and handed over the report to Minister Jayasekera.
The report as usual got the necessary wide publicity that follows such investigations from the media. It revealed that top cricket officials like the Dharmadasa brothers Jayantha and Upali and Nishantha Ranatunga had abused their positions in office with deals that benefitted the respective companies they worked for. The report also goes onto highlight abuse of power, corruption, high handed acts and several other malpractices by politicians and administrators during the last three years.
With the Sports Minister calling for elections to Sri Lanka Cricket on January 3 the former officials who have been named in the report could be contenders for the top posts unless the Minister can find a way to stop them.
However at a recent function the Minister went on record to state the probe report had failed to find evidence or proof of any misdeeds and had not recommended action against any former officials of Sri Lanka Cricket.
“We read all the ideas and recommendations of the appointed committee. Nine recommendations have been made. But nowhere in those nine recommendations does the report ask to initiate legal proceedings against a person. The report does not call for specific action, take action against a particular person, or initiate a disciplinary inquiry against a person. It does not present any evidence specifically on any charge or allegation,” the Minister was quoted as saying.
“As a responsible minister, I will ensure the finding of the real culprits and take legal action against them without assassinating the characters of others. We know clearly that there were some problems and irregularities. Some of those problems were beyond the control of SLC. They were helpless sometimes.”
With the Minister promising several amendments to the Sports Law which includes lifting of the controversial four-year rule that deprives an official from holding position after four years, virtually all past officials will be eligible to contest.
After all the time and money spent in exposing the offenders who had brought the good name of Sri Lanka Cricket to disrepute in the eyes of the international cricket world, will the probe become just another eyewash?
