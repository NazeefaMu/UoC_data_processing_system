Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he can’t give any ministerial powers to State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi (UNP) citing that he (Amaraweera) could not place trust on him.

“Fisheries State Minister Wedaarachchi had said that he was never given any powers in the ministry.

There is no pint in telling that to me. If I am to give ministry powers, then I have to give them to a person, I can trust. I have given some limited powers to him, but I can’t give him full powers,” Minister Amaraweera said.

Addressing a media conference at his Angunukolapelessa residence, Minister Amaraweera said if he (Minister Wedaarachchi) had any problem, he could ask any other ministry from the Prime Minister or the President. I have given the fisheries deputy minister enough powers and also given a personal staff as well.”

“If I am given the Highways Ministry, I will accept it,” the minister said. (Wimal Gurusinghe and Chandrasena Gamage)
