“Some people ask as to when I will resign from the office of President. I will leave the presidency after giving appropriate punishments to corrupt politicians,” the President said addressing a public rally held in Kosgama.

President Sirisena emphasized that he is ready to walk down in the streets with the people to commence a journey against the fraud and corruption.

“After the local government elections held on February 10, a national movement against the corruption will be established joining hands with all the politicians who love the motherland irrespective of their political differences,” he said.

He extended an invitation to all citizens who love the motherland to join him in this initiative.
Addressing the gathering, the President further said that by no means the work that has to be done for the betterment of the country and the nation, could be neglected.

Recalling the request made by former leaders to the people of this country, to rectify the mistake happened on January 08, 2015, the President questioned whether they are asked to re-create an era where disappearances, killings, murders of journalists and setting fire to media institutions occur.
