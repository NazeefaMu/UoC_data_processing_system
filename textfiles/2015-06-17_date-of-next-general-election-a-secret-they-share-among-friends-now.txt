	These two Ministerial ones, both close to the New Big Boss met the other day at the main secretariat. Their conversation soon turned to the upcoming general election.

“When will the election come in your opinion,” one Ministerial one asked the other.
“The 20th Amendment will take at least another one month. And the August exam will soon follow. That too will take at least one month. This means the election can come only after August!” “Not soon after August. Because the Boss will leave for the UN to address the General Assembly in September.  If Parliament dissolved in October, the election will fall due in December. But the O’ level exam is due in December!” “Do you mean there will be a further delay?” the other Ministerial one asked. In answer, the colleague whispered a secret into his ear. “Gosh!” the other exclaimed “Who told you?”
