A big question mark over his benevolence


	

Unusual generosity on the part of a leading businessman has raised eye brows in political circles, they say.




This businessman has already paid a lump sum of Rs.9 million as six months’ payment for a house taken on rent by a leading politician. 


The politician had moved into the rented house because his official residence is now under repairs.
Incidentally, this generous businessman is a son- in- law of a onetime white-collar bigwig who controlled public finance, they say.
