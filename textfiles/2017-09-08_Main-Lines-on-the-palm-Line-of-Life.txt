Main Lines on the palm - Line of Life


	

Human Hand – Trailblazer of Human Civilization – Part 24

 



 

 The Line of Life very often commences at the side of the hand from under the Mount of Jupiter, encircling the Mounts of Lower Mars and Venus. It in most cases, terminates under the Mount of Venus near the bracelets or rascettes. 

The location 
The renowned palmist Cheiro says: “The Line of Life is that line which runs round the base of the thumb and lies directly over a large blood-vessel called the Great Palmer Arch. This blood vessel is more directly with the heart, stomach and vital organs which may have given rise to its term, ‘The Vital’ as used the ancients.”


This Line is referred to as ‘Jeevana Rekha’ or ‘Ayu Rekha’ by the Indian palmists. 

 

Significance of the Life Line
The Line of Life is considered the most important line on the palm, because everything in life depends on life. 


This line is seen in the hands of practically all human beings.


Line of Life is not alike in all palms. The great palmist known by the pseudonym Psychos says in his book, ‘New Guide to Palmistry’: “This line is rarely absent; indeed, its total absence would show that the life of the subject was extremely precarious, and the death might come at any moment…” 


The Line of Life in some hands breaks up half-way near the Mount of Venus. Subjects with such short-lines are short-lived.  They die early very often due to an accident. This line should be deep and clear of defects and continuous. 


The Line of Life indicates the length of life and the health of the subject at various periods in life. 
The Line of Life originates and terminates differently in different hands. 

Indication of ambition, wealth, fame and success 
In certain cases, this line rises from the Mount of Jupiter.  A subject with such a Line of Life would be very ambitious; an individual fired with the desire to gain wealth, fame and general success. 

 

Cold-hearted subjects
In certain cases, the line runs closer to the thumb thus reducing the size of the Mount of Venus. Subjects with a line are cold-hearted and unsympathetic.  They are capable of committing the most heinous crime without any feeling.  Such subjects do not live long.


As a general rule, the longer the Line of Life, the longer the life; the shorter the line the shorter the life.
It has to be remembered that the Line of Life does not indicate the early death or the life alone.

 

Indicates natural vigour and health
This line mainly indicates the natural vigour and the health of the subject. The Head Line and the Heart Line also carries the death indications. 


Before venturing a prediction, the line on both hands should be carefully examined. If the line is deep, well cut, and free from defects, the subject would be strong, vigorous and full of vitality. 


If the Life Line and the Head Line join completely under the Mount of Jupiter, the subject is considered fortunate.  Such a subject is persevering and methodical in his work. 


However, it is inauspicious for a person to have the Life Line, Heart Line and the Head Line originate from the same point.  Such a person is destined to become a victim of murder.


If zig-zag lines are visible on the Life Line, the subject would be in poor health.


A triangle between the Life Line and the heart Line indicates a lung disease.


A thin line originating from the Life Line and proceeding towards the Mount of Jupiter indicates that the subject is very ambitious and works hard to fulfill his aspirations. 


If there are lines running parallel to the Life Line, the subject is clever and achieves his goals in life due to careful planning and hard work. 


An abrupt end of the Life Line indicates unexpected death of the subject. 


The character of the Life Line and its indications are as follows:
Short line: Short life
Narrow and thin line: lack of vitality and resistance to disease 
A chained, laddered, broad and shallow line: Delicate health
Islands on the line:  Periods of delicate health
Commencing from under the Mount of Jupiter: Grand success(To be continued)
