Samsung’s QLED TVs, which introduced the world’s first cadmium-free Quantum Dot technology, were unveiled at a First Look event in Colombo on August 6. The 2018 QLED TVs feature improved picture quality, design, connectivity and intelligence, creating a truly limitless TV. The new range of TV’s offer amazing picture quality through 100% Colour Volume and HDR10+ functionality which brings out hidden details. Fusing a slim, sleek and premium metal body with a nearly bezel-less display, QLED TVs set the tone for exceptional sophistication.

To create even more stunning picture quality, the TVs feature new Direct Full Array backlighting technology that ensures that the screen is illuminated accurately. This reduces blooming and halo effects and enables deeper contrast, with inky blacks and brilliant whites. Advanced Anti-reflection technology ensures that the TVs’ spectacular picture quality can be enjoyed from almost any angle, and also helps boost contrast. Aligned with the new products, which include models up to 65 inches in the Sri Lankan market, Q Engine technology automatically upscales on-screen content to UHD levels to further enhance viewers’ immersion. 

With this range, Samsung introduces Ambient Mode. With the Ambient Mode, you can convert QLED TV into a canvas that expresses your moods and acts as a window to the world. The TV can mimic the pattern on the wall behind the TV to create an astonishing visual effect in which the TV blends seamlessly into the wall. Also, the TV will automatically show you the weather to reflect whether it is sunny or rainy. Moreover, you can personalize the background with your own photos or from a selection of stunning artworks. It is very easy to access the Ambient Mode by simply pressing the hotkey on QLED TV remote.

The QLED range also comes with one invisible connection whereby through a single, hardly visible cable you can transmit data as well as power. Using this robust, high speed, and future proof cable, you can put the TV wherever you want to and all connected devices can be stacked away far from the TV.

The new QLED TVs are also designed to seamlessly connect with SmartThings-compatible devices to offer users even greater control over their home’s smart technology. In addition, the TVs’ Universal Guide service curates content from the TV and connected sources to offer users a customized viewing experience that they can enjoy at any time.

This latest series is available to purchase at Singer, Softlogic, Singhagiri, Damro showrooms and dealers Island wide.
