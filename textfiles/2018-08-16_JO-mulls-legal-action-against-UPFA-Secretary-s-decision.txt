The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said it was ready to take legal action against UPFA Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera for giving his 'personal' opinion on the Opposition Leader's post claiming it as the party's opinion.

Addressing a news briefing, MP C.B. Ratnayake said Minister Amaraweera had given his personal opinion to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on the matter of Opposition Leader's post without consulting the UPFA’s Executive Council.

“This is a personal opinion of the UPFA Secretary as other Executive Council members have not been consulted. We are ready to take legal action in this regard,” he said.

Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila who addressed the briefing said the UPFA Executive Council had not been convened in over a year.

He said JO Leader Dinesh Gunawardane and UPFA MPs Susil Premajayantha also represent the Executive Council but they had not been consulted over the decision taken with regard to Opposition Leader’s Post. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
