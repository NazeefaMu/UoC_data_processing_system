The 'Mona Lisa' mantra

A good home creates a solid foundation for fulfillment, successful relationships and secure futures. It is a dream come true. When you fix your surrounding in a way that satisfies you and meets the expectations of your lifestyle then life becomes idyllic. If you don't want your dreams to become a nightmare then hire an architect. ArchWorld features Channa Daswatte a one -time associate of the great Geoffrey Bawa.
Channa Daswatte grew up as a single child having his secondary education at Trinity College in Kandy. Even at the time the young Channa was always interested in designing and putting things together and had a sought of reputation as being artistic. It was one of his school teachers who suggested he take up architecture as opposed to the sciences that he was studying for his A/L. Since then he thought of design and architecture. Later he attended the University of Moratuwa and then University College London as part of his architectural education.
Joint effort
"A good house I firmly believe is a joint effort between the people living in it and the architect. Homes are very personal things and a good house that people fall in love with is often a joint project. As an architect I try to find out what the family most enjoy doing both separately and individually. The spaces of the house and how they connect must allow for this to happen. When this works, and this is often the key to a successful house, it will become a place that people ease into," said Daswatte.
A specialized world is what we live in. You won't regret hiring an architect. After all your house is a life time investment. One you put everything into your house you can't sell it again and build another house. If life was that simple we could all live like kings.
"A personal house is usually tailor- made at all levels -the physical needs of shelter, the social needs of privacy and contact between the users and also the economic capabilities of the family. A good architect can often give the essentials of shelter and social needs within restricted budgets, each most importantly to meet the critical spatial needs that a family needs to prosper and live harmoniously. So it's always worth the effort of making one's own home to suit individual needs and aspirations."
Subtlety
Creating spaces that change the ambience with such subtlety is the architect's mantra. It is like enjoying Vincent Van Gogh's paintings or the painting of the Mona Lisa. You never ever get tired of looking at it. Even though it is static it has so many angles. Similarly sometimes we like to see vibrant colors.
"Creating a home that feels different at every time of the day is achieved through a careful engagement with the site and context. Understanding how the sun and the rain and other elements of the environment will interact with the house. A house can be designed to bring the morning sun in, shade you from the harsh light of midday and again perhaps bring in the warm glow of a setting sun. This will certainly change the feel of a house through the day. Opening the house or shutting it from certain aspects of the environment would do this."
Architecture is like the eternal sea always changing never static. Even though Channa has risen from this, his ideas are pretty much the same.
Ideas of style
"My core thoughts about architecture have not changed at all. At the very core is the belief that making spaces with an understanding of the life to be led within them can make a difference to the well- being of human beings. I don't think this can change. But other ideas of style, look, materials and technology and my attitude to these may perhaps have changed and will certainly evolve with time and experience."
The mighty Geoffrey Bawa is a legend in Sri Lanka. Almost prophetic in his creations he has made his mark and will be remembered for centuries or for as long as society exists.
"One thing is that Geoffrey Bawa never really taught anything. He influenced people through his conduct and work. If you were lucky to be in his ambit or understand the reason for his actions in his work, there was much to learn. Architecturally there is much that has influenced, not just for me but many others. But one thing I will always keep with me is that you never succumb to a singular idea such as a style. Each project is an opportunity to explore, investigate and interact with people and make something new."
Channa's greatest teachings from Geoffrey Bawa is 'What you hide behind the walls you build, around a space when making a piece of architecture, is as important as what you reveal. What he meant by this was perhaps that there must be awareness of every move you make in architecture.
"He was a gentleman to his fingertips, and had a great sense of self- deprecating humour. Today it would be hard to even recognize these qualities in people." Learning Architecture takes almost eight years. In that sense it is very unlike any other profession in the world. Everyone gets the same education but everyone's styles differ.
"All professions have varying degrees of subjectivity in the way a professional will approach and resolve a problem. As professionals we will make an opinion about the resolution of a given problem based on each of our experiences.
What one is taught in the academic program is the principles on which these opinions and judgements must be made. While in most fields there is a general consensus and understanding of how this happens, Architecture is much more subjective particularly in the contemporary world, where each person we deal with has an opinion and thought.
Individual architects will thus work from their own experience and understanding of the world around them and the problems they are solving combined with the opinion of various clients. This gives for a marvelous potpourri of products that makes the practice of architecture so engaging. Architecture for most of us need not be an inborn talent. It's a craft that can be learnt and if practiced with care and diligence, produce good work. But to be a master perhaps there is a modicum of inborn talent that makes a difference and these are few and far between."
