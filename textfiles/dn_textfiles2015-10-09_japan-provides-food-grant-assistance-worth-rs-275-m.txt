Japan provides food grant assistance worth Rs. 275 m

The Japanese government will provide food grant assistance to the value of Rs. 275 million to Sri Lanka through the World Food Programme (WFP) to support emergency programmes in Sri Lanka, including the school meal programme.
The distribution of the food assistance will be supervised by the Sri Lankan government.
The Japanese government provided food grant assistance worth 500 million Japanese Yen to Sri Lanka through the WFP from 2012 to 2014 to sustain the school meal programme. Good nutrition is a major factor in the physical as well as mental growth of children.
Under the food grant assistance, Japan will provide canned fish manufactured in the areas devastated by the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, which meets safety requirements. The assistance will be mutually beneficial to Japan and Sri Lanka.
