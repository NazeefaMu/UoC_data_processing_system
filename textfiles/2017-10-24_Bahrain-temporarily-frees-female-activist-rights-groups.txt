Bahrain temporarily frees female activist: rights groups


	



 

Bahrain has temporarily freed a female activist who has accused her government of torture in detention, rights groups said Monday.   


Ebtisam al-Saegh was released late Sunday as she awaits her trial on “terrorism” charges, the Bahrain Institute for Human Rights said.   


Two other activists, Radhi al-Qatari and Mohammed al-Shakhoori, were also released pending their trials on similar charges, it said.   


London-based rights group Amnesty International re-tweeted a post announcing Saegh’s release.   
Bahrain’s justice ministry did not respond to a request 
for comment.   


Saegh was detained in July after re-tweeting a series of posts critical of Bahrain’s king and its security agency and charged later the same month with “terrorism”.   


Her detention prompted warnings from rights groups she was at risk of torture. Saegh accused Bahraini security services of torture and sexual assault during a previous arrest in May.
