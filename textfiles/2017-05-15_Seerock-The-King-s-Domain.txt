Seerock: The King’s Domain


	

Surrounded by jungle and in the shadow of an ancient and historic rock fortress, Seerock is a luxury boutique hotel that recently opened its gates to guests visiting Dambulla. 



Situated on a path off the Habarana main road en route to some of Sigiriya’s most well-known hotels and villas, the hotel is built on the concept of water dwellings, with the main building and individually situated guest rooms perched on concrete beams over ponds. As you enter the main building, you are greeted by a striking replica of Sigiriya’s lion paws, and this theme emerges again in the rooms named after historical Sri Lankan legends and artwork inspired by the Sigiriya frescoes. 

With stunning architecture and interior, here’s what we thought of our stay at the Seerock hotel! 

Accomodation 

There are 12 luxury rooms to choose from at Seerock. The Superior Deluxe rooms are fitted with jacuzzis or jetted tubs while the Premium Deluxe room come with a plunge pool and private deck. The Grand Deluxe Suite, also known as 'The King Kashyapa’s Suite, is fit for a king with its own private pool and secluded surroundings. All rooms include a front and back balcony and with a 650 sq. ft floor area, it's spaciously designed with elegantly handcrafted wood furniture. All rooms are air conditioned and fitted with amenities such as a 50" colour TV with satellite, WiFi, hair dryer, toiletries and mini bar with complementary non-alcoholic beverages, biscuits, organically produced savoury bites and tea and coffee. 



The rooms are truly luxurious. The ambience of the room is designed in such a way that not only is it pleasing to the eye; it also has a very homely atmosphere. The beds are extremely comfortable and guests are guaranteed a good night’s sleep. One of the things that we loved about the hotel is the sense of privacy it affords its guests. The rooms are all situated a comfortable distance from one another so all guests can enjoy some peace and quiet. And there was something utterly serene and beautiful waking up to find peacocks running about the gardens. 



And if guests are lucky, the staff tells us they can even get a glimpse of a few elephants occasionally! 

Dining 

The hotel has one main restaurant and a bar/lounge area. As a luxury boutique hotel accommodating selected guests, all meals are served a la carte. 



The food at the hotel was exceptional at every turn. Each meal was simple but lavishly executed. While their continental cuisine was absolutely divine, it was their Sri Lankan meals that were truly outstanding. Even as a local who has had more than their fair share of rice and curry - the dishes at Seerock were delectable, and with just the right balance of heat and coconut-y goodness for us to proclaim the dishes as one of the best rice and curry meals we’ve ever had! All vegetables used are organic, and grown in the hotel's own vegetable garden. 

Having been trained in Switzerland, the Executive Chef at the hotel has many years of culinary experience from working in Carnival Cruise liners and in resorts in the Maldives. During our stay, he made sure to inquire into our meals and ensured that our favourite dishes were at the table. We loved this personal touch because all meals were tailormade to suit our taste buds so there were no complaints! 



The bar/lounge area adjoining the dining area gives guests an eyeful of the magnificent Sigirya Rock at a distance. The bar menu offering a range of drinks and cocktails also offers guests shisha upon request. 

Facilities 

Surrounded by jungle, Seerock offers privacy to all its guests. The outdoor swimming pool is hidden behind the main building which offers guests a bit of seclusion. The pool consisting of an adjoining baby pool is levelled at one depth (as someone who can’t swim, this writer is grateful!) and is beautifully designed with an artificial waterfall as its backdrop as it once more incorporates the cultural background of Dambulla in its theme. 



The hotel also has a spa with their own masseuse and offers a range of services from aromatherapy to full body massages. If you’ve been trekking all day or recovering from your long climb at Sigiriya or a walk at Ritigala, the spa offers a relaxing foot massage that cures all aches and pains at the end of the day. 



The hotel also offers village tours to travel in bullock carts and canoes in the lake and even arranges activities like cycling, hiking, elephant back rides and hot air balloon rides. 

Service 

Seerock has one of the highest guest satisfaction ratios in the area according to Trip Advisor and it is easy to understand why. From the beginning to the very end of our stay the service provided was of high calibre where our needs were met with prompt attention and warmth. Not only are the staff courteous, helpful and efficient, they also engage with the guests frequently and go out of their way to cater to any special needs or comforts. Guests even have the option of requesting for butler service. 

Service can really make or break your stay and Seerock has trained its staff well to ensure you have the perfect holiday without wanting for anything! 

WiFi 

Yes! 

Overall 

The Seerock hotel is the ideal place for a relaxing getaway. Secluded from the busy town, the hotel offers guests a quiet place to stay with luxury accommodation and food, great staff and beautiful surroundings. 

Whether it’s a romantic getaway or a family trip - Seerock is recommended for anyone looking to take a break from their busy lives.
