Amid some 17 UPFA members in the North-Central Provincial Council (NCPC) supporting the joint opposition, it yesterday urged the government to resolve the crisis by holding immediate elections and replace Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne with one who commands majority support.

JO member and MP S.M. Chandrasena told a news conference that in the alternative the NCP Governor should accept the affidavits submitted by 17 NCP councillors who have pledged their support to the joint opposition and are calling for the removal of Chief Minister Jayaratne.

“The government should take to appoint a new chief minister. The refusal by the NCP Governor to accept these affidavits is a violation of the Constitution,” he said.

Meanwhile, JO member G.L. Peiris said the appointment of new ministers to the NCPC was merely an attempt to safeguard the government's balance of power. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
