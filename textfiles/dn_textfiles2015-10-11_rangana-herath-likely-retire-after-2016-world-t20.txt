Rangana Herath likely to retire after the 2016 World T20

Rangana Herath, the current Sri Lankan left-arm spinner is likely to call time on his career after the 2016 World T20 in India. Herath, who is nearing 38 years of age, admitted that his retirement call would be sooner than later.
Herath’s knee injury is said to be a key factor behind his decision to retire from international cricket. Herath recently spun Sri Lanka to a famous victory in Galle against India while defending a low total in the fourth innings.
He said that his ongoing knee injury was hampering his bowling.
“I did an operation on both knees in 2011 for damaged cartilage,” Herath said.
“I had a clean-up and I had no problem playing after that. But of late I have been getting pains. It is four years since the operation and the effect of it must have worn off over the years due to the wear and tear while playing.”
