Rathana Thera to abstain from voting


	

United National Front (UNF) MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said he would abstain from voting for the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 

He told Parliament that the no-faith motion was brought in against an act of misusing state funds and added that even though he could not come to a conclusion until the court decide the culprit, as a Buddhist monk, he could not vote against or in favour of the motion.

“It is not acceptable for a Buddhist monk to engage in or support fraud and corruption. I cannot vote against or in favour of the motion,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
