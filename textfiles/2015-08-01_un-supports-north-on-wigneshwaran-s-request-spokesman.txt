United Nations said yesterday it was exploring provision of a broad package of technical and financial assistance including the support of the Northern Province to bolster citizen confidence in the peace process on a request made by the Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran.
UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said UN supported the Government and the people of Sri Lanka and their efforts to advance reconciliation and accountability.
When asked about Peacebuilding Fund, Mr. Dujarric said Fund were initiatives to advance the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka by resettlement of internally displaced persons, national reconciliation, strengthening human rights mechanism, and ending impunity.
“What is currently under discussion for support by the Peacebuilding Fund are initiatives to advance the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka by resettlement of internally displaced persons, national reconciliation, strengthening human rights mechanism, and ending impunity.  The UN support is always based on the basis of inclusive and participatory consultations with all key stakeholders.  And my understanding is that already $1 million have been already dispersed to support resettlement and integration initiatives for the remaining internally displaced people in the north and east on land that’s been… on seized land that have been returned by the Government.  For the rest, we continue to consult with the Government of Sri Lanka and the Northern Provincial Council and all key stakeholders to finalize the UN support,” he said.
When asked about an international mechanism, UN spokesman said whether it was domestic or international, that will need to be determined and that they were obviously awaiting the High Commissioner’s report and recommendations to make that decision.
