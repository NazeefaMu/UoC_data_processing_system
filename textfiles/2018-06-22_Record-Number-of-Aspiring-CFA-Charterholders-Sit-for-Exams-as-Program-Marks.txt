Each level of the CFA Program imparts a particular skill set:

 

• Level I is focused on investment tools and the foundations of the business, giving candidates the necessary knowledge and comprehension;

• Level II is focused on applying those tools in the analysis of asset classes, including equity investments, fixed income, derivatives, and alternative investments;

• Level III is focused on portfolio management and wealth planning, requiring candidates to be competent in synthesis and evaluation while making investment decisions.

 

In 1959, the Financial Analysts Federation (FAF) formed the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts (ICFA) to establish standards of ethics and competence for security analysts, develop the exam, and bestow the title of Chartered Financial Analyst® (CFA) on those who passed. The FAF and ICFA eventually merged to form what is now known as CFA Institute. On June 15, 1963, the inaugural exam was administered at 27test centers in the United States, Canada, and London to 284 candidates, six of whom were women.Today, over 84,000 (37%) candidates are women.
