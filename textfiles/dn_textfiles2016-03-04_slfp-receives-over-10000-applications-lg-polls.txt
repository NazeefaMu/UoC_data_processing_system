SLFP receives over 10,000 applications for LG polls

 
The SLFP headquarters has received nearly 10,300 applications for the upcoming Local Government election, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, Minister Amaraweera said there is huge interest especially among the youth to contest the election under the SLFP ticket.
"The SLFP has been able to attract Tamil voters after several years. During the period of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, there was widespread support from Tamil voters for the party," the minister said.
"Under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena, the SLFP has been able to win the confidence of the Tamil community. We are now restructuring the party by strengthening youth and women's organisations and party trade unions," the minister said.
Refuting allegations by various groups claiming that President Sirisena has become a prisoner of the UNP, the minister said that some SLFPers in the opposition have become the prisoners of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila.
