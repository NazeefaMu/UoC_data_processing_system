Abduction of man: 8 suspects, except Hirunika, accept charges
	
Eight out of the nine suspects who were accused of abducting a man in Dematagoda in 2015, accepted the charges levelled against them before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe today. 
MP Hirunika Premachandra was the only suspect who did not accept the charges.
Counsels appearing for the suspects requested the Judge to mitigate the punishment, citing that the eight suspects had accepted the charges when they were produced in court the first time.
The next hearing was fixed for November 24. (Farook Thajudeen)

Arjuna blasts LIOC
	
In the wake of the fuel crisis, Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today that the matter would be sorted out by Thursday with the shipment of fuel arrivingon Wednesday.
He told a news conference that though there was no shortage of diesel, the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) and some CEYPECTO filling stations had stopped the supply of diesel supply and that his ministry would inquire into this matter.
We are looking into this. We will consider whether the filling stations which didn't release diesel should have a license anymore. This could not have happened like this. There was a rumour spreading asking people to fill in the fuel tanks of their vehicles. Long queues of people, at filing stations were a result of panic buying, he said.
He said the LIOC imported a shipment of fuel on October 15, but it was rejected on October 17 after testing.
The ship is still docked at the Trincomalee Port forcing us to buy substandard oil. LIOC was supposed to get a fresh shipment on October 31 and it was due on November 3. This shipment contained a stock of diesel as well. We were compelled to buy this stock as well but we rejected it as it was also of inferior quality. This kind of thing has never happened before, the minister said.
The minister said there were attempts to influence him politically, but he did not succumb.
The President and the Prime Minister asked me to do the right thing. Had I allowed this shipment in, the situation would have been worse. I didn't want to do this as the minister," he said andapologized to the people for the inconvenience caused as a result of the current petrol crisis.

I will reveal those who inflicted undue influence on us to accept the shipments," the minister said.
He said the President and the Prime Minister advised him to do the right thing when he informed them about the shipments. "Only the President and the Prime Minister can order me, the minister said.
He said there were enough stocks as of today despite the situation with regard to shipments and there was no reason to panic but rumours spread via SMS messages did the damage.
"There is no issue because we have a stock of 10,000 metric tons and 1,500 metric tons was released today," the minister said. (Yohan Perera and Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Lets learn from Timor-Leste

Lets learn from Timor-Leste
	

I was interested to visit a courthouse when I heard that there is a list fixed with time to call up cases in courts in Timor-Leste where we hardly found such schedules in the Sri Lankan court system.
I was given the opportunity to visit the Dili District Court in Timor-Leste recently by the Judicial System Monitoring Programme (JSMP) which is a leading non-governmental organisation in accountability, and strengthening the Rule of Law. I was accompanied by JSMP staff members Ms. Eurosia de Almeda and Mr. Jose Moniz.
The Judicial structure of Timor-Leste consists of a Court of Appeal and four District Courts. The Court of Appeal hears appeals brought from the District Courts. Timor-Leste utilizes a civil law system and is developing its own courts system. There is no separation as criminal and civil courts and hence all cases go through the same system: first through District Courts, and then to the Court of Appeal.
The Supreme Court of Justice, constitutionally to be the highest court, is not yet established. The Penal Procedure Code includes all rules for the procedure as well as evidence and sentencing. There is no death penalty in Timor-Leste and the highest punishment being a term of 30 years of imprisonment.
Entering the courthouse was very easy, where there was no security checking and as a human rights activist and regular visitor to Sri Lankan courthouses, I found a friendly atmosphere there. 
From the entrance, I felt the differences between the two environments as back in Sri Lanka where I often accompany the victims to courts. In Sri Lanka we have witnessed on many occasion where ordinary people are virtually harassed and victimised by the security personnel from the time they enter the court premises. They are scolded by the security guards and the Police officers for simple reasons.

"Ordered to put up a public notice to say that people entering the court premises should wear only white, and the Police officers on guard were instructed not to allow anyone to enter the court house without the white attire. "

There was no dress code to enter the Dili District Court. Then I recalled how a Sri Lankan Magistrate charged and remanded a woman coming to court in a coloured dress. The Magistrate had ordered to put up a public notice to say that people entering the court premises should wear only white attire, and the Police officers on guard were instructed not to allow anyone to enter the court house without the white attire.
I was also not permitted to enter the High Court of Kandy many times for not wearing fully white attire. Women wearing trousers or jeans are strictly prohibited in High Courts.
It was as the dress code was given the priority over the delivery of justice in Sri Lankan court system. After entering the court I saw how the cases were lined up and scheduled for trials.
The schedule included the time, case number, Judges, brief description of the case and very few people were seated outside until their cases were called. There was no rush at all, as the trials were fixed according to the time.
In Sri Lanka, litigants need be in court by 9.00 a.m. and are hardly aware as to how long they got to wait until their cases are heard.
Dili District Court comprised 04 hearing rooms and we entered one courtroom where there was a domestic violence case was taken up. In Timor-Leste, every victim is assisted by a Public Prosecutor and every accused is assisted by a Public Defender (defence lawyer). The Judges lead the evidence and not by the Public Prosecutor or Public Defender. The Judge directly speaks with the victim, accused and other witnesses.
It was really surprising to see the nature of leading evidence. The Judge spoke gently with the victim and allowed the victim to explain. Then I remembered how our victims are further victimised during the trials as often the defence counsel raise their voices and humiliate the victims.
In Sri Lanka, there had been instances where victims of rape are indirectly labelled as prostitutes by some defence counsels at the beginning of the trials.
This particular case was called that day when I was in Dili District Court in Timor-Leste for more clarification and the Judgment was scheduled to be delivered the
following week.
After this case was over we entered another hearing room where there were 3 Judges on the bench as the case was a more serious one. It was a domestic violence case.
Domestic violence is considered as a serious crime in Timor-Leste. The Judges led the evidence from the accused and then the wife (the victim) was called for evidence. The accused was called for evidence once again for more clarifications. Considering the evidence the Public Prosecutor on behalf of the victim, made his comments and requested the Judges to impose a 6-year jail term to the accused.


The Public Defender made his remarks to the Judges and pleaded the Judges for a lenient punishment as the accused, the husband happened to be the breadwinner of the family.
The trial was concluded in one day and the Judgment was scheduled to be delivered within a week.
In Sri Lanka, cases are more often being postponed rather than taken up for trials. Generally, it will be at least 03 months of interval in between two calling dates. There had been instances where more than 12 years is taken to complete a trial and I recalled how a rape victim had to go to courts for 15 years to get Justice done and I accompanied her to courts since 2005.
Many journalists were there and taking notes of the case and the trial process is being monitored by various parties including NGOs. I learnt that some cases take time to complete the trial but it should not exceed 02 years and if so it will be a controversial and bad remark.
The delay of Justice could be questionable by the monitoring parties. Therefore I felt the importance to have a strong Judicial monitoring system in a country to establish the Rule of Law.
I found that the Judicial System Monitoring Programme (JSMP) in Dili Timor-Leste is doing a tremendous job in trial monitoring, analysing and making recommendations. It has given an enormous impact and contributes to the development and improvement of the Judicial System to ensure a transparent and proper functioning court system.
JSMP has monitored several important cases involving high-level state authorities including the corruption cases involving the former Minister of Finance and the former Vice Minister of Health.
In addition to observing the justice sector, JSMP also continued to observe the National Parliament.
I felt the difference and remembered the stressful situation (going out of the court) in Sri Lanka. In this court system of Timor-Leste anyone can witness the trials, can take notes, can speak to each other (softly without disturbing the proceeding) even you could use the mobile phone in silent mood inside the court.
Furthermore, microphones are fixed for each party and everyone could hear the conversations very clearly. In Sri Lanka often we dont hear anything that is spoken in the court and the cases are postponed without a proper explanation given to the parties.
No one can take notes inside the court or cannot read even anything related to the case. In the beginning of my journey with the victims I have been scolded several times by security guards and the police officers for reading the case file and taking notes while I was accompanying the victims, and now I understand that is strictly prohibited in the Sri Lankan court system. We are not allowed to speak inside the courthouse even for an emergency.
Crossed legs or crossed arms are strictly prohibited. We should remove the battery from our mobile phones when entering the Kandy High Court if not we need to keep our mobile phone at the security check.
Once a man was allegedly given an eight-month jail sentence for yawning inside the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court in Sri Lanka while the court was in session.
I remember once the mother of a raped girl whom I accompanied to High Court of Nuwara Eliya had to take off her shoes to the command given by a Police officer, reasoning it create a noise and it disturbs the court hearing. The poor mother was barefooted during the entire trial in such a cold weather and I felt guilty that I could not oppose this rude action and I might have been charged for contempt of court if I argued with the Police officer.
Once our director Fr. Nandana Manatunga had to intervene and make a complaint to the Court Registrar to get permission to enter the High Court of Kandy as a mother of a political prisoner was not allowed to enter the courthouse to witness her own sons hearing.

"In spite of welcoming the valuable recommendations made by the UN Special Rapporteur, the former Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe condemned and objected the report."

There are bundles of stories how our Judicial System treat the ordinary people, that I have experienced during my 12 years of journey with the victims of torture and rape by accompanying them to various courts in many parts of the country. With all these feelings of differences of the Judicial Systems in the two countries I came out of the courthouse and then I was surprised to see the Judge, whom I saw in the 01st trial was waiting for his car standing at the exit of the courthouse which was very unusual in our context.
A report prepared by the former UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Monica Pinto, on her mission to Sri Lanka from April 29 to May 7 in 2016, at the 35th session of the UN Human Rights Council, was highly critical of the Sri Lankan Justice System.
During the visit, the Special Rapporteurs met relevant ministers, government officials, members of the judiciary, the Attorney-General, lawyers, the National Human Rights Commission, civil society members, and victims and their families.
In addition to the visit in Colombo, Ms. Pinto and her team visited Anuradhapura, Jaffna and Kandy. Our organisation, the Human Rights Office got the privilege to organize the meeting with Ms. Pinto to meet the civil society members and victims in Kandy.
The report disclosed the political mess and the crisis of the administration of justice and given extremely valuable recommendations for reforms that would benefit the nation.
In spite of welcoming the valuable recommendations made by the UN Special Rapporteur, the former Justice Minister allegedly condemned and objected the report.
Justice Minister, delivering a statement in Parliament, said the UN must act with responsibility when appointing top officials. He further said the report by the Special Rapporteur was harm ful to Sri Lankas Sovereignty and the Special Rapporteur was misled by non-governmental organisations when compiling her report.


The minister said the Government has sent its response to the report through the Foreign Ministry to the UN.
It is the governments duty to have identified these problems and taken the necessary steps to have them corrected. It is this type of practical problems that the UN Special Rapporteur is referring to and such type of recommendations should have been welcomed, by the Government if it was concerned with improving this most backward system of administration of justice that exists in the country. Timor-Leste is a young nation gaining independence in 2002 from the occupancy of Indonesia and working its development towards the Rule of Law, respecting the Constitution and the law, and the recognition of international law.
Timor-Leste has ratified a significant number of international treaties and conventions since 2002 and has adopted the customary principles of International law in their own legislative process.
Sri Lanka has bounded by ratifying 13 major international treaties and conventions since 1980 including ICCPR and ICESR.
The practical significance of ratification is an indication of a Governments commitment to safeguarding human rights and upholding the international order. Ratification assures the people of a country that current and future administrations will be subject to a continuing international obligation to guarantee specific and fundamental human rights, no matter who is in power. Also, ratification helps to strengthen domestic human rights protection by providing standards and benchmarks for national law and practice, engaging the expertise monitoring and making recommendations.

Sri Lanka is a country that has been always proud of its history as a Nation but hardly adopts the best practices from other countries. Timor-Leste being a young nation achieved tremendous progress since gaining independence in 2002 and suffered some of the worst atrocities of modern times in their struggle for self-determination.
Therefore, Sri Lanka, Let us learn from Timor-Leste and lets make a change in the system that respects and safeguards the dignity of all persons and build a nation that establishes the Rule of Law.Lucille Abeykoon is human rights defender from Human Rights Office  Kandy and organisation working for the victims of human rights violation. This report was made following the recent visit to Dili District Court in Timor-Leste.


Some highlighted issues addressed by Ms. Pinto

	Delays in the administration of justice (investigation of crimes and the indicting process)
	
	
	Judicial delays - The backlog of tribunals, in both civil and criminal matters which is dragging for 10 to 15 years, should be considered.
	
	
	Independent, impartial and transparent institutions as the administration of justice must be more transparent and democratic as transparency is an essential requisite of the Rule of Law.
	
	
	Judicial accountability as accountability is a must in a democratic society.
	
	
	Constitutional review - an opportunity to strengthen independence.
	
	
	Implementation of international human rights law. As the country has ratified a great majority of international human rights treaties however, these instruments and their related jurisprudence are not deemed enforceable at the domestic level.
	
	
	Access to justice - Access to a lawyer and other due process guarantees.
	
	
	Transitional justice - create a meaningful and participatory transitional justice mechanisms.
	
	
	Education and training for significant change
	
	
	Language problems have a dramatic impact on access to justice and respect for a fair trial and due process guarantees for Tamil speaking people.

LIOC obtaining 15,000 tonnes of petrol from India
	
The Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC), which accounts for 16 per cent of market share in the supply of petrol in the country, has ordered an emergency supply of 15,000 tonnes of petrol from India to meet the current shortage, an official said today.
LIOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra told Daily Mirror the LIOC had contacted several suppliers and had managed to purchase a stock of petrol on spot basis.
"The petrol is being loaded and will reach Sri Lanka on November 9 or 10," he said.
When asked to comment on the current petrol shortage, he said his office had procured 35,000 tonnes of petrol from M/s TOTAL, the French Multinational Oil Company.
Mr. Bohra said the shipment arrived on October 16, 2017 and samples were tested at the CPC/CPSTL laboratory and found complying with the chemical properties of petrol specifications but contained some visible particles and such the CPC/CPSTL laboratory refused to approve the stock of petrol. The ownership of the petrol remains with M/s TOTAL till it satisfies the requirements of CPC/CPSTL laboratory. LIOC immediately informed M/s TOTAL to replace the cargo.
"M/s TOTAL offered to remove the particles through a filtration process, which is quite common in petroleum and shipping industries but officials refused to accept the product at the meeting held on October 31, 2017. Thereafter, LIOC again advised M/s TOTAL to replace the cargo, but has not done so yet. LIOC always adhere to the quality parameters in totality and procure the goods only from reputed oil companies and this is quite evident from past records, he said.
Mr. Bohra said LIOC had only 16 per cent market share in the country and its daily sales requirement of petrol was approximately 600 tonnes.
According to its records, LIOC still has a stock of 3,500 MT of petrol as on date. To the extent possible, some quantity of petrol is being released daily by LIOC from the Trincomalee Terminal. The present situation is mainly due to the reason that the stock of petrol imported by the CPC has been delayed while M/s TOTAL is taking time to replace the cargo. CPC petrol is expected to arrive on Wednesday or Thursday, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Remembering blessed Rev. Gonsalves
	
Rev. Jacome Gonsalves used the oriental languages to usher the Christian era in the island
At a time when the Catholic Church is contemplating to bestow the Blessed hood on the Christian writer scholar Rev. Jacome Gonsalves, who lived in the then Kandyan Kingdom during the reign of King Narendrasinghe, it is necessary to find the reasons for the background he qualifies for this treatment in his saintly life and his commitment to genius skills as man of letters.
When St. Joseph Vaz visited this island during King Narendrasinghes rule in the beginning of the 18th Century, Rev. Vaz wanted an erudite scholar to support his missionary work here, a reputed scholar missionary from India who had a Doctorate in letters, a linguist and a poet of excellence, consented to join the mission initiated by St. Joseph Vaz.
Rev. Gonsalves had easily grasped the indigenous languages in use in the subcontinent and was familiar with the indigenous cultures and native practices.
He accordingly agreed to migrate to take up this challenge to put the Christian Latin literature, music and drama translated into local languages.
First, he studied the native languages. The language was the vehicle on which the communication could reach out to the folk.
Its command and the flow mattered in the process. He took instructions from the Buddhist prelates in Malwatte, Kandy during the cordial courtship that prevailed during this period that experienced a renaissance in writing.
He trained translators in native languages and compiled books and copied them and distributed to parishes created by his guru St. Joseph Vaz.


This was how he started parish assignments and introduced order and discipline in parishes with regard to devotion. He made smooth accessibility to the holy mysteries of the universal Church through his ecclesiastical translations, music composition, drama performances and publications thereafter in the national languages.
Thereby he laid the national foundation for the indigenous Church for the Catholics of Sri Lanka. He simplified the ecclesiastical teachings and mysteries of divinity and regulated them into prayers and composed songs for ordinary lay people in parishes. 
He translated the Hymn Joy to the world as Devindu Upanneya Sathuni which remained close to the hearts of many Catholics during Christmas time.
He made the story of Universal creation and the ages beyond so simple in his song Arambhya.
They even went to the extent of creating passion play and drama which quickly absorbed into the Catholic culture which later contributed to the advancement of drama and nadagam in the island.
He laid the foundation for the Catholic culture with his composition of drama and song which was a novel experience to indigenous cultures based on Buddhist and Hindu literature.
As much as Arahant Mahinda updated the Buddhist culture prevailing in the island, Rev. Jacome Gonsalves in his term here in the 18th century laid the foundation for an Asian Christian Cultural set up for the local Catholics. Perhaps he could have been influenced by the Christian culture and literature that existed during the Portuguese regime proved by local authors like Alagiyawanna Mukaveti of the Kotte period.
He borrowed them and updated the letters. It was only after three centuries the Vatican realised the importance for a Church for Asia which has its roots and heritage mixed with indigenous cultures existing in the huge continent.

"His remains lie at the altar of Bolawatte Church where he spent his last days. Even to this date, eminent scholars like Professor Sunil Ariyarantne have a soft corner for his literary productions..."
There were such missionaries in the East who contributed to this transformation of the Roman Church to the needs of Asia. Now there is no turn back, things have improved on the march to the creation of a regional Church divorced from Roman traditions for its survival. He studied native languages specially educated himself with letters from the Buddhist Sangha in Malwatte, Kandy, and was able to update the Christian heritage needed for this island.
His remains lie at the altar of Bolawatte Church where he spent his last days. Even to this date, eminent scholars like Professor Sunil Ariyarantne have a soft corner for the literary productions of Rev. Gonsalves which he interprets as a source of inspiration to the Sinhala Language and Literature. He opened a new Chapter of progress in the use of the Sinhala Language which is strange to its culture in which it developed and originated.
He translated the Psalms and Ecclesiastes from the Bible and proved that the native languages could engineer different cultural backgrounds. He was followed in contemporary times by scholars like late Rev. Dr. Don Peter, Rev. Marcelline Jayakody, Rev. Ernest Porutota, Rev. Molligoda or Rev. Aba Costa in our times who dreamt the vision of Rev. Gonsalves.
As in a short narration of the late Rev. Gonsalves late Rev. Dr. Dom Peter describe him the way he has sacrificed long hours burning oil in the dark parish room in consecutive nights during that time clothing himself in a long cassock to protect from mosquitoes to accomplish his mission for a local Church. He was so native that even the Kandyan Kings were not feeling uncomfortable with the alien tendencies as a priest in the hill country.
Therefore calling him Blessed would not seem something foreign to the people of this country.

Resolve SAITM crisis without delay: Champika
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the crisis which has engulfed the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) should be resolved immediately based on the proposals submitted by the Medical Faculty Deans of the eight State universities.
JHU general secretary, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told a news conference that this matter would end up in disaster if opportunist politicians used it for their petty political gains.
The government should realize the gravity of the issue and introduce an immediate solution. The Deans have submitted a set of proposals taking into consideration all stakeholders such as the university students, SAITM students and professionals. More than 10,000 university students have been affected by this longstanding matter, he said.
The minister said the government should resolve this matter without attempting to resolve the government policy on private education.
He said this crisis could only be resolved by absorbing SAITM into a State university and admitting students based on Z-score marks at the A/L examination.
There are no issues about charging fees from the students. It should be absorbed into the State university system as a non-profitable institution, the minister said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Six Lankan jailed for stealing Dh1.1m in Dubai
	
Six Sri Lankan guards of a security company in Dubai have been jailed for three years each for robbing Dh1.19 million from a cash transfer van.
The six Sri Lankans earlier admitted in the Dubai Court of First Instance to the charge of theft of the funds that belonged to several branches of a shop in Dubai.
They will be deported after serving their jail terms.
Two Sri Lankan cleaners have been charged in absentia with possessing some of the stolen amounts and with aiding and abetting the main accused. One of them was sentenced to one year in jail, to be followed by deportation, while the other was cleared.
The two cleaners - who are at large - helped the guards by letting them use their IDs to transfer some of the money (Dh84,000) to Sri Lanka.
The six guards staged the theft and covered for one of them while he stole the cash. They gathered at a flat in Al Rashidiya, later where each of them received Dh160,000 and left the remaining amount for various expenses.
The incident took place between May 6 and 10. The main accused admitted during investigation that they planned the theft a few days in advance. They rented a flat for the purpose and decided to split the money and transfer most of it back home through money exchange outlets.
They hid in the Dubai flat and also in Sharjah.
At around 1.30pm on May 6, they went to a shop at the Deira Metro station where they were supposed to collect funds. One of them pretended he was going to the washroom. As his accomplices distracted the staff at the shop, that accused went to the cash transfer vehicle and stole the money bags after the driver - who trusted him - opened the safe for him. The driver thought the guard would be taking empty bags as usual.
Once they took the cash, the guards fled the scene in two cabs and went to Sharjah, where they changed their clothes. In the evening, they gathered in the rented flat in Al Rashidiya.
The police arrested the main accused shortly later and recovered a part of the money from him. He told the police that some of his accomplices managed to transfer their shares outside by using others' IDs.
Apart from Dh1.1million, the guards also stole SR976, RO118, QR1,190 and $740.
The cash in different currencies was recovered from them.
They paid Dh2,500 to one of the cleaners, whom they met in Sonapur labour accommodation, to let them use his ID.(KhaleejTimes)

Softlogic Life accoladed at Global Mobile Marketing Awards
	

Sri Lankas fastest growing life insurance brand Softlogic Life has become the first ever Sri Lankan brand to emerge winners in the prestigious Global Mobile Marketing Awards for the most innovative mobile messaging campaign in the world.
The award was won for the Campaign That Saved 2500 Lives at the Global Smarties Awards, New York 2017; the worlds only global mobile marketing awards programme honoring innovation, creativity,and success.
The Global Smarties Awards otherwise known as the Oscars of Digital marketing is organized annually by the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) to celebrate the teams and talent who are leveraging the power of mobile to create marketing campaigns that drive business impact. This years selection process involved over 100 global senior-level mobile marketers along with agencies and was finally reviewed by the MMAs independent jury led by jury president Goodyear CMO Richard Kellam.
The campaign titled Campaign That Saved 2500 Lives was focused on helping people in flood effected areas during May 2017. Due to high network traffic during this time, connecting to the DMC was extremely difficult. Having lost all their belongings, mobile phones (mostly basic feature phones) were the only possessions of the affected people which they used to call for help. Keeping true to its brand promise of giving people quality through simple choices, Softlogic Life together with Mindshare Sri Lanka chose to take action through a simple and agile technology solution. A mobile integrated SMS line was created within 24hrs in partnership with Etisalat. This established a connection between the affected individuals and the relevant government authorities and expedited access to aid and assistance. Softlogic Life then used the same SMS line to amass requests for essential goods to help those in need. The initiative was highly successful and enabled Softlogic Life to help 2,500 distressed individuals who were directly impacted.
Mobile platforms have changed the game for marketing professionals all over the world and have become a core driver for businesses to foster innovation and creativity. Softlogic Life Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said: A local brand creating such an impact on a global platform in the area of marketing and digital is a great milestone for all marketers in Sri Lanka. This shows that we as a country are well in-line with global trends and have the capability and the vision to be as great as any global brand. Without a doubt, this is the highest achievement a Sri Lankan brand has garnered in the field of marketing on a global platform.
Softlogic Life together with Mindshare Sri Lanka was able to target flood affected areas through a successful geo-targeting strategy and leverage social media as well as radio channels to raise awareness amongst the community very effectively landing them this win beating an all-time global multinational giant. This not only marks the first time that a Sri Lankan brand has been awarded a Global Smarties award but also the first time a brand has gone head-on with many other global giants and emerged victorious.
What is great about this effort is the fact that a brand in the insurance category which is generally reserved in nature was able to achieve something of this magnitude in Marketing, said Softlogic Life Marketing Head Nuwan Widyapathige. Its a testimony to the innovative culture and business philosophy Softlogic Life has. We have been doing some great marketing and the digital space is one of our key strategic priorities. We want to make use of digital channels to effectively reach out and engage our customers and thats something we have been doing really well for quite some time now. Before this award we managed to secure two records in the Sri Lanka social media space namely most engaged branded video on Facebook for one of our commercials and the fastest branded video to reach one million views on Facebook for this years Fathers day video, he further stated.

What were doing is pretty Australian
	

Muslim activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied has labelled Australia as a country founded by invasion, theft of land and genocide in a rant in support of the Manus Island asylum seekers.
The 26-year-old former ABC presenter, launched the tirade on Twitter against those in power, saying that the treatment of the people on Manus Island was deeply un-Australian. 
Her response comes just days after news broke that 600 detainees had locked themselves inside the regional processing centre without food or water as the government decided to discontinue critical services on October 31, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said.Pictures show men digging a makeshift well in the dirt in hopes of finding water have been shared alongside the news, with Abdel-Magied saying the government was acting cruelly, unfairly, uncourageously and without integrity.
Lest we forget Manus, I suggested, over six months ago. The backlash was said to be because I was unAustralian, disrespecting our history, & sullying the memory of the diggers and the ANZACS, she wrote online.
This isnt what they fought for, I was told. How dare you disrespect the Aussie spirit.
Abdel-Magied was making reference to her Anzac Day tweet earlier this year which read: Lest we forget (Manus, Nauru, Syria, Palestine).
She copped considerable public backlash for the comment, which was later deleted, and was criticised by Peter Dutton and Tony Abbott.Tell me. How is what we are doing on Manus Island to other human beings respecting the Australian Spirit How is what we are doing to people, she continued.
She continued by calling out the Australian government for standing behind a policy that is implemented in the most inhumane way. 
We CANNOT in good conscious say that we are living up to these Australian values.
Whatever it takes to help avoid the fact that today, right now, we are acting cruelly, unfairly, uncourageously, without integrity.
Right now, you folks in power Youre being pretty damn unAustralian, she said.
At this point in the rant Abdel-Magied said that because Australia was founded after invasion, theft of a land and the genocide of its First Nations people, perhaps this was truly acting in an Australian way.
The controversial advocate pointed to the way a 23-year-old Iranian refugee named Omid set himself alight last year while being processed on Nauru. 
Imagine choosing to burn alive to make a point, she said.
On Saturday Opposition Leader Bill Shorten urged the Prime Minister to allow 150 detainees on Manus Island to be resettled in New Zealand,Sky News reports.
