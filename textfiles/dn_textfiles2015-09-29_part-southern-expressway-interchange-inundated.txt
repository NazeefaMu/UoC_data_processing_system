Part of Southern Expressway interchange inundated

Weligama-Kanake road which is the exit road from the Kokmaduwa interchange of the Southern Expressway has been inundated for a distance of about one kilometre from the exit gate due to heavy rains.
Traffic movement on the Southern Expressway has not been affected, a Southern Expressway spokesman said. Motorists have been advised to use alternative interchanges such as the Imaduwa or Pinnaduwa roads until the flood waters recede.
