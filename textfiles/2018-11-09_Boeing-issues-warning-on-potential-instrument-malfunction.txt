(c) 2018, The Washington Post · Timothy McLaughlin, Ashley Halsey III, Stanley Widianto ·Nov 08, 2018 - JAKARTA, Indonesia - Airplane manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday issued a bulletin to airlines worldwide warning of erroneous readings from flight-control software on its planes, after a Lion Air jetliner crashed into the sea soon after takeoff, killing the 189 people on board.   


Boeing, which is assisting in an investigation into what went wrong in the Oct. 29 crash of one of its new 737 Max 8 jets, said it issued the bulletin as “part of its usual process.”   


The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday issued an emergency notice to all operators of Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes. It warned airlines that erroneous sensor inputs like the one that came into play in Indonesia “could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,” leading to “possible impact with terrain.”
