related to several other investigations was an important one as it could convey a strong message to the public that the government was not soft-pedaling fraud and corruption charges leveled against some top - notch politicians and officials of the previous regime. Ranawaka said that there was criticism from sections of the society on the delay on the government's part to prosecute those accused of wrong doings.
He said that it was time to put a full-stop to such accusations and show all that the government's anti-corruption drive was on track.He also charged that some powerful ministers and state officials were defending those accused of wrongdoings in the past and called for strong action against such individuals.
"Their names remain an open secret. The whole country knows who they are," the Minister said. Commenting on the controversy regarding the Avant Garde issue, Ranawaka added that there was no doubt that the firm had breached the local laws when conducting their activities.
"We toppled the Rajapaksa regime to put a full stop to such corrupt activities.People are waiting and watching.
Tomorrows meeting could be a symbolic one to show that we do not condone fraud and corruption headed."Meanwhile, when the Parliamentary group of the ruling party met on Friday, the Avant Garde issue became a key topic among the party's MPs.
Ministrers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Rajitha Senaratne, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, Arjuna Ranatunga and Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera fired salvos at Cabinet ministers trying to defend the conduct of the Avant Garde company.
They said the government should take stern action against the company as the public was losing faith in the good governance policies of the government.
They also stressed the need to conduct anti-corruption inquiries without political interference.
They warned that the battle against corruption, a key rallying point for the common opposition at the last Presidential election in January, is gradually coming to a standstill.
"This could," they said, "plunge the government into a crisis". Meanwhile, another group of Ministers representing the UNP held discussions over the weekend to defend Marapana and Rajapakshe at the Cabinet meeting on Monday.
"No member in the Cabinet is more experienced than Marapana and Rajapakhe when it comes to matters related to the judiciary. Ranawaka and Senaratne talk as if they formed the government along without any support from the UNP.
It is our duty to defend our party at the Cabinet meeting," a Minister, who wished to remain anonymous told the Daily News.
