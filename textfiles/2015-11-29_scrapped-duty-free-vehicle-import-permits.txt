The United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) parliamentary group which met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Bentota today had come up with a proposal to provide a special grant to public servants to purchase vehicles.
The group had decided on this in the wake of criticism of the the budget proposal to stop issuing duty free vehicle import permits to certain categories of people.
Informed sources said many MPs had been of the opinion that this budget proposal should be revised.
Apart from this, many members had wanted a full restoration of fertiliser subsidy which had been restricted. However no final decision had been taken on this, but it had been decided to give some additional relief to farmers.
It had also been decided that the party should strictly adhere to an economic policy based on social market economic principles.
The group had divided themselves into five groups under five leaders, namely, Ministers Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Harin Fernando and Deputy Ministers Eran Wickremaratne, Harsha de Silva and Ajith P Perera.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka were the keynote speakers at the meeting. (Yohan Perera)
