Health and edu. sectors to fall sick on Thursday


	

‘SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra’ today warned it would carry out a countrywide strike with the participation of schoolteachers, principals, deans of the medical faculties and nurses associations on September 21.

It said the health and education sectors would be disrupted because the employees would be on sick leave on September 21 urging the government to abolish SAITM.

Ceylon Teachers' Services Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe told a news conference held in Colombo that the ‘SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra’ had refused to accept the recently issued presidential committee report because it had not given an acceptable solution on this controversy.
