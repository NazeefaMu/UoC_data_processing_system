NANTES AFP July5, 2018- A French policeman was detained for questioning Thursday over the fatal shooting of a young man that has sparked two nights of rioting in the western city of Nantes.   


Burned out cars and broken glass littered the streets after angry youths clashed with police in low-income neighbourhoods across the city. 

 
Eleven people were arrested after rioters torched several buildings, including a library, a creche and a pharmacy, and more than 40 cars were burned in the early hours of Thursday.   


Another person was arrested in the Paris suburb of Garges-les-Gonesse where the slain 22-year-old grew up, after youths threw Molotov cocktails at police and set dumpsters alight.   


The killing of the young man, identified by local media as Aboubakar F., risks inflaming tensions in deprived urban areas in France where residents frequently complain of police brutality.
