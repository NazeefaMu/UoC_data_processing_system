Prices of vehicles would be increased by at least Rs. 250,000 as an impact of the depreciation of Sri Lankan rupee against the US Dollar, the Vehicle Importers Association Lanka (VIAL) President Indika Sampath Merenchige said.

The value of Sri Lankan rupee dropped to a new record low of 170 against the US Dollar yesterday.

According to the the foreign exchange rates issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the selling price of US dollar was Rs.170.65 while the buying price was shown as Rs. 166.78.
