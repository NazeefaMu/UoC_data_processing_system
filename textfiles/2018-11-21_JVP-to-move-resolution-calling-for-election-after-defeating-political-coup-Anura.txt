JVP to move resolution calling for election after defeating political coup: Anura


	



The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today they would bring in a resolution to dissolve parliament and pave the way for a General Election soon after defeating the current political coup.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was speaking at a rally held in Maharagama on the theme “Defeat dictatorial fury and win democracy”.

He said neither Mahinda faction nor the Ranil faction had a right to form a government right now as they had violated the mandate of the people who were the ones that should decide who forms a new government.

“The Rajapaksa government which was formed after buying over MPs in parliament has no right to govern the country. The Ranil faction has also violated the mandate given in 2015. Both factions have no right to form a government. The right to form a new government should be given over to the people,’ he said.

Mr. Dissanayake said, however, they were not prepared to go for an election under this illegitimate government and added that they would make every effort to defeat this coup in parliament, in court and in the streets.

“The President continues to violate the Constitution. If this continues, it would lead to a bloodbath. When Parliament does not accept the government and the Cabinet, the government rules the country against the Constitution. This will end in bloodbath,” he said.

He said the JVP came forward to rectify what has taken place for the sake of democracy and added that if this was not rectified, it would set a bad precedent.

“Some people question as to why we are so perturbed about what is taking place in the country at present. Ranil is concerned because he has lost the premiership. However, we are concerned because it is a threat to democracy,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
