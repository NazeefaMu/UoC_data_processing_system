Extortionist lying low after regime change


	



 

A certain politico had made it a practice to extort Rs.50 daily from each bus driver originating daily trips to various destinations from the Pearl city, they say.

 


There is a fleet of about 250 buses attached to the Pearl-city terminal servicing dozens of routes running in various directions from the city. A well-known goon employed by the politico to collect the extortion money had been paid Rs.950 a day.


The extortion racket had ceased with the latest regime change. And the goon too had ceased visiting the bus stand, they say.
