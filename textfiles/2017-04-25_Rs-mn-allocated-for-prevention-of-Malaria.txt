The government has allocated Rs. 30 million this year - a three-fold increase compared to last year - for the prevention of Malaria in the country ,Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.

Despite Sri Lanka being a Malaria-free country now, the Minister recalled the catastrophe it caused when the epidemic broke out in 1934 losing the lives of 80,000 people.

He said recently a Malaria patient was reported at the Kalubowila Teaching hospital where a migrant who was infected with the disease was identified as a positive Malaria case.

Minister Senaratne said the Health Ministry had identified several possible diseases that could be transmitted through migrants coming down from vulnerable countries.

However, the Minister said health officials and doctors were capable of identifying the disease and treating them successfully. He asked Lankans to be vigilant when travelling to Malaria endemic countries and seek medical assistance when necessary. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
