Life insurance leader Ceylinco Life has broken new ground in partnership with Sri Lanka Post to give policyholders in Sri Lanka another 4,000 plus outlets to pay 
their premiums.
A milestone agreement signed by Postmaster General Rohana Abeyaratne and Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan paves the way for 653 post offices and 3,410 sub post offices to collect insurance premiums from policyholders of Ceylinco Life. Hailing the agreement as ‘historic’, Abeyaratne said the Posts Department hoped to begin premium collection some time in December 2016, significantly enhancing convenience for Ceylinco Life policyholders.
Renganathan said the collaboration between the company and Sri Lanka Post was a good example of a private sector – public sector partnership that is a win-win for both sides.“For the company, there will be reduction in the cost of collecting premiums and for the Postal Department there will be a new source of revenue,” he said, disclosing that Ceylinco Life’s collections average more than Rs.1.3 
billion a month.
Ceylinco Life has already used Sri Lanka Post’s Speed Post express service to deliver more than 75,000 policy documents to date, Renganathan added.
Ceylinco Life policyholders have several options for the payment of their premiums. Besides visiting a branch or making the payment via mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) devices carried by the company’s sales personnel, they may pay their premiums online by bank or credit card standing order or via the ‘eZ Cash’ mobile payment platform of Dialog or the Mcash service of the Mobitel network.
The market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate 
social responsibility.
