(Daily Mail), 18 January 2018 -  Ditching ready meals won’t just be good for your health, it could also help the environment.   


A new study has found microwaves in Europe are as toxic to the environment as nearly seven million cars.  In the EU every year, microwaves account for almost eight million tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere.  


University of Manchester researchers conducted the first ever comprehensive study of the environmental impacts of microwaves, considering their whole life cycle - from ‘cradle to grave’.  They found that microwaves emit 7.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the same as the annual emissions of 6.8 million cars.The findings also show that, every year, microwaves across the EU consume an estimated 9.4 terawatts per hour (TWh) of electricity.  That is the same as the annual power generated by three large gas power plants.The number of microwaves in the Europe Union is predicted to reach 135 million by 2020.
