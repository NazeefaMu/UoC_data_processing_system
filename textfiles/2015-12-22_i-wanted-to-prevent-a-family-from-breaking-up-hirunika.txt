	Dismissing allegations that she had threatened and assaulted a 26-year-old man who had been abducted by her support staff in a "Defender" vehicle, UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra said today that all she wanted to do was to prevent a family from breaking up.
	At a special media briefing yesterday evening, the MP, who is at the centre of the controversy, said that she wanted to help one of her staff members, as his family was about to be broken up by an outsider.
	Admitting that it was wrong for her support staff to carry out the unlawful act of bringing a person forcibly to her office, Ms. Premachandra said that if the injustice that that was done to her staff member was referred to the police it would have taken days for the matter to be resolved.
	She said the abducted man,, who was also married, had been having an extra marital relationship with the wife of one of her staff members who had two children.
	She said the abducted man had forcible taken away the wife of the staff member and was keeping her.
	When the staff member went with a group of people to talk to him at the drapery shop where he worked he had refused to come out. Then the group had dragged him out and had taken him from there, Ms. Premachandra admitted.
	The group had brought the man to her office in Kolonnawa and reported to her. She said she had tried to sort out the matter and advised him to end the affair as it would break up another family.
	When asked whether she did the right thing, as a responsible public representative, to interfere in a personal problem in such a manner, she said that all she wanted to do was to save a family.
	She added that she had willingly brought her staff members who were involved in the abduction to the police station along with the vehicle to cooperate with the police inquiry. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
