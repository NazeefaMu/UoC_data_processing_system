Protest causes heavy traffic in Fort


	

Heavy traffic was reported in Colombo Fort because of a protest organised by the All Ceylon Polythene Manufacturers and Recyclers Association (ACPMRA) against the ban of polythene.

They demanded the government to provide them alternatives for polythene.  

Meanwhile, police said the road from NSA Roundabout towards the Ceramic Junction had been temporarily closed due to the protest.
