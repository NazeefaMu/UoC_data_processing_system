The consultation process for the domestic mechanism relating to the war will begin next week, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
In a media statement after discussions with the visiting Norwegian delegation, Minister Samaraweera said a special session in parliament on Saturday (January 9) will form a constitutional council which will draft the new constitution.
“On Saturday a special session in parliament will form a constructional council, a committee comprising the whole parliament, which will begin the serious business of consulting the people and drafting a new Constitution of Sri Lanka that reflects the aspirations of all Sri Lankans,” he said.
Stating that Sri Lanka’s multicultural identity was a strength to the country, Norwegian Foreign Minister Børge Brende in his statement said the reconciliation process was fully supported by Norway.
“I was updated on the process of rehabilitation and the building of houses by the government and we are happy that it is on track,” he said.
Børge Brende said the number of foreign delegations visiting the island has shown the international community’s bid to build a strong partnership with the government for the development of Sri Lanka. (Nabeela Hussain)
