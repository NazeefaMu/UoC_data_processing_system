Gammanpila hits out at a host of issues

A majority of the case heard in Court nowadays can be regarded illegal due to the absence of an Attorney General at present, claimed Parliamentarian and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila.
Addressing the press in Pita Kotte he said that while certain politicians were commending the decision to sing the national anthem in Tamil, saying it helped promote communal harmony, almost 98 percent of the 212 countries in the whole world sang their national anthem in only one language despite having a large number of dialects among the population.
Gammanpila also said he had wished to challenge Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to a public debate on the topic: "Who is tying to divide the SLFP?" He said the SLFP had faced division four times in the past, that was in November 2014, January 2015, March 2015 and August 2015.
He also spoke on the Therevada Kathikawaka Bill, saying there was a funny act playing out in front of the in the media today called Ranawaka vs. Ranawaka: The JHU is opposed to the enactment of the Therevada Kathikewatha Bill - but the Cabinet of Ministers had approved the Bill, he said: Minister Patali Champaka Ranwaka is a member of the Cabinet of Ministers as well as the JHU. Therefore it would be interesting to see if Ranawaka would resign from the Cabinet or the JHU, he said.
