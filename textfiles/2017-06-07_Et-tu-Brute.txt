A certain high riding flamboyant purohita was divested of the key portfolio he held as widely expected at the recent reshuffle of the pact. 

 


The general opinion among political friend and foe was that he was relieved of the very important portfolio as he fell short of the stature expected of him. 


However, the loser of the much coveted portfolio has reportedly told his friends that he was moved out not because he was found wanting, but because a colleague of his, very close to the all-powerful party leader wanted him out. He had described this colleague as a person who made it to Diyawanna through the ‘list’.
