South Africa, (Daily Mail), 22 June 2017 - Superstitious villagers in Eastern Province, South Africa, have been living in fear since a sheep gave birth to a creature that elders claimed was half-human half-beast and ‘sent by the devil’.   

Many of the 4,000 residents and farmers of Lady Frere village were convinced bestiality and witchcraft had led to the birth of the creature.   


The panic got so great that the Eastern Cape Department of Rural Development sent out experts to carry out tests after pictures of it spread like wildfire through the community.   


Chief Director of Veterinary Services Dr Lubabalo Mrwebi admitted that at first glance the lamb which was born dead did resemble a human being but was not part human.   


Dr Mrwebi said: ‘We can confirm this not a hoax photo but a severely deformed lamb born by a sheep in Lady Frere.
