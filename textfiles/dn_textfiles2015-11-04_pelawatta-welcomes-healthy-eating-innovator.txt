Pelawatta welcomes healthy eating innovator

The people of Pelawatte can now enjoy all the benefits of healthy eating, without sacrificing on tasty and filling yet nutritious meals as innovative healthy eatery Calorie Counter by Duaine Peiris recently opened its newest restaurant in Pelawatta, one of the country's fastest growing suburbs.
Offering a larger, two-floor venue which seats over 70, as well as state-of-the-art Rational Ovens from Germany, leading to only the healthiest food being prepared, Calorie Counter is ideal for meals that are not only nutritious but also tasty and filling.
Additionally, the all-new Calorie Counter in Pelawatta also features a mind, body and soul lounge, which offers a small, free-to-use, dedicated exercise space with all the fitness equipment needed for a basic workout; as well as an area where patrons can relax and enjoy games, brainteasers and quizzes to stimulate their minds, because a healthy person is more than just a healthy body.
Further, there are plans to introduce an in-house nutritionist, with free consultations offered to aid in their extensive meal plan programmes, which are already a highly successful part of the healthy eatery chain's offerings in both Thimbirigasaya and Pelawatta.
With extremely satisfied residents of Pelawatta, they offer a full menu comprising grilled main courses, new Breakfast menu and an array of quick and tasty sandwiches that are not only light on one's diet but also on one's wallet as well as healthy snacks such as wraps, salads, juices and even smoothies like banana oatmeal, throughout the day.
The new menu additions such as the highly popular Shakshouka, a world-renown Tunisian chicken and egg dish served with mixed greens and kurakkan bread. Other current favourites include the Almond Crusted Crispy Grilled Chicken and the Tofu Pancakes, while a new range that has only recently been introduced is the Organic Range, which comprises solely organic ingredients, from organic, free range chicken to only organically grown vegetables, with items like Cajun Spiced Organic Grilled Chicken, Organic Peri Peri Chicken and Herb Infused Organic Grilled Chicken currently on the menu.
Their ever increasing success is primarily the result of the restaurant chain's expertly formulated meals, says the healthy eating concept's Sri Lankan founder Duaine Peiris.
"Not only do we offer tasty and filling meal choices, with nutrition being our main goal, but we also offer a full and exact breakdown of nutritional and calorie information to create awareness of what one is eating", he adds.
Duaine also signals that innovation is a prime motivator at Calorie Counter, with new food choices debuting all the time, like the recently introduced all Organic Range, to keep customers excited and interested in staying healthy. The same also applies in terms of cooking, which is done exclusively with state-of-the-art Rational Ovens from Germany. Added to that, Calorie Counter uses only the freshest and best, healthy ingredients, keeping meals truly wholesome, in every way, instead of being overly dependent on sauces, condiments, sugar, etc., unlike our competitors, where the result is only empty calories.
