A group of family members of missing persons including Sandya Eknaligoda, wife of missing journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, had reportedly attempted to wade towards the deep sea off Trincomalee today in protest to the government’s alleged failure to look into the investigations of the missing persons.

However, the attempt was prevented by the villagers. The group staged a protest outside the Trincomalee Governor’s office by displaying the pictures of the disappeared prior to wading into deep waters.

The protestors strongly demanded the government to expose what had happened to the disappeared and to ban the Prevention of Terrorism Act and release all political prisoners.

The relatives of disappeared from Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Jaffna and Vavuniya participated in the protest.

Prageeth Eknaligoda was a cartoonist, political analyst and a journalist was reported missing on January 24, 2010, just two days before the presidential polls. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
