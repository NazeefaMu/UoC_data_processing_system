‘When sleeping women wake, mountains move’ a famous Chinese proverb is starting to become more and more relevant in today’s context, in an era where the role of women havebecome ever more essential in the development of economies across the world.
They are seen as a key contributor in decision making and are actively marking their presence in the entrepreneurial industry. 
Microfinance services have become an important tool as they start contributing to the economy by providing support to uplift and encourage specially women. Over the years many organizations have worked towards empowering women and have seen positive growth in their skills through the support of microfinance in most parts of the country. 
Present day women are recognized as an imperative catalyst in the economic rejuvenation, especially in developing countries. Thus NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow in their life.
With this objective in mind, NDB recently held its third consecutive workshop on Empowerment of Small Scale Women Entrepreneurs in Matale.  As one of the Bank’s CSR projects the programme was aimed towards empowering women in the area to participate fully in building financial stability. The objective was to ensure the inclusion of women’s talents, skills and energies in developing sustainable livelihood for their families 
and communities. 
This programme was initiated by the NDB Microfinance Unit and NDB Matale branch. NDB makes every effort to see mirco level entrepreneurs get to the next level and this was one initiative to help them do so.
A special guest at this workshop was Srimathi Sandya, Proprietor of Neat Fashion Kandy, who started off at the micro level. In her speech she spoke of her path to success and shared her experiences of being a female entrepreneur.  “As women we must learn how to be determined and not let problems let you down, to be successful in any business one must never compromise on the quality and keep developing what you do”  
Shalika Priyangani - Micro Finance Officer of NDB in her presentation discussed on how to improve knowledge on financial information and financial security. “The problem starts when you don’t know what happens to the money you earn.  It is important that you discuss with the Bank on ways to make most of your savings without having to use your capital to pay 
up loans”
The workshop also included a special discussion by Dr. Jayantha Wijesekara – Pediatrician, Matale Base Hospital on how to secure a good health. The participants were given invaluable health tips and advice on how to avoid diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease and about developing good health habits amongst children. 
A session on Grooming and Personality was also carried out by Ganga Wanigaratne – Assistant Vice President – Operations, Account Services and Credit Administration.
NDB remains dedicated to bringing its customers one step closer to accomplishing their life long ambitions and uplifting their standards of living through the range of services that is accessible through its growing branch network.
