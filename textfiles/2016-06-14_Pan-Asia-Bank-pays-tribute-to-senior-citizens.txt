Pan Asia Bank pays tribute to senior citizens


	

In recognition of the invaluable contribution made by Senior Citizens during their life time to the betterment of the country, Pan Asia Bank has come up with an initiative to offer free gifts as a value addition for senior citizens’ Fixed Deposits.  
As a truly Sri Lankan bank, Pan Asia Bank is sensitive to the fact the most senior citizens in the country are dependent either on their pensions or the interest income from their deposits as their main source of income during the retirement period which is what prompted the bank to come with this value added offer.
Under the new value added gift scheme the bank will be offering a gift of an Umbrella for Fixed Deposits up to 499,999 and an emergency lamp for deposit values of over that amount. 
These free gifts are offered to depositors on top of the attractive interest rate of 15 percent per annum that will be paid on the deposit.
Pan Asia Bank has always paid special attention to the vital segment of senior citizen as their financial requirements were largely overlooked by most financial services providers until recently. In fact Pan Asia bank was the first bank to launch a special personal loan scheme for Government pensioners under the name “Sammana” with no requirement 
for guarantors. 
This offer will be available at all the Pan Asia Bank branches from 13th June 2016 till the stocks last.
