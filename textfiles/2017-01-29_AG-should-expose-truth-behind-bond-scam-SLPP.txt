The Attorney General (AG) should expose the individuals responsible for the Central Bank bond scam, the lawyers' body affiliated to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today.

“The AG has a legal obligation to expose those responsible and take steps to punish those found guilty,” SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam told a news conference.

“On June 1, 2015 Crime Investigation Division (CID) Director B.R.S.R. Nagahamulla informed the Attorney General’s Department of a possible financial fraud that had taken place involving a company called Perpetual Treasuries (pvt) Ltd. and the Central Bank (CB). Thereafter the AG’s Department was said to have opened a file to investigate the matter,” he said.

He said the report had been sent to the Criminal and Civil Deputy Solicitor Generals by the AG, who in turn recommended that immediate action be taken against the parties involved.

“Both Deputy Solicitor Generals were of the opinion that the bond issue should be investigated further. However, their recommendations were ignored and no investigation followed. The AG should not stay silent any longer and should order a thorough investigation into the matter,” Kariyawasam said.

Meanwhile, he said that the people of the country need to know the truth about the bond issue and under the Right To Information (RTI) Act the AG is duty bound to reveal to the people what really took place.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
