Referring to the incident where Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake is alleged to have attempted to assault a Buddhist monk three months ago, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon today urged President Maithripala Sirisena to sack Chamara Sampath with immediate effect.

He told Daily Mirror the incident, which had taken place at the Chief Minister’s office, was swept under the carpet because of insufficient evidence on the incident.

“The Uva Province Chief Minister, who is charged with forcing the Badulla Tamil Girl's School Principal to kneel at his feet and attempting to assault a Buddhist monk, is no longer eligible to hold the post of Chief Minister.The video clip which clearly shows the latest incident is now circulating on social media websites,”Mr. Tennakoon said.

He said this latest incident too should be investigated and sack the chief minister without delay.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
