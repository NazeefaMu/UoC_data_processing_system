President - UNP meeting heats up


	

A meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and a UNP delegation led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday turned tense with heated arguments, after the UNP insisted that SLFP ministers who voted for the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister should quit the government.

However, the President is reported to have refused to accede to the request.

Meanwhile, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, who voted for the motion, said he had no intention of remaining in the government, but said only the President could decide whether he and the others, should remain or leave.

“This is a coalition government. The SLFP is a party to it. The President, as the party leader, should decide on our stance and not the UNP,” he said.  (Kelum Bandara)
