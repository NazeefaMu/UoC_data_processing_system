Rathana Thera unhappy over OMP Bill:


	

Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera MP expressed his displeasure yesterday over the passage of the amended draft Bill to set up an Office of Missing Persons (OMP).

The Thera said the procedure adopted by the government to pass the Bill and the objections of the Joint Opposition MPs to the draft Bill were both disappointing.

“The entire procedure, and the mechanism adopted to pass the Bill and the way the objections were posed were disappointing. The Bill was passed without making room for amendments; and the few amendments which were made, were not enough,” the Thera told Daily Mirror.

He went on to state that the people’s mandate was not given to the government to execute moves of this nature. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
