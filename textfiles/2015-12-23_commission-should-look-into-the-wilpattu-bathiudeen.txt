	A commission should be appointed to look into the Wilpattu deforestation controversy, Minister of Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said today.
	While refuting allegations that he had illegally re-settled internally displaced Muslims in Wilpattu, Bathiudeen said if such illegal constructions had happened, it could be investigated through Commissions or the Police.
	“The Presidential Commission, Bribery Commission, FCID, CID and the Police are functioning in the country to investigate illegal acts. Why none of them is investigating this allegation and come to a conclusion?” he said.
	“If some is having evidence against me, they could lodge a complaint with any of above mentioned institutions,” he said.
	He said that he had no connection in to the Wilpattu deforestation.
	“All the allegations are baseless. I will quit from politics if the allegation that I re-settled internally displaced families in Wilpattu could be proved,” Minister Bathiudeen said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
