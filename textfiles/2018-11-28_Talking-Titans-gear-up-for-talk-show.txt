‘Talking Titans’  gear up for talk show


	

‘All the world’s a stage’ for the 150 ‘Talking Titans’ who comprise the school of elocution and public speaking spearheaded by Amalka Perera. Equipped with polished skills of oration and confidence, these youngsters are capable of projecting their thoughts and opinions on any given topic in a matter of minutes. 

Whilst they belt academic achievements in LAMDA and Trinity College examinations, Amalka sought an education beyond the ordinary for her students. The weekly lessons incorporate debates, discussions and impromptu speeches which she believes would bring these blossoming youth out of their shells and make them ready to face the world with etiquette, eloquence and an edge.

Most of her seniors joined the ‘Talking Titans’ family at the age of 4 or 5 and have since then developed a beautiful bond with their teacher.  “We talk to her about everything. She’s like a mother to us,” were the sentiments shared by Innupama Gunasekara who has been under her wing for 12 years now. They had nothing but praise for the doors of opportunity the lessons had opened for them. 




I wanted to bridge the gap between the corporate and the emerging youth. ‘Speak to lead’ will allow these young adults to rub shoulders for the first time with the corporate sector - Amalka Perera

 


Young Amaya Perera shared how she has evolved from “being too scared and sitting in the corner” to “going forward and doing what had to be done.” 

From discussing historic figures like Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln to examining pressing crises like the Syrian War,  Amalka has ensured her students are competent enough to stun you with their diverse and in-depth knowledge on any given topic. 

Having accumulated such fountains of knowledge over the years, the students are ever ready to engage with a real audience and test their craft out.

“I wanted to bridge the gap between the corporate and the emerging youth. ‘Speak to lead’ will allow these young adults to rub shoulders for the first time with the corporate sector.” Amalka thus described the intent behind this initiative. She realised that these students who have long nurtured their oratory skills deserve an experience, an opportunity to explore their horizons. 

The event will host an audience of 150 people of which 35 will include a blend of invited corporate heads. 

12 speakers will take to the stage to each voice their thoughts on youth issues and current affairs.

With the purpose of engaging the audience and ascertaining that the students are indeed adaptive and knowledgeable, there will be a chance for the listeners to question the speaker after he/she has concluded speaking. 

The Talking Titans encourage you to come witness them in action on  December 11 at the Mandarina Hotel from 5-8 pm. The talk show will be followed by cocktails.  Tickets will be sold at Rs. 1500 (for students) and Rs. 2500.
