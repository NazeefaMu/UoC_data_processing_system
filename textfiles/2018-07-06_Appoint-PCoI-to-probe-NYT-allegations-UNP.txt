UNP backbench MPs today called for the setting up of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to probe the allegations which had been made in the news report published by the New York Times.

The request for the PCoI was made by UNP MP Mujibur Rahman at a news briefing held at parliamentary complex this morning.

Asked whether the request was his personal one, Mr. Rahman said it was his personal one but UNP is also of the opinion that the allegations made in the New York Times report should be probed.

“I am expressing my own opinion but my party is also of the opinion that the allegations has to be probed,” the MP said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
