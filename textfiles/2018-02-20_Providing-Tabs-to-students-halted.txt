Providing Tabs to students halted


	

On the instructions of President Sirisena, the Cabinet today decided to suspend the programme to provide Advanced Level students and teachers with Tabs, the Cabinet spokesman said.

Among the reasons for the suspension were the huge amount of money that would be incurred to purchase tabs, problems in the tender procedure and the possibility of utilising these funds for essential projects in the education sector.

According to a 2017 Budget proposal, around 160,000 A/L students and 36,000 teachers were to be given tabs, at an estimated cost of Rs. 4 billion. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
