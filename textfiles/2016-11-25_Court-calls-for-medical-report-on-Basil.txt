Acceding to the Attorney General’s request, Colombo High Court Judge Padmini N. Ranakwa today directed the Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) to submit a medical report on former minister Basil Rajapaksa to Court before December 7.

The Court’s direction was based on ascertaining Mr. Rajapaksa’s health condition prior deciding whether he should be allowed to travel to the US for medical treatment between December 10, 2016 and March 2, 2017.

He filed a motion seeking Court approval to go aboard in a case in which he has been indicted on charges of misusing Rs.29 million belonging to the Divi Neguma Department to distribute five million Almanacs with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s picture during the last year’s presidential election campaign.
