MYTH: If you pluck one grey hair two will grow in its place.  

 

BUSTED: “This is not true. There is no scientific basis for this. Even if you pluck the hair or cut it, it doesn’t alter the growing process. When you pluck the hair, the whole thing will come out. So it takes a little bit longer for the new hair to grow but two strands will not grow in the place of one. Grey hairs will occur due to various reasons. Mainly genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalances and some vitamin deficiencies will give rise to grey hair. It happens because the pigment cells are lost in the root of the hair. Unless there is a cause for the greying which we can treat, there is no way to treat the greying of hair.” explained Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe, Consultant Dermatologist.
