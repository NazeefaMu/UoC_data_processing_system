A macho act, a diversion at group meeting
	

The Green party Diyawanna members took up for discussion vital issues such as the VAT increase at their regular group meeting held at the council complex the other day.

While a serious discourse on the topical key issues relating to the countrys economy was underway, a certain popular young member with deputy status seated among the fair members at the rear put up a display of his macho prowess, they say.
While the deputy was flexing his muscles to demonstrate his physical strength another member had videoed the entire display.
The video footage of the macho act staged while a serious discussion was on is due to be released to the media shortly. However, this footage will come as a surprise to the deputy who staged the act, they say.

CA Sri Lanka launches Certificate Course in Forensic Accounting
	

In a fresh effort aimed at combating increasing fraud in the country, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) launched the Certificate Course in Forensic Accounting, to inculcate chartered accountants with important knowledge and skills in this specialised field.
The 15-week course covers pertinent areas associated with modern forensic and investigative accounting, which will help accountants gain a thorough understanding on the principles and practices used by public accountants, internal auditors and others on how to examine financial and other related information.
The course covers key topics including fraud auditing, litigation support, valuation and cybercrime, among other key areas and will be conducted by a panel of experienced resource personnel who command vast experience on the subjects. The panel includes KPMG Sri Lanka Partner Jagath Perera, Attorney at Law and Insurance Ombudsman of Sri Lanka Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, Ernst & Young Sri Lanka Partner Averil Ludowyke, KPMG Mumbai India Associate Director Prashant Bhat, BDO Partners Partner Risk, Forensics and IT Ashane Jayasekara, Sudath Perera Associates Attorney-at-Law Laknath Jayawickrama and B. R. De Silva & Co Manager Audit and Assurance C.S.W. Anthony.
In the face of growing fraudulent activities and with the consistently increasing demand for forensic accountants both in Sri Lanka and across the world, the course by CA Sri Lanka, in its capacity as the national body of accountants is a timely initiative.
CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that amidst increasing fraud and corruption, the institute has taken steps to ensure that public expectations are met with the launch of this specialised course.
In our capacity as leading a professional institute in the country, remaining relevant is among the highest on our agenda and we need to complement this by offering relevant programmes for the benefit of our membership. There is no doubt that the business community and the public have always looked up to chartered accountants for guidance and through this course, I believe we meet an important objective in ensuring public expectations are met, he said.
Wickremasinghe noted that the success of the profession depend on the respect that chartered accountants continue to have from the business community, the government as well as society.
Therefore, as an important stakeholder and members who are known as gatekeepers  we have an important role to play in assisting the government, the public and the business community to prevent fraud and corruption, he said.
Wickremasinghe also encouraged more chartered accountants to follow the certificate course, as it will educate them in an important and relevant area, which will not only enhance their professional standing but will also bring them greater professional success, as they will be in continuous demand across both the public and private sectors, locally and overseas.
CA Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Aruna Alwis noted that the role of the accountant is no longer restricted to number crunching positions but has evolved drastically from its traditional role.
Today, accountants are also considered investigators and therefore, this course is very relevant and timely and will serve for the enhanced success of chartered accountants, as they embark on a specialised role, in the current context, he added.

Speculation about a reshuffle of the team at the top table has been rife for some time. First it was rumoured that the event would come soon after the May Day. The latest talk in the town is that the red letter day is to dawn for certain in September.

The day in September has now been fixed on the advise of an astrologer who is, by the way, holding an important office in yahapalanaya, they say. He had warned that making any change in the current team before the date and the time he had ordained, would portend ill for the government. So those eagerly waiting to become the new faces at the top table have to bide their time till September.
A doctor from Kotte, a Yapa from Matara and another from the West are expected to be included in the reshuffled team, they say.

DFCC 1Q net profit up 16% over strong core banking and lower costs
	
The DFCC Bank PLC group increased its March quarter net profits 15.8 percent to Rs.955 million with an earnings per share of Rs.3.60 from a year ago, the interim results showed.
The performance was supported by moderate growth in core banking and lower costs but the higher provisions for possible bad loans, lower fee-based incomes and trading losses had a bearing on the results.
The net interest income of the group grew 7.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.1.79 billion for the quarter while the net fee and commission income fell 4.3 percent YoY to Rs.305.1 million.
This is on the back of a 2.1 percent or Rs. 3.5 billion growth in gross loans and advances of the bank on a standalone basis. Out of this Rs.3 billion came from overdrafts. 
The banks margins were not publicly available.
The assets of the bank stood at Rs.255.1 billion, up 3.6 percent during the three months.
The deposits grew 5.9 percent or Rs.6.6 billion to Rs.117.5 billion. The low-cost deposits  current and savings accounts (CASA)  ratio was 17.3 percent.
The impairments rose as much as 62.5 percent YoY to Rs.455 million due to provisions made for individual customers.
The cumulative allowance for impairment for loans and advances was maintained at a healthy level of 72 percent as a percentage of impaired loans and advances on March 31, 2016. The ratio of impaired loans to total loans on March 31, 2016 was 5.6 percent compared to 5.1 percent on December 31, 2015, the bank said in an earnings release.
Meanwhile, the banks trading portfolio made a net loss of Rs.19.5 million from Rs.12.9 million net gain made a year ago due to the rise in yields of the government securities.
The net losses of the banks available-for-sale (AFS) investment portfolio, which also composed of gilt-edge securities, mostly made a staggering Rs.2.8 billion mark-to-market loss against a Rs.672.1 million loss a year ago. These losses are adjusted against equity.
However, the banks AFS portfolio losses were excluded in the calculation of capital adequacy and thus the groups Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 15.13 percent and 15.07 percent, respectively, the bank said.
The net gains from financial investments  mainly consisting of dividend income from the investment in Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC  remained largely unchanged at Rs.623.7 million.
The other operating losses narrowed to Rs.127.9 million from Rs.287.2 million loss due to contraction of foreign exchange losses.
Meanwhile, the total overheads of the banking group narrowed 13.3 percent YoY to Rs.1.1 billion amid lower personnel expenses against the same quarter last year.
This decrease was mainly due to the reduction in personnel expenses, as a result of the annual performance-based staff payments being included in the comparable period, the bank said.
As of March 31, 2016, Bank of Ceylon had a 14.35 percent stake in the bank followed by Hatton National Bank PLC with 12.22 percent. The state-controlled private sector pension fund, the Employees Provident Fund had a 9.19 percent stake, being the fourth largest shareholder of the group.

Did growls from Big Brother silence him
	

Several Diyawanna members from the main party from the North including their leader from the East holding high office in the council were having a friendly chat with a group of yahapalanaya members in the lobby the other day.

Their talk had taken a serious turn when a yahapalanaya one asked the leader from the East why they were throwing monkey wrenches into the Sampur power plant project despite their pious platitudes about the general good of the people.
The leader from the East replied: We are against it on a matter of principle. We will not allow the government to go ahead with the project.
Media people soon heard that the leader from the East had made a statement expressing the partys firm stance against the Sampur project and began calling him to check whether this hearsay statement was correct. However, his stock reply to everyone who inquired about the statement supposed to have been made by him was: No comment.
Many Diyawanna members had later wondered why the veteran political leader who was so bold and articulate in the council lobby had suddenly turned cautious with the media. Meanwhile, some people say that growls from a neighboring country had silenced the grey-haired leader.

Govt. will remove Cabinet moles: Rajitha
	
Reshuffle or not, the Government would remove a few Ministers from the Cabinet for sabotaging the anti-corruption drive of the Government, inefficiency and treachery before long, a senior Cabinet Minister said today.
Joint Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne told the weekly Cabinet news briefing that not only the members of the Joint Opposition, the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp and public sector officials and senior Police officers, who benefitted from the Rajapaksa Government, certain Ministers also would do everything to scuttle the ongoing investigations against corruption, money laundering, frauds, and embezzlement that allegedly took place under the Rajapaksa regime.
Four Ministers including Minister Champika Ranawaka and I discussed the ongoing investigations by the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) the other day and decided to make a request to the FCID to submit a report on the investigations completed.
But one Minister has put our efforts in ex-President Rajapaksas ear and the following morning he disclosed the contents in the Cabinet paper in Kandy and added that there was a move by the Government to arrest him and Namal, Basil and some other family members.
This is treachery on the part of this Minister, Minister Senaratne said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena was fully supportive to their move and instructed not to obtain the FCID reports through the Cabinet, when the relevant Cabinet paper was submitted on Tuesday.
President Sirisena is aware of the double dealing of this particular minister and few others. They will be removed from the Cabinet shortly with a couple of other Ministers whose performance is nil, Minister Senaratne added.
Responding to a journalist on the mediocre publicity given to the last weeks exposure of the alleged transfer of money amounting to Rs. 12.6 billion on January 9, 2015, by the Chief of Staff of former President Rajapaksa, Minister Senaratne said a large section of the media was still with members of the previous regime and did not support the anti-corruption drive of the Consensual Government.
In other countries, the media takes the lead of the fight corruption. In our country many journalists and media institutions do the very opposite of it, Dr. Senaratne charged.
He added that he wondered whether they get paid from those agencies and politicians.
Minister Senaratne revealed that when the FCID first questioned the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank about the money transfer, the head of the unit, an ASP of the Rajapaksa Camp, had said there was no such transaction taken place on that day.
But during the inquiries it has been revealed that the money has been delivered in bags from the BoC City Branch to the residence of Mr. Senarat from nine in the morning to 4 p.m. by the driver, who has changed three cheque leaves given to him.
Minister Senaratne said the VAT increase was the result of massive scale frauds, money laundering and embezzlement under the Rajapaksa regime and therefore the blame must go to it
He added that the people must punish those who still rally around that clique. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

On hearing that there was a place for another person in the delegation, a certain character from Maharagama who once functioned as a provincial minister made an appeal to the former strongman that he be picked for the vacant place in the delegation.
Sir, please take me in place of Yoshitha, he implored.
However, the former strongman turned down his appeal saying: I took you on my visit to Thailand. Are you trying to accompany me on this visit too
Please, let me come, Sir. I will buy my ticket, the Maharagama worthy implored again.
I am not taking you with me this time round. Thats final! the former strongman told the man in a firm tone.
Incidentally, the former strongman had employed this character from Maharagama as his double at the last big poll for security reasons and the man had a happy time getting salutes from security top brass and cruising around in the official limousine allocated for the use of the Head of the State, they say.

Not everyone who died during the war was a terrorist. We are here to commemorate the civilians. It is necessary to seek out what happened to these people since a lot of civilians lost their lives due to the war, he said.

Peace-building process is challenging - President
	
Addressing the Seventh National Ranaviru Commemoration Ceremony held before the Ranaviru Statue at the Parliament Grounds in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte this afternoon, President Maithripala Sirisena said peace-building and promoting inter-communal harmony and reconciliation in a post conflict era was quite challenge.
The president stressed that the government was committed to provide all possible facilities, equipment, technological know-how in modern warfare, as well as foreign training to armed forces personnel in order to make them more reliable and battle hardened, but extremely disciplined soldiers.
He further said every Sri Lankan observed and honoured the war heroes who made supreme sacrifice, and even lost their limbs in the battle field. While stating that the heroes fought for territorial integrity, sovereignty, peace as well as sorrow and pride, he said sorrow stood for the sacrifices made and pride for the complete eradication of separatist terrorism from Sri Lankan soil.While mentioning that the entire nation paid their utmost respect, condolences, and appreciation for all war heroes and civilians who lost their lives during war, President Sirisena said the families of war heroes too deserved much gratitude. He said the strength and spine of a country were the armed forces. Even the UN had accepted this policy and encourages governments to build strong and disciplined forces, he added.
Winning hearts and building religious and communal harmony are not easy, especially following a long drawn civil war. In order to achieve absolute peace, we need to work towards sustainable peace and promotion of reconciliation among all communities. A feeling for the humanity among people, public officials and politicians was essential to contribute their part in this endeavour, he stressed.
President Sirisena said there have been religious, ethnic and social and regional unrest for hundreds of years. Making broken hearts united was not easy, he said adding that racial and social unrest had a long history in Sri Lanka.
It had happened before and after the independence, the president said.
The detractors of the government carried posters to racially motivate people during the recent past. They attempted to convince people that the government was discriminating against war heroes. But, people have not forgotten how they treated the military leader, the top war hero who led the armed forces for the ultimate victory against the separatist terrorism. They put him in jail after a pseudo military trial with fabricated charges. This is how they treated war heroes, President Sirisena recalled.
While National Ranaviru Seva Authority Chairperson Anoma Fonseka made the welcome address, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Field Martial Sarath Fonseka, armed forces commanders and Police Chief and Ministers were present at the ceremony. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

A proposal made by Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe to amend the Penal Code to change the minimum age for criminal responsibility to 12 was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers today.
While addressing the Cabinet briefing today, Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka said, in case of a child aged between 12 and 14, Magistrates could use their discretion to decide on whether criminal responsibility could be assigned. This was also approved by the Cabinet.
The current Penal Code precludes a child under the age of eight from being prosecuted for an offence, the Minister said. However, internationally, the minimum age of criminal responsibility varies from ages twelve to fourteen.
Psychologists and other experts have opined that eight years is far too young an age at which to incur criminal responsibility, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Sri Lankas first General Insurance Sales Congress ends with tremendous success
	

Traditional drums and dance heralded the beginning of Sri Lankas first General Insurance Sales Congress (GISCO) recently at Waters Edge. The theme of the congress was Growth through innovation. Over 500 delegates representing insurance companies were present at the event.
The days programme began with the lighting of the traditional oil lamp by chief guest Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa, IBSL Director General Damayanthi Fernando, Dr. Christian Bartsch of Munich Re, Chandra Schaffter, Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) President Dirk Perera and other leading personalities of the insurance industry.
Following the national anthem and an inspiring curtain raiser, IASL Marketing and Sales Forum Chairman Samitha Hemachandra delivered the welcome speech, in which he pointed out some of the key objectives and choice of theme for the event. Innovation is the key to success, progress comes only through innovation, he stated. He ended by stating that if each participant could take away at least one idea on innovation from the congress, the effort that had gone into organising the event would not be in vain.
Pereira expressed his delight at seeing such a large number of participants. He placed special emphasis on the competitive nature of the insurance industry and the constant change of the needs of the customer. One cannot stay still, stated Pereira. Growth is not going to happen if you keep doing the same thing over and over.
Sugathadasa conveyed her appreciation to the IASL for having taken the initiative to organise the first GISC. In the beginning of her speech, Sugathadasa explained the necessity of insurance in public enterprise and its value to the economy. She also highlighted the importance of insurance advisors working closely with the customers in order to provide tailor-made solutions. However, she went on to point out that the lack of penetration of insurance in Sri Lanka is a cause for concern.
In his keynote address, Bartsch highlighted the importance of innovation to grow the insurance industry and went on to present a number of innovative ideas that had been introduced to the global insurance community over the recent years.
Schaffter presented a detailed history of the insurance industry in Sri Lanka, titled Insurance  Then & Now.

Trespasser disciplined
	

There are two purohitas handling subjects closely connected to the countrys economy and there is no love lost between them for some time, they say.

The reason for the bad blood between the two is that one purohita has made it a habit to appoint his people to positions in the state-owned bodies coming under the subjects of the other purohita.
The purohita trespassing on his colleagues subject area had ignored instructions issued by the two offices in the highest echelons to revoke the appointments he had made to the institutions coming under the purview of the other one. Angered by his insolent attitude the highest political authority had given his nod to reconstitute a director board of an institution connected to insurance with new appointees, they say.
By the way, a rumor abuzz in political circles says that the stiff-necked purohita thus tamed is likely to be brought down a step lower from his pedestal at the reshuffle round the corner.
