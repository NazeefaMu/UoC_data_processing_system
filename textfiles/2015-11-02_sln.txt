	The SriLankan flight UL 230 flying from Kuwait to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was diverted to the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) this morning due to heavy mist in the Katunayake area.
	A spokesman for SriLankan Airlines said the flight was scheduled to land at the BIA at 6.30 a.m. but due to bad weather it was diverted to the Mattala Airport.
	However, the flight flew back to its scheduled destination of the BIA at around 9.00 a.m. once the mist was cleared from the area.
