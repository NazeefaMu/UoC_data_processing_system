Debate on medical students issue this afternoon


	

The House decided to hold an adjournment debate this afternoon on steps taken by the government to resolve the issues faced by medical students following a request by Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane.

He said a serious issue had arisen in the country today due to the strike launched by the GMOA in protest of yesterday's attack on university students.

The MP said a large number of university students, who were protesting against private medical education, had been hospitalised due to the attack by the police.

He said it should be considered a national issue because more than 8,000 medical students had been inconvenienced because of it and said that government could not keep mum on the matter. (Ajith Siriwardena)
