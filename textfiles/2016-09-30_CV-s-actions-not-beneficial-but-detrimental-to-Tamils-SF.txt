Minister Sarath Fonseka said today the actions of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran would not yield any benefit to the Tamil people but would cause them more problems.

He pointed out that Mr. Wigneswaran was attempting to take political advantage by inciting racism and said his actions would boomerang on him just like what happened to former Tamil leader Appapillai Amirthalingam.

“Wigneswaran cannot understand nor is he trying to understand politics. He is trying to obtain votes by somehow deceiving and provoking the Tamil people,” Mr. Fonseka said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
