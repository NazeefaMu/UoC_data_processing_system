NFF says replacing PM not the solution


	

While claiming that there is a move by the government to hand over the Prime Minister post to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the National Freedom Front (NFF) asserted that a change of personnel was not what was needed.

Addressing a news briefing, NFF Media Spokesperson Mohammed Muzammil said the people appear to be disgusted with the government and added there should be a change of government.

“It is crystal clear that people are disappointed with the way this government has been ruling the country. Therefore they cast their vote in favour of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which has as its leader former President Mahinda Rajapaksa,” Muzammil said.

“The citizens of the country have rejected both the President and the Prime Minister as witnessed during Local Government election held last Saturday (10). This government no longer has a mandate to run the country," he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
