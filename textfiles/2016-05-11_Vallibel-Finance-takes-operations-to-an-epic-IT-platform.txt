Vallibel Finance further consolidated its standing as a futuristic finance company with a far-reaching documentation management system that would overhaul the company’s 
operating system.
The move also spells great news to the company’s rapidly growing customer base beefing up security on information and transactions.  
The cutting-edge documentation management platform was designed and installed by epic Technologies Group, one of the leading IT development companies in the region. The new system will transform day-to-day business operations into a super efficient work flow system, while offering maximum documentation security and user authenticity.
The new high-tech system will see a paperless work environment also helping save on energy and operational costs.
“This has been a well thought out move by the company and goes to show that just as much as we are finance-savvy we are equally techno-savvy. Steadily, we are priming ourselves as the people’s undisputed choice,” said Vallibel Finance Managing Director Jayantha Rangamuwa. “The architects of the new documentation system Epic Lanka has been in the forefront of the advent of new technology in Sri Lanka. The process of going from a paper-based, cumbersome operational model to a futuristic document and information management system comes with its own challenges especially with our client being a finance company. Together we have developed a world-class, custom-designed solution,” said Epic Lanka Chairman Nayana Dehigama.
