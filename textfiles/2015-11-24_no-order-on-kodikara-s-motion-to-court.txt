No order on Kodikara's motion to court


	

Colombo Chief Magistrate today made no order on a motion filed by Western Province Provincial Councillor Upali Kodikara for an explanation as to why he failed to be present before the CID after a court order was given.
When the motion filed by Mr, Kodikara’s Counsel, R. A. K. Ranawaka was taken up for inquiry, the Counsel told Magistrate Pilapitiya that his client did not present himself before the Cinnamon Gardens Police due to illness and submitted a medical certificate to confirm the fact.
However the Magistrate observed that if Mr. Kodikara had fallen ill on that day he should have informed the Police about it.
Mr Kodikara was arrested and was charged with protesting and creating a tense situation by obstructing the duty of a police officer at a session of PRESIFAC at the BMICH in which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was called in for questioning.
The Court, while granting bail to Mr.Kodikara, made it obligatory for him to be present before the Cinnamon Gardens Police on Sundays, a stipulation which Mr.Kodikara had failed to adhere to the previous Sunday (22). (T.Farook Thajudeen and Shehan Chamika Silva)
