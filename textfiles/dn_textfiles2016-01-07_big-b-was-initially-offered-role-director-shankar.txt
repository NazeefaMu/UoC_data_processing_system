Big B was initially offered the role by director Shankar

Rajinikanth and Amitabh Bachchan are both very big names in the Indian film industry. While Rajinikanth rules Kollywood, Big B has inspired a lot of people in B-town. What is as awesome as their cine careers is their great friendship and it seems that an epic opportunity to see these two veterans together on screen was thwarted.
Amitabh Bachchan has revealed that he was approached by the Kollywood big-shot director Shankar to play villain opposite Rajini in the 2010 film Enthiran. But Big B was advised against playing the role by the Superstar.
Here is what the yesteryear's angry young man was quoted as saying,"Shankar had come to me and he wanted me to play the villain (in 'Enthiran'). I called Rajini.
