President Maithripala Sirisena said the upcoming provincial councils elections would be held under the Electorate System and this system would apply to the general elections as well.

President said this when he met the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members of the North-Central Provincial Council at the President’s House yesterday.   

He said he had proposed the ward system instead of the preferential voting system so as to introduce a new political culture as promised in his manifesto for the 2015 presidential election.

The President said the preferential voting system made politicians think only of themselves and not about the people or the country. He said the new system would encourage politicians to work for the country. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
