Govt aims to make SL a highly competitive economy - Mangala

The government’s intention is to make Sri Lanka a highly competitive economy on par with Southeast Asia, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
"The newly created Development Strategy and International Trade Ministry will coordinate investments and economic relations. The barriers to Direct Foreign Investments including bottlenecks and delays to doing business will be removed," he said.
"There will be reforms in the financial and monetary sectors and more stringent control of the budgets," the minister said delivering a lecture on 'Politics and Development in Sri Lanka' at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore on Thursday.
Samaraweera said to strengthen social sector programmes, especially universal access to education and health, the government will increase the budgetary allocations to both sectors.
A new set of laws will be put in place to combat corruption and financial crimes, he said.
The past six years or so since May 2009 saw Sri Lanka take an unfortunate journey on an autocratic path. Civil liberties were curtailed, independence of institutions including the judiciary was compromised, democracy was weakened, the rule of law was undermined, and good governance practices and human rights were violated with impunity, the minister said.
"We failed to address the causes of conflict in a manner that would guarantee durable peace, meaningful reconciliation and non-recurrence. Divisions in society were becoming deeper along religious and ethnic lines, freedom of speech and expression were curtailed, and fear and intimidation pervaded society," Samaraweera said.
"This is the first time in our country’s history that we have a truly Sri Lankan leader, who has been elected through the votes of all Sri Lankans, irrespective of race, religion and language. A President who stands for a united New Sri Lanka in which ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity is respected, celebrated and valued; a leader who would fulfil the aspirations of the people for strong and independent democratic institutions, freedom of expression, rule of law, good governance and the promotion and protection of human rights," the minister said.
From the very first day since assuming office, President Sirisena’s Government, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been pursuing an agenda of reform which I am sure you must be familiar with," Samaraweera said.
"We have also initiated dialogues with diaspora groups and individuals with a view to working with them and obtaining their ideas, views, and assistance for the reconciliation process that is currently underway in the country including projects that directly relate to the welfare of the people," he said.
" Sri Lanka is once again working closely with the United Nations Organisation and its systems and procedures. We liaise closely with the High Commissioner for Human Rights and his office and we remain open to working with the OHCHR to obtain technical assistance to address several important issues including justice and accountability related issues," the minister said.
"Despite all the violence of the last several decades, there is a large reservoir of goodwill in my country, among the people of all communities. They are, after all, guided by the four major religions of the world which pursue peace, compassion and brotherhood – Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Islam," Samaraweera said.
The priority objective of the government is of course the achievement of “reconciliation and development” which is essential for the nation’s long-term stability, development and prosperity, the minister said.
"As Sri Lanka embarks on this important journey we look to Singapore, the one country in the region that is hailed as the modern success story of economic advancement combined with political stability and ethnic harmony," the minister said.
"Today, Sri Lanka has no choice but to take this chance; this opportunity before us, which may not present itself again, and work collectively with commitment, with the assistance of the international community, to re-build our country as a strong, united and prosperous pluralistic nation, ensuring ethnic and religious harmony, economic success, political stability and a balanced foreign policy," the minister said.
