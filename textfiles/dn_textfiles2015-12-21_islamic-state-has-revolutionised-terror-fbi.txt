Islamic State has revolutionised terror - FBI

 
US: The director of the FBI, James Comey, said that Islamic State (IS) had “revolutionised” terrorism and that the world faces a much more serious threat today than ever before.
Comey said the group’s decentralised structure and use of social media to spread propaganda and incite attacks made it particularly difficult to combat. “Your parents’ al-Qaeda was a very different model than the threat we face today,” he said.
The FBI, he said, had “hundreds of investigations” in all 50 US states as part of an attempt to stop those inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) also known as Islamic State (IS) from carrying out attacks. He said the ability of Isil conspirators to use encrypted communications, and the constant threat of small-scale attacks worldwide, posed new challenges to US law enforcement.
Meanwhile, secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson was in Washington unveiling a new system to alert the public to terrorist threats.
Johnson said the National Threat Advisory System would be revised, so that the public would be made aware of “general developments or trends regarding threats of terrorism” in the form of “bulletins” posted to the homeland security website.
The attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, have reignited the debate in the US about how best to combat terrorism. Polls show that terrorism is now the primary concern for the American public, overtaking the state of the economy and government gridlock.
In Tuesday’s Republican Presidential debate, candidates berated the Obama administration for its alleged failure to keep the American people safe. One recurring concern was that Tashfeen Malik, the female San Bernardino attacker, had been allowed into the US despite reportedly having posted in support of Isil on Facebook.
“For heaven’s sake, every parent in America is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our government can’t do it,” said Carly Fiorina, a Republican candidate.
In his remarks yesterday, Johnson said the Department of Homeland Security was consulting social media as part of the vetting process for immigrants, and had been since early this year.
“Under my leadership as secretary, we in fact began to consult social
media in connection with conferring various immigration benefits and we will be doing more of this,” he said. “Any reports or partial reports to the contrary are simply false.”
Comey said the FBI had no evidence linking Malik and Syed Farook, her husband and co-conspirator, to a terrorist cell. US officials say it appears the couple, who slaughtered 14 people at a party, were inspired by - but not directly affiliated with - Isil.
Speaking alongside Comey, New York’s Police Commissioner Bill Bratton reiterated that the threats made on Tuesday against schools in Los Angeles and New York had been a hoax.
Los Angeles elected to close all 1,000 of its schools on Tuesday after receiving a threat overnight that an “army” would attack schools with explosive devices and automatic weapons.
