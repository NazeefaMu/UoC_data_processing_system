Petition for army deployment against SL dismissed


	

The Madras high court on Thursday had dismissed a public interest litigation filed two years ago by an advocate seeking deployment of armed forces to protect Tamil Nadu fishermen from the Sri Lankan navy.

In 2014, advocate S. M. Ananda Murugan filed the petition. He said the Katchatheevu Island, the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar have been the areas of conflict between the Tamil Nadu fishermen and the Sri Lankan navy.

The central government unilaterally ceded the Katchatheevu, which was under the Ramanathapuram parliamentary constituency in Tamil Nadu, to Sri Lanka through an agreement.

The Indian government claimed that fishing rights and the right to worship at St Antony's church vested with the Indian fishermen. However, the Sri Lankan government misinterpreted it and said that the Indian fishermen have only rights to dry their nests on the island. Due to it, the Sri Lankan navy has been killing and injuring hundreds of Tamil Nadu fishermen, he said.

When the case came up for hearing on Thursday, the government side said it was taking all necessary steps to protect the Tamil Nadu fishermen.

Following this, the court dismissed the petition. (Times of India)
