Effective, efficient public will see a developed country - President

An effective and an efficient public service is vital for the success of overall development activities and the progress of the economic sector, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing public servants who received appointment letters as management assistants at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium yesterday.
He said public servants are duty bound to understand public issues.
President Sirisena said an efficient and an effective work pattern and a positive attitude paves the way to take the country forward.
He said the government was keen to uplift the economy of families of all communities including rural households.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake was instructed by the President to launch a proper and result oriented programme to empower rural family units. "The project will look into the welfare of rural family units while strengthening those family units economically," he said.
He said the government will never let anyone misuse public funds allocated for the development and infrastructure activities of the country.
Public servants as well as politicians are equally duty bound to get the maximum benefits of state allocations, he said. President Sirisena added that it is obvious that when public servants get small bribes, politicians and high ranking officers are engaged in monetary misuses amounting to millions or billions. Both these activities should be condemned and totally banned, he said.
