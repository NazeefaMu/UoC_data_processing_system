SL a critical partner: US


	

Sri Lanka would be a critical partner in broadening the United States interests across the Indo-Pacific region, US President Barack Obama's ambassadorial nominee for Sri Lanka Atul Keshap told lawmakers on Tuesday.  
"As we look to advance our interests across the Indo- Pacific, Sri Lanka will be a critical partner," Keshap said.
Noting that there is room for closer cooperation on disaster response and maritime security in the Indian Ocean, he said Sri Lanka is a regional leader in the fight against cybercrime, a contributor to UN Peacekeeping Operations and is focused on disrupting drug trafficking and fighting maritime piracy.
Keshap said the US wanted to build lasting peace and fellowship among Sri Lanka's various religious and ethnic groups, PTI said.
"We want to help build a lasting peace and fellowship among Sri Lanka's ethnic and religious communities, including credible justice, accountability and reconciliation that can facilitate closure for those who suffered and lost loved ones during the war," Atul Keshap, the nominee for US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation hearing.
"It is important to get this right, and the UN and international community can lend useful insight to the efforts of the Sri Lankan people," Keshap said.
If confirmed by the US Senate, Keshap would be the second Indian-American to be serving in an ambassadorial position in South Asia. Richard Verma is the current US envoy to India.
"We want to help the Sri Lankan people strengthen democracy, civil society, and human rights, including media freedom and freedom of religion," he said.
"Economically, the US is Sri Lanka's largest export market. While our trade volume is relatively low, there is great potential to expand our partnership," he said.
On Maldives, Keshap said a young and dynamic populace is on the front lines of climate change.
"We are worried, however, about the current state of rule of law, due process, and human rights (in Maldives). All citizens should be allowed to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms," Keshap said.
