The Centre for Human Rights and Research (CHRR) today requested the Education Ministry to look into an incident in Badulla where a top provincial level politician in Uva had forced a school principal to kneel.

In a letter to the Ministry Secretary, CHRR Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said they have received information that this politician had summoned a principal of a Tamil girls school in Badulla and forced her to kneel after she refused to follow his orders.

“Parents of a student had met the school principal with a letter obtained from the politician to get the student admitted to the school. However, the principal has rejected the letter saying she is not bound to follow orders of politicians but education ministry officials,” Mr. Tennakoon said in the letter.

He said after the parents had reported the incident to the politician, he had summoned the principal through provincial education officers and had forced her to kneel and apologise.

“This is an uncivilized and inhumane act which degrades the reputation of the public service. Therefore, we request the ministry to look into this issue and take necessary action in this regard,” Mr. Tennekoon said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
