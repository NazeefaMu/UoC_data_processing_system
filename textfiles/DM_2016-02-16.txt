Dark clouds that overshadow two myopathic sisters
	
Stella Young, the Australian comedian, journalist and disability advocate once said, The thing about disability is that you adapt, you do what works for you.
Yet at times there are so many difficulties in the form of the lack of financial support, marital failure, lack of a good educational backing, apart from being disabled, that the situation becomes so desperate, that adapting is no longer an option without external support.
Dilini Sewandilka and Nisansala Sajini, 26 and 24 respectively, are disabled sisters living in Galewela, Anuradhapura.
They find it almost impossible to lift themselves up once they have sat on a chair or on the floor. The mother lifted her up and we saw the excruciating pain and fatigue Nisansala underwent in the process, which is to most of us a simple task.
The two sisters cannot raise their arms and they walk very slowly. Each step requires a lot of effort. When I try to stand up, I feel as if theres a knot in my backbone, as if it is stuck, said Dilini trying to stand up holding onto the wall for support.
It was when we turned 16 that symptoms showed up. The doctor said that this is a result of myopathy, said Nisansala.
Myopathy is a muscle disease that attacks the proximal muscles of the body, namely the limbs and upper arms.
The disease can be identified when one cannot lift their arms above their shoulders. Treatment for myopathies depends on the cause. However, the cause of their myopathy is unidentifiable. The sad truth is curing the disease is almost impossible when considering cases of congenital myopathy and what makes matters worse is even treatment is only possible when the cause of the myopathy is identified.
The doctor administered some medicine which made us grow fatter. As a result we fell down more frequently.
Then the doctor asked us to stop taking the medicine and advised us to take vitamins. All the medicines and vitamins are pointless.
Our condition isnt improving, said Nisansala. Both Nisansala and Dilini could not continue their education after their O/L studies because of the sickness.
The disease became an obstacle to our studies as well. When the disease first crept in, we had trouble with getting up from the desk.
But, later it became much worse where even getting into the bus to go to school became an impossibility. We had no choice but to quit school.  said Dilini.
At 19, Nisansala was married off to a proposed prospect who was a coolie. I stayed in my husbands house for a year. He knew about my sickness before marriage. But later they werent happy, berated me for my disability and sent me back to my mothers house, said Nisansala. She and her husband are presently separated and would be legally divorced by the end of this month.
Dilinis situation is more tragic.  I got married when I was 21no..24. My husband used to get drunk and beat me. He was often in a bad mood. When I complained to my mother-in-law about the abuse, she used to scold saying that I couldnt walk or do anything and that her son doesnt benefit from me at all. She also said that her son should be married to someone else. I was sent back home, she explained in tears.
After the separation the sisters were taken to the Kandy General Hospital for treatment by a specialist, where Dilini was found out to be 5 months pregnant. The father didnt even come to give our son his name. said Dilini. Dilinis son who is 3 years old is looked after by her mother. His father has turned a blind eye towards not only me, but our child as well.
No financial aid has ever been given by him to look after our son. It is my mother who has kept this family together.  Neither of the husbands help the sisters.
They depend on their mother and step-father, who work as coolies. Dilini receives a monthly allowance from the temple which is of Rs. 350/=. They are grateful for the money, but Rs. 350/= is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family. Further, the family is part of the Samurdhi poverty alleviation programme where they receive Samurdhi benefits every month.
However, to receive money they need a job, and a job will only worsen their condition. Their sickness has made them confine themselves to the house. After Dilini left school she started working at a hostel, The people at the hostel knew about my condition and they were very kind to me. But, my legs began to gradually stiffen.
Soon my condition worsened to the point that I had to resign from the job. When asked about future expectations their mother, W.N. Leelawathi said, It would be a great relief and a huge satisfaction to see that my children have a proper house to live in before I die. The expectations of the two sisters were no less different. Our expectations We need a house. Our greatest hope is to get cured though it seems that it is almost impossible. We would also like to get efficient wheelchairs so that we could at least do the basic daily tasks.
They are two sisters, with a few dreams: a cure, a house and wheelchairs. We can make their dreams a reality by giving them financial assistance. We rise by lifting others this was stated by Robert Ingersoll,. Though, they are a family who are fighting an illness, grappling with poverty and have problems with their marital relations they have not lost hope for a brighter future. Hence, external support is an indispensable need for the very survival of this family. Generous donors could ease the familys impoverishment by sending their mite to

This onetime political strongman was recently taking a ride behind a pilot security escort as usual along a road in the Matale district. Suddenly on seeing a Green party Diyawanna member standing in front of his roadside residence, he asked the driver to stop the vehicle.
The onetime strongman, the shrewd politician he is, had taken advantage of this accidental encounter with the Diyawanna member hailing from a well-known political family in the area to have a cordial chat with him. Its a pity that they have failed to offer you a Ministerial portfolio, the strongman observed. He added: Didnt they promise to offer a portfolio to the member who would win both his seat and the district for the party They have badly let you down!   
The onetime strongman had also made it a point to drop in at the Diyawanna members parental home for a chat with the latters mother as well before resuming his journey.

Fitch rates Singer Finances proposed senior debt BBB(lka)(EXP)
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned Singer Finance (Lanka) PLCs (SFL; BBB(lka)/Stable) proposed senior secured redeemable debentures of up to Rs.1.5 billion a BBB(lka)(EXP) national long-term expected rating.
The issue will have three tranches with bullet principal repayments in the third, fourth and fifth years, with a fixed-rate coupon paid semi-annually. The debentures will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. SFL expects to use the proceeds to fund lending growth, lengthen maturities of its liabilities and reduce structural maturity mismatches.
The agency will assign a final rating to the issue subject to the receipt of final transaction documents conforming to information already received.
The issue has been rated at the same level as SFLs national long-term rating. The debenture is secured by a primary mortgage over receivables from identified lease agreements. Fitch has not provided any rating uplift for the collateralisation as the recovery prospects are assessed as average and comparable to those of the unsecured notes in a developing legal system.
SFL is rated two notches below its parent, retailing company Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (Singer; A-(lka)/Stable). This reflects Singers majority ownership in SFL, the common Singer brand and Singers influence on SFLs strategic direction through representation on the finance companys board. The two-notch differential also reflects SFLs limited role in the group as SFL provides financing for only a low proportion of Singers sales.
SFLs rating also reflects its standalone credit profile, its higher capitalisation levels compared with its peers amid modest loan growth and its improved asset-quality metrics.

German national arrested for allegedly harassing 9 yr. old girl
	
A 60-year-old German national was arrested by the Jaffna Police for allegedly sexually harassing a nine year old girl yesterday.
Police said the man had allegedly called the child, who was passing by his house, after her evening class and tried to kiss her in his bedroom.
When she had screamed for help, the neighbors had intervened and the child was allowed to go home. The foreign national had given the child some money to pacify her.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today those who are paid to shout against the agreement with India will learn a lesson when the people get to the streets soon.
No one should waste time on unwanted things because the government will not stray from its journey towards developing Sri Lankas economy, myself, Minister S. B. Dissanayake and Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva will not deviate from our journey, he said at Ape Gama during the launch of the systematic country diagnostic study by the World Bank Group.
He referred to the minister and the deputy minister because they were present at the launch.
The Prime Minister who insisted on a strong commitment from the state machinery said the government expected the effective use of funds allocated to each institution.
We expect results from public servants, he said and urged the private sector to put its shoulder to the wheel instead of continuing a wait and see policy.
The Prime Minister said only ordinary people pay taxes and bear a great burden for the sake of the country. He said it was his generation which paid a host of taxes such as death duty, wealth tax and several other taxes while the present generation did not bear that much of a tax burden.
Besides, he said Sri Lanka should move away from the South-Asian way of thinking and adopt policies based on an East-Asian line of thinking. The Prime Minister said the government would ensure that money goes into the hands of the poor.
He said the government was focused on eradicating poverty, ensuing that the inflation rate is low, double the gross domestic product and make Sri Lanka a high-income-earning country by 2025. The Prime Minister said the World Bank would support the government to achieve these policies.(Yohan Perera)

India eyeing bridge or undersea tunnel to link SL: Gadkari
	
New Delhi: India, after signing a road transport agreement with Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal, is said to be considering an ambitious bridge or undersea tunnel linking the Indian mainland with Sri Lanka.
India was mulling the project after the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) suggested that India look at a project linking Sri Lanka, roads minister Nitin Gadkari said at a Mint Conversation, a platform where special invitees interact with Mint staff.
When I met ADB officials (in June), they told me to look at a connectivity project between the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka as well. They said that they would finance it. They proposed a bridge between Rameswaram and Sri Lanka, Gadkari said.
When I recently visited Rotterdam (Netherlands), I visited an immersed tunnel connecting Rotterdam and Belgium. So, it could be an immersed tunnel or a bridge. We are looking at it, the minister said.
Connectivity as been a key theme in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) for many years now and a beginning was made when India signed the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) transport pact in June in the Bhutanese capital, Thimphu.
The pact was proposed after Saarc, which also includes Afghanistan, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, failed to conclude a motor vehicles pact, along with an agreement on regional railways when the leaders of the eight nations met in Kathmandu in November 2014. This was because Pakistan was unable to secure internal clearances. India-Pakistan squabbles have been blamed for Saarc failing to realize its potential for economic integration.
The BBIN pact seeks to open up vehicular traffic in order to give impetus to trade and sub-regional cooperation, a key element of Prime Minister Narendra Modis neighbourhood policy.
According to Sri Lankan diplomats, the idea of connecting India and Sri Lanka by a bridge or undersea tunnel has not been broached by the New Delhi government in recent times.
But news reports say the idea of a land bridge or a causeway between India and Sri Lanka was mooted back in 2002 by current Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his earlier stint. The idea behind it was to enable trucks from southern India to ferry goods to the Colombo port, one of the largest in the region. However, there were strong objections from some sections in Sri Lanka, who said the plan would mean Sri Lanka will be seen as an extension of India, according to media reports.
It (the idea of a corridor) is a good idea. But I think it will take time to fructify, said a person familiar with the developments who did not want to be named. If it works out, it will definitely give a boost to sub regional cooperation within Saarc.
Currently, India is connected to Sri Lanka by at least 100 flights a week. A ferry link between Dhanushkodi in Tamil Nadu and Thalaimannar in Sri Lanka was snapped in 1983, when the Tamil-Sinhala ethnic conflict erupted in Sri Lanka.
Another ferry service that was started in 2011 between Tuticorin (in Tamil Nadu) and Colombo after the end of the Sri Lankan civil war in 2009, was discontinued as the operator deemed it uneconomical.

Although one month has elapsed since Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris ordered the CID to send the DVDs and a CD of the CCTV footage of the vehicle in which rugby player Wasim Thajudeen travelled, to a forensic laboratory abroad for examination, they are still in Court custody.
The Magistrate had directed the Criminal Investigations Department to send those DVDs and CD abroad for in-depth studies on January 7 this year.
However, the CID is yet to obtain those articles relating to the case from the custody of the Court.
Earlier, the Colombo University's School of Computing (UCSC) recommended that the video footage be examined at a well-equipped forensic laboratory abroad such as the FBI, MPS or the new Scotland Yard as the poor quality of the video footage and the UCSC's limited technical facilities to do so.
It is reported that the footage had been recorded during the night and as such strong lights from oncoming vehicles had distorted the images. (Nirangi Abeywikcrema)

Will sack Yoshitha if charges are proved: navy
	
Ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa's son Yoshitha, a Lieutenant in the Navy, and currently in remand custody on charges of financial irregularities at the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) would be sacked if found guilty of the charges, the Navy said today.
Navy Spokesman Akram Alavi said the Navy was also conducting two investigations in connection with Yoshitha's alleged unauthorized overseas travel and his involvement in politics while being a naval officer.
Yoshitha had travelled abroad without the approval of the Navy Commander and had also engaged in political activities while being a naval officer. It was in the midst of these investigations that he was arrested on money laundering charges. He will be sacked from the Navy if found guilty of the money laundering charges, Captain Alavi said.
The Defence Secretary had directed the Navy Commander to investigate how Yoshitha joined the Navy, how he received overseas scholarships, his alleged engagement in active politics and other activities while being a naval officer.
