The Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) has announced that Sri Lanka has been selected to be the host country of the 12th Annual International Microinsurance Conference. 


The event will take place from the 15th-17th of November at Cinnamon Grand, Colombo.
The Munich Re Foundation together with the Microinsurance Network first initiated the International Microinsurance Conference in 2005. Organized by the Munich Re Foundation of Germany, the purpose of the conference lies in providing a suitable platform for insurers, re-insurers, insurance/re-insurance brokers, micro credit agents, insurance regulators, international donor agencies as well as organizations like the World Bank Group and ILO, to meet and exchange views and ideas on the topic of insurance and discuss issues pertaining to the development of microinsurance. Thus ensuring that those in the world who find themselves below the poverty line will reap the benefits of schemes provided by insurance professionals from all around the world. 


Having accepted the Munich Re Foundation’s invitation to host the prestigious international event, the IASL received the support of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) and the Microinsurance Foundation USA; both organizations will take on the role of co-host of the conference. The Sri Lanka Convention Bureau is also a supporting organization of the conference.


In addition to the main event, a pre-conference workshop has been organized by ILO and will be held on the 14th of November at Cinnamon Grand, on the topic, ‘Managing Microinsurance Distribution & Building Sustainable Agriculture Insurance’. The Annual General Meeting of the Microinsurance Network will be held on the 18th of November while the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) will host their financial inclusion working group and draft group on the use of Digital Technology in conjunction with the conference. 


A total of 350 participants from over 50 countries have already registered themselves. The organizing committee, which consists of representatives of all insurance companies in Sri Lanka, expects to see more than 400 participants from 55 countries present at the International Microinsurance Conference 2016.
