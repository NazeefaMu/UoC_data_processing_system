A young man who had visited former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s official residence in Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo today was arrested when he threatened to commit suicide saying that he won’t leave till he meets Mr. Rajapaksa.

The Police said the suspect had tried to stab himself once he found out that Mr. Rajapaksa was not at his residence at that time. He was overpowered by one of the policemen providing security to MP Rajapaksa and handed over to the Cinnamon Gardens Police thereafter.

The suspect had been identified as a resident of Balangoda.

Meanwhile, the former president's Media Spokesperson Rohan Welivita said that the suspect appeared to be mentally unstable.

"He was shouting and said he wanted to meet the leader who saved Sri Lanka from terrorism and set our people free," he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
