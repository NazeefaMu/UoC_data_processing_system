Singapore to help SL in restructuring its foreign ministry


	

Singapore will provide help to Sri Lanka as its government undergoes restructuring, said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Monday (Feb 29).

In response to a media query, an MFA spokesperson said Singapore will offer capacity-building assistance for the restructuring of Sri Lanka’s foreign affairs ministry. “MFA hosted a two-day study visit in January 2016 for senior officials from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, covering areas such as planning, human resource and training,” said the spokesperson.

However, the restructuring exercise and decisions taken will be entirely led by Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the spokesperson added.

Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan had agreed to Sri Lanka’s request for help in its restructuring plans during his counterpart Mangala Samaraweera’s introductory visit to the Republic last year, said MFA.

“Singapore is prepared to offer further capacity-building assistance in relevant areas upon the Sri Lankan government’s request,” the spokesperson added. (channelnewsasia)
