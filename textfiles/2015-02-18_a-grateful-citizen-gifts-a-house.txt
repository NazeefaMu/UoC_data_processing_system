A grateful citizen gifts a house


	


	
	The deposed Big Boss has yet to get an official residence in the city or a suburb. As he has no residence of his own in the city or close to it, the deposed Big Boss had been staying in the official residence of his elder brother presiding over the Diyawanna House whenever he had occasion to visit the city.

Given that his elder brother is the holder of a highly respected non-partisan top office in the country, using his official residence for political powwows is against tradition. Taking cognizance of this fact, the deposed Big Boss has been looking for a suitable house to be taken on rent.
Meanwhile, a leading medical doctor who had heard about the deposed Big Boss’ hunt for a house on rent had soon called him. “Sir, I have a well-furnished bungalow with all amenities, located in an ideal environment for you to stay whenever you visit the city,” he told the deposed Big Boss. “This bungalow is yours as long as you want. I am making this offer as a citizen grateful to you for assuring us of the most precious freedom – freedom from fear.”
The deposed Big Boss will shortly move into this bungalow in Nugegoda area, they say.
