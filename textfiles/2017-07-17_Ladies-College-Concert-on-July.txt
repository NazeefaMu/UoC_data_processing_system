The curtains will rise on the first ever evening of singing, dancing and orchestral music starring the old girls of Ladies’ College, on July 29 at the school Hall at 7.30 p.m. 
The concert will showcase a multitude of talents, as the old girls themselves take the stage to deliver some fantastic performances. The programme for the evening includes some surprise skits and a sing-along session which will undoubtedly get your fingers clicking and your toes tapping. This concert is presented by the Ladies’ College Old Girls’ Association and directed by Sureka Amerasinghe.  
The proceeds of this evening will be channelled towards two objectives. One is the ‘Smart Classroom Strategy’ - a milestone initiative to digitalize the school and bring Ladies’ College on par with international and multidisciplinary standards of education; the second project is to propel the advancement of arts, sports and drama with the aim of ensuring the holistic development of the members of the OGA.
