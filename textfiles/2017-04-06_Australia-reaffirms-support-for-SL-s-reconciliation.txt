Australia’s International Development and the Pacific Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells met Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran during her visit to the Northern Province on Wednesday and reaffirmed ongoing commitment to the development of the province and support for Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process.

Issuing a statement, the Australian High Commission said Australia has provided more than AUD250 million to support the reconstruction of conflict-affected communities in the North and East since 2009.

Australian support has included housing and local infrastructure construction, de-mining, education, and a wide range of economic and business activities.

The Minister visited a crab processing plant in Iranaimatha Nagar, Poonakary in the Killinochchi District. This Australian-supported joint venture is exporting Sri Lankan crab to the United States. The venture has created work for the local community which was displaced during the conflict.

“The business model of linking producers directly with exporters has not only created jobs, but high quality jobs. More importantly it has created jobs for women,” the minister said.
