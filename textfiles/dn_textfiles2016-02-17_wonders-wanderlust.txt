Wonders of wanderlust!

It is not just Swiss chocolates and Alpine mountains that captures Swiss Ambassador to Sri Lanka Heinz Walker-Nederkoorn's interest. An economist who likes to distribute his knowledge at conferences, Walker-Nederkoorn says that Sri Lanka is his first experience in South Asia. The ambassador has already served countries like Germany, Egypt, and Indonesia. He has started off his ambassadorship in Romania in 1990.
"I believe that diplomats need to be open to different experiences. You need to embrace a country and its culture while maintaining a certain distance. Should not load your shoulders with all the problems in the country but you need to cultivate an empathy for the people, their problems and the country," he says. He notes that life can be tough at that time even for a diplomat. His one-year stint in Romania during the revolution was such an example.
"There were only two or three restaurants which served lunch or dinner in Bucharest'" he recalled the trials he has undertaken during his career. He took up the post as Swiss Ambassador to Sri Lanka in October 2014.
Born in Schattdorf/Canton of Uri, Walker-Nederkoorn holds a PhD in Economics and Social Sciences from the University of Fribourg. After working at the University of Fribourg as an assistant at the Chair of Economic Policy, he entered the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs in 1990 and undertook his first assignments in Berne, Bucharest and Geneva. He is a music lover and plays the Alphorn, the national folk instrument of Switzerland which originates from the Alps. The instrument was originally used to call for help or summon cattle from the pastures. It ranges in length from 10.6 feet to 13.5 feet and produces 'natural' harmonic tones which reaches up to four octaves.
"The Alphorn was a form of communication between our farmers. They played it at sunrise and during sunset. You can hear it many kilometers away in the Alps. The sounds echoes back to you," he explained.

He notes that due to its massive size the Alphorn is a challenge to travel with. It can be portioned into three and fitted snugly into a bag. "I played it in Jakarta as well. I bought it about five years ago. I like to be present in whatever I do. It is the same with the Alphorn. I hear the tone, feel it and produce it at the same time," he says. Walker-Nederkoorn has started off his musical stint with a trumpet when he was 12 years old. Next he took up the brass band at High School.
"I met my wife, Senta, at High School. We have known each other for more then 40 years," he added with a smile. The couple has three daughters: Anna (24), Nina (22) and Sophie (20).
He notes that he has picked up various past times from each of the countries he has visited.
"It was singing in Germany. I took to scuba diving in Egypt. I discovered golf in Indonesia," he mused.
"The traffic is very heavy in Jakarta. The golf courses are the only green area in the city. I go there early morning. It is a good way to start the day. It takes hour and a half hours to pay nine holes. It is fascinating because you cannot force anything.
It is a game of miss hits. You can never be perfect. It deals with finding the right balance of power and control. If you use too much power, you lose control. Vice versa and the ball will not go anywhere. I hit the best shots when I am relaxed," he expressed. Queried if he has 'picked up' anything from Sri Lanka yet, the ambassador breaks into a smile.
"It is the thirst to discover things," he replied.
"Sri Lanka should be a leader in archeology because you have such a rich heritage. I was so impressed and still am by your beautiful heritage. We visited Anuradhapura once and our tourist guide showed us how your system was sustainable. For example the rest rooms had a marvelous system to get rid of waste. If they had let the waste flow into the rivers they would not have had suitable drinking water. Therefore they knew what was important way back then," he said. He notes that he is also captivated by the diversity in the island. This, he notes, is a similarity which the nation shares with Switzerland.
"If you travel around Switzerland you will notice that every 10 minutes there is a change of landscape. One of my favourite places to visit in Sri Lanka is the Horto n Plains National Park. I visited it twice last year," he said.
Another place he loves to chill out during the weekend is the Galleface Terrace. "The sea fascinates me. There is a whole new life beneath the sea. It is amazing to witness the corals and marine life mingled with the sound of your breath as you dive in. I did scuba diving at the Pigeon Island," Walker-Nederkoorn said.

The manner in which the kings built the stupas by linking them with the cosmos too captivates him. "The king is in the middle and then around him there are the educated people, then the watchers and then the agricultural fields.
One of the pillars of any successful society is the Government's close link with the educated people in the society," he said.
Looking around the spacious garden in the Swiss Residence which is filled with lush greenery Walker-Nederkoorn gives a sigh of content. "I grew up in the Alps. So I love nature. The mountains are like the emblems of the limits which you can achieve. If you get to the top, you can have a great view across the valley.
Whenever I visit Switzerland, which is like two to three times per year, I go skiing," he said. The ambassador and his wife have four pets: two Persians and two tabby cats. The Persians: Mikesh and Ajnun, have traveled with them to Sri Lanka.
"You need to train dogs but cats are not animals that you can discipline. If I am tense they do not come to me. Whenever they come to sit by my side, I know that I am relaxed," he laughed adding that the family had birds and turtles while they were in Indonesia. They even had a gold hamster in Berlin. Speaking about his love for flora and fauna Ambassador Walker-Nederkoorn says that he likes all expressions of nature.
"We need to respect plants. Every plant has a character. They are all individuals. Nature has its own society. We have the eco system where plants and animals are integrated. If you interfere with that system you disturb the whole cycle," he opined.
"I love the nature in the tropics. We have this luxury only in the spring time. One of the great assets of being a diplomat is that you get the opportunity to live in different countries. If you live four years in a country, you become a part of it. I transform myself by taking in all the experiences I come across," he said.
