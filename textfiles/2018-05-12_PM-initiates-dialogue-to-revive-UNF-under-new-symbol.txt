Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have initiated a dialogue with parties aligned with his United National Party (UNP) to form a broad front under a new symbol and policy plan to face future elections.

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) and the All Ceylon Makkal Congress are currently aligned with the UNP and function in Parliament as the United National Front (UNF).

The Prime Minister chaired a meeting at Temple Trees on Thursday attended by TPA leader Mano Ganeshan, SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem, ACMC leader Rishad Bathiudeen, JHU leader Patali Champika Ranawaka and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.

Sources said the UNF would carry a new symbol instead of the UNP's elephant symbol and also accommodate Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs who are willing to join the new political front. (Kelum Bandara)
