A group International Trade Ministry officials will leave for India on December 21 to make a final decision on the Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) with India which was earlier known as Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) revealed on Monday.
The revelation was made by International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama during a meeting held yesterday with GMOA members who continuously opposed the long-pending CEPA/ETCA.
GMOA member Dr. Haritha Aluthge told the Daily Mirror that according to International Trade Minister Samarawickrama, a final decision on the long-pending agreement would be made on December 22.
“We pointed out the kind of damage that will be posed to the Sri Lankan trade community. We were informed by the minister that they would finalize the ETCA only after reading the facts in the agreement and studying them,” Dr. Aluthge said.
However, during a media briefing held yesterday by the GMOA, its Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said all arrangements have been made to sign the CEPA/ETCA agreement between Sri Lanka and India in January.
“Though the name CEPA has been changed to ETCA, we still cannot accept allowing unemployed Indian professionals to enter the Sri Lankan labour market. As we previously said, we extend our fullest support to the Government to improve the quality and skills of Sri Lankan professionals up to international standards. But, instead of uplifting local labourers, the government is going to hire Indians. As the ones who opposed the ETCA, we have had to face defamation from some people. Since we oppose it, the GMOA’s and all state professionals’ reputation is being defamed by some people. The public should be concerned over this due to the impending dangers it would cause,” Dr. Herath explained. (Piyumi Fonseka)
