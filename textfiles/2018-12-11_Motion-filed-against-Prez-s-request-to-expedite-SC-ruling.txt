A motion has been filed in the Supreme Court today by a lawyer against the request made by President Maithripala Sirisena asking the Chief Justice to expedite the court ruling on the dissolution of parliament.

In his motion, the lawyer said such requests undermined the hearing of the case. Therefore, he requested the Supreme Court to issue a ruling after considering the motion.

President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday he would request the Chief Justice through the Attorney General to deliver the order on the dissolution of parliament without further delay. (Thilini De Silva and Ranjan Katugampola)
