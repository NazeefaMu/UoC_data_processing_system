Video: Italy train crash leaves at least 20 dead


	



Two trains have collided head-on in southern Italy, killing at least 20 people and injuring many more.

They collided in an olive grove in countryside between Andria and Corato in the Puglia region, close to the so-called heel of Italy.

The line has only a single track and it is thought the crash was due to either a signalling error or a mistake by one of the drivers, both of whom are thought to have been killed.  

A seven-year-old boy was rescued from the wreck of one of the trains and airlifted to hospital by helicopter.

Italy's prime minister Matteo Renzi said: 'This is a moment for tears in which we need to work to recover the victims and wounded.'

Mr Renzi, who interrupted a visit to Milan, said: 'We will not stop until we know what happened.' (Daily Mail)
