Wheeler-dealing to take local bodies


	



 

Three JO politicos had recently rendezvoused with a pro-Maithri stalwart behind closed doors at a five-star hotel overlooking a river.

 


Two of the JO trio are siblings and the other is a nephew of a leading politico. The pro-Maithri character, a typical turncoat, is said to be known in his home turf as ‘Gemba’ (frog). An original Green, he later joined the Blue party. In more recent time, he closely moved with the former strongman until the carrot of high office drew him to the Maithri faction. He too hails from a political family. 


Their talks were aimed at working out a strategy to have a Pohottuwa guy elected to the chair of an important mini-governing body, they say.
