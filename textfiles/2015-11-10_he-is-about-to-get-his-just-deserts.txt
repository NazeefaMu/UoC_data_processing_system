He is about to get his just deserts


	


This former Ministerial one from the South who made it to Diyawanna from the West was once a law unto himself. Taking undue advantage of his close ties to the former strongman, this politico used to abuse his powers with callous disdain for the law as well as for the social norms and values. 
However, once his Boss fell from power, he turned against him. 
The politico did not stop at vilifying his former mentor, but also threatened to take him to courts.
The intimates of the former strongman who had ignored the hostile conduct of this character have now decided to take tit-for-tat action against him, which they think would shut his big mouth for good.
These intimates of the former strongman have now begun collecting information about the wealth he had amassed while holding high office. Meanwhile, a member of a local body in the Kelaniya area has come to their help by providing them with documentary evidence relating to business ventures, large estates, buildings, lands and other property acquired by the politico with his ill-gotten lucre.
So filing a case against the politico with the authorities tasked with probing bribery and corruption is just a matter of course, they say.
