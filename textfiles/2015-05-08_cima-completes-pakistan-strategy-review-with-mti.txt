CIMA, the world’s largest professional body of management accountants, in consultation with MTI Consulting has completed a multi-stakeholder study to fine-tune its Pakistan market strategy.
“CIMA opened its Pakistan office in 2009 with the intent of enhancing the professional and qualified management accountants, in a country that requires globally recognized professional bodies to support local talent. The entry of CIMA into the professional education industry of Pakistan was with the strategic intent of gaining a greater share of its relatively large degree-driven market.
This establishment also enabled CIMA to offer greater support to the existing members and students and create opportunities for the talented youth in the country” said CIMA Regional Director for Middle East, South Asia and North Africa Bradley Emerson.
“MTI has provided CIMA Pakistan with plenty of food for thought and strategic initiatives for each and every stakeholder, which will ensure that going forward each stakeholder would be addressed in our strategy to generate half of all enrolments in the MENASA region by 2018,” said CIMA Country Head Pakistan Javaria Hassan.
To find the answers to the focus areas defined, MTI structured the research such that it would take a 360 degree insight from all of CIMA Pakistan stakeholders. As a result, over 600 touch points were achieved in the span of the three months. This was formidable data along with the ground knowledge acquired through visits to develop reliable assessments of the current ‘business-brand health’ and draw conclusive strategic pursuits for CIMA Pakistan.
Algeria, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordon, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and Syria MTI has an impressive track record in Pakistan having successfully completed the mega consulting project to develop Pakistan’s  National Export Plan via the restructuring the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan.
