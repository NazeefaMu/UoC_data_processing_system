They followed it up with the special FC Barcelona edition in Red and Blue mix. The R11 pioneered the crescent curved design that was both aesthetically pleasing and practical. The R15 introduced the beautiful Ruby Red and Cosmic Purple gradient colors.

It was when OPPO launched the R-series which gave fabulous pitch-perfect pictures even in low-light that made many ditch the regular point-and-shoot cameras. The R1 came with an f/2.0 aperture lens which was a big deal back in 2013. The OPPO R11 was one of the first phones to come with dual 20MP cameras.
