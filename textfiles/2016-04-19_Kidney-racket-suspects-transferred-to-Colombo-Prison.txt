Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today directed the Prisons Superintendent to transfer the seven remaining suspects of the alleged Indo- Lanka kidney racket to the Colombo Prison.

The order was given after the Prisons Authority informed the Colombo Magistrate yesterday that the first suspect, Vijitha Giri Lakshman Kumar, had escaped from the Mirihana detention Camp.

The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) today complained of low security at the Detention Camp prompting the Magistrate to transfer the remaining suspects.

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday issued a warrant for Lakshman Kumar and also imposed a travel ban. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
