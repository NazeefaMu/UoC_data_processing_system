Central Province medal winner felicitated

 
National Sports Festival is an inter-provincial meet and the organisers should ensure that sportsmen and sportswomen from the provinces represent the respective provinces they were born. They should check their birth certificates and justice done to their province, said the Secretary to the Central Province Sports Department Mrs M K K Karunaratne.
She made these observations when she addressed the audience at the felicitation ceremony for model winners at the 41st National Sports Festival and held at the Auditorium of the Central Provincial Council at Pallekele.
She said that she is making this plea as the province often without the basis amenities and with the greatest difficult produce sportsmen and sportswomen who rise to national level. When they reach the top and for employment purposes they take up residence in other towns more particularly the Western Province who every year win the Championship title at the National Sports Festival while Central Province is always the runner up.
This trend must be stopped and if it is not place is good. Central Province has the talent but in most places lack on facilities. We don't have an astro turf track nor the astro turf facilities to play hockey but out girls and boys won the hockey championship titles. We produced six best performers in Udaya Ranasinghe (Table Tennis), Shehan de Silva (swimming), Madura Dharmaratne (Ladies Hockey), I R K Willawarachchi (mens hockey), W G I V R Wijesuriya (Taekondomale), R D K Dharmawardena (Judo-Men).
This year we won 47 gold medals - two more than our previous best of 45 and we can do much better or even lift the championship title if those born in our province represent us.
She added that four girls from Kandy were members of the Sri Lanka netball team which won the Asian Youth netball championship a few days back. Udaya Ranasinghe is the national champion at table tennis and Shehan de Silva is the national champion at swimming. This shows individually we have been dominating and we should harness the talents for team work.
Chief Minister of the Central Province Sarath Ekanayake said that as the government we have been endeavouring our best to provide the best facilities to our sports starts but these are our limitations and adequate funds is one of them. We intend constructing more grounds. He has had discussions with the Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera for funds to complete the balance work at Digana Sports Complex. He took the Sport Minister on an inspection tour.
Our target to become the Best Province in the country by 2015 and this we have been not able to achieve due to various untoward problems. But have courage and determination and we will be able to achieve this in the future.
Minister of Sports of the Central Province Premuka Bandara Tennakoon said that much has been dealt on this felicitation ceremony by the other speakers and it is gratifying to note that this has been our best ever performance in this 41 year old National Sports Festival. We can even do better if we could master our best team.
He said that sports is not only winning medals or cups or trophies. It teaches us many other things which could be very useful in life when you step into the society. A sportsman acknowledges both victory and defeat in the same vein. If you cannot win, you go to the next competition with grit and determination. That defeat has made you stronger, You learn leadership and team work which are no useful to the society. You hardly ever hear of a sportsman in a problem. He knows how to face and handle a problem without getting into difficulties. These are things he or she had learnt in sports to manage problems.
