He is bitter about politico’s sweet success


	


This is a sweet food item which the people find indispensable. It is locally produced, but the amount produced here is hardly sufficient to meet the national requirement. So the shortfall is covered by imports.
The tax levy on this food item was increased recently. A certain well known factory producing this food item held back a massive stock of this item on the eve of the tax hike – you guessed right – to be released after the resulting price increase.
Alas! A high political authority in charge of the subject issued a fiat that the entire stock be released to the market forthwith.  And a buyer who appeared from nowhere at the right time purchased the entire stock!
The tax levy came two or three days later giving a windfall to the buyer.  According to the factory employees the lion’s share of this fortune went to a political bigwig who manipulated the transaction! 
However, the political bigwig who profited from the transaction had made one bad mistake: He had failed to buy the silence of the factory owner, a higher-up himself and the latter being bitter about the outcome, is going round now telling the tale to all and sundry, they say.
