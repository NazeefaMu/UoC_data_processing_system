Martin Guptill ton leads New Zealand to 294-5

The most prolific international one-day batsman of 2015 hasn't required a New Year's resolution.
 
Martin Guptill's run of form in the limited-overs arena continued in Mount Maunganui on Tuesday as he made 102 in the fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka.
 
The opener's century guided the Black Caps to 294-5 from their 50 overs as they sought to seal a 3-1 series victory.
 
Guptill made 1489 ODI runs in 2015, with four centuries and eight 50s. In the current series against Sri Lanka which began on Boxing Day, the opener has compiled scores of 79, 93 not out, 30, 27 and 102.
 
His composed knock - albeit with a couple of miscues - came from 109 balls and featured nine fours and three sixes. It saw him become the third New Zealander to break into double figures for ODI centuries - Guptill now has 10, behind only Nathan Astle (16) and Ross Taylor (15).
 
Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews won the toss and somewhat surprisingly put the hosts into bat.
 
While the Bay Oval wicket is a vast improvement from the old dunger at Blake Park used late last century, the wise word is to utilise what pace and bounce there is initially, then bowl when the deck is slower and more variable.
 
After losing opener Tom Latham to the last ball of the first over, Guptill and Kane Williamson began to establish the sort of dominance New Zealand built earlier in the series.
 
While the Sri Lankan seam attack was generally accurate, any delivery too full or too short was rapidly pounced on by two in-form batsmen.
 
In doing so, they picked up their share of boundaries in the first 10 overs and then accumulated with little risk, forcing Mathews to further rotate his limited bowling line-up in search of a breakthrough.
 
Having omitted rookie leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay, the visitors had to employ a pair of part-timers tweakers in Tillakaratne Dilshan and Milinda Siriwardana. Guptill brought up New Zealand's 100 and the century partnership for the second wicket with a six off a rank full-toss from Siriwardana and Williamson wasn't far behind in reaching the same personal mini-milestone.
 
He'd produced the shot of the innings with an inside-out boundary over extra-cover, so it came as a massive surprise which silenced the crowd when he gloved a poor delivery down the leg-side from Dilshan that wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal snatched at the second opportunity.
 
Williamson's 61 came off 72 balls and featured seven fours, as he and Guptill put on 122 for the second wicket.
 
Ross Taylor then put on 81 for the third wicket with Williamson as he compiled a valuable 61 off 67 balls, including four fours and a six.
 
Nuwan Kulasekera took 3-53 off his 10 overs while young paceman Dushmantha Chameera went for just 41 off his nine overs.
