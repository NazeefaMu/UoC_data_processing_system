The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila requested the Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake to save the reputation of the ministry and himself by removing Ministry secretary Nimal Bopage from his post if he has expressed his personal opinion through the missive issued by him to the media on the ‘Joint Opposition’.

Addressing a media briefing, MP Gammanpila questioned from Minister Karunathilake how a Ministry Secretary could use the ministry’s letter head and his signature as the Ministry’s Secretary to express his personal opinion.

“The Ministry Secretary has misused the ministries’ letter head. His actions were unethical and false. Why does the Minister still keep such an impertinent person in this post without removing him? Only the Ministry’s Director of Information have the ability to issue such statements,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
