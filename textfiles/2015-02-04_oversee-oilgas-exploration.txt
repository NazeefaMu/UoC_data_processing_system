	The Power and Energy Ministry is to set up a National Oil Company (NOC) as a private–public partnership venture to oversee the offshore gas and oil exploration in Sri Lanka, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
	Minister Ranawaka told Daily Mirror that this company, once established, would function independent of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
	“Though this is a state company, it will be managed by the private sector. We do not possess technology in this sector. So, we need to find it from elsewhere,” he said.
	Besides, the Minister said he would unveil the Ministry’s short term plan for restructuring and development of the entire sector.  (Kelum Bandara)
