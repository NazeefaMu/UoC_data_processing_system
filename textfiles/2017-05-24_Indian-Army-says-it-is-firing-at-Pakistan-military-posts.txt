Hindustan Times, New Delhi, 23.05.2017 - The Indian army said on Tuesday that it is engaging in “punitive fire assaults” on Pakistani posts that were aiding infiltrators into India.  


“Recent actions in Naushera have caused damage to Pakistan army posts,” said Maj Gen Ashok Narula in a briefing.   He said the Indian army “proactively dominates” the LoC. “We want peace and tranquillity in Jammu and Kashmir.”   


“Pakistani army has been providing full support to infiltrators by engaging Indian Army posts,” he added.  The “fire assault” follows the beheading of two Indian jawans by militants from Pakistan earlier this month.  The army had at the time said that Pakistan will have to face consequences, and promised a response action at a time and place of  our choosing.
