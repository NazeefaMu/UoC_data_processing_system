## Title: Rs. 25,000 fine for high speed and overtaking amended: DMT
## Section: Breaking News
## Date: 12 October 2017 01:18 am
Rs. 25,000 fine for high speed and overtaking amended: DMT
	
The proposed Rs.25,000 fine imposed on drivers for high speed and overtaking other vehicles from left side has been amended, following a decision taken by the committee appointed by the President, Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) Commissioner General A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said yesterday.
While addressing the media yesterday at the DMT, the commissioner said that earlier a decision had been taken to impose a fine of Rs.25,000 for several offences including these two offences, but the fine for these offences would be amended.
Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, driving without a valid driving licence, employing those without a driving licence, entering a vehicle into a railway crossing irresponsibly and driving without valid insurance are the other traffic offenses categorized for this fine. There would be no change in the fine for these offences, according to the Commissioner.
The committee was appointed by the President Maithripala Sirisena comprising Finance Ministry secretary, Transport and Civil Aviation Secretary, Department of Motor Traffic Commissioner, Deputy Solicitor General from the Attorney Generals Department, Traffic Police DIG.
After considering the comments received from the people and considering the defects and certain standard of the roads in the country the committee had decided to amend the fine for high speed, he said.
There was a spot fine of Rs.1000 or a fine of Rs.25,000 through a lawsuit for high speed earlier. Now the fine through the lawsuit has been divided into four categories, the Legal Officer of the DMT K.I.Yogachandra said.
According to him if a vehicle exceeding the maximum speed by 20 percent will be charged a spot fine of Rs.3000. If he did not pay the spot fine and found guilty by a court the fine would be in the range of Rs.3000 and Rs.5000. If the violation is between 20 and 30 percent of maximum speed the police can impose a spot fine of Rs.5000 or the court can impose a fine between Rs.5000 and Rs. 10,000. In case of 30 to 50 percent high speed the spot fine would be Rs.10,000 or a court can impose a fine between Rs.10,000 and Rs.15,000. For the 50 percent high speed Rs.15,000 would be the spot fine whereas the fine would be in the range of Rs15,000 and 25, 000 if it is imposed by the court..
Accordingly the committee had decided to remove the Rs.25,000 for overtaking a vehicle from the left side and imposed a spot fine of Rs.2000 and the offence was taken under the common offence of the 224 clause of the Motor traffic act, he said.
Mr. Yogachandra said the amended motor traffic bill had been referred to the parliament. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

SL should focus on thwarting modern security threats: Ruwan
	
We must focus on modern threats to our national security that can lead to instability by way of financial crises, climatic events, cyber attacks and pandemic diseases, State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene said today.
He said this at the Colombo Air Symposium 2017 at which he was the Chief Guest.
States have placed national security as the prime objective and leaders are seeking how best they could enter into partnerships with other countries. International conferences such as the Colombo Air Symposium has set a platform for such strong partnerships. Cyber attacks, drones, sabotage, suicides, terror tactics, media campaigns, guerrilla attacks and fear tactics that cause mass hysteria have become common occurrences today. Asymmetric threats are the most complicated security threats to deal with because of their dynamic nature. An asymmetric attack may cause sudden emergence of problems within the health sector, security and the safety of the region, improvement of infrastructure, law and order, security of food, relief provision and failure of the administration sector of a nation. Being prepared for the unforeseen is the biggest challenge we face today as policymakers, the state minister said.
He said the Sri Lanka Air Force played a key role in establishing peace and had always proved its readiness to learn and change for the betterment of the country.
Sri Lanka's air power makes an immense contribution towards national developmental goals along with its other sister forces, the state minister said.( Darshana Sanjeewa)

Speaker signs LG Polls (Amendment) Act
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya placed his signature to the Local Government Election (Amendment) Act in Parliament today, paving the way to conduct local government polls in January, as pledged by Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya and Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha..
Mr. Jayasuriya speaking at the occasion said the delay in conducting local government polls had created some uncertainty in the country because the grassroots level administration was carried out by the local government bodies.
He added that the conducting of early local government polls were extremely vital to expedite the development process and to end public concerns. The Act which was passed in Parliament on October 2, brought amendments to the Municipal, Urban and Pradeshiya Sabha Acts.
Local government bodies are closely associated with the day to day activities of the people and therefore, it is the responsibility of all concerned to hold local government polls sooner than later, Mr. Jayasuriya said.
He pointed out that the most important and progressive feature in the newly introduced local government election law was the opportunity given to voters to elect their local government member directly through the first past the post system and the abrogation of the highly criticized preferential voting system.
He said several countries have pledged him support to further assist in strengthening the local government administration.
Mr. Jayasuriya expressed his gratitude to Minister Musthapha for his efforts in enacting the local government electoral law in a speedier and fair manner to the satisfaction of all stakeholders including minority parties.
Minister Musthapha and Secretary General of Parliament, Dhammika Dassanayaka were also present at the event. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

US quits UNESCO over 'anti-Israel bias'
	
The US is pulling out of the UN's cultural organisation UNESCO, accusing it of "anti-Israel" bias, the BBC reported a short while ago.
Quoting the US state department, the article said the US was also concerned about mounting financial arrears at UNESCO and that the agency needed to be reformed.
Meanwhile, UNESCO Head Irina Bokova has said the withdrawal was a matter of "profound regret".
The withdrawal represented a loss to the "UN family" and to multilateralism, Ms. Bokova said.
The US will establish an observer mission at the Paris-based UNESCO to replace its representation, the state department said.
The decision follows a string of UNESCO decisions that have drawn criticism from the US and Israel.
In 2011, the US cancelled its budget contribution to the agency in protest at its decision to grant full membership to the Palestinians.
And last year, Israel suspended cooperation with UNESCO after the agency adopted a controversial resolution which made no reference to Jewish ties to a key holy site in Jerusalem.
Then earlier this year, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned UNESCO for declaring the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank a World Heritage site.
The US withdrawal is also motivated by a desire to save money, Foreign Policy magazine reported.
US President Donald Trump has criticised what he sees as a disproportionate contribution by the US to UN institutions.
The US funds 22% of the UN's regular budget and 28% of UN peacekeeping.

US will expand military to military relations with SL: Admiral Swift
	
The US look forward to the expansion of their military to military relations with Sri Lanka through military exercises, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Scott Swift said.
He said U.S. Pacific Fleet forces joined the Sri Lanka Navy in Trincomalee as part of Exercise CARAT 2017 last week and activities like CARAT, both from an interoperability perspective and from a perspective of building trust and cooperation to address multilateral challenges.
When Sri Lanka experienced severe flooding this past May, several nations sent naval forces and provided assistance to aid in disaster response and recovery. It is what responsible navies do, and I commend my fellow naval leaders for their leadership in their decision to provide assistance, the Admiral said.
Addressing the Galle Dialogue 2017 held in Colombo, Admiral Scott Swift emphasized that engagement and building trust remains a critical part of maintaining the inclusive security network that sustains the rules-based order and helps protect freedom of the seas for the benefit of all nations.
As we build trust between our forces, we improve our ability to provide security on a wider scale. Piracy and armed robbery at sea plagued the Western Indian Ocean for an extended period, disrupting the delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia and threatening the use of critical sea lanes. In 2012 alone, the estimated costs to governments and the shipping industry caused by piracy were nearly $7 billion. It took a collective response by maritime nations and their navies, a U.N. resolution, and adjustments to best practices and policies in the shipping industry to reduce this threat to more manageable levels,he said.
Admiral Swift said just as nations and their maritime forces have the ability to build trust, their actions, like applying national laws in international space, erodes any trust that can be gained by multi-lateral cooperation.
He said as the Pacific Fleet Commander, he look forward to continuing to work closely with like minded nations, focusing on ensuring the benefits provided by free and open access to the maritime domain are enjoyed by all nations, regardless of size, strength or wealth. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Amana Takafuls third party insurance brings many benefits
	
In Sri Lanka, it is an essential legal requirement that every motor vehicle on the road be equipped with at least a third party insurance cover. This requires that motor vehicle owners approach an established and reputed insurance company to acquire the necessary documentation.
Furthermore, as all insurance companies establish branches in towns and city centers it leaves little or no option for the people residing in the suburbs to travel to the city in order to fulfill their insurance requirements. Amana Takaful (ATL), an insurance provider known for its customer centricity has come forward to put an end to this cumbersome practice and has now established over 450 authorized 3rd party agencies island-wide, thus making third party insurance schemes easily
accessible to all.
Furthermore, unlike existing 3rd party insurance schemes available, ATLs 3rd party insurance policy comes loaded with the following benefits.
The policy holders are essentially entitled to receive Rs 50,000.00 in case of accidental death, up to Rs. 1500.00 per day up to a maximum of 14 days a year in case of hospitalisation. The insurance scheme releases a sum of Rs 25,000.00 as funeral expenses.
Amana Takaful invites you to make use of these unique and unparalleled benefits of a fully loaded third party insurance scheme that is accessible to all Sri Lankans via its 450 plus 3rd party agents strategically located island-wide.

Ambassador Liyanage throws his weight in Doha school
	

Ambassador Liyanages unlawful interference into Stafford Sri Lanka School affairs has had a negative impact on the country
	This is a good lesson for our politicians not to appoint people who arent professionals to represent our country abroad,
	Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha is a non- profit organization maintained with the sole purpose of providing proper education for the Sri Lankan students living in Qatar.

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar is accused of using diplomatic powers to harass a private Sri Lankan School Doha. This issue has caused much concern among Sri Lankans living there. Ambassador A.S.P. Liyanage has come under severe criticism for the unlawful and unjustified interference in the affairs of Stafford Sri Lankan School in the recent past. Liyanage has gone to the extent of getting the schools bank accounts frozen and lodged complaints against the school management with the Qatar Education Ministry andLabour Department, abusing diplomatic powers. 

Officials of Stafford Sri Lankan School in Doha confirmed with this newspaper yesterday (October 11) on how the Chairman of the School had been taken into custody by the Qatar Police following a complaint lodged by Ambassador Liyanage. The arresting of the school official was related to whatsapp messages both Liyanage and the School Chairman had exchanged six weeks ago. 
The Chairman had been extensively questioned for several hours and was produced before the public prosecutor. Unlike in other countries, when a foreign envoy lodges a complaint, the police in Middle Eastern countries acts speedily. We kindly request the Foreign Ministry in Colombo to intervene and instruct the Ambassador to stop harassing the school authority, officials in Doha said.

Expatriates voice concerns
According to Sri Lankan expatriates in Doha, unlike previous Sri Lankan envoys, Ambassador Liyanage, is bringing discredit to the country by interfering in matters not under his purview.
According to a section of parents, Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha is providing the best possible education to children of expatriates and also preparing those who wish to sit for the Sri Lankan O/Level Examination as well.
Although our children are following the London Edexcel syllabus here, the school management is preparing the students who wish to sit for the Sri Lankan O/L examination syllabus as well. But since the recent past, the school work is getting disturbed due to Ambassador Liyanages uncalled for involvement in the work of the school management which has raised concerns among parents and students of the school, a spokesperson for the group of Sri Lankan expatriates in Doha said.

However, the Qatari Sponsor had taken measures to unfreeze the bank account immediately and informed the Doha Bank that he is the owner of the school and that the account will be operated by the Board of Trustees unless and otherwise instructed by the Sponsor or by a Court Order
A career diplomat opines
Meanwhile a career diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the duty of an envoy is to facilitate its own people in the country and serve, not harass people. Ambassador Liyanages unlawful interference into Stafford Sri Lanka School affairs has had a negative impact on the country.
As the countrys envoy, he shouldnt have got involved in the affairs of the school management, but helped them if any assistance was asked for. The lack of experience in representing the country abroad has given rise to this crisis. He is neither a career diplomat nor from the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. This is a good lesson for our politicians not to appoint people who arent professionals to represent our country abroad, the diplomat said. 
Claiming that there are frauds taking place, Ambassador Liyanage on July 18, 2017 had allegedly got the school bank account in Doha Bank frozen by exercising diplomatic powers. Liyanage has taken a step beyond and made a complaint against Stafford Sri Lankan School to the Qatar Education Ministry and the Labour Department regarding various allegations, sans proof.
Qatari sponsor
However, the Qatari Sponsor had taken measures to unfreeze the bank account immediately and informed the Doha Bank that he is the owner of the school and that the account will be operated by the Board of Trustees unless and otherwise instructed by the Sponsor or by a Court Order. 
Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha Chairman Kumudu Fonseka when contacted said that school affairs hadnt been affected due to the Ambassadors unnecessary involvement with the school administration. However, the schools chairman added that the situation had raised concerns among the parents of students. Established in 2001 with 14 children of Sri Lankan expatriates, Stafford Sri Lanka School Doha has now classes from nursery to Grade 13 (pre University) and boasts of a student population of 1, 100 students which is served by 82 Sri Lankan teachers. 
Ambassador Liyanage says that the Sri Lankan Embassy in Doha is the sponsor of this school and therefore the Embassy has the right to interfere in the management of the school. This is misleading. The Sri Lankan embassy hasnt spent a cent towards this school and this is a fully private school and the sponsor is a Qatari citizen. The reason why the Ambassador is now attempting to get involved in the school administration is because of the money in the school bank account, Fonseka said.


Unnecessary interference
According to Fonseka, the unnecessary interference of the Sri Lankan Embassy began following his meeting with one of the Ministers in the present regime. When this minister came to Qatar I personally met him and requested him to obtain assistance from the Government of Sri Lanka for further development of the school by the way of requesting the general Treasury to consider issuing a letter of comfort (LoC) in the event the Board of Trustees, who are all Sri Lankans, need to borrow funds from banks and financial institutions in Qatar for the construction of new buildings for the school.
In support of this request, a cabinet memorandum is to be submitted to the cabinet by Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella to which the Minister of Justice and Foreign Employment Thalatha Atukorale and the former Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva had given their blessings as well. Minister Kiriella had visited our school and was pleased in how we are managing the school. Minister Atukorale is very supportive of this school as she knows that expatriates benefit from this school. This memorandum is yet to be submitted to the cabinet. However when the request was made to this particular minister, he inquired about the existing money in schools bank accounts. When I informed him that the school accounts contained more than 8 million Qatari Riyals (approximately Rs.498 million), he was surprised and that became the turning point. It is no doubt that the unjustified interference from the Embassy commenced from this moment as they are now eying the school funds, Fonseka alleged. 


Non- profit organization
Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha is a non- profit organization maintained with the sole purpose of providing proper education for the Sri Lankan students living in Qatar. These students cant afford education in other schools due to high tuition fees. 
Myself and 15 Sri Lankans funded this institution in 2001 to help out our community here. We developed a constitution and the school is operated by the Board of Trustees, which comprises Sri Lankans. In keeping with the Qatar Law we cant have full ownership of the institution, but since a Qatari volunteer offered us help we were able to get the school registered as a community school under the commercial registration no: 40169, hence it is at present under the full ownership of Yousuf Ahamad Al Feraidon. However, Al Feraidon nor any other member of the Board of Trustees is claiming dividends, Fonseka said. 
According to Fonseka, Ambassador Liyanage claims that the school is raising money unlawfully and he is also not happy with how the school operates. These are reasons which led him (Ambassador) to get the bank accounts frozen and report the school to the Labour Department and Education Ministry in Qatar. 
When the Ambassador visited the Education Ministry on August 15 to lodge the complaint I too accompanied him. Liyanage wanted the officials to visit the school the following day, but the school was being refurbished due to the vacation, I wanted the officials to come on a later date and they visited the school on the 26th. The officials were happy regarding the facilities provided for the students and they too were surprised as to why the Ambassador is making such allegations. Later, on September 28, Liyanage had visited the Qatar Labour Department to complain against the school employing Sri Lankans who dont have work visas. He had also complained that the salaries paid to them was done violating the labour laws of that country. The Sri Lankans, who come to Qatar with their spouses visa, after marriage, are given employment by our school just to make them earn money. Whatever we have done we have not gone against the Qatari Law as we are law abiding citizens, Fonseka added.
Liyanage refutes allegations
However, refuting the allegations made, Ambassador Liyanage said that he had acted in the best possible manner to prevent Sri Lankans getting involved in any frauds. This school has been registered as a community school and how can a community school earn such a huge amount of money amounting to Qatari Riyals 8 million This school is sponsored by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Qatar and the sole responsibility of this school lies with the Ambassador. If frauds are taking place, as the Sri Lankan Envoy, it is my obligation to get involved and prevent the Board of Trustees from generating money fraudulently, the Ambassador told theDailymirror.
When asked as to why he got the school bank account frozen and lodged complaints with the Qatar Education Ministry and Labour Department against the school, Ambassador Liyanage said that it was done on a written request by the Foreign Ministry in Colombo. 
One of the former Secretaries advised me in writing to freeze the accounts and to report the school to the relevant departments, which I carried out. There are 16 members in the Board of Trustees and they are functioning from the inception of this school which is illegal. Members of the Board of Trustees have to change once in every three years. The Sri Lankan Embassy cant allow these administrators to collect money unlawfully. President Maithripala Sirisena is due to visit Qatar on a two-day visit on October 25 and after this visit the Foreign Ministry in Colombo is going to take stern action against this school, Ambassador Liyanage said.

Embarrassing behavior
Meanwhile, Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, Presidents Senior Advisor and Insurance Ombudsman, who holds the written authority from the Board of Trustees of Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha to act on their behalf in Sri Lanka, said that this school is operated and managed as a private institution with no intervention or involvement of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Qatar. 
Chairman Fonseka transferred the sponsorship of the school from the Qatari Sponsor to the Sri Lankan Embassy in 2010 to retain the Sri Lankan identity. The then Ambassador Wijesiri Padukka issued and addendum to the school constitution and through a power of attorney, dated December 12, 2010, empowered the Trust Chairman with the power to operate the school. Despite this, it is disheartening to know as to how the present Ambassador is trying to take the law unto his hands and harass the Sri Lankan community there, which will in turn make an adverse impact on the country in the eyes of other foreign missions in Qatar. Being a former Ambassador, I have acted in the best interest of our people and had never interfered with private institutions, Dr. Weerasooria claimed.
Dr. Weerasooria further said how Ambassador Liyanage recently told him that President Sirisena had telephoned the Emir of Qatar to make a request to hold an inquiry regarding the schools management. 
Liyange had told the same to a senior official at the Foreign office in Colombo. I have high regard for the President and I know how he follows protocol. He would not call the Emir of Qatar directly without informing the Foreign Office. When I told Liyange that I am going to ask the President whether he phoned up the Emir, Liyanage immediately wanted me to forget what he said and not to raise it with the President. This Ambassador is lying and even the Prime Minister knows well that Liyanage is not a Foreign Ministry appointee, but a mere political appointee. His behavior has embarrassed the carrier diplomats, Dr. Weerasoria said. Dr. Weerasooria further accused Liyanage of leveling allegations against the Board of Trustees. What does Liyanage know about a Trust I am known and involved in Trust work and know how it operates. This is an established trust and all members are professionals, Dr. Weerasoria added.

After the conclusion of the evidence of former Governor Arjuna Mahendran, the Commission called Chief Dealer of PTL, Nuwan Salgado before the Commission to question him on a document which he is said to have maintained in his computer on the instructions of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
It was revealed that Chief Dealer of PTL, Nuwan Salgado had maintained a document in his computer relating to the payment allocations made by PTL channeled through its other related companies (Perpetual Asset Management, W.M. Mendis & Company and Perpetual Capital) to informants referred by three code names.
Charlie, Tango and Car had been used as code names by Nuwan Salgado in his document.
This Document reflected several fund transactions made by PTL since July 17, 2014 to March 10, 2015.
This document had been submitted by the Attorney Generals Department to the Commission by way of an affidavit of the witness, which was sworn on October 3, 2017.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke questioned the witness.
DSG Milinda Gunatilleke: What did this document record
Witness Salgado: It reflects payments made by PTL time to time to its related companies
DSG: What are the companies in the group that are mentioned in the document
Witness Salgado: Perpetual Asset Management, W.M. Mendis & Company and Perpetual Capital
DSG: For what were these payments made by PTL to its group companies
W: When I was asked to maintain such a file, I was asked to update it under three categories, which I mentioned on the right hand side in the document. Whenever I had to update payments from PTL to its group companies, I updated it under these names.
DSG: It was for those individuals, right
W: That was my understanding
DSG: What were the names you mentioned in the document
W: Charlie, Car and Tango
DSG: So, there are three names to which payments have been made by PTL through its related group companies bearing those three code names, right
W: Yes
DSG: How are they described as per this document There are described as informant in this document, right
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Why there is a specific word referred to as informant
W: That is something I put to the document when preparing it, which I shouldnt have done.
Justice Jayawardena: Whose Document is this
W: This is the document that I maintained and Kasun Palisena wanted me to update, which I did.
Justice Jayawardena: Was Kasun Palisena aware of this document
W: He was aware of it.
J: Was he aware of this word informant
W: I dont think he was aware but I had e-mailed this document to him, so he might have seen that.
J: So, therefore, he could have seen that this word informant had been used in the document, right
W: Yes
DSG Milinda Gunatilleke: Now, in the dealing room, you and other dealers including Kasun Palisena had referred to an individual called as Charlie, right
W: Yes
DSG: Who was that
W: For the dealing purposes, we named the primary contact person of the EPF in dealing as Charlie. Time to time the individuals from the EPF may have changed but that code name remained the same.
DSG: So, up to September 2015 it was Mr. Udayaseelan and thereafter it was Mr. Saman Kumara, right
W: Yes
DSG: Why were these code names used
W: Code names were used in the dealing room for the purpose of anonymity, because brokers and other counter parties may be in the lines.
DSG: So, could these individuals referred in code names, had provided inside information in relation to bond trading
W: I dont know exactly the payments were made. But in the way this document was asked to be maintained and what I understood from the discussions I had with Kasun Palisena, they were tracking certain information. I thought these were considerations for giving inside information about treasury bonds.
DSG: Can you identify the individuals referred to as Tango and Car in this document
W: No
DSG: Were they similar individuals to whom you referred to as Charlie
W: In my view, yes.
DSG: You had also used the name Little Johnny from time to time when dealing, right
W: Yes. Mostly it refers to ETF (Employees Trust Fund) but we also used that name Little Johnny to call Kaveen Karunamurthi as well.
DSG: Mr. Karunamurthi was the dealer at DFCC when the switches were done between PTL and NSB, right
W: Yes
DSG: There is a code name used as Wolverine, right
W: Yes
DSG: Who was that
W: We used it to refer the primary contact person of the NSB. And at that time it was Naveen Anuradha
DSG: Have you updated this document further
W: Yes, there should be a further updated document
This Document only reflected several payments made by PTL since July 17, 2014 to March 10, 2015.
DSG: Where would that be
W: In my Computer
DSG: Now this document reflects a series of payments, right
W: Yes
DSG: The last payment of this document is referring to Charlie, right
W: Yes
DSG: That payment happened on March 10, 2015, right (After the controversial bond auction which took place on February 27, 2015)
W: Yes, basically I updated this document.
DSG: On instructions of whom
W: Kasun Palisena.
DSG: So, you said that after this date you have updated this document and that document would have the rest of the details, right
W: Yes
DSG: What was the amount paid
W: Rs. 3 million
At this moment DSG Gunatilleke played new voice recording, where Nuwan Salgado and Kasuna Palisenas voices are evident as a background discussion.
DSG: What was Kasun Palisena telling you
W: He was telling me to offer Charlie the 30.
Then the DSG continued to play that voice recording in which Nuwan Salgado was speaking to EPF dealer Udayaseelan regarding a deal which was settled in the Lanka Settle System in June 2015.
DSG: Now up to September, the person PTL referred to as Charlie was Udayaseelan, right
W: Yes
DSG: Then after the month of September, if PTL was referring to an individual at EPF as Charlie who could that be
W: It is Saman Kumara
Thereafter Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness with regard to this document maintained by him.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Now, you maintained this document on whose behalf
W: On Kasun Palisenas behalf
Justice Jayawardena: That means on behalf of PTL, right
W: That I do not know exactly. Kasun would know why he asked me to maintain such a document.
Justice Jayawardena: This is the document maintained on the instructions of the CEO of PTL, right
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: How exactly were these payments realized. It says payer is PTL and payee is Perpetual Asset Management or W.M. Mendis & Company or Perpetual Capital What was the mechanism used
W: These were outflows of the investments these related group companies held with PTL.
J: So, does that mean that PTL used money they invested under Perpetual Asset Management or W.M. Mendis & Company or Perpetual Capital
W: No. The related companies invest with PTL,
J: PTL use part of that money to these payments
W: Not that we --PTL -- use part of it. This is them requesting us to send money from the investment of those related companies themselves.
J: So, how do you know that the money went to the informant
W: That I dont know; whether these payments exactly went to that person. I was asked to update those payments under three categories, which I did.
J: So, according to this document, there were payments to a person named as Charlie, right
W: Yes
J: This is fairly a large amount of money over a period of time, right
W: Yes
J: Considering the payments made to Charlie; reflected as per this document, do you think that all of that money was paid to him
W: I assume so.
J: When did you join PTL
W: From the inception.
J: These details show, that from July 17, 2014, very shortly after PTL started operating as a Primary Dealer, PTL have been paying an informant named as Charlie a sum of money Rs. 97 million (During July 17, 2014 March 10, 2015). Was that correct
W: Yes
J: According to the name Charlie it was EPFs Udayaseelan, right
W: Yes
J: Was PTL actively dealing with EPF at that time
W: Yes
J: If Charlie is Udayaseelan then PTL was obtaining inside information from Charlie from the entirety of 2014, was that correct
W: If the person referred to as Charlie had not been changed by EPF in 2014 that is correct.
J: Now, between July 17, 2014 and December 30, 2014, there are 18 payments amounting to Rs. 94 million made to Charlie, right
W: Yes
J: And that period is outside of our mandated area, which was the time that Mr. Nivard Cabral was the Governor of CBSL, right
W: Yes
J: We are interested in the payments that are within our mandated time period starting from February, 2015 to 2016. So, did this pattern continue
W: Yes
J: Now, PTL allocating payments to their informants continued in 2015 and thereafter as well, is that what you are saying
W: Assuming yes
J: Do you know who were Tango and Car
W: No
J: Would they be state institutions
W: That I dont know
J: Tango and Car were also receiving payments from 2014, right
W: Yes
J: So, then basically, from the start of PTL in 2014, they were paying informants and it was a large amount of money.
Witness was silent
			Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Now, between July 17, 2014 and December 30, 2014, there are 18 payments amounting to Rs. 94 million made to Charlie, right
			Witness Nuwan Salgado: Yes
			Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: And that period is outside of our mandated area, which was the time that Mr. Nivard Cabral was the Governor of CBSL, right
			Witness Nuwan Salgado: Yes
			Justice Jayawardena: We are interested in the payments that are within our mandated time period starting from February, 2015 to 2016. So, did this pattern continue
			Witness Salgado: Yes
			Justice Jayawardena: Now, PTL allocating payments to their informants continued in 2015 and thereafter as well, is that what you are saying
			Witness Salgado: Assuming yes

HANDUN VILLAS - Hundred years of Colonial living
	
Talalla- on the sun-baked Southern coast, is a small fishing village, just 14 kilometres off Matara. Talalla Bay is one of the attractive stretches of beaches, yet ignored by most of the beach lovers and travellers.
Adding glamour to this unrevealed calm and quiet place, where the rhythm of typical Sri Lankan countryside flair continues, Handun Villas is a blessing for true nature lovers.
Located amidst a ten acre land of coconut, mango, jack and other fruit trees, just opposite the Tallala Bay off the main Mataratangalle main road, Handun Villas is a 122year old colonial manor (ancient walauwa) built in 1895 with a touch of authentic Sri Lankan Dutch grandeur.
For the serene holiday seeker, Handun Villas is the perfect getaway with the scenic natural Talalla Bay on the opposite side and rural village setup from the other sides. Based around an ancient walauwa, it has been restored to its original glory and was opened in June 2017. Handun Villas was named to celebrate its history, derived from Handunnetti, the name of the family, whose ancestral home it is. This Villa project is the brain child of the present owner Ranesh Handunnetti and managed by Naomi Handunnetti.
The villas, built on an open plan, provide privacy in a simple, comfortable setting that enhances the guests connection to the beautiful natural surroundings. The surrounding garden filled with lush greenery, giant squirrels, monkeys, number of peacock and other birds , all the best that nature has to offer said Naomi Handunnetti, the Director of the property.
Handun Villas, a place to embrace nature and return revived, is equipped with amenities that enhance the bliss of relaxation starting from the all-natural luxury spa, to the restaurant that serves divine island cuisine.
As guests arrive, they are welcomed into the history of the mansion followed by the traditional lighting of an oil lamp, a prayer and finally be treated to a cool herbal or a king coconut drink that takes away the heat and travel stress explained Naomi about the typical Sothern hospitality practice. Handun Villas has eight rooms -two in the main walauwa and six built in two clusters.
Kohomba is a superior deluxe room with Dutch inspired architecture and is located in the main house. This room also has a private verandah and a courtyard. Karanda is deluxe room with a private verandah and a courtyard. Sepalika, Soorya and Kurundu are three deluxe rooms with a garden view.
Mai Mara, Kiri Palu and Hal Milla are three standard rooms with a garden view. Comparatively, these three rooms are smaller than the rest.
All rooms are equipped with modern amenities including satellite TV, a safe, bathtub and rain shower, complimentary toiletries, mini fridge, A/C, free Wi-fi and complimentary tea/ coffee making facilities.
Adding a touch of home living, the dining room and lounge open onto a long rear verandah overlooking the swimming pool and the back yard.
Handun Villas offers more than accommodation and cuisine. They offer you an experience. Designed with complete comfort and luxury living, Handun Villas offer traditional dining practice to its guests. The cuisine too is authentic Sri Lankan, but we are geared to cater to any kind of global food she added.
This is a family destination. Triple room occupancy could be arranged. Almost every room is designed to suit family requirements and it is a home away from home said Damian Casiechetty, the Manager of the Retreat. Aware that health starts from the inside, Handun Villas prepares its cuisine with care.
Guests can sample delicious fruit juices and fresh salads at the juice and salad bar, or enjoy a meal made of garden-fresh, home-grown vegetables from the propertys farm. The child-friendly menu will keep little ones taste buds happy, while parents can choose to enjoy a more sophisticated fine dining experience. In keeping with its authenticity, celebration of culture, and immersion in the islands heritage, visitors can learn how to cook Sri Lankan meals. Also our authentic Ayurvedha spa, stocked with high-quality organic products made especially for it, emphasizes the focus on wellness Naomi said.
Talalla is accessible via the Southern Highway and is a great place to explore from. Uda Walawe, Yala Kataragama, Mulkirigala and hot water wells at Suriya Wewa, the Waulpane Caves are in close proximity.
Deep sea fishing is a favourite pastime in Talalla. It is an ideal place for exploring shipwrecks, snorkeling and watching whales, in addition to water sports.

HSBC tops Asiamoneys New Silk Road Finance Awards
	

HSBC has been named Best Overall International Bank for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the inaugural Asiamoney New Silk Road Finance Awards, reflecting the banks commitment to being the leading financial partner to clients engaged in Belt and Road projects.
At an awards ceremony in Beijing earlier this week, Asiamoney also recognised HSBC as the:
Best Bank for BRI-Related Infrastructure Finance in Southeast Asia
	Best Bank for BRI-Related Infrastructure Finance inSouth Asia
	Best Bank for BRI-Related Finance in Central & Eastern Europe
	Best International Bank for BRI in the Middle East & Africa
The US$ 2 billion Gemas-Johor Bahru Double-Tracking Rail Project, part of the Kunming-Singapore Rail Link, was also awarded Best Overall Project/Initiative for BRI. HSBC was mandated as the principal bank to the project, providing comprehensive trade finance, cash management and foreign exchange services.
Peter Wong, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, commented: We are proud to win this recognition from Asiamoney. HSBCs universal banking model and global network means that we are uniquely positioned to meet all of our clients financial needs as they engage in Belt and Road-related business. We believe the Belt and Road will create a wealth of opportunities for our clients and we look forward to providing them with outstanding services across financing, advisory, risk management and
transaction banking.
In its coverage of the award for Best Overall International Bank for BRI, Asiamoney said: HSBC was undoubtedly a worthy winner this year. It has always straddled continents, starting life financing trade between Asia and Europe. The bank has Belt and Road in its DNA. This pedigree has long been an advantage to HSBC, but it now looks more valuable than ever before.
HSBC was also recognised at the ceremony for its leadership in offshore Renminbi (RMB) services, having been voted Best Overall Provider of Offshore RMB Products and Services in Asiamoneys Offshore Poll 2017 for the sixth consecutive year. The Bank also claimed a series of Asiamoneys awards for banking in different Asian markets, including Best International Bank in China.
Mark Prothero, CEO of HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives commented, Sri Lankas location advantage combined with the strategic expertise and the network capability of HSBC sets the perfect stage for the country to reap the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative. We have been in Sri Lanka for over 125 years and have actively supported the development of the countrys infrastructure. The recent Sinosure-supported financing of the renovation of the countrys main runway at Bandaranaike International Airport, through the state authority that manages the airport, is one of the most recent examples.

I will prove that Duminda is not sick, says Hirunika
	
Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra yesterday claimed she was ready to get a team of doctors to prove that Duminda Silva, who is presently in the prison hospital, was not suffering from any illness at all.
She said she had repeatedly said that Mr. Silva was not ailing and that a team of doctors had proved that fact. I have said from day one Mr. Silva is not sick. I saw him being taken to the eye hospital in a wheelchair. He has no ailment in his stomach or legs as he has claimed. I am ready to get a team of doctors to examine him in order to prove that he is fit as can be. I have an impartial team of doctors in the prison hopital to do so, she said.
She told a news conference that Mr. Silva who was fit enough to be able to come to court when called upon to do so, had suddenly fallen ill after being imprisoned.
Refering to the defamation case filed by MP Udaya Gammanpila, she said she did not attend the court hearing with regard to the case filed by Mr. Gammanpila as she did not get a court summons. I did not get any notice sent to my present address. So I could not attend the court hearings and the court has given an
ex-parte decision. Now I have received notice to my present address giving me a weeks time to explain the reason for my failure to appear. Now I am ready to continue the case. I have explained my reasons for not appearing in court on that date. I would like the case to be heard again. I will win the case and show that what I said was true, she said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Marching towards home where our children are The second in a series of articles delving into our loc
	
What is great about our local theatre  Sinhala and Tamil  is that its so relevant and contemporary. It has always strived to extrapolate, to think beyond the present and to predict whats out there, whats unforeseeable. Its not sustained by nostalgia, although theres enough and more of that, too: one of the more inscrutable qualities about our playwrights is that they are as adamantly reverent of their veterans as they are disdainful of the conception of the medium those veterans idealised. The latter were in turn dejected by the ennui of sticking to one form of the theatre, which is why they absorbed from new playwrights from elsewhere and which is why we evolved rather quickly after 1956, even more so, in fact, than the cinema, which for 20 years remained with Lester James Peries, and literature, which for 10 years remained with Martin Wickramasinghe. It didnt take long for Sarachchandra to be upended by Sugathapala de Silva, in turn to be followed by Gunawardena, Premaranjith Tilakaratne, Nawagaththegama, and Bandaranayake.
That our schoolboys idealise serious plays about serious themes and ideas which make people laugh indicates, not surprisingly, how idiosyncratic we are about the social and the personal, the relevant and the irreverent, with respect to the Sinhala theatre. In Preston Sturgess beautiful screwball comedy Sullivans Travels our hero, a director of escapist, shallow musicals and comedies, defiantly leaves Hollywood to lead a life of penury so that he can direct socially relevant dramas.
Along the way he meets a girl who loves comedies and in particular those directed by the hero; he questions her choices and asks whether the world has spurned comedies at a time of depression and squalor (Dont you think with the world in its present condition, with death snarling at you from every street corner, that people are a little allergic to comedies), only to be given the defiant reply, No. Laughter is the best medicine, the only antidote, which can convey serious themes without wringing controversy. It gets us to think, to reflect, without those contortions and distortions typical of any art form when made to be facilely courageous and profound. 
In terms of ideology we have moved beyond both Sarachchandra  who stood for an ideology of moral, religious upliftment  and Sugathapala de Silva  who stood for an ideology of commitment  and we have even passed the seventies and eighties and nineties, when Sinhala theatre was for the most the prerogative of the Political Left. Its interesting to note that our generation, and todays schoolchildren, tend to affirm and side with actors, scriptwriters, directors, and producers who can make us laugh without cutting corners. Its not the kind of humour you come across at a conventional tea party comedy of manners. The closest our English theatre can and does get to such a form of humour is when its own actors relapse into the vernacular, sleekly and efficiently: many of the skits in IdeaCouchs The Garage Show contain this quality, for instance. 
Its not the kind of humour you come across at a conventional tea party comedy of manners
But then theres humour and theres humour, the one forced and contrived, the other natural and spontaneous. In the theatre spontaneity is almost always the consequence of preparation, not improvisation. Its hard to improvise on stage because its live, not because its impossible, and in comedy what matters is the correct timing, the correct cue. Of the two broadly definable genres onstage, therefore, comedy is the default quality of the medium.
This is not because its greater or lesser than drama, but because its easier to make people laugh out of a tragedy gone wrong than it is to wring tears out of a comedy gone wrong. (In fact very few comedies ever go wrong; they are the result of either careful planning or careless miscalculation.) Humour is always felt, never expressly projected, which is why our political satires are so shallow. They always resort to the same tricks and dichotomies: the big fat nationalist versus the young, bespectacled, idealistic understudy, one which our English playwrights allude to frequently as well.


But then theres humour and theres humour, the one forced and contrived, the other natural and spontaneous
	Its not the kind of humour you come across at a conventional tea party comedy of manners
	The message is potent, in a vague way, which is why some of these symbols and caricatures evoke laughter, sometimes intentionally, often not
	The new theatre, which these boys idealise, is provocative but spontaneous, aware of its own falsifications but not overtly joyful about it
	One that involves music and dance and laughter and at the same time provokes you to think


And then theres the issue of novelty versus banality: its much easier to keep audiences here transfixed on comedies and skits that obsess over the same form of slapstick (the wrong accent, the wrong costume for the wrong gender, a play-within-a-play gone horribly wrong because of miscast actors, etc.), and its much easier for a drama, in that sense, to become obscurantist (which, incidentally, can be said of our films too, especially our art-house avant-garde films). In the former instance what comes out is a contorted but refreshing form of novelty: weve seen the same slapstick routines in other plays before, but we are alright with it; in the latter instance what comes out is banality: the same themes, once reworked, induce boredom, indifference, sometimes anger. 
Part of the reason why our playwrights turn political and resort to symbols and caricatures is that, obviously, they want to circumvent censorship. The more direct they are, the more likely it is that the Censor Board (a remnant of the past if ever there was one) will censure and block it. Directness is the preserve of the madly honest, and our political playwrights are for the most not mad, only honest. The capitalist is Big and Fat, the worker Thin and Sallow.
(I capitalise these terms because the producers do a pretty good job of doing so onstage as well, without spelling them out overtly to audiences.) In Jayantha Chandrasiris Mora the titular protagonist is shot at in the end, but doesnt die. Why Because the truth cant die: it survives and grows. Likewise the Dragon in Makarakshaya dies off only to be replaced by the Burgomaster; we have so many dragons, but many more Burgomasters.
The message is potent, in a vague way, which is why some of these symbols and caricatures evoke laughter, sometimes intentionally, often not. A few plays do, with extraordinary resolve, keep us transfixed and deeply depressed throughout  some of Bandaranayakes plays, like Trojan Kanathawo, are like that  but they are unfortunately rare. Rajitha Dissanayakes POLITICAL plays are more the rule than the exception here, since they subsist on a contrapuntal mixture of anger and laughter.
His best intentions are undone by what those intentions lead up to, a point summed up by my friend Dhanuka Bandara: I strongly feel that he has much more to offer, a fact that his older plays attest to. Again, this goes back to my earlier contention: in any art form, especially in the theatre, comedy is the default form of expression, not tragedy, because tragedy is the consequence of meticulous planning, while comedy can both be planned and also undo the most carefully constructed dramas. Theres a name for this latter phenomenon, by the way: bathos. 
Our schoolboys and schoolgirls believe that theres something new and innovative and exciting about plays that make you laugh and make you think about people who live without homes and sanitation and even employment, at the same time, because they are fascinated by whats being staged and also repelled by the way these articulate their intentions. They want something new out of what they believe is already new.
They are the new purveyors, who are enamoured of what their predecessors do but want to go beyond. Beyond what I asked one of these schoolboys the other day. Momentarily stymied, he finally settled on an answer: One that involves music and dance and laughter and at the same time provokes you to think. A play that does all that is pretty much like a film that eventually becomes a parody of its own genre. The new theatre, which these boys idealise, is provocative but spontaneous, aware of its own falsifications but not overtly joyful about it. That conversation, incidentally, got me talking with two other boys, more specifically about the kind of plays they not only like but also write.


Both these boys had, in fact, scripted their own plays at their school (note: very few children take to scripting these days: they prefer acting, naturally I suppose). One delved into a stock tragicomic situation: a dying family elder being fought over by his prodigal sons and daughters (the undercurrents of tension and hilarity were there). The other too presented a stock situation: three men, all three two-faced and duplicitous, on a boat. But while they are, in a manner of speaking, stock, their treatment at the hands of these young scriptwriters bespeak to a higher sense of self-confidence in them: theres no proper resolution in either production, and the fact of there not being a proper resolution compels both laughter and reflection, the amalgamation of which, as we all know, is pathos (in Sinhala, lreKdrih). Pathos has always been fresh, current, relevant, because it stands against both indifferent humour and over-the-top seriousness.
Why its so hard to come by and why our children find it difficult to engage with it, is a completely different topic I intend to explore
For all their intentions and efforts, however, these boys are doomed to forego on their conception of the theatre, not because theyre discouraged from engaging in those conceptions but because theyre institutionally discouraged from indulging in the theatre in the first place. There are reasons for this, clearly. Pathos has almost never been the preserve of the Wendt because the Wendites, as I pointed out last week, are content in being formally conservative and facilely novel, a sensibility that lacks that revolutionary streak and tongue-in-cheek daring to be found in your typical Sinhala stage production. Its a new way of looking at old themes and ideas, a new way of looking at the world, in fact. Why its so hard to come by, and why our children find it difficult to engage with it, is a completely different topic, one which I intend to explore.

Police said a group of six men including the two victims had been cutting Kumbuk trees illegally and had hid behind some bushes when a group of three hunters had passed by.
Investigations revealed that the hunters had shot at the bushes after hearing noises and assuming there were wild boars behind the bushes.

He said such a network would work hand in hand with the Air Forces Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems that will be modernized to better improve maritime domain awareness.This would also lead to a better centralised command, control and intelligence structure to develop enhanced situational awareness., Mr. Waidyaratne said.
He said air assets remained a prime choice when responding to security threats, due to its inherent advantages of height, speed and reach. It has become the number one choice to call upon by many governments. As seen during our conflict and natural disasters, the first response were from our air assets. It is under this rationale that we wish to develop our air capabilities both in traditional and non-traditional spheres, the secretary further added.

We do not know what will happen in the future. However, it is necessary to find the real culprits. The PCoI has continued its proceedings for nine months. Many bigwigs of this government including the former finance minister have been summoned before the PCoI during this period, he added.
He said that United National Party (UNP) Chairman Malik Samarawickrama and its General Secretary Kabir Hashim also recently arrived at the PCoI and added that the proceedings were quite different at the PCoI on that day compared to the other days; No cross-examination had been done, he added.
