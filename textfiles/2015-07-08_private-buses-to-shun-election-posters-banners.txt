	Private buses would not be allowed to use election propaganda banners and posters on them for the upcoming general elections, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) said today.
	“If any candidate or political party did so, action will be taken to remove them with the help of the Police after informing the Elections Commissioner,” LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
	“A special written request had been made by the Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya on deploying private buses to transport ballot boxes and nearly 1000 buses have been reserved to serve the election duties,” he said.
	“We understand that more buses would be used by the Elections Department instead of other vehicles,” Mr. Wijeratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
