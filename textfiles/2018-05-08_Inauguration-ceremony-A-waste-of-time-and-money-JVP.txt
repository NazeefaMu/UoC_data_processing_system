JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake today claimed that the ceremony herelding the inauguration of Parliament was a waste of time and money and said they had requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to reveal the cost of yesterday's ceremony.

He said the President had not presented any fresh action plan and they did not view this as a useful move.

"Nothing new will happen even after the inauguration of parliament," he said.

The MP said Parliament was prorogued by the President to resolve the crisis in his party and it only led to a delay in carrying out parliamentary business.

"About 1,000 oral questions and 1,000 petitions had to be postponed because of the prorogation," he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
