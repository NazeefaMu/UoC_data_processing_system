Six more suspects, aged between 27 and 36, who were allegedly involved in the cruel killing of an eagle in Galle, were arrested by the Habaraduwa Police yesterday.

The Police said the suspects were remanded till today after being produced before the Galle Magistrate’s Court yesterday.

A photograph in which some men are seen killing an eagle in an inhumane manner after plucking its feathers and cutting off its claws went viral earlier this month.

Measures were taken to nab the culprits for animal slaughter under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (No.22) of 2009, the police said.

Earlier two suspects, both residents of Kaduruduwa, were arrested by the police in connection with the incident.
Commenting on the matter, two wildlife organizations, Freedom Sri Lanka Foundation and the Let Them Live said the eagle is an endangered and protected species and could not be killed or sold. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
