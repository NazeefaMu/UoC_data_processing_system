All soft drinks will have mandatory colour codes given by the Health Ministry following a gazette notification, with effect from August.

The taxes applied for the sugar production would also be increased, the ministry stated.

According to the colour codes - if the soft drink with 100 ml contains sugar higher than 11g, theRed colour should be used on the surface and if the sugar amount is between 2g and 11g, the Yellow colour should be displayed.

The soft drinks with the same 100 ml that contains less than 2g are required to display Green colour.

The purpose of the decision is to educate the public and subsequently reduce the sugar amount in their bodies to control non-communicable diseases.
