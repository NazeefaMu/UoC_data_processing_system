The Colombo Magistrate’s Court today ordered the television stations which covered UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra’s news briefing -- on the abduction of a man at Dematagoda -- to hand over their video footage to the Police.
This order was given in sequent to a motion filed by the Wellampitiya Police requesting that the video footage of the news briefing be handed over to them to be forwarded to the Attorney General’s Department.
The Magistrate also ordered that the suspect -- whose wife is alleged to have had a relationship with the abducted man – be placed in a separate cell. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
