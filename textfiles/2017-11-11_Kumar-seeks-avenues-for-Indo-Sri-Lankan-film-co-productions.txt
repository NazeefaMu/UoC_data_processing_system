Kumar seeks avenues for Indo-Sri Lankan  film co-productions


	



Indian filmmaker P. Suneel Kumar Reddy was here last week, seeking avenues for Indo-Sri Lankan film co-productions.  


He has a broader vision of bringing together talent from SAARC countries in film 
making projects.  


On his initial visit to Sri Lanka, Suneel Kumar was accompanied by his producer, Y. Ravindra Babu.  
Both are from the state of Andra Pradesh (part of which is now called Telengana) and have been friends from their days as students of mechanical engineering. Only Ravindra Babu is now employed in a related field, Suneel Kumar having opted for journalism and film making after graduating as a mechanical engineer. Having worked as a Telugu-language newspaper editor, he calls himself a journalist with film as his ‘medium.’ In addition to film making, he now teaches film making and conducts workshops.

  
This duo have been in the film making business together for 17 years. They make films under the Sravya Film Company label. They have made films in Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.  

 



 

Suneel Kumar has made 16 features so far, including children’s films. He was in Sri Lanka with a children’s film venture in mind, an adventure story with special effects and actors from both countries.  


Self-taught as a film maker, he makes both commercial films with those fight and dance sequences common to the subcontinent’s films as well those with more serious content. His 2010 film ‘Gangaputhrulu’ won 18 state awards including best director and best dialogue writer.  


In Indian film making, dialogue writing is taken very seriously and is a separate profession. Suneel Kumar writes his own scripts as well as dialogue.  


“As people, we have the same emotions no matter where we come from. I see film as a unifying matter,”said Suneel Kumar.  His latest film ‘Gulf’ is about the hopes of those who seek a way out of poverty through Mideast employment. It tells the story of a young weaver who can’t make enough in this traditional craft.  


As he puts it: “there are many success stories and also some failures in this region. This film intends to discuss various case studies in an entertaining fashion.” 

 
His 2012 film ‘Oka Romantic Crime Kata” was about how the young take to crime. It was a box office success and he is now making the sequel, titled ‘Romantic Criminals.’  


He tackled a topical socio-economic issue in his film ‘ATM Working,’ which was about the Government’s demonitisation decision which wiped out the savings of millions of Indians.  


 

Suneel Kumar has made 16 features so far, including children’s films. He was in Sri Lanka with a children’s film venture in mind, an adventure story with special effects and actors from both countries



‘The original title was ‘ATM Not Working,’ Kumar said. ‘But the censor board objected and we had to change the title,” he reflected. 


Suneel Kumar is an articulate filmmaker keen on expanding his horizons beyond the borders of India.
