Expolanka Freight Ltd (EFL) announced a three-year sponsorship agreement with the historic Havelock Sports Club with the objective of supporting the successful rugby club and developing the sport of rugby in Sri Lanka.

Speaking to the media at a press conference announcing the agreement, Saif Yusoof, Managing Director of EFL Sri Lanka said the company is excited to sponsor one of the country’s oldest rugby teams.

“EFL has long been involved in the development of football in Sri Lanka, and we wish to extend this support to rugby as well – one of the renowned sports in the country. Our new partnership with Havelock Sports Club will no doubt help us immensely in this regard, and we look forward to what the future holds for both the team and the game,” he said.

Havelock Sports Club President Romesh Abeywickrema shares Yusoof’s enthusiasm and vision for the future to take Sri Lankan rugby – and sports in general – to the next level.

“At Havies, we always strive to improve our game while also improving rugby standards in Sri Lanka. Partnering with EFL, I feel, is definitely a step in the right direction, and will strengthen us further in our drive to become one of the best teams in the region,” he said.

Yusoof further said that the company wishes for its international clients to experience Sri Lankan culture as well as Havelock Sports Club’s rich history as a result of the sponsorship. 

The Havelock Sports Club dates back well over a century. Formed in 1915, the original Havies comprised 27 school boys from 12 to 16 years of age – all of whom resided in the vicinity of the Havelock Park. Together the boys formed a club and named it Havelock Sports Club, and the rest, as they say, is history.

“Our presence in Sri Lankan rugby – and sport in general – is deeply rooted in Colombo’s colourful past, and the experience we have gathered over the past century as a club will no doubt prove to be a great asset for EFL in their plans to further develop the game,” said Romesh

“Pioneering clubs like Havelocks that has existed for 103 years need corporate support to survive in a highly competitive professional environment, and the corporate community must focus on sustaining popular sports as part of their social responsibility which ultimately brings out the best in our youth and also fosters the future generation of this country through sport,” addedSammy Akbar, Director of 3PL and Freeport, EFL.
