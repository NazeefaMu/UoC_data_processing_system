Police in a hard fought 24-7 win over Air Force

 
Police SC romped to a rather underperformed win against a fighting Air Force outfit by 24 points (2 tries, 2 conversions) to 7 (1 try, 1 conversion) in their Dialog 'A' Division inter-club league rugby match played at Air Force grounds, Ratmalana yesterday.
The winners led 7-nil at the breather.
Police got their act together and the momentum rather late in the second half by scoring a total of four tries to which the Air Force replied with only one.
For Police flanker Chanaka Harishchandra opened scoring and the other tries came from flanker Radeesha Seneviratna, Joel Perera with nippy scrum half Sudan Sooriarachchi touching down for the final try off a brilliant three quarter move. Full back Reeza Mubarak put over two conversions.
The solitary try for Air Force was scored by their full back Nuwan Perera who also made the conversion. He had an outstanding game with his booming kicks to touch to go along with his safe collection and sizzling runs down the line while also manning the last line of defence.
Army trounce CH 50-6
In another game played at the Army grounds in Diyagama the rejuvenated Army side virtually thrashed the hapless CH and FC by 50 points (8 tries, 5 conversions) to 6 (2 penalties). Army led 17-3 at lemons. - (WAI)
