Art for art's sake!

Seven artists came together bound to each other by their love of art and sculpture aided by the Lionel Wendt. Their artistic creations are testimony to their talent and their perseverance. Coming from various walks of life they have such passion for art!
Each year in November the Lionel Wendt holds what they call the 'Festival of Art' where they give the gallery free for a collective exhibition of Art and Sculpture. Here they feature art exhibitions for groups of artists who cannot have an exhibition by themselves. The whole aim is to promote art. Here the gallery and theatre is given free. These young artists can have the gallery to themselves for five days.
These young artists really cannot afford to have a permanent exhibition in Colombo elsewhere except on the road. Lionel Wendt Art center is there to promote art and theatre in Sri Lanka. They want to help these artists.
"We are there to promote art and we do not take any commissions from anyone. When they sell all their money is for them," said Lionel Wendt Memorial Fund, Administrative Secretary, Dilrukshi Rambukwelle. These fine young artists are namely - Dileepa, Chammika, Kusal, Sajeewani, Teklan, Chandana and Morayas
"Normally a set up like this would cost around Rs. 18,000. But the Lionel Wendt is giving it to us for free. The Lionel Wendt wants to promote art in Sri Lanka and the artists here are those who have passed out from the University of Aesthetic studies and Vibhavi Academy. The artists here have academic knowledge of this vocation. They are full time artists. However all the artists here differ in their style and subject matter. In this exhibition four of us feature works of art and two of us feature sculpture," said Chammika Jayawardana.
Chammika feels that there is a certain threat when it comes to this industry. At a very young age boys and girls are told that their drawings are ugly. After that the child becomes disillusioned and gives up drawing pictures and gives up practicing."If you take my works they are small but capture minute details. It is all about precision and hard work. The picture I draw reflects my mood and my sense of color. In all our pictures there is a certain European influence. All of us have been trained in sculpture as well even though only Chandana and Morayas feature sculptures in this exhibition. The rest of us feature all paintings. Here in this exhibition what is featured is what the individual likes best.""If you take my works they are small but capture minute details. It is all about precision and hard work.

Morayas is assembled art something similar to Picasso.
"Before writing the child learns to draw. The child's perception of the world is destroyed from the very beginning. His/her sense of originality and his/her world is pruned. This hinders the child's development. Art is thinking and the child becomes just another product of society. Also another danger is, upcoming young artists have no space to display their pictures."
Chammika feels that it is the flaw in Sri Lankan society that only when someone dies is his/her paintings appreciated in Sri Lanka. Vincent Van Gogh though not Sri Lankan was one example in his day and age in his society.
"Art changes when society and culture changes. Art contains the history of a nation. When thoughts change that is art. Van Gogh was fearless in his artistic expressions. He drew for his own pleasure. It took some time for people to understand his pictures. Leonardo Da Vinci was also one who dedicated his efforts to art and made sacrifices."
