A man, who had allegedly been caught peeping into a women’s toilet in the Paradeniya, had been beaten to death by a neighbour yesterday.

Kegalle Police discovered the body of a man lying along the road and inquired into it to find that he was beaten-to-death by a man for being a peeping-tom.

The deceased had been identified as a 50-year-old resident of the area who was notorious for peeping into women’s toilets and stealing women’s undergarments.

The suspect had later surrendered to police and he was arrested thereafter. (Saman Wijeyabandara)
