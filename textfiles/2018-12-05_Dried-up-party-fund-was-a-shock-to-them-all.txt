Dried up party fund was a shock to them all!


	

A political party quite active in the upcountry estate sector had held a grand party the other day. The party chief who is nattily dressed in the usual black suit, his son and other party seniors had attended this party.


All had been quite liberal with the bottle, and even the party chief and his son had found themselves fully soaked a few hours later.  Meanwhile, the son had a suffered a serious injury on a hand in an accident.


The son was rushed to a hospital where the doctors had asked them to purchase some very expensive drugs for the patient. The chief who hosted the party found that he did not have enough cash in hand to meet the drug bill and asked a party high-up to settle the bill with monies from the party fund.


Then only they had discovered that the party fund too had dried up. The news was a shock to all party activists because they could not imagine a party with several Diyawanna members could go bankrupt.


However, later they had raised enough monies from another source to pay the high drug bill, they say.
