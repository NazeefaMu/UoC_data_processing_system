The Supreme Court has determined that the Theravada Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill was inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore it should be passed in Parliament with a two-thirds majority in addition to approval by people at a referendum for it be enacted a law.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya communicated the Supreme Court’s determination to Parliament today.

He said the Supreme Court has determined that clauses 9, 10 and 12 in the Section 12 of the bill were inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.

He also announced that the Supreme Court had determined that Sections 2\2, 2\4, 2\3, 11/2 were also not in accordance with the Constitution.

He stated that the Supreme Court has held slashing of Section 5 and the amendment of Sections 2/2, 1/2 would bring the Bill in line with the Constitution.

The primary objective of the bill is to ensure a code of conduct for Theravada Bhikkhus in Sri Lanka.
