UNITED NATIONS AFP Oct6, 2017   -  Saudi Arabia on Friday rejected the UN’s move to blacklist the coalition fighting in Yemen for the killing and maiming of children, calling the information cited in the international body’s annual list “misleading.” “We reject the inaccurate and misleading information and figures contained in the report,” the Saudi Ambassador to the UN Abdallah al-Mouallimi told a news conference at the United Nations, insisting the Saudi-led coalition does everything possible to avoid hitting civilians.
