Sylvesterian coach Roland Perera resigns

The long time cricket coach of St. Sylvester's College, Kandy, Roland Perera has submitted his resignation from the post mid way during the current schools cricket season citing business commitments as the reason for taking this decision.
True Perera is having a chain of shops in the city of Kandy but this is not something new to him and he had managed both cricket coaching and business well. He is did coaching at his alma mater for the love of it and often dipping deep into his pockets to keep the cricketers happy.
Sylvester's was when they became all island schools Division one Coca Cola League champions in 1994 and at that time they were the second schools to do so after St. Anthony's College in 1991 when they had a star studded side with three of them going on to play for Sri Lanka together against South Africa.
But St. Sylvester's College did not have stars in their side in 1994 and they lacked the basic amenities and did not even have a playground to practice and they had to depend on the matting wicket of Police grounds, Kandy.
It was the knack that Perera had to get the best out of the team which enabled them to tick. Though not meeting each other in a format at that time the Sylvesterians had to compete in the tournament with schools like Royal College, S. Thomas' College, St. Peter's College, St. Sebastian's College, Ananda College, Nalanda College, St. Anthony's College vie for the same honours arranging their own fixtures.
It was after the Sylvestrians that Trinity College from Kandy won the schools Division one league title. No other school from Kandy except for St. Anthony's College, St. Sylvester's College and Trinity College had won this title.
Perera is a full Sylvester's and played for the school as an attractive left hand batsman, left arm spinner and excelled in fielding in the covers where he never allowed anything to go past him. He also represented the Central Province School in the inter zonal cricket tournament organised by Observer. That was in the seventies.
On leaving school he joined Morrison Sons and Jones Limited and plated in the Mercantile cricket tournament and also for Moors Sports Club in P. Sara trophy cricket tournament which was then the highest level of club cricket before taking wings to the Middle East for greener pastures. He continued his cricket in the Gulf before returning to Sri Lanka in the early eighties.
By then his illustrious elder brother Malcolm Perera after a ten year sting had left St. Sylvester's College to take up employment in the University.
That was in 1982 and Sylvesterians experienced with two cricket coaches for two years before handing over the post to Roland Perera in 1984.
Roland Perera did a marvellous job and continued from where Malcolm Perera had left and who was to letter become the Director Coaching at Sri Lanka Cricket and later the Junior National Coach at Bangladesh for six years.
