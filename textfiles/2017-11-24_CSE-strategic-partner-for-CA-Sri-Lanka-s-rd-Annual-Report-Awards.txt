The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has once again renewed its support for the 53rd Annual Report Awards Competition organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants (CA Sri Lanka) by coming on board to power the prestigious competition as a strategic partner.


This is the fourth year in a row that CSE will power the competition, which promotes and recognizes organizations that promote transparency, accountability and good governance through financial reporting. 


CSE Chairman Ray Abeywardena said the Colombo Stock Exchange was delighted to partner with CA Sri Lanka as a Strategic Partner of the 53rd Annual Report Awards. “The awards competition is recognized by the business fraternity as an acknowledgement for quality financial reporting,” he said. 


Abeywardena noted that in the face of rising stakeholder expectations and with the ever evolving regulatory framework, both public and private companies are faced with renewed challenges and so have to sharpen their focus in delivering quality reporting. 


“We believe initiatives such as CA Sri Lanka’s Annual Report Awards competition helps strengthen and promotes sustainability, transparency and good governance,” he said. 


Welcoming CSE onboard once again, President of CA Sri Lanka Lasantha Wickremasinghe reiterated that securing the support of an organisation such as CSE was not only a boost to the competition’s standing, but was also an endorsement to the competition. 


With a history spanning over half a century, the Annual Report Awards has created an important benchmark in the country as a competition that promotes the core elements of transparency, social responsibility and good governance. The competition has helped organisations from multinationals, conglomerates, NGOs, to even SMEs improve transparency and accountability in financial reporting, while also enhancing Sri Lanka’s reporting standards in line with best global practices. The competition will revolve around the theme ‘Quintessence of Eminence’ this year. The grand finale of the competition will be held on 05th December 2017.
