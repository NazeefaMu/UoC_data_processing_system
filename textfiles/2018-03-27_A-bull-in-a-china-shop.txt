A bull in a china shop


	



 

There is a head of an establishment in the industries and commerce sector who has made it a practice to dash on floor the files submitted to him by some executives to show them his displeasure, they say.

 


A typical political appointee, this white-collar high-up would dash the files on the floor and bark at executives whenever they make an endorsement on files stating their objections to illegal instructions given by him.


Two female accountants who have got disgusted with the uncouth behavior of the high- up have already applied for transfers, they say. 


This establishment head would create this ugly scene in his office at once or twice a week, but the political authority responsible for his appointment despite being well aware of the situation, is turning a blind eye to it, employees say.
