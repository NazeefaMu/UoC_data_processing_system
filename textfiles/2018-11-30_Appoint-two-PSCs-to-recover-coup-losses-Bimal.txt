JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake yesterday said two Parliament Select Committees (PSCs) should be appointed to recover the losses and damages caused to the country by the political coup.

He told Parliament that President Maithripala Sirisena was responsible for the political impasse and that he should apologize to the nation for his actions.

"The purported government is not accepted by the international community. Even the Rajapaksa-friendly countries such as Swaziland and the Maldives do not accept it. Only some pro-Rajapaksa media institutions support them. The PSCs should comprise of professionals in the legal fraternity and other respected disciplines in order to enlighten the people on the true situation. Information on the coup should be taught to students so that this would not be a bad precedent. The PSCs should not merely assess the losses to the economy and resources, but should also look into the damage caused to the image of the country. They should recover the losses from those involved in the coup," he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
