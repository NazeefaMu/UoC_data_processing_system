After the Kollupitiya Police informed Court that the complainant -- in a case involving 14 students of a leading boys school in Colombo who were charged with trespass on the property of a girl’s school in Kollupitiya -- had intimated that she did not wish to proceed with the case, Colombo Fort magistrate and additional district judge Priyantha Liyanage discharged the concerned students.

When the case was taken up in court, SI Dammika Perera of the Kollupitiya Police submitted that the woman principal of the girl’s school had made a statement to the police saying that the suspect students were invited by her to the girl’s school. The police also informed Court that they did not wish to proceed with the case.

The attorneys who represented the parents of the suspect students submitted to Court that the students were unaware that it was an offence to congregate near a girl’s school, and that the parents and the students had been advised not to repeat such actions. (Sumiththa Jayawickrama)
