Forgetting the past


	

There is a prominent politico known to have taken the initiative to revoke the law barring the fragmentation of coconut estates in a gallant move to meet a business need of his ladylove. 

 


At a recent a high level conference chaired by the country’s highest political authority, this politico had drawn derisive smiles from all present when he expressed his deep concern over the continuing practice of breaking up of coconut plantations into small lots for commercial and residential purposes.


Several politicos who attended this conference had expressed their views on the factors that have contributed to the shortfall in coconut production leading to the current high price in the market.


One participant conspicuous by the red shirt he was wearing had remarked that the politico responsible for lifting the prohibition on fragmenting coconut plantations too was present at this conference.  However, the politico to whom the remark was targeted had been seen engrossed in some documentation, they say.
