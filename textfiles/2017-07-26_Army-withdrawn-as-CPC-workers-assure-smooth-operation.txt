The Army personnel, who took over the operations of the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela petroleum distribution control were withdrawn this evening, Army Spokesman Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne said.

He said the decision was taken after the employees agreed to conduct smooth work.

“The special teams deployed for the control of the petroleum distribution had been recalled,” he said.

The Army took over the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela petroleum distribution control midnight Wednesday in order to restore fuel supply following the Extraordinary Gazette announcement which declared that fuel distribution as an essential service. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
