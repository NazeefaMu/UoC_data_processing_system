JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said today former MP Piyasiri Wijenayake, who was held responsible for fraud by PRECIFAC, had accompanied the President on his recent visit to Japan and said this would negatively influence the legal proceedings against him.

He asked in parliament how the President took him on a state visit when he was accused of a fraud by a commission.

"Mr. Wijenayake was seen attending a discussion between the President and the Japanese Prime Minister. How is the law enforced on such suspects when they are taken on state visits like this. I ask the Law and Order minister to inform parliament whether this would unduly influence the judiciary and the police," Mr. Ratnayake asked.

He said PRECIFAC had held about 200 people responsible for fraud and corruption. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
