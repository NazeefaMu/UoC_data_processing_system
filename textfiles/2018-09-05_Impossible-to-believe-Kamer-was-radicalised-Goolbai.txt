Impossible to believe Kamer was ‘radicalised’: Goolbai


	

Former Principal of Asian International School (AIS), Goolbai Gunasekara yesterday said that it was impossible to accept that the 25-year-old Kamer Nizamdeen who was arrested in Australia for alleged ‘terrorism’ charges, was ‘radicalised’.

“I certainly remember Mohammed Kamer Nizamdeen who was recently accused of being a possible terrorist in Australia. It is something I not only do not believe in, but also it is something I will continue to disbelieve until (if ever) it has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that this exceptional boy is guilty of, someday,”

“Kamer came to AIS for the final 2 years of schooling in order to do his London A/L exam. He came from one of Colombo’s best known and most prestigious boys' schools where he had achieved excellent results at the Ordinary Level Exam. Many students enter international schools to do their Advanced Level Exam and most of them do well. But Kamer immediately became one of the most popular boys in his class for the very simple reason that his main attribute was niceness. This is an overworked adjective, but one that describes Kamer perfectly. He was a gentle, charming and yes, a nice boy in every way,”

“His unfailing courtesy to teachers and to his classmates was noticed from the start. Teachers who taught him were always full of praise for his work ethic and his general thorough approach to studies. His teachers have kept in touch with him after he left us (gaining 3 As I might add) and entered the University of Melbourne,”

“Envy is one of Sri Lanka’s worst national traits. It is characteristic of an island mentality say some psychologists. I am no psychologist myself, but long experience has taught me a fair amount of discernment. Kamer was gentle, sweet natured and comfortable with himself. He had no hang-ups. He had a happy home and projected an aura of personal calmness and self control. Perhaps he was too successful at what he did and that upset his contemporaries,” she added.
