The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said that it would not involve in any Police proceeding hereafter because of the alleged conspiracy to kill President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa with the involvement of some top Police officials.

JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told a news conference at the ‘Dooshana Virodhi Balakaya’ on Wednesday revealed that DIG in-charge of the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) Nalaka de Silva was in an attempt to conspire against President Sirisena and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.

He said President Sirisena should conduct an investigation into this matter and added that immediate legal action should be taken against DIG Silva.

He said some underworld figures had also been involved in the said conspiracy and added the JO had lost its faith in the Police followed by this revelation.

“It is revealed that the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was also involved in this conspiracy. We cannot trust the Police as well as the IGP because of this issue. Therefore, we will not involve in any Police proceeding and we will not go to the Police over any matter. We will only go to the Courts if there is any issue,” he said.

“These conspirators are in an attempt to favour Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. We thought that only the Rajapaksas have become victims but at present President Sirisena’s life is also at stake,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
