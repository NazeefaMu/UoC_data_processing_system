The Western Provincial Council (WPC) today postponed the debate and the vote on the draft bill on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution till next Monday.

The Governor had requested the Council to convey its decision on the draft Bill before September 12.

However, Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said today more amendments are to be included in the Bill and therefore, the debate should be postponed till the amendments were finalised.

The postponement was approved by 77 councillors while five members objected to it. Two members did not vote. (Muditha Dayananda)
