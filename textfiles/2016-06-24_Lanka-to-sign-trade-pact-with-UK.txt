Lanka to sign trade pact with UK


	

Sri Lanka will sign a trade pact with the United Kingdom as soon as possible, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha De Silva told Parliament today.

The Deputy Minister who was speaking during the debate on Right to Information Bill said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would inform Parliament the details of the proposed pact.

“Sri Lanka will lose 40 per cent of the Tax concessions to be entitled to it under the GSP plus trade facility when the UK leaves European Union following the verdict given by the British people at Thursday's BREXIT and the plan B which the government devised earlier was to go for a trade pact with the UK," the Deputy Minister said.

Dr. de Silva said Sri Lanka too will be affected by the global economic downturn which had begun after the UK people decided that it should leave EU.

The Deputy Minister accepted that they did campaign with the British government to convince the British people to vote in favour of UK staying on with EU.

Dr de Silva was actually responding to a statement made by Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane to this effect earlier during the debate.

Mr. Gunawardhane said Deputy Minister de Siva and other government politicians had engaged in a vein effort to convince the British people on behalf of UK Prime Minister David Cameron. “You people have put Mr. Cameron in difficulty" now he said while informing the House that Mr. Cameron had announced his resignation.
