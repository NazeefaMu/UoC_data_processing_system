CAA directs private hospitals to issue detailed bills


	

The Consumer Affairs Authority has directed that all private hospitals should issue a comprehensive bill mentioning the price, details of medicinal drugs and equipment used for patients, a CAA official said today.
The move has been taken following a string of complaints received by the CAA from Doctors and as well as patients, CAA Chairman Rumi Marzook said.
“Some private hospitals, doctors, channeling centres and outpatient departments (OPDs) are issuing bills in which they have included very expensive price details of medicinal drugs. They are the same medicinal drugs given at various prices in the market. It is a burden on the patients,” Marzook said.
Meanwhile, the CAA Chairman requested the hospital authorities to take action to ensure the safety, efficiency and good quality medicinal drugs given to patients according to the National Medicine Regulatory Authority Bill which was passed in parliament recently.
