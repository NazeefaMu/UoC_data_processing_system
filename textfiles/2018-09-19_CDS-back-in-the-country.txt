However, he left the country on September 10, to attend the 208th Independence Commemoration Ceremony of United Mexican States, representing Sri Lanka on the invitation of Mexican Defence Minister General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda.

An official said earlier that the CDS had informed the CID in writing about the visit and had requested for another date to appear before the CID.(Darshana Sanjeewa and T.K.G. Kaila)
