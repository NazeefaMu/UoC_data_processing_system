Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today charged that the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran was acting on a separatist and racist agenda and his conduct was a hindrance to national reconciliation.

JHU national organiser and western provincial councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the government had taken several steps towards promoting national reconciliation in the country including re-establishing the northern provincial council and removing high security zones but Mr. Wigneswaran was not showing any cooperation on that direction.

Mr. Warnasinghe told the news briefing that the Northern Province Chief Minister did not attend the recently held 32nd Provincial Chief Minister's conference in Hikkaduwa, which gave an opportunity to discuss the issues in provincial councils together with other Chief Ministers and added that he continued to evade the Cabinet meetings as well.

He said: " If Mr. Wigneswaran was acting against the Constitution, action should be taken against him and it was the responsibility of the governor to reveal the reason behind Mr. Wigneswaran’s actions".
Mr. Warnasinghe challenged the Chief Minister to reveal what he had done for the betterment and to uplift the Tamil people in the north during the last three years.

He said only 20% of the funds allocated for the Northern Province were spent and the rest had been returned to the Treasury. (Ajith Siriwardana)
