A No fly-zone has been declared tomorrow between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. because a mysterious space debris named 'WT1190F' is to hit Earth's surface near the southern sea area of Sri Lanka, the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited today said.
It is said the object is suspected to hit the sea between Galle and Hambantota.
Chief Flight Service Officer Krishanthi Thisera said the no-fly zone would not affect the operations of the Bandaranaike International Airport-Katunayake and the flight operators flying to Australia and Maldives have already found alternative ways, to use during the said time.
