Heidi Klum Dressed as Jessica Rabbit

If there is one thing Heidi Klum has become known for since retiring from the runways, it's her extravagant Halloween parties, and more importantly, her equally extravagant costumes. She used to involve ex-husband Seal in the festivities, but divorce doesn't exactly encourage people to have fun and dress up together.
Single life notwithstanding, the German former supermodel amped up her costume game to a very scary degree. Having chosen some offensive outfits in the past, such as dressing up as the Hindu Goddess, Kali, in 2009, but she has since learned from her mistakes.
This year saw Klum, at her high profile annual party, take on the task of dressing like Jessica Rabbit.
On the surface, it seems like a pretty simple concept: wear a red wig, a red dress, red shoes, and purple gloves. But Heidi managed to make it weird, with latex on her face to make her look like the cartoon vixen, fake breasts, and a fake butt to top it all off. She certainly beat anyone else's attempts to get plastic surgery to look like Jessica Rabbit. Racked
