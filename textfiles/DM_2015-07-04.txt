Hirunika to decide on her SLFP membership today
	
Western Provincial Councilor Hirunika Premachandra said that she would not remain in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) if former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was given nominations to contest from the party.
She said she would make a decision on her SLFP membership today.
All the things we have spoken of during the previous presidential council election would become false if Mr. Rajapaksa was allowed to contest from SLFP. Therefore, I will not remain in the SLFP if he was given nominations and will contest from another party, she said. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

Maithri and Mahinda have betrayed their voters: JVP
	
JVP central committee member Sunil Handunnetti said they were not surprised by the decision taken to give nominations to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa under the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
This decision shows the rejuvenation of the vile politics and greed for power, he said.
He further said that Mahinda Rajapaksa had betrayed the 5.8 million who voted for him while Maithripala Sirisena had betrayed 6.2 million of his voters.
Mr. Handunnetti said that Mr.Sirisena only wanted to secure his power and leadership in the party and Mr. Rajapaksa wanted power to escape from allegations of corruption. Their unity is only for their private gains but not for the benefit of the people or the country, he added.

MR contesting from Kurunegala: T.B. Ekanayake
	
Former Minister T.B. Eknanayake says former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will be contesting in the upcoming General Elections from the Kurunegala District.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror Online, the former Minister confirmed a decision has been made for MR to contest from Kurunegala from the UPFA.

Following weeks of various speculations over the probability of the former President contesting at the upcoming elections, last evening the UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha issued a media statement confirming that Mr. Rajapaksa would be given nomination from the UPFA, which was further clarified at the media briefing held last evening by the UPFA allies that called for his PM candidacy at the forthcoming polls.

However, doubts are still being expressed by some political groups particularly the UNP over the situation, who claim they are certain the President would not work together with MR and therefore, would not receive a nomination from the SLFP.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa initiated his political career from the Beliatte constituency and thereafter contested from the Hambanthota district. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Retired Chief of Defence Staff, Lt. Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya, has reportedly not been granted a visa to visit the United States although his wife had been granted one in May this year.
The visa applications had been sent to the US Embassy in May and the duo was scheduled to leave the country on a private visit on June 30, the Daily Mirror learns. However, the passport of the former CDS was still at the embassy and had not been returned as yet.
Lt. Gen Jagath Jayasuriya took over as Commander of the Army after the end of the civil conflict and was thereafter appointed Chief of Defense Staff. He retired from the position a few weeks ago.
Meanwhile, when contacted by Daily Mirror on the matter, a spokesman for the US Embassy in Colombo said that as a matter of policy, they cannot comment on individual cases. Thats all we have to say at this moment, he said.

Rajiv Gandhi killers should be pardoned: Katju
	
A former Indian Supreme Court Judge, Justice Markandey Katju had said Rajiv Gandhi killers should be pardoned and set free now as they had been in jail for 24 years, Deccan Chronicle reported.
In his blog Satyam Bruyat on Friday, Justice Katju, also a former Chairman of the Press Council of India, said that the assassins should be set free like Abdul Qadeer in Hyderabad jail, D.S. Bhuller in Tihar prison and Zaibunnisa Qazi in Yeravada jail.
Striking a harsh tone, he said, I am not justifying the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. But what business did Rajiv Gandhi have in sending the Indian army into Sri Lanka, causing the deaths of thousands of Tamils, apart from 3000 of our soldiers Would that not have given rise to a strong sense of resentment among Tamils he asked in his blog. 
Rajiv Gandhis ordering massacre of Sikhs in 1984 after the assassination of his mother and saying Jab bada ped girta hai, to dharti hil hai jaati (when a big tree falls it shakes the ground) showed that he had a criminal bent, Justice Katju said.
In any case, enough is enough. The convicts should now be freed. If they are not, I am setting up a Court of Last Resort on my return to India for attaining this objective, and for this I will appeal to the patriotic Indians for help, he said.
Court of Last Resort will not really be a court in the judicial sense but only a fact finding body whose aim will be to secure justice for all, he said.
