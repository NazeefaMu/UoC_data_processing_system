The programme also included a segment on the regulatory role of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka conducted by Deputy Governor Sirwardena and the Director of Financial Intelligence.


Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Sales and Service, Transaction Banking Head Anton Amarasinghe speaking of the motivations for hosting the workshop said: “Correspondent Banking is an important means of facilitating cross-border trade and financing growth, hence we are determined to support this facet of the financial services industry by sharing knowledge and best practices with peers and regulators. We are also committed to promoting the safety of our financial system and protecting against financial exclusion.”


Standard Chartered remains a leading player in the Financial Institutions business across the globe, with Correspondent Banking forming an integral part of the solutions the bank provides to its clients. With workshops such as these, Standard Chartered aims to contribute to the overall well being of the industry by sharing ‘de-risking through education’ which Standard Chartered Group has developed, to manage the financial crime risk in the bank’s correspondent bank portfolio, and to support growth in emerging markets and promote financial inclusions.
