Although Astrology (Jyotish Shastra), Palmistry (Hasta Rekha Shastra) and Numerology have developed as separate subjects or sciences in recent times, the latter two sciences had developed as part or branches of Astrology in ancient times. In fact, Numerology had developed as `Swara Shastra’ which suggests that the ancient sages in India in particular had laid more emphasis on the vibrational or phonetic aspect of the science than on the numerical aspect.

 

Palmistry and Numerology – Offshoots from Astrology
Both Palmistry and Numerology – the modern day `Swara Shastra, concede the influence of planets on man. For example, in Palmistry the Mounts and Lines on the hand are named after planets. And the characteristics of different planets are taken into account in reading the significations of the Lines, Mounts and signs on them. In Numerology too in interpreting the values of numbers, colours, gemstones, etc. planetary influence is taken into account. Therefore, nomenclature or terminology occurring Astrology is widely used in Palmistry and Numerology as well.

 

The same Yogas giving same results
Certain favourable and unfavourable planetary combinations are termed as Yogas in Astrology. Astrology also speaks of favourable Yogas like Amala, Anapha, Adhi and Vesi and unfavourable ones like Daridra and Papakartari. Some of our readers might be surprised to learn that Yogas by the same names giving results similar to those described in Astrology occur in Palmistry 
as well.


We hope to discuss some of such favourable and unfavourable Yogas occurring in Palmistry.
Amala Yoga: A person who has a developed Mount of Moon and also elevated Mounts of Sun and Venus with the Moon line (See the figure 1) proceeding towards the Mount of Mercury is blessed with this Yoga.


Result: The subject is wise, clever and famous. He is wealthy and enjoys all comforts in life. If the Mount of Venus is free of obstructing lines, he is much attracted to sensual pleasures.


Adhi Yoga: A person who has a well-developed Moon line with a branch off it reaching the Mount of Saturn is a beneficiary of Adhi Yoga. (See figure 2)


Result: The subject is humble, clever and foresighted. He works according to a set agenda for time management. He does not lack anything necessary for a comfortable living.


Anapha Yoga: This Yoga is produced when there is a favourable Mount of Venus, with the Sun line originating from a well-developed Fate line. (See figure 3)


Result: The subject has a magnetic personality and is capable of influencing others. He is highly respected in society. He is wise, virtuous and altruistic.


Bhaskar Yoga: This Yoga is formed when the Sun line meets with the Moon line and the Mercury line and there is a long and prominent Jupiter line. (See figure 4)


Result: The subject has means of acquiring all needs for a comfortable living. He has several sources of income. He is versatile and persevering. He has an impressive personality. He makes friends easily. Enemies fear him. He is a lover of arts, music and literature. He extends his patronage to artistes. He enjoys the company of a wide circle of friends.
