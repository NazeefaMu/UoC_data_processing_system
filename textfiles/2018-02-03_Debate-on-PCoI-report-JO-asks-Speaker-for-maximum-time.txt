Debate on PCoI report: JO asks Speaker for maximum time


	

The joint opposition (JO) said yesterday it would request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to allocate maximum time for the JO for the parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission’s report.

MP Bandula Gunawardana told a news conference that the JO was the group which spearheaded the campaign which revealed the Central Bank bond scam.

“Not only did we reveal the scam, we literally shed blood for this. Our MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena was injured during the protest held near the Central Bank in Colombo when a barrier fell on him. We organised awareness campaigns across the country to make people aware about the scam. Therefore, we deserve the most amount of time at the debate,” he said.

The MP said the National Executive Council which was set up during the 100-day programme and its members were also responsible for the bond scam because the council had allowed the appointment of former CB governor Arjuna Madendran.

He said it was the JO which wrote to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank informing of them about the CB scam. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
