Protest by mine workers at Kahatagaha


	

Workers of a graphite mine in Kahatagaha have launched a protest inside the mine shaft over several demands including Rs.400 increase on their risk allowance which is currently Rs.16.

The protest at the 1,132 feet deep mine is continuing for the third day.

The protesters say the risk allowance of Rs.16 has remained unchanged for forty years and demanded that they be provided an insurance cover because their occupation was one of high risk. (Sampath Seneviratne)
