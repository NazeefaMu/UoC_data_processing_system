There was no evidence to suggest that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was involved in any financial fraud, but allegations of money laundering and financial mismanagement had been levelled against many of the Rajapaksa family members, Cabinet Spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today.

Responding to a journalist on an alleged statement by former President Rajapaksa that he would cut his own throat if it was proved that he had stolen a single dollar of State revenue, Minister Senaratne said there was no evidence to prove that former President Rajapaksa engaged in any financial frauds while in office.

“But Mahinda Rajapaksa is not all other Rajapaksas. Many other members of the Rajapaksa family have various allegations of financial fraud against them. I would like to know what they have to say, when inquiries are in progress or some of them are taken into custody,” he added. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
