Sampath group records Rs.4.7bn pre-tax profit in 1H
	
The Sampath group recorded half-year growth in profitability with a pre-tax profit of Rs.4.7 billion, an increase of 32 percent over the previous years first half pre-tax profit of Rs.3.6 billion.
The profit after-tax for the half year ended June 30, 2015 stood at Rs.3.2 billion, which is an increase of 13.8 percent over the corresponding period in 2014. 
The bank, the main entity of the group, too recorded a profit before tax of Rs.4.4 billion, compared to Rs.3.4 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2014, which is an increase of 30.3 percent.
The banks posttax profit for the six months ended June 30, 2015 also rose by 11.8 percent, from Rs.2.7 billion in 2014 to Rs.2.9 billion
in 2015.
A lower growth rate in post-tax profits, both at the group and bank levels than that in pre-tax profits, arose due to reversal of certain tax over provisions of previous years, upon finalization of the respective tax returns in the 1H14. Net interest income
The net interest income (NII) increased from Rs.7.8 billion in the 1H 14 to Rs.8.5 billion in the 1H15, registering a moderate growth of Rs.729 million (9.4 percent).
This growth in NII was achieved despite the interest margin shrinking from 4.07 percent in the 1H14 to 3.8 percent in the 1H15, as a result of the growth in the fund-based operations of the bank. 
However, timely re-pricing measures taken by the ALCO, the banks success in minimizing the NPLs and improvement in the CASA ratio, helped to maintain the net interest margins (NIM) at current levels. Net fee and commission income
The banks net fee and commission income for the 1H15 stood at Rs.2.8 billion, which was a growth of 26 percent. Increase in business volume from operations such as credit card and debit cards, trade-related services and other banking services contributed to this growth.Other operating income
Other operating income too recorded an impressive growth of 156 percent and stood at Rs.1.3 billion in the 1H15 compared to Rs.0.5 billion recorded in the corresponding periodof 2014.
The major contributory factors for this increase were realized exchange income and income from currency notes operations.Operating expenses
The operating expenses of the bank increased from Rs.5.6 billion in the 1H14 to Rs.6.6 billion during the period under review, reflecting a growth of 17 percent.
This was due to general price increases, business promotional campaigns, credit card-related expenses and salary increments given to the staff members during the periodunder review.Impairment loss on loansand receivable
Reduction in provisions against the gold loans (pawning) in 2015 was the main reason for the reduction in collective impairment charge by Rs.578 million during the period under review, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The banks total pawning advances as at June 30, 2015 was only 5.1 percent of the total advances. Business growth
Total deposits recorded a growth of 6.3 percent from Rs.342 billion as at December 31, 2014 to Rs.364 billion as at June 30, 2015.
Despite the drop in pawning advances by Rs.7.3 billion during the period, the banks total gross advances increased by Rs.29 billion or 9 percent, from Rs.311 billion as at December 31, 2014 to Rs.340 billion, at the end of 1H15.
Total assets stood at Rs.461 billion as at June 30, 2015, reflecting a growth of 6.7 percent against the total assets as at December 31, 2014. Performance ratios
ROE (after tax) for the six months ended June 30, 2015 stood at 19 percent reflecting a marginal growth compared to the corresponding periods 18.77 percent. 
ROA (after tax) for the six months ended June 30, 2015 stood at 1.34 percent. Earnings per share too reported an increase in the 1H15 and remained at Rs.17.38, compared to Rs.15.56 for the corresponding periodof 2014.
Similarly, the NPL ratio (net of interest in suspense) also showed an improvement from 1.93 percent as at 31.12.2014 to 1.71 percent as at 30.06.2015
Capital adequacy ratios
Although the Tier I and Total capital adequacy ratios have marginally reduced by 0.36 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively compared to December 31, 2014, mainly due to the credit growth mentioned above and the cash dividend paid in April 2015, the bank managed to maintain its capital adequacy ratios, Tier I (8.47 percent) and Total (12.87 percent), well above the minimum regulatory requirements of 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively at the end of 1H15. The bank continued to adopt a policy of leveraging its capital to an optimum level but will ensure to maintain a capital buffer adequate enough to support its future business expansion andrisk profile.

As such, unique and flexible repayment leasing solutions are introduced assessing the changing consumer needs.

He further explained that the bank will have an on-location leasing booth where on-the spot vehicle financing through leasing will be facilitated.
In addition, customers will enjoy extraordinary benefits on vehicle insurance schemes where attractive discounts up to 85 percent on the basic premium will be provided through the partnership the bank has secured with its insurance partners.

UPFA, SLFP general secretaries stuck in a quagmire
	
	Concerns were raised by political parties and the legal fraternity today over a possible delay in gazetting of national list members by Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya because of the dispute over the post of UPFA General Secretary.
	The UPFA expects to file a petition in the Supreme Court today or tomorrow challenging the sacking of Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadharshana Yapa from the posts of UPFA and the SLFP general secretaries and replacing them with Prof. Wishva Warnapala and Duminda Dissanayaka, a member of the UPFA legal team told Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity.
	He said legal experts were preparing the petition and that in case the dispute was not resolved soon the first session of the new parliament scheduled for September 1 might also be delayed.
	The core of the issue the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction not recognizing the sacking of Mr. Premajayantha and Mr. Yapa from their posts by President Maithripala Sirisena on Friday.
	Prof. Wishva Warnapala and Duminda Dissanayaka who were appointed as acting general secretaries of the UPFA and the SLFP respectively had also obtained an enjoining order from the District Court of Colombo restraining Mr. Premajayantha and Mr. Yapa from interfering in the work of the acting general secretaries.
	The enjoining order was obtained on Friday just prior to the court vacation beginning on Monday.
	A court official said the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court would resume sessions only on August 31 at the end of the Court vacation and as such any legal action by Mr. Premajayantha and Mr. Yapa would have to be put off till then. However, the official said petitions could be filed in the two apex courts during the vacation.
	Mr. Premajayantha, who commented on the removal of Mr. Yapa from the post of SLFP General Secretary and the appointment of Mr. Dissanayaka to replace him was a violation of the SLFP constitution of the SLFP and that the enjoining order had been obtained by misleading the court.
	The General Secretary of the UPFA can only be removed by a resolution approved by the UPFA Executive Committee and not by the leader according to its constitution. The acting General Secretary is not a member of the executive committee and his name has not been approved by it or that of the SLFP as required by the UPFA constitution. The two general secretaries have not been asked to show cause as to why they should not be sacked as required by the natural justice. Therefore this move is unlawful and unacceptable, Mr. Premajayantha said.
	He said the District Court did not have the jurisdiction to issue the enjoining order and that it should have issued by the Supreme Court.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Yapa told Daily Mirror that Mr. Premajayantha would submit the list of the UPFA national list members to the Elections Commissioner at the close of the election.
	He is the legally appointed general secretary of the UPFA and under section 99A, Chapter XIV of the Constitution, the Elections Commissioner must accept the list submitted by Mr. Premajayantha, Mr. Yapa said and added that he has already submitted the SLFP national list members to Mr. Premajayantha.
	Veteran politician and a former UPFA national list member DEW Gunasekara said untangling the legal tangle on the issue would be time consuming and might delay the first session of the new parliament scheduled for September 1. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Voting for General Elections commences
	
	Voting for the General Election-2015 has commenced at 7am to elect 196 members of Parliament. The voting is scheduled to end 4 pm.
	
	Additional Elections Commissioner U. Amaradasa said, 15,044,490 voters were eligible to vote on the basis of the 2014 electoral register which was being used at this election. Nearly 200,000 officials will be deployed on election duty while the votes will be counted at the 1,600 centers set up for this purpose.
	The hectic but relatively peaceful 33-day election campaign concluded at 12.00 midnight on Friday. Nominations to one of the most crucial and decisive parliamentary elections since independence ended on July 13.
	One of the significant facets of the election campaign was the peaceful atmosphere when compared with the previous elections in the wake of the Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya taking upholding election laws to the letter using the powers vested in him through the 19th Amendment.
	The Elections Commissioner and three leading election monitoring groups -- PAFFREL, CaFFE and the CMEV have deployed nearly 25,000 local observers and about 200 international observers to monitor the election.
	The 12-member Commonwealth election observers who are in the country have expressed optimism that the peaceful atmosphere was conducive to the holding of a free and fair election.
	Commonwealth Observer Group Chief and former Maltese president Dr. George Abeyla earlier said the group remained 'cautiously optimistic' because of the peaceful situation with all parties agreeing to uphold election laws.
	He said Sri Lanka was well placed to hold a free and fair election but that the monitors would reserve their final judgement till the electoral process is over.
	The observers are expected to visit the Western, Central, Northern, North-Central and North-Western Provinces in the next few days. Special attention will be focused on the 48-hour campaign-free period prior to elections as well as on the voting, vote counting and the release of the results.
	Centre Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) Executive Director Dr. Pakiyasothi Saravanamuttu said they had received complaints of 810 cases of election-related violence up to noon yesterday. He said 143 of them were of a serious nature which included four deaths and the use of firearms.
	Meanwhile, Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said incidents of 1,121 election-related violence including two deaths had been reported up to yesterday
	He said PAFFREL would deploy nearly 13,000 local and 14 foreign observers.
	The United National Party (UNP) pledged to make Sri Lanka the Centre of Excellence in all sectors within the next five years under its Five-Tiered Programme while the UPFA manifesto entitled An Assurance for the Future promises a huge relief package for the people.
	The JVP in its manifesto, Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide promises to make Sri Lanka a prosperous and modern country with equal distribution of wealth and resources. The TNA which is the main party in the North wants voters to give it more strength at this election to achieve self rule, devolution of lands and police power, release of political prisoners from jail and the merger of North and East to make it a Tamil-speaking region.
	Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the Police Department would deploy 70,000 personnel and 4,000 STF personnel to conduct a trouble-free election and they would man polling booths, mobile patrols, riot control and roadblocks.
	Meanwhile, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya has ordered all private sector employers to grant paid leave to employees to cast their votes.
	He said all employees were entitled to paid leave ranging from half a day to two days based on the distance to the employees polling station. If the polling station is less than 40 kilometers the work place, the employee is entitled to a half days paid leave while if the distance is 150 kilometers or more, the employee is entitled to two days paid leave.

Yuan slide seen adding to StanCharts Asian challenges
	
REUTERS: Already faced with a battle to revive the fortunes of banking group Standard Chartered , new Chief Executive Bill Winters is now confronted with another challenge in the shape of Chinas yuan devaluation.
Just over a week after Winters outlined his plans to revive the bank after a slump in profits, analysts say his turnaround efforts could be hampered by the yuan devaluation which threatens to increase bad debts in Asia and weaken other currencies in the region.
London-based Standard Chartered is the European bank most exposed to Asias economic weakness and currency volatility, which come just as Winters launches his attempts to lift the banks fortunes and improve profitability.
We think that asset quality will continue to deteriorate and the worst is yet to come, said Barry Norris, Chief Investment Officer at Argonaut, a fund that has a short position on the stock.
The bank, for many years a favourite among investors because of its exposure to fast-growing Asian economies, had already come under pressure from rising losses on loans to commodities clients and to customers in China, India and elsewhere.
Southeast Asia (ASEAN), where Standard Chartered generates 19 percent of revenue and has 26 percent of loans, could be particularly impacted by currency turmoil, analysts said.
Shares in Standard Chartered, which have more than halved in value since hitting a record 1,975 pence in late 2010, are down 3.4 percent since Chinas devaluation and HSBC is down 2.7 percent. By comparison European banks as a whole are down 2.3 percent.
The relatively muted reaction is because a rise in bad debts had already been forecast at StanChart and there were concerns about Chinas slowdown, analysts said. The impact of weaker Asian currencies on revenue is also partly offset by a reduction in local expenses, such as wages, in dollar terms.
Credit QualityBut some say worse is to come.
We believe ASEAN credit quality is set to deteriorate further, as existing trends are exacerbated by yuan devaluation, said Joseph Dickerson, analyst at brokerage Jefferies.
He rates Standard Chartered underperform and has cut his price target on the stock to 602 pence from 656p.
Other analysts have also downgraded this week, with Nomura for instance cutting its target to 1055p from 1170p with a neutral rating.
Chinas yuan depreciation has sparked jitters as its economy is slowing and it could start a currency war, which dragged other Asian currencies to multi-year lows.
Standard Chartered reports in U.S. dollars so earnings are hit when local currencies weaken against the dollar. Weak local currencies reduced its income by $277 million in the first six months of this year, representing more than one-third of its 8 percent income drop.
Rival HSBC is also heavily exposed to Asia, but is more diversified in Europe and the United States. Its core Hong Kong market also appears less affected by the recent turmoil, analysts said.
Standard Chartered acknowledged moves in the yuan-dollar rate would have a direct impact as it reports in dollars.
The second-order impact on the Chinese economy and therefore our China-related business is obviously more of a macro (economic) conversation, said a spokeswoman in an email, declining further comment.
