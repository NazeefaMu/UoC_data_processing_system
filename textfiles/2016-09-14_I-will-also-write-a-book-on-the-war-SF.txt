Field Marshal and Minister Sarath Fonseka yesterday said that he too will write a book on the war, insisting that action should be taken against those who had leaked war secrets by writing books.

How the war was created and its history and how it evolved with the time as well as how it was finally won will be included in the book, he said.

The Minister also said that he is hoping to publish his book by next year and the initial work is currently being done. (Sujith Hewajulige)
