Arjuna faults FCID for summoning Mathews


	

Former world cup winning Sri Lanka cricket captain and Minister of Ports and Shipping, Arjuna Ranatunga said the summoning of Sri Lanka Cricket captain Angelo Mathews to the FCID was regrettable.
 
Since FCID officers visit the homes of politicians to record their statements and make enquires, summoning the captain of the National Cricket Team was questionable, he said.
He also said that there was a need to ask why the officer did not go to Mathews’ house and record his statement there.
The minister made this comment today (24) at a ceremony at the Jaffna Central College.
