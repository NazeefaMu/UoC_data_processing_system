The United National Party (UNP) rejected the statement made by Deputy Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran who had called for the reorganization of the LTTE, UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told Parliament today.

He said his party rejected the statement made by Ms. Maheswaran when government MP S.M. Marikar asked a question on this matter.

“Did Ms Mahsewaran express the official stand of the party and the government? If not what is our party’s stand on it? Mr. Marikar asked.

“The UNP rejects the statement by Ms.Maheswaran. I talked to her over the phone on Monday and sought an explanation from her. She said she was emotionally overcome by the abduction and the killing of a child in the North,” Mr. Kariyawasam said.

Mr. Marikar said Ms. Mahsewaran should go to the mental hospital in Angoda if she had any mental issue.

UNP MP Asoka Priyantha also rejected the statement made by Ms. Maheswaran and said she should resign from her post. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
