Vitamins are compounds which are necessary for the growth and development of human beings. These vitamins help maintain bodily functions such as metabolism, immunity and digestion. They also make sure that your body grows and functions optimally. Vitamin D plays a substantial role in the regulation of calcium in the body and maintaining the level of phosphorous in the blood. These nutrients are required to keep your bones, teeth and muscles healthy. Vitamin D deficiency means that your body is not getting enough of it to stay healthy. The human body requires vitamin D in order to absorb calcium and promote bone growth. The risk of cognitive impairment as well as cardiovascular diseases in adults, have also been associated with Vitamin D deficiency.   

 

What is Vitamin D?
Known as the ‘Sunshine vitamin’, vitamin D is produced in response to the human body being exposed to sunlight. It is also one of the fat-soluble vitamins and there are two forms of it, D2 and D3. Fortified foods like fatty fish such as Tuna, Mackerel and Salmon, Egg yolks, some dairy products, plant foods and supplements include a fair amount of Vitamin D. Research has revealed the importance of Vitamin D in protecting against a host of health problems.

Just as bone ailments are quite common in people who suffer from the lack of Vitamin D, muscle fatigue and muscle weakness might occur frequently too,”explained Dr. Jayatissa.
