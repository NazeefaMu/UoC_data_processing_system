53rd Isipathana-Thurstan ends in a tame draw

 
The 53rd battle of the Brothers between Isipathana and Thurstan played over the week-end ended in a tame draw at the SSC even before the completion of first two innings of the match as both teams' approach with the bat was very sedate throughout the match especially Thurstan who took 110 overs to make 291 in their first innings.
Kasun Abeyratne renewing the 25-year old record for the highest individual score made by a Thurstan batsman in this 53-year old annual encounter scored 147 in Thurstan's first innings score of 291 for eight declared and his patient 348-ball innings with 17 fours placed Thurstan in a commanding position after they were put in by Isipathana. The record Kasun broke in this match was established by Kamal Mahendra in 1990.
The interesting feature of this record breaking was that Kasun established this new record under the captaincy of Charana Nanayakkara whose father Gamini Nanayakkara was the captain of Thurstan when Kamal Mahendran established his record in 1990.
Isipathana with a batting lineup that could be rated as one of the best in the island this year got off to a horrible start as they lost three quick wickets even before they put 50 on the board. However, SL youth wicket-keeper Vishad Randika, Sanjula Abeywickrama with 1000 runs under his belt this season and Pramod Madhuwantha, a star all-rounder in the schools circle did an excellent recovery job carrying Isipathana total to 222 for eight at close on the final day. Sanjula top scored for Isipathana with a gallant 75 while Pramod Madhuwantha finished with a good double of 4 wickets and 44 runs. Lahiru Dilshan also bowled well for Isipathana before Dilan Madusanka excelled with the ball for Thurstan.
