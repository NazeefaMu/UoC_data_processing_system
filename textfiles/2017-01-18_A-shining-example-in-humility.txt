A shining example in humility


	



 

A commemorative ceremony to mark the birth anniversary of the founder-leader of the Blue party was held at his statue on the Galle Face Green the other day. 

 


The eldest daughter of the founder-leader was the first distinguished guest to attend the ceremony.
The organizers of the event who respectfully welcomed the distinguished guest escorted her to the seat in the front row reserved for her. She sat down in the seat after some hesitation. A few minutes later she beckoned an organizer and told him: “The President and other VIPs of the government will soon turn up. Therefore, I should not occupy this seat.  Aren’t the seats of the front row really meant for such VIPs?”


The organizer who was a little surprised protested: “Madam, we have got strict instructions to reserve front row seats for the members of the late leader’s family. They are the VIPs on this occasion!”
She said: “No! No! I should not occupy a front row seat. Please offer them to the VIPs of the government who are expected to attend this ceremony.” 


Waving off the organizer’s persistent protests, the lady walked off to take a vacant seat at the rear.
Guests at the ceremony who witnessed the incident found it a good topic for discussion and they all agreed that the good lady set a good example for some of our politicos who would create ugly scenes if they were not accommodated in the front row at public functions.
