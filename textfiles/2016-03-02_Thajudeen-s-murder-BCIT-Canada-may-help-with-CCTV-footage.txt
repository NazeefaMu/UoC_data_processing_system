Thajudeen’s murder/BCIT, Canada may help with CCTV footage


	

The CID informed Court that there was a possibility of receiving direct assistance from the British Columbia Institute of Technology of Canada for clarification of the CCTV footage concerning the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.

The CID had earlier made a request through Interpol for foreign assistance to improve the clarity of the CCTV footage that possibly contained evidence related to the crime.

Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Pieris had ruled that the death of Thajudeen appeared to be a murder under section 296 of the Penal Code and ordered the director of the CID to take appropriate action immediately to apprehend the persons responsible for the act.

However, on an earlier occasion, Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake, representing the Attorney General’s Department, had said that getting foreign help to clarify the CCTV footage might take some time on account of unavoidable technical issues -- as they had to go through the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Interpol.

The case was put off for March 23. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
