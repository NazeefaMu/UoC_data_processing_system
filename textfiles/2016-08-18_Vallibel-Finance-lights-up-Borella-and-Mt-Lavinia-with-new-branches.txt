Financial innovator Vallibel Finance added two brand new branches, including a motor division 1st of its kind, to its expanding network, creating a frenzy of interest in the popular townships of Borella and Mt. Lavinia.
Readily embraced by the people as the name-bearer of the powerful Vallibel Group, the company has been scaling impressive heights with each new branch receiving exceptional public endorsement.  
Vallibel’s entry to Borella, a long-established city-center on the path of a road network that connects all four corners of Colombo and its suburbs, comes with a far-reaching blue-print of success for both the people living in Borella, as well as the vast migrating population that crosses this important town.
Borella also records a first for Vallibel with the unveiling of a motor division in the new branch to specifically handle the booming vehicle business there.  The Vallibel Motor Division, located facing two main road frontages in the heart of Borella, is a showpiece in architecture and facilities.
The bustling township received Vallibel to their midst with a well-participated opening ceremony.  Jayantha Rangamuwa, Managing Director of Vallibel Finance, personally greeted the special guests, customers, suppliers, businessmen and residents of the area who graced the occasion.
“Borella is an epic-center not just for business and residents but the thousands who thronged to it as they travel through this busy town.  We will cater specifically for their diverse needs with the kind of financial artistry that makes us endeared to people wherever we go”, Rangamuwa said.
