Video: Mahendran will face jail term if found guilty
	
The present regime which practices good governance will not hesitate to send Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to jail if he is found guilty of the controversial bond issue, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
Mr. Ramanayake told a media briefing that the present regime cannot throw away its electoral victory on January 9 just because of the Central Bank Governor.
He said Mr. Mahendrans impounded passport is currently with the Bribery Commission Director General. Mr. Ramanayake added that Mr. Mahendran will apply for Sri Lankan citizenship as soon as his passport is released.
He said FCID was not set up for political victimisation. He said even the Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa, the Board of Investment chief and several other government officials will be probed by the FCID shortly as it had received allegations against them. He therefore denounced the recent allegations made by his uncle Professor Carlo Fonseka that FCID was set up for political victimisation.
Further he alleged that there are people in this government who accept money from those who are accused of corruption to sweep their charges under the carpet.
Minister of Media Gayantha Karunatilleke said probing is necessary to confirm the allegations on any officials including the Central Bank Governor. He too said investigations will be made to get these charges confirmed. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)Video by Sanath Desmond

Duminda instilling fear: Hirunika
	
	UPFA Western Provincial Councillor Hirunika Premachandra yesterday charged that MP Duminda Silva was indirectly coercing witnesses from coming forth to give evidence by making latent threats.
	By saying that there will not be enough evidence to incarcerate him, what he is trying to say is that people will not come forth with evidence. This is an indirect threat to strike fear into potential witnesses, especially when there is a pending High Court trial she told the Daily Mirror.
	She said people still feared Duminda Silva because he was still a Member of Parliament, but the fear psychosis would change after the general elections.
	People fear that he still has power as an MP, but power is here one day and gone the next, so after the general elections this will change. I believe that after this impending change, the people will come forth and give evidence without fear she said
	The Provincial Councilor added that she was confident that justice would be served when witnesses were allowed to speak freely.
	She made these comments following a statement by Duminda Silva that there wasnt enough evidence to hold him liable for his alleged crimes.(Jehan Gunasekara)

FCID to probe Manilal Fernandos bank accounts
	
The Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) has obtained a court order from Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya to investigate the accounts of four private banks in Colombo over the alleged fraudulent dealings of Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) former Chairman of the Management Committee Manilal Fernando and Chief Executive Officer Chrishantha Perera committed during 2006 to 2014.
The FCID sought the Courts order to investigate the accounts in the Colombo branches of Commercial Bank, HNB, Standard Chartered Bank and State Bank of India.
The FCID in their report asserted that former Chairman Ranjith Rodrigo, who was then the President of the FFSL on May 7 had complained to FCID that according to an audit carried out by the Government Auditor it had recorded the fraud committed by the suspects and to investigate the matter.
The FCID said according to the investigations it had revealed that 40,000 Euros given to the Federation by the Italian Football players for the renovation of the Kalutara playground was fraudulently deposited in Mr. Fernandos Colpetty Commercial Bank Account No 1110024098 by Chrishantha Perera.
The Division also alleged that on May 12, 2008 the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) had given the FFSL US$ 60,000 as aid for hosting the Pakistan Football Tournament. Chrishantha Perera had prepared bogus standing orders to the banks which credited the funds to Manilal Fernanados Commercial Bank A/c No 1110001533.
The Division further said after the Tsunami disaster, in 2006 Holcim (Private) Ltd., had donated Rs. 10 million to the FFSL to repair the damaged houses. From that Rs. 10 million, Chrishantha Perera had fraudulently paid Rs. 5 million to Manilal Fernanado.
The Division also stated that in 2008, Sri Lanka had hosted the South Asian Football Tournament and the AFC in May and October 2008 had offered to pay US$200,000 to the FFSL. From that amount the AFC had paid US$160000 to the FFSL in October, which was deposited in the Standard Chartered Bank account No 02119008902 and a subsequent payment of US $ 40,000 made to the Federation had been fraudulently deposited in Manilal Fernandos Commercial Bank account No 25160003710201.
The Police said the suspects had committed offences punishable under Sections 386, 388 and 403 of the Penal Code and Section 5 of the Money Laundering Act of 2006. Magistrate Gihan Pilapitya ordered the FCID to investigate the complaint and file a report in court.
The Division also alleged that on May 12, 2008 the AFC had given the Sri Lanka Football Federation US$ 60,000 as aid for hosting the SAF Football Championship. (Farook Thajudeen)

The leftist parties had requested President Maithripala Sirisena to set up an interim UPFA government before the general elections and appoint Chamal Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister to ensure stability in the country and to fulfill political reforms, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) leader Tissa Vitharana said today.
I requested President to appoint Chamal Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister temporally because it will help ensure the unity in the party. We can rescue the country from the downfall it had experienced today and bring development process back on track, he said.
Professor Vitharana told a joint news conference of several political party party leaders such as Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Douglas Devananda, Prabha Ganeshan that the UPFA government had a mandate to govern the country till 2016 and that it would not annul even after the defeat at the last presidential election.
It is a wrong move to appoint a UNP government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe. The economy is in a great crisis and the cost of living is skyrocketing after the new government was elected. There has been no government in history that went bankrupt within six months, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH Pix by Waruna Wanniarachchai

Maithri rejects concessions to MR at polls: Rajitha
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena has flatly rejected to grant any concession to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the forthcoming election campaign, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today.
	Minister Senaratne told the weekly cabinet news briefing that President Sirisena categorically told the six-member committee appointed to mend fences among the two worrying factions that Mr. Rajapaksa did not qualify to be nominated as the Prime Ministerial candidate, in the national list or get nominations from the SLFP to contest the poll.
	The six member committee met President Sirisena yesterday to discuss the responsibility the former President Rajapaksa would be entrusted with at the upcoming parliamentary polls campaign among other matters. They requested to nominate Mr. Rajapaksa as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the UPFA at the election campaign and also nominate him if his name was not included in the National List of the SLFP. President Sirisena told the committee in no uncertain terms that no nomination as the Prime Ministerial candidate or no inclusion of his name in the National List of the SLFP. He would not get party nominations to contest the election either, Minister Senaratne said.
	He said the six-member committee comprising Opposition Whip John Seneviratne, UPFA General Secretary and SLFP National Organizer Susil Premajayantha, SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Dilan Perera, Kumara Welgama and T.B.Ekanayake were entrusted with the task of mending the fences between the two groups and creating a strong political front under President Sirisena assisted by Rajapaksa.
	However, Minister Senaratne noted that any politician, political party or group was free to join the UPFA and support its election campaign.
	The people have clearly rejected the policies and the style of the governance of the previous regime and therefore, attempts to bring back rejected politicians and policies back to power was an insult to the people who elected Maithripala Sirisena as the President and the government formed under his leadership.
	The people must decide at the forthcoming election whether they would continue to support the good governance under president Sirisena or restore the pillaging and plundering Rajapaksa regime. They also must decide whether they approve to punish the rogues who looted public money or let them free and open the gates once again for corruption, lawlessness and thuggery, Minister Senaratne stressed.(Sandun Jayasekera)WATCH

Suggestions that switch from PR system will wipe out small parties a canard: Zuhair
	
	Suggestions that the switch over from the Proportional Representation (PR) system to the mixed electoral system will wipe out small and minority parties is another canard spread by these parties, the National United Front (NUF) said in a statement yesterday.
	The NUF said that political parties such as the LSSP and CP had been well represented in Parliament from as early as 1947 right upto 1989 under the first-past-the post (FPP) system. The statement said that at the 1970 general election the LSSP won 19 seats in the then 151 member Parliament, while the UNP won only 17 seats and The Communist Party won 6. In the 1965 general election, the LSSP won 10 out of the 25 seats it contested while the CP won 4 out of the 9 seats it contested. At the 1960 (July) general election the LSSP won 12 out of 21 seats it contested while the CP won 4 out of 7 seats it contested. In the 1960 (March) general elections the LSSP won 10 out of 101 seats it contested and the CP won 3 out of 53 seats.
	The left parties had popular and charismatic non-communal leaders then though they gave in to communal politics after the first elections under the PR system, which aggravated communal tensions, further endangering ethnic relations. There is absolutely no basis for the claim that the minor and minority parties will be wiped out under the FPP plus limited PR system, except on account of the waning popularity of its leaders, the statement added.
	Similarly, the statement added, Tamil and Muslim parties, depending on the popularity of its leaders and candidates will return to Parliament particularly from the Northern and Eastern provinces of the country. Future possible political debacles of the minor and minority parties need not be blamed on the system, the party further said. (Kelum Bandara)
