Buyers of Isuzu vehicles from Sathosa Motors will be eligible for a range of benefits including discounts on the purchase price when they use the leasing options offered by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon under a new promotion unveiled by the two companies.
Valid till end April 2017, this latest leasing promotion offers discounts ranging between Rs 50,000 and Rs 100,000 on the full range of Isuzu motor lorries, cabs and buses, as well as competitive lease rentals, six labour free services, a 100,000 kilometres engine and gearbox warranty subject to maintenance at the Sathosa Motors workshop, and expedited processing at Commercial Bank’s island-wide branch network.
The Commercial Bank will also offer special schemes on selected vehicles under this promotion which will be promoted at all bank branches, the Sathosa Motors head office and two distributors in Jaffna and Ampara. This is the eighth joint promotion of this nature between these two organisations.
“We believe that this promotion will benefit many small and medium enterprises in particular that are looking to expand their operations or replace ageing vehicles,” said Sandra Walgama Commercial Bank’s Deputy General Manager, Personal Banking. “Many who aspired to acquire high quality Isuzu vehicles will now find the tangible benefits offered by this promotion attractive. The bank is always keen to uplift the SME sector by providing support in all aspects of business.”
Established in 1962, Sathosa Motors has succeeded in strengthening its reputation in the Commercial truck segment with its brand of Isuzu commercial, heavy duty and light duty vehicles and pickup trucks. 
The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the top 1000 banks of the world for six years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 256 branches and 658 ATMs in Sri Lanka.
