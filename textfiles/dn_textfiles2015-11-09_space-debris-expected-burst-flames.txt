Space debris expected to burst into flames

The falling space debris may be visible to the naked eye as it is expected to burst into flames when re-entering the earth's atmosphere on November 13, an official at the Planetarium said.
However, she said it might not generate a spectacular view as it happens in the daytime sky.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, she said the object is expected to fall into the Indian Ocean, about 65 kms south of Sri Lanka around 11.00 a.m. on November 13.
"We hope to observe the object one hour before and after the calculated time. This object designated as WT1190F is said to have a diameter of about two metres. The likelihood of any damage from this space junk is very low. In the next few days, we will receive more accurate calculations on the time and location of its fall. The object may break up into smaller pieces during reentry. The bigger pieces will continue to hurtle downward while smaller pieces burn completely high up in the atmosphere," the official said.
She said the object is thought to be a component from a spacecraft bound for the moon. The official added this is the first experience for Sri Lanka of a falling space debris in its environs.
Explaining on the rising threat of space debris, she noted about 3,000 objects of space debris about the size of WT1190F or larger than that are found in the space.
"The term came into use since the Earth's first satellite 'Sputnik 1' was sent in 1957. Much of the debris will eventually fall back into the Earth's atmosphere and incinerate, but some larger ones may still make landfall," she said.
Scientists requested the fisher community not to go fishing in the southern seas during the time of the phenomenon, even though they predict the chance of any hazard is low.
