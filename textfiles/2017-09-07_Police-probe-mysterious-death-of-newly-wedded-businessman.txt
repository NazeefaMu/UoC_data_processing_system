The Mount Lavinia Police yesterday initiated a special investigation into the mysterious death of a newly-wedded businessman who was found lying unconscious in a hotel room on the Beach Road, Mt. Lavinia on August 31.

Police said the injured who was admitted to the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday night while being treated at the Intensive Care Unit.

They said the deceased, identified as Mohan Wijethilaka (42), was found lying unconscious in the hotel room with broken teeth and bruises on his face.

However, the officers of the Mt. Lavinia Police Crime Branch suspect whether the death was an attempted suicide as they found 16 empty Paracetamol cards and the trouser belt of the victim hanging from the ceiling fan of the hotel room.

Police said the victim and his wife were regular customers of the famous hotel.

According to the police, the businessman and his wife had checked in at the hotel on August 28 and left the following day.

However, the victim had again visited the hotel on August 30 and occupied a room.

Police said the victim had been found unconscious and admitted to hospital by a trishaw driver and a friend of the victim who were allegedly sent by the victim’s wife in search of him.

Meanwhile, the victim’s brother lodged a complaint with the Mt. Lavinia Police that he was suspicious about his brother's death.

The businessman was married to an Animal Rights’ Activist on August 18.

The postmortem report will be received by the police today. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
