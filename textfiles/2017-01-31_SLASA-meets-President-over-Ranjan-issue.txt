Officials of the Sri Lanka Administrative Services Association (SLASA) and the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary yesterday met President Maithripala Sirisena over the incident where Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake had allegedly used strong language against the Divisional Secretary.

Issuing a statement, the SLASA said the President had assured to inform the Deputy Minister personally to withdraw his statements.

“The President claimed the incident should not have happened and the deputy minister was at fault. He also expressed his apology. If Deputy Minister Ramanayake continues to be adamant, our executive committee, which will meet up on Friday, will decide what future action should be taken,” SLASA Secretary Sunil Galagama said.

The Association said they also met Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and he had apologised for the inconvenience caused by the divisional secretary and her family members from the incident.

“The Minister said he will inform deputy minister to be cordial when dealing with state officials,” the SLASA said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
