Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday dismissed the criticism, over his recent response to a statement made by Colombo’s Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, saying he stood by what he said.     

“What I said was correct and I stand by it,” he said in response to a journalist at an event held at Royal College, Colombo.

When asked about the joint opposition’s pledge to continue criticising the minister’s response, he said, “The JO can come to Colombo again, stage a protest and show its incompetency,”
