Lights! Curtains!

“What do you mean you don't get PAID for being on stage?”
I sigh at being asked the same question umpteen times before. If I had a rupee for every time someone expressed shock at the fact that most actors in the local English theatre arena are unpaid, I'd be Oprah.
“I mean just that. I like it that way.”
Cue diplomatic silence accompanied by a perplexed stare, shake of head and that all-too Lankan ‘tch’ phonetic. It's hard for a non-thespian to comprehend. I don't blame them. Not everyone is insane enough to literally bleed, sweat and toil into the wee hours for months on end for the sake of a few nights’ romp on a stage in return for a few claps. But we're actors. We thrive on insanity and you can't put a price on madness.
Perhaps the inability to understand why we voluntarily sacrifice our time, families and good sense in favor of theatrics and no monetary compensation, stems from not seeing an actor's journey towards that final curtain. And so, I'm going to help you out with a little sneak peak, mainly because I'm really tired of explaining myself to everyone who asks THE question. Ladies, gentlemen and newspaper germs, I give to you the Diary of a Dramaqueen (cue drumroll and grandiose clash of cymbals) -
It all begins on that first day of auditions. You could be an absolute newbie or an old hand in this business… it doesn't matter how many times you've been to one, an audition can still make you want to run to the toilet in terror every five seconds. Even the cockiest of us still have much to prove or live up to in that room filled with judgmental eyes. But you squeeze your quaking legs together in prayer and close your eyes to visualize everyone in their underwear - a trick we actors use to battle the nerves. It works, momentarily. Deep breath, and you begin to recite. Before you know it, you're done and you've been cast, because as most Sri Lankan theatre productions go, there isn't much of a pool to pick from. So all those nerves on audition day are really just because you're being a Dramaqueen - and rightly so. You can now strut around like a newly-pardoned Thanksgiving turkey, telling all and sundry which role you're playing, whether they ask you or not.
In the next few months you will forget you ever had a social life, or any life at all for that matter, and give every waking moment to learning lines or lyrics, training your voice, improving your stamina and flexibility and procrastinating at your day job while you dream of legendary stardom. This is the time during which your colleagues at the office are treated to spontaneous bursts of ‘ma ma ma ma maaaa’ scales and ascending arpeggios in the washroom. Because we actors tend to take things overboard, you'll also find us explaining haughtily to the management that the gynormous brightly colored scarf we've wrapped around our neck and face like a Middle-Eastern terrorist is to keep throats warm, since nobody was considerate enough to shut off the central air-conditioning for our benefit. We're attention seekers that way. You can always spot an actor in an office environment; they'll be the ones draped sideways over the boardroom armchair, quoting Lady Macbeth to the spot on the whiteboard.
The rest of the body goes through a workout that's no less ridiculous. Like any athlete, actors put themselves through rigorous training in preparation for a show. Rehearsing for a musical? Then by Jove, you will be commanded to do planks while singing your song, in order to strengthen your tummy muscles. Those of you who, like me, never really had a single muscle in that region, will curse the day you ever signed up for the production.
But the curses are soon forgotten when rehearsals begin, because along with the tribulations of physical exercise comes the one thing that forms the addiction we theatre people just cannot kick - the cast bonding. The cast of any theatre production is a very special bunch of individuals (special can be defined in many ways, and most of those definitions apply to theatre people). In all your years of being misunderstood and criticized because of your penchant for drama, you have finally found the warm sunny embrace of like-minded nutjobs who delight in your eccentricities and differences, no questions asked. Truly, theatre groups are the way to world peace.
Before you know it, it's opening night. The butterflies in your stomach have butterflies. The corridors of the theatre are filled with mirth and merriment as excited actors run about in stockings and wigs, experimenting with make-up and laughing at each other. Good luck cards and flowers are received, making you feel rather chuffed and special (this time, there's only one definition that suits). You then take your place behind the curtain and strike your pose. The music begins, the audience hushes, the lights fade on and the curtains are about to part….. and you suddenly have to pee. A wild, furtive glance around you gives you the comforting assurance that everyone else on that stage is also struggling to keep their nervous bladders intact. However, the toilet will have to wait, for the show has just begun. You close your eyes, imagine the audience in their underwear and then you transport yourself into another being.
The rest, as they say, is history. Dazzle or disappoint, the show goes on, and you have been a part of it. At the end of it all you rush into each others’ arms and weep once more (yes, we actors do a lot of that) because you really don't know what to do with yourself now that you no longer have to turn up for rehearsals every evening. Cue the phenomenon known amongst the thespian community as PPD= Post Production Depression - months upon months of wanting to do it all over again. That is, until you see a notice about an audition coming up and you hear those familiar heartstrings tuning up.
It's not easy to explain to someone who doesn't understand why you don't get paid for being a stage actor. How does one put a price on passion?
They'd have to pay me to stay away from it.
