Krishan and Sheshala win Central Province table tennis titles

 
Krishan Wickremaratne of Vidyartha College and Sheshala Bandara of Mahamaya Girls College won the men's and ladies open singles events at the 3rd Central Province Table Tennis Championship 2016 organized by the Kandy District Tale Tennis Association (KDTTA) and worked off at the Jagath Rajapaksa International Table Tennis Indoor Stadium at Doluwa off Peradeniya.
Over 400 paddlers participated in this championship which covered Matale, Kandy. Gampola, Nawalapitiya and Nuwara Eliya and was a major success due to the efforts of the committee of the KDTTA which had to meet heavy overheads as this venue is located nearly 20 kilometres from Kandy. The organising committee headed by by former National coach Mahinda Ellepola did their best to encourage the participation of leading paddlers from the Province providing good competition. Notable absentees from the tournament were national champion Udaya Ranasinghe, Prasad de Silva and Nirmala Jayasinghe who ere away on national duty playing for the country at the 12th South Asian Games 2016 held in Guwathi, India during the same period. But this gave the other paddlers a chance to display their talents.
Seventeen year old Krishan of Vidyartha College often in the shadows of Udaya Ranasinghe did well to win a double. He first won the boys under 18 singles by defeating schoolmate Dinesh Kavishka 3/1 in the finals. The loser started off well by winning the first set 7/11 but Krishan Wickremaratne mopped up in the next three sets without allowing the game go into the fifth set.
Sheshala Bandara of Mahamaya Girls College kept out of table tennis due to her G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examinations last year came back to form by winning the ladies open event defeating the Junior National Champion 14 year old Samadhi Hettirachchi of Mahamaya Girls College 3/0 in the finals. Sheshala Bandara won the first set by the close margin of 13/11 but the loser displayed leaser fight in the next two sets as she was seen often gasping for breath. This was too much for the little girl who played in her third final for the day.
But Samadhi Hettharachchi did not go home without a major trophy as she won the girls under 18 title defeating none other than the open event winner Sheshala Bandara 3/1 in the finals Samadhi Hettiarachchi won the first two sets but lost the third 4/11 and her 11/6 win the fourth set finished of the match. Losing in the quarter finals were top paddlers like Ridmi Kandnarchchi, Janani Pushpakumara and in the semi finals Thanushi Ridrigo and Sandavini Kularatne.
Fourteen year old Thanushi Rodirigo of Mahamaya Girls College won the Girls under 15 title by overcoming Schoolmate Samadhi Hettiarachchi 3/0 in the finals. The loser was often slow as the had some breathing problems but battled on to finish runner up.
