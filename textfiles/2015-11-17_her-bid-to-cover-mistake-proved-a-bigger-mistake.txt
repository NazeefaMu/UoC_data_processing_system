Her bid to cover mistake proved a bigger mistake


	


The New Big Boss who was on an official visit to Bangkok recently was due to meet the compatriot community in that country at a special function on the sidelines of his official engagements. 
Meanwhile, our fair envoy based in the Thai capital had also organized a dance performance by a well-known troupe from here to enliven the occasion. 
Before attending the function, the new Big Boss had wanted to know who the Sri Lankan artistes were billed to perform on the occasion. And he had been highly annoyed to learn that they had got down two artistes who had to appear before a commission probing financial crimes allegedly committed during the previous regime. He immediately cancelled this engagement and later pulled up the madam who was the livewire behind the event, they say.
Undeterred, the madam next organized a gala dinner in honour of the visiting Head of State on board a luxury ship hired for the purpose. She had arranged to entertain the New Big Boss and the other guests invite to the  dinner while the ship was on a two-hour cruise. 
The new Big Boss this time round reacted with anger when he was informed of this offbeat arrangement obviously organized to win brownie points. “I have no hankering for a dinner on board a ship,” he told the madam. “Please stop squandering public funds in this fashion.”
After ordering the cancellation of the dinner on board the ship, the new Big Boss himself had taken the initiative to host a group of his guests to dinner with Sri Lankan culinary delights. 
Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs authorities are set to hold an inquiry into the conduct of this fair envoy for marring the new Big Boss’ visit to Bangkok, they say.
