The UNF has handed over a motion to suspend the expenditure head of the newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, UNF member and Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Rauff Hakeem told a media briefing today.

He said the motion was handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

“We have requested that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa's secretary should be prevented from spending funds on Mr. Rajapaksa's behalf,” Mr. Hakeem said and added that this motion would be taken for debate on November 29.

UNP MP Rajitha Senaratne said this was one of the many steps his party would take to ensure democracy in the country. “We will take more action both in and outside Parliament and these will be made known during the next few days,” he said.

TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said their parties would also support the motion. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
