Lawyers' express dissatisfaction

The Lawyers' Associations at the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court and the Colombo High Court have unanimously decided to launch a protest against the decision of the Galle High Court to file a charge sheet against former Solicitor General Rienzie Arsecularatne, as his mobile phone allegedly rang in the Court room.
The Lawyers' Associations have decided to stage a protest on Thursday (3) outside the Magistrate's Court premises unless the matter was settled by the relevant parties.
