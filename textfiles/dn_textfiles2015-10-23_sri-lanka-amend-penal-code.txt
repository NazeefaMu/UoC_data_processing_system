Sri Lanka to amend the Penal Code


Sri Lanka government has decided to amend the Penal Code to prevent hate speech.


In the past decades instigation on communal basis, hate speech focusing various religious and ethnic groups and related printed material have caused in breach of communal harmony, the Government said.
The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) had recommended that laws should be enacted and empowered for prevention of such behaviours.
Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal made by Minister of Justice, Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapaksa to make suitable amendments to the Penal Code.
The proposed amendments are expected to be submitted to Parliament soon. (Gov.Info)
