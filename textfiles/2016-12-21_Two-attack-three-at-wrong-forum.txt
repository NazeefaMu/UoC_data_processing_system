Two attack three at wrong forum


	



 

Two powerful purohitas had taken up cudgels against three of their colleagues at a very important meeting held recently which was attended by the Top Two of yahapalanaya.

 


The irate duo -- one handling the public purse and the other looking after the health of the nation -- had charged that the three colleagues had become a liability to the government. 


The two purohitas had even expressed their aversion to work in the same team with the trio responsible for key establishments like Police, law courts and kachcheris respectively which had drawn the Number One’s curt reply: “Isn’t this a party issue? Why don’t you sort it out at party level?” And that brought down the curtain on the issue, they say.
