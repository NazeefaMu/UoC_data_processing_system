PM to relinquish power in case of govt’s failure
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday that he had no intention to hold on to power at the expense of the country’s future. He is prepared to forgo power if he cannot take the country on the correct track, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was making a special statement in Parliament yesterday with regard to the government’s stance over demands made by trade unions during discussions held with the representatives of trade unions.
The Prime Minister met trade union representatives headed by National Trade Union Front Chairman Saman Ratnapriya on Saturday and Sunday to discuss concerns pertaining to the 2016 Appropriation Bill.
“I have been in power and out of power. I am using power to build the country. I have no personal agendas. If I cannot use my powers to build the country, I am prepared to let power go and go home. We do not hesitate to take unpopular decisions for the country’s future. Our decisions may be criticized. But, the future generation will endorse our decisions as correct,” Prime Minister said.
He said Rs. 2,000 of Rs. 10,000 allowance given to the public sector employees would be added to their basic salaries from the beginning of the next year. Action would be taken to add the balance to the basic salary in three phases within the next year, he said.
“With this addition, there could be questions pertaining to salary anomalies. We would re-establish the national salary commission. We expect that the commission would submit us a report on public sector salaries within six months,” he said.
The Prime Minister said the government met trade union leaders during the last couple of days. They asked him to reveal the government’s position with regard to their demands, he said.
“The Rajapaksa regime misappropriated the monies of the EPF and ETF. We wanted to amalgamate the two funds to increase security and efficiency. But we would maintain them as two different funds under the the Central Bank. We would take action to prevent anyone abusing the funds. The recruitments made to the public sector from 2005 were not regular and not according to the normal procedure. There are no funds to pay pensions. That is a dangerous situation,” he said.
In 1963, the elderly population was 5.4 percent of the total population. The figure would increase to around 17.8 percent in 2031 and 27.7 percent in 2050.
The life expectancy has increased. In 1961, the life expectancy was 61.5 years, in 2011, it was 75.3 years. This would reach 81 years in 2050, he said.
With the increased life expectancy, the number of years pensions being paid has increased. In 1960s, the average number of years the pension being paid was five years. This stands around 15 years now. It has been estimated that the number of years pensions to be paid would be around 18 years in 2031 and 20 years in 2050. As a result of this, the allocation for pensions in budget proposals has been on the rise, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
In 1961, the allocation for pensions was Rs. 83 million. This has arisen to Rs. 99,961 millions in 2011. It is estimated to be around Rs. four trillion in 2050, he said.
Rulers with a foresight knew about the pension crisis since 1960s. Dr. NM Perera and several others have pointed this out. But there was no genuine effort to address the problem because of petty political objectives, he said.
The Rajapaksa regime did not look into the matter with a scientific perspective, but giving into popular politics, the previous government recruited people to the government service haphazardly. They were not concerned about the fact that there would be no funds to pay pensions for those who recruited after 2005. They played with the future security of the public servants, the Prime Minister said.
“Sri Lanka reached a landmark on January 8. The objective of this journey is to salvage the country from the ditch of corruption and inefficiency and uphold it above marching forward with the rest of the world. It is not an easy task. The journey before us is hard but we must move ahead. There are huge challenges. We would have to think of the common good over personal gains. We would have to make sacrifices,” he said.
“We do all these to ensure a better future for this country.
That was the objective of the policy statement presented to Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena, the mid-term economic policy presented to Parliament by myself and the budget proposals by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake,” he said.
The Prime Minister said the government provided reliefs for the people through the budget proposals and will continue to take measures to improve public welfare.

Money in lieu of fertilizer systematised - Ven. Rathana Thera
JHU MP Ven. Athuruliye Rathana Thera told Parliament yesterday that it is on a systematic way that money is being provided in lieu of the fertilizer subsidy.
“The world is embracing organic fertiliser and moving away from artificial fertilizer. This is why we will be granting money instead of the fertilizer subsidy. We can move on to alternative methods during the next harvesting season.
We are spending a huge amount of foreign exchange to import fertilizer every year. Artificial fertilizer contains substances harmful to humans and animals,” Rathana Thera said.
