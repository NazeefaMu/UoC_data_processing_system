Sooriyawewa ground staff: Their trousers for their wages


	

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said today an investigation would be launched into the incident where temporary ground staff at the Sooriyawewa Stadium in Hambantota were asked to hand over their uniform before being paid their daily wages.

He said he was informed about this incident this morning and would never endorse such action.

“I cannot agree with it at all. What is the use of taking back a trouser worn for six days? I will conduct an investigation into this matter,” he said.

It was reported that about 100 workers who were recruited as ground staff on a temporary basis had gone to obtain their salaries after six days of work at the Sooriyawewa stadium during the Zimbabwe tour and were asked to hand over the trousers given by the SLC before being paid their wages.

The workers were disappointed at this request because they had not taken an extra trouser to wear not expecting to hand over the one given by the SLC. Some of them had no other choice but to return home in their underwear. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
