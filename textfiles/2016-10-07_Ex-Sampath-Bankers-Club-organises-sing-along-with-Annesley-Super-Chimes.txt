A musical extravaganza ‘Sing Along with Annesley & Super Chimes’ will be presented by the Ex Sampath Bankers Club on Sunday, October 23, 2016 at Grand Monarch, Thalawatugoda, commencing 7:00 p.m. 
The proceeds of this event will be used for various projects to be undertaken by the Ex Sampath Bankers Club. The corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects to be undertaken by the club will be mainly to support needy children in their education. In keeping with the reputation that Sampath Bank has for its IT leadership, the club will facilitate IT education by upgrading their school computer laboratories with better equipment and conducting classes for the students in the technology stream. Conducting leadership and other educational and skill development programmes for these needy students is also envisaged. 
The club has already conducted a workshop on smartphone photography for children as its first CSR project. In addition, evening lecture/discussion and networking sessions are conducted for its members.
Ex Sampath Bankers Club was inaugurated in January 2016 and its objectives are to promote fellowship and understanding of its members and also to undertake projects of a charitable nature and/or social value. The membership of the club consists of those who have retired or resigned from service of Sampath Bank. Among the members are those who have tirelessly served Sampath Bank as members of the corporate management of the bank as well as those who had served in all other ranks since its inception in 1987.  The sing-along will be an evening to remember for the audience with Annesley and his band taking them down memory lane with their favourites and the best hits of the 60s and 70s.
