A block of land in Medamulana belonging to Major Neville Wanniarachchi, who was former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s chief security officer, was dug up using a backhoe in search of buried cash, jewellery and weapons.


About 20 STF personnel had been deployed for the digging amid high security to prevent any trespasses.


The Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya recently ordered the CID and the FCID to conduct investigations into frauds and corruptions allegedly committed by Major Wanniarachchi.


The CID informed court that the Major Wanniarachchi had forcibly acquired barren lands belonging to the state and several houses. (Chandrasena Gamage)
