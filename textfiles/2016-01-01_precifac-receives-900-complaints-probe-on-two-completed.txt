PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille de Silva said today the commission was able to complete investigations into two complaints out of 25 major complaints received in 2015.
He said the commission had received 900 complaints in 2015 of which 300 were referred to its police investigation team.
“Our commission has been able to complete investigating two major cases in five months since the setting up of the police team in July last year. Even though the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) was established in March last year, the investigations began only in August after the appointment of police personnel. Investigations into two other complaints would be completed in the next two months,” Mr. Silva said.
He said complaints into misappropriation and financial irregularities in SriLankan airlines, Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd., the Coconut Development Authority, Lak Sathosa, the State- owned ITN and the National Housing Development Authority were among the major investigations that were being carried out by PRECIFAC.
Mr. Silva said in addition to the police personnel carrying out investigations, four High Court Judges and a former Auditor General have been appointed to assist the commission. (Ajith Siriwardana)
