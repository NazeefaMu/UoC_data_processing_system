Train services to the North, East and Puttlam have been cancelled this morning after a container damaged the Kelaniya Railway Bridge, the Railway Control Room said today.

The container which was heading to Biyagama had attempted to travel under the bridge, which was too low, not taking into consideration the height of the cargo it carried. The accident had damaged the bridge causing the disruption in train services.

The Control room said the accident had pushed the railway track to the side by atleast five feet.

The Railways Bridge Supervisor will inspect the damage today while the Railroad Maintenance Way Supervisor will assess if the track can be used for services.  

The Railway Control Room said the bridge had been damaged on two occasions previously and that it was currently in the midst of renovations.

Train services will be restricted to a single railway line until further notice. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
