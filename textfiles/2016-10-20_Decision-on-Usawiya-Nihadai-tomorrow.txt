The decision on the restraining order imposed on the film 'Usawiya Nihandai' has been fixed tomorrow by Colombo District Court Judge M. U. Gunawardena.

The restraining order was issued by District Court Judge after taking into consideration a petition filed by former magistrate Lenin Ratnayake that the film directed by Prasanna Vithanage was based on a false story relating to him and it had defamed the judiciary. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
