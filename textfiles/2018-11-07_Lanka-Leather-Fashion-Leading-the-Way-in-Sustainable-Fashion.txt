Leading high-end leather garment manufacturer, Lanka Leather Fashion (LLF), was awarded CarbonNeutral® status for a fourth consecutive year by the independent sustainability verification, validation, and assurance body – The Sustainable Future Group (SFG). 

With the assistance of The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC) — Sri Lanka’s leader in Integrated Sustainability Solutions – LLF underwent a comprehensive assessment of their organisational greenhouse gases (GHGs) to determine its environmental impact. The impact was then compensated for through the reinvestment in a renewable energy project in the Ratnapura and Kandy districts of Sri Lanka, in return for registered Carbon Credits to match their Carbon Footprint. 

LLF continues to push the boundaries when it comes to introducing diverse initiatives to tackle social and environmental issues within the workplace and communities in Sri Lanka. Through the introduction of new technologies and adaptation of newer, greener and more efficient business practices, LLF has been able to continuously lower its operational expenses and enhance employee engagement. From using discarded leather waste to create new products for clients to joining forces with a local fashion designer to create upcycled leather jewellery, LLF is helping create a sustainable culture within its communities. 

Sanith de S Wijeyeratne, CEO of CCC, congratulated LLF on their efforts by stating, “LLF is an noteworthy example of what a company can achieve when focusing on getting the balance right between the social, environmental and economic impacts of its business operations. Marco, along with his team, have done an extraordinary job leveraging their niche position in the market to change the conversation in its supply chain across the globe. We are a proud partner and hope to continue this fruitful relationship as they continue on their sustainability journey.”

Marco Weidemann, Director of Lanka Leather Fashion, added, “With the ever-evolving business landscape, we are proud to be on the forefront of sustainable innovation, methodically finding ways to reduce our global footprint in the luxury leather market. Apart from an environmental benefit, we are starting to see the economic benefits in cutting our energy spend while improving other business processes. Our aim is to build a greener future, and appreciate the guidance The Carbon Consulting Company has provided us over the past four years.”
