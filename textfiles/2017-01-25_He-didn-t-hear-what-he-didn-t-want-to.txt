Number One in yahapalanaya had occasion the other day to have a chat with a deputy of a key ministry who entered Diyawanna from a remote area. 

 


In the course of small talk, Number One had casually asked the deputy how the work in the Ministry was going on, the deputy had replied: “Sir, though the name of our portfolio is high sounding, there is hardly any work for us to do. So my boss and I just sit there blinking.”


The deputy had added after a chuckle: “Sir, my boss and I are getting along well because no work means no issue to quarrel over either. After all he is not unhappy about the situation, because he has got ample time on hand to attend to his affairs in the Moneragala area!”


The deputy had stopped talking when he found that Number One appeared deep in thought, hardly listening to him.
