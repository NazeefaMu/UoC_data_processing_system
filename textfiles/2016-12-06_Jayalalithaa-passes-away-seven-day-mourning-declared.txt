J Jayalalithaa, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu state, has died in a Chennai hospital, nearly three months after she was admitted there. She was 68. Jayalalitha breathed her last at 11.30pm, hospital said in a statement.

The 68-year-old leader suffered the cardiac arrest hours after AIADMK said that Jayalalithaa will return home “soon” as an AIIMS expert team confirmed she has completely recovered after over two months of hospitalisation.

Jayalalitha was hospitalised on September 22 after she complained of fever and dehydration. The hospital, which had been issuing bulletins on her health status, had later said she was being treated for infection with respiratory support, among others.

A seven day mourning has been declared in the state. Schools and colleges will also remain closed. (indianexpress)
