In a response to the claim by MP Bandula Gunawardane that the Mathematics paper of the GCE O/L Examination was too difficult for students, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that he would inform the Examination Department and do justice for the students if there was a common issue.

 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said they were not hesitant to solve any issues in the Government examinations.


“Examination papers are not made to answer with ease. They are there to test the competency of the candidates. However, in the said incident, if a majority of students claimed that the paper was too difficult and allocated time was not sufficient, I will consider it and inform the Department of Examination with necessary instructions,” Kariyawasam said.
