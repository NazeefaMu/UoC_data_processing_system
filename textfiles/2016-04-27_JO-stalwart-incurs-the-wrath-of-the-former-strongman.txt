The JO stalwart from the upcountry, addressing a public meeting in his hometown, had fired a broadside at the top men of the former regime for the blunders they had committed while in power, and the ousted strongman and his clan now quite close to the JO have taken umbrage at this attack. 

 


The irate former strongman had not only upbraided the upcountry JO stalwart, but also had boycotted a public rally organised in his area. By the way, the former strongman had been invited to chair this meeting, they say.
