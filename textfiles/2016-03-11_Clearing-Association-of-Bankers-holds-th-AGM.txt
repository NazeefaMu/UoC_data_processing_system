This Association was formed in 2008 with the objective of “enhancing the knowledge of Bankers as well as to promote the good will, understanding and fellowship among Bankers engaged in clearing.” last year too we were able to fulfill above objective with holding much awaited Inter Bank Quiz program & the most famous Inter Bank Softball Cricket tournament with a large participation. On the success of these events we were able to build up our membership to a greater extent.
Upul de Silva of People’s Bank was re-elected as the President.
