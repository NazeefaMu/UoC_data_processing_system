A large crowd was seen protesting against bull fighting in several areas in the Northern Province during Thai Pongal.

At these events several of the bulls end up severely injured while the onlookers resort to gambling. Bull fighting is prohibited in many countries.

In Sri Lanka it is not banned though gambling is prohibited.

Many animal rights activists say bull fighting which is a form of cruelty to animals should be stopped. (Romesh Madushanka)
