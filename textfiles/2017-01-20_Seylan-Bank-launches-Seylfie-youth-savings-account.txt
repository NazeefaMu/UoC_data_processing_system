Yet again revolutionizing the banking industry in Sri Lanka, Seylan Bank has launched a state-of-the-art digital bank account for the youth of Sri Lanka named - Seylan Seylfie. 
A brand-new youth account experience for those between 18 and 26 years, Seylan Seylfie offers unique benefits for its tech-savvy target group. Seylan Bank has partnered with the country’s leading telecom provider Dialog Axiata PLC to offer various digital benefits for this data-loving customer segment.
With Seylan Seylfie, the bank has pioneered the ‘digital interest’ concept, which is a world first between a bank and a mobile operator, with interest on savings accounts credited directly to Dialog mobiles of youth account holders as a top-up for data, voice, etc., if the account holder 
so wishes. 
The Seylan Seylfie chip-based debit card offers an array of benefits and discounts while shopping, dining or holidaying. Seylan Seylfie offers free cash grants of up to Rs.25,000 to account holders on turning 21 and on completion of a graduate degree or professional qualification, which adds immense value to the account holder based on the account balance. 
Student, educational and other business loans are also available at attractive rates. Further, youth could open a special current account with customized cheque book as well, subject to complying with a few conditions. A special credit card is also offered if the youth earns a monthly permanent income of over Rs.15,000 and designed to give the youth the flexibility to spend responsibly.
Leveraging on the age group’s love for social media, Seylan Seylfie also offers social banking via Facebook. The account holders who register for Seylan Internet banking can log in to their Facebook profile and use the Seylan social banking app with convenient benefits such as pay-a-friend, balance inquiries. This feature also allows you to pay mobile and other bills and carry out other convenient 
banking services.
