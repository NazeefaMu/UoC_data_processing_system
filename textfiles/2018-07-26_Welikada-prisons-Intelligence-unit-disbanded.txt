The Welikada Prison Intelligence Unit was disbanded with immediate effect by Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalata Atukorala today.

The ministry said the decision was taken following the findings of an investigation conducted into several corruption and irregularities reported in the Prisons Department.

Recent investigations alleged that several prison officials have reportedly maintained contacts with prison inmates who are accused of drugs trafficking. It was also reported that with the help of some prison officials, the inmates were getting mobile phones.

Earlier, the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) also found a list of about eight contact numbers suspected to be of prison officials, from a mobile phone of the the main suspect arrested with the stock of 103 kg of heroin early this month.

The Prisons Department has been informed to carry out an internal investigation regarding these Prison Officials. (DS)
