	The Police Department will adopt a new policy regarding recruitments, promotions and transfers. The policy has been referred to the National Police Commission, police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said yesterday.
	He said the need for a new policy had been stressed for a long time.
	The need for such a policy was vital, as the procedures had been changed many times in the past due to political interference, he said.
	He said it would give the public and those who wish to join the service a clear indication of the necessary qualifications, and those in service what it takes to move up.
	It is also important to have a policy regarding transfers and, therefore, a new procedure has been formulated, he said.
	There will be new procedures for the recruitment and promotion of inspectors and senior gazetted officers
	The department will recruit policemen to three different ranks; namely, constables, sub inspectors (with educational qualifications of having passed the G.C.E Advanced Level) and assistant superintendents (with a bachelor’s degree or higher).
	The procedures for recruitment of sub inspectors and ASPs have been sent for approval to the NPC. The procedures for recruiting police constables and constable drivers are still being formulated.
	The new policy is to individually look into the promotions of inspectors, ASPs and deputy inspectors general.
	The procedures were referred to the NPC last week and will come into effect once the NPC approves them.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
