Another victim of the game that knows no rules


	



 

A move made to appoint an ambassador to head our diplomatic mission in Berlin has run into a tangle, they say.

 


Government initially decided to appoint a senior foreign service diplomat to fill this key post now vacant and the concurrence of the German government for the appointment too was duly obtained. And then came a communication from a high authority recommending that a certain lady much junior to the initial choice be appointed. So they cancelled the first appointment and sought German government’s concurrence for the second choice. 


Meanwhile, the senior high-ups in the foreign service got highly perturbed on hearing that an injustice had been done to a senior colleague of theirs to make way for a political favorite, and they made a complaint to Number One in yahapalanaya. 


Number One who gave them an attentive hearing immediately suspended the appointment given to the junior lady. 


However, given the wrangling going on over the choice of an appointee, all indications are that the chair in Berlin will remain vacant for a further period, they say.
