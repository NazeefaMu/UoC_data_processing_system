Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the Central Bank staff transfers that had taken place are on disciplinary grounds.
“They need to be disciplined,” he said, and added that the staff concerned could not be let off the hook with minute disciplinary action.
 Mirror Business reported yesterday that over 100 officials from below senior management levels to minor officials were transferred from their positions.
 The transfers were enforced without any prior notice, as the officers were notified of their new responsibilities only Wednesday morning.
 Prior to that, over 15 senior Central Bank officials were transferred, again without any advance notice.
 At a press briefing held at the Central Bank this Monday, Governor Mahendran maintained that these transfers are routine.
 He said that this year’s rotational transfer procedure was delayed due to the elections. He noted that those officials who had completed five years in one department were eligible for transfers.(Chandeepa Wettasinghe)
