Backdoor bid misfired!


	



 

A political chief overseeing a distant province had phoned up the Number One in yahapalanaya.

 


The purpose of his call was to seek the Lokka’s pull to bail out the father of a team colleague in hot water.


The chief explained to the Big Boss that the father of his team colleague hailing from a high-class family in the plantation domain had been made to suffer a stay in the Welikada State lodge after getting involved in a case and appealed to him to deliver him from the fate awaiting him.


This appeal made on behalf of a dude awaiting justice at the Welikada lodge sent Number One into a fury. “I say,” he had shouted into the phone.

“Don’t try to rub every bit of muck in this country on my body. I have got enough problems to worry about…You had better mind your own business!”


The Number One had hung up just as the provincial chief had begun making his meek apology, they say.
