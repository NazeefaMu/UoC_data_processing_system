No point of allocating Rs 270mn for NEC: Herath


	

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath today charged that there was no point in allocating Rs 270 million through the 2018 budget for the National Economic Council (NEC) as the country’s economic reforms were being handled by the Economic Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Therefore he questioned whether there was a need to pump more money into the NEC as the duties are already being handled by the PM's committee and as such would end up getting duplicated.

He said this shows that the present government has no economic vision for the nation and added that the budget 2018 was only going to add an additional burden onto the public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
