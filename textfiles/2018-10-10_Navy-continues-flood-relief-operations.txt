Responding to the emergencies following the adverse weather condition in the island, several groups of naval personnel belonging to the Navy’s Diving Unit, Special Boat Squadron and Rapid Response Rescue and Release Unit (4RU) were engaged to remove logs and branches of trees clogged underside of the Avithawa Bridge in Galle, restricting the downstream of water and posing a threat of flood condition in the area. Navy teams averted the possible threat with their prompt action.
