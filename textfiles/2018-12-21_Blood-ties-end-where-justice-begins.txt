Blood ties end where justice begins!


	



 

There is a young popular Diyawanna member who has been compelled to visit Aluthkade now and then for shooting off his mouth.

 


Whenever the young politico visits Aluthkade, an elderly physician highly respected by both the young and the old in his community would accompany him and scribes and videographers would mob them as they walk together towards the august complex.


The elderly physician would enjoy brief a chat with media personnel in the precincts of the august complex and turn back to his waiting car when the time is about to begin proceedings inside and the young politico would go inside the complex alone.


Some people who watch this scene describe it as a typical episode from a movie.
