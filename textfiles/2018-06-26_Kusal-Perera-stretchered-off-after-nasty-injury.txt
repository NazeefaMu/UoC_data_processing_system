Sri Lanka's Kusal Perera was stretchered into a waiting ambulance after a nasty fielding incident shortly before dinner on the third day of the third Test in Barbados.

Perera was fielding at long-on from the bowling of Dilruwan Perera, when West Indies tailender Shannon Gabriel launched the ball high and in his general direction.
