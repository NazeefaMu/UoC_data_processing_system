Ministers not in favour of ban on pandals


	

The proposal made by the Minister of Buddha Sasana Gamini Jayawickrama Perera to the Cabinet yesterday banning Wesak Pandals and Danasalas was turned down by the Ministers severely objecting to the proposal.

In the midst of the opposition by the Ministers, Minister Jayawickrama Perera had opined that this was an idea mooted by the Mahanayakes.

Ministers who expressed objections had voiced saying that putting up Pandals and conducting Danasalas during Wesak had been a tradition for a long time, and therefore restrictions cannot be imposed, however a request can be made to have the Pandals exhibited on another day avoiding the Poya day, but it is appropriate time that the Dansalas are organized on the Poya Day, the Ministers had commented.
