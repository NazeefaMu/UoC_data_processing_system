Careem jewellers recently unveiled its spacious distinctively designed flagship store, which is prestigiously located at Cambridge Place, Colombo-7.

Careems is one of Sri Lanka’s oldest luxury jewellers. Established in 1890, Careems is renowned for creating exceptional artisanal jewellery and for providing a connoisseur’s selection of fine gemstones. The new showroom spanning an area of around 2000 square feet is a reflection of Careems ethos in design creativity, virtuous craftsmanship and uncompromising quality. Unique in its layout is that the store features three different areas to cater to the varying needs of Careems diverse patrons.

The exterior of the store has a clean form and beautiful shimmering copper-brown appearance. The glass façade entrance leads to the main hall of the store where the interior reflects tones of gold, brown and Champaign. A nostalgic photo wall illustrates the 128year heritage of Careems.

A one of a kind sculpture made from tools used to manufacture jewellery is a novel addition to the store. Most importantly an impressive collection of classical and contemporary jewellery and gemstones adorn numerous wall and table showcases positioned around the showroom.

As one walks further into the store a completely different enclosure ‘The Diamond Room’ emerges. This special room boasts a delightful blooming chandelier, white carpet and silky white walls. This room houses an array of diamond, bridal and fashion forward jewellery specially curated to suite the younger generation. There is also a pretty dresser where one can sit and try out numerous styles of jewellery.

A third room ‘The Designers Lounge’ caters to Careems specialty for bespoke design and craftsmanship. A comfortable sofa in Careems branded blue colour dominates the lounge, which overlooks a tranquil Japanese garden. This is an area where one can enjoy perusing numerous jewellery design books while composing their personalized jewellery designs with one of Careems’ award-winning designers.

Commenting on the new flagship store, Careems Managing Director Shezard Careem said, “Careems at Cambridge Place will provide the ultimate luxury pinnacle for jewellery and gemstone enthusiasts. Having conceptualized this store over many years and seeing it brought to life had been an amazing experience. We hope that it will bring unrivalled enjoyment and fulfilment to our wonderful customers in Sri Lanka and around the world.”
