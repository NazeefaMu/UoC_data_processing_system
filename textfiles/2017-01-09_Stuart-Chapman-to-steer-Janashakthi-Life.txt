Janashakthi Insurance PLC, a leading Insurance provider in Sri Lanka, announced the appointment of Stuart Chapman as Director/Chief Executive Officer for its Life Business with effect from January, 1, 2017.
In 2015, Janashakthi, along with other Insurance providers, split its composite business segregating the Life and Non-Life sectors into two separate entities. In line with the latest IBSL regulations, all Insurance providers are further required to appoint a separate Principal Officer for each segregated business entity, who must also hold the position of Chief Executive Officer or Managing Director of the company. Aligning itself with these regulations and with the aim of increasing its focus on the Life business, Janashakthi made the strategic decision to appoint a separate Chief Executive Officer for Janashakthi Life.
A consummate professional with extensive expertise in the Life Insurance business, Stuart will focus on Life Sales & Distribution, Life Operations & Training, and Life Complaints Management at Janashakthi, adding greater value to the overall business.

We wish him all the very best as we gear ourselves as an organisation with intensified focus and determination to attain our vision of lighting the lamp of Insurance in every home and workplace,” said Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.
