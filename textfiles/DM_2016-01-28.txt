Cabinet not decided on Anthem language
	
	The Cabinet is reportedly divided over the opinion on the proposal to sing the National Anthem both in Sinhala and Tamil languages at the National Independence Day event this time, it is learnt.
	A committee working on national reconciliation has proposed this to the Cabinet yesterday. However, a section of the Ministers was opposed to the idea. Therefore, a final decision was not taken.
	The committee has made such a proposal in the hope that it would be a step forward in the direction of bringing about reconciliation among the ethnic groups. Currently, the National Anthem is sung in Tamil, mainly at events in the Tamil speaking areas.
	After the ministers exchanged their views in this respect, President Maithripala Sirisena said he would decide on it after discussing it with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
	He also asked the Ministers not to talk about it any further.
	Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne are among those who stood for the National Anthem to be sung in both the languages.
	During the previous rule, then National Languages and Social Integration Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara proposed a bilingual national anthem to be worked out and it led to a controversy at that time, prompting the Public Administration Ministry to issue a circular how the National Anthem should be sung.

	The Homagama Magistrate today rejected the bail application submitted on behalf of the Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary the Ven. Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera, who was remanded till February 9 on the charge of contempt of court.
	Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake said it was quite evident that the suspects act of contempt of court was pre-panned and had undermined the peoples sovereignty. He said he was not scared of any threat and that he would not change his decision even at gun point.
	Attorney Sumudu Kantha Hewage had submitted the bail application last morning.
	Lawyers appearing for the Thera he had been involved in the incident due to his young age and his sentiments for the nation and the religion and that it was not pre-panned. They moved for the Thera's release on conditional bail.
	Attorney Sudath Wickeremaratne representing the Homagama Bar Association objected to the release of the Thera that saying he got involved through ignorance of the law was not an admissible plea.
	He told Court the suspect had been released earlier on the charge of breach of civil law and that he was responsible for creating Sinhala-Muslim clashes in Beruwala which wreaked havoc in Dharga Town, Beruwela.
	The Attorney said he was not prepared to call the suspect a Buddhist monk and insult the Buddhist monks of high calibre who upheld their dignity. He said he would like to introduce the suspect as a thug in robes and pointed out that the suspect shouted slogans that he would not respect the law of the Brown Sahibs and challenged the Court to arrest him and twenty other Buddhist monks who were with him and even insulted the lawyers representing the Attorney Generals Department. The attorney said they witnessed the behavior of a group of individuals in robes who obstructed the court proceedings on the day the suspect was arrested.
	Attorney Shantha Warnakulasuriya appearing for the Thera said the group of individuals who obstructed the case proceedings on Tuesday had not accompanied the suspect.
	The Magistrate who rejected the bail application told court that he would not take decisions under pressure of protests or at the instigation of any individual. He pointed out that the causing obstructions to Court proceedings amounted to contempt of court and insulting the state officials to that of obstructing their duty. The Mgistrate said he found no reason to change his order in two days.
	He informed the parties to the case that he would refer the case to the Appeal Court or take any other action on the instructions of the Attorney General. (Muditha Dayananda)

"Myself, the President and the others in the government are of the same view," he said.

Inauguration of the solar energy system at the Sampath Bank Colombo Super branch
Solar energy system installed at Colombo super branch in Dharmapala Mawatha In line with one of its core CSR pillars, Environment Protection a n d C o n s e r v a t i o n  , Sampath Bank, renowned as a responsible corporate citizen, installed its first solar energy system at the Sampath Bank Colombo super branch in Dharmapala Mawatha. The bank ceremonially inaugurated the installation of its first Solar System at the Colombo super branch premises on December 03rd 2015.
Commenting on the initiative Sampath Bank Chief Operating Officer Nanda Fernando, said: At Sampath Bank we take our sustainability goals to the heart of our business. W h i l s t i n v e s t i n g i n initiatives that protect and conserve the environment, weve taken steps to i n t e g r a t e s u s t a i n a b l e practices in carrying out our business. Installing our very first Solar Energy System is therefore yet another step taken by the bank in venturing into a new dimension of adopting environmentally friendly energy sources.
I want to also express my gratitude to the team of experts from Genso Power Technologies who offered their services to make yet another one of our sustainability operations a success. Based on the performances of this pilot installation, we hope to equip several other branch outlets with energy solar systems within the next year, he added. Sampath Banks solar energy system possesses the ability to generate almost fifty megawatt hours (50,000kWh) of clean and green energy to the national grid. Covering two third of day time energy usage of the bank premises, this solar system will create a comfortable and a refreshing banking environment for the Sampath employees and customers. Further, the solar energy system reduces the carbon emissions to the atmosphere by thirty metric tonnes (30MT) annually, which is equivalent to planting almost 200 trees on soil.
This environmental benefit further fulfills the banks passion to protect and conserve the environment whilst contributing to reduce the impact made on ecosystems, climate change, health and quality of life, economic growth and environmental sustainability.

He said;
It was an honour to meet former President Nasheed, who I think did an excellent job for his country in cutting out corruption and turning that important country round. He suffered terribly from being in prison, and it is good that he is able to get out to seek medical treatment, but we want to see a change in behaviour from the Maldivian Government to make sure that political prisoners are set free. Yes, we are prepared to consider targeted action against individuals if further progress is not made. Let us hope that the diplomatic efforts, including by the Commonwealth action group, will lead to the changes we want to see.
