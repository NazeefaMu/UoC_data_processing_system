While claiming that a coalition of VIP 'robbers' both in the government and the opposition had managed to delay the debate on the bond commission report and the PRECIFAC report, President Maithripala Sirisena today challenged them to hold the debate on the bond commission and PRECIFAC report before February 10, prior to the Local Government elections.

Addressing an election propaganda rally in Panadura, President Sirisena said a coalition of VIP 'robbers' involved in the bond scam attached to the government and the opposition had gathered at a house in Borella and decided to delay the debate on both reports.

President Sirisena said they had met the day before when Parliament decided to hold the debate after the election.

President Sirisena said after receiving the bond commission report by him, the opposition had continuously urged to hold a debate on it and to make it a public document immediately.

“By then I had not read the full report. Within three days time, I went through it and made a statement with regard to it. Then, the bond commission and PRECIFAC reports were presented in Parliament,”

He said however, surprisingly these parties were silent after presenting these two reports to the Parliament and they had decided to hold the debate after the Local Government election.

“Both these parties have decided to hold the debate on both reports after the election since it would expose the nakedness of both these parties. Therefore I challenge all these heroes to hold this debate at least for one day before February 10,” he said. (Muditha Dayananda)
