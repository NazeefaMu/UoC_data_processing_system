Seylan Bank offers its esteemed credit card members fabulous holiday experiences at exquisite Cinnamon’s resort properties this season. 
Through its exclusive partnership with Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts, Seylan Bank offers its credit card members amazing deals which break down all barriers to revelling in their dream holiday! Seylan cards have earned a reputation as the best cards to own for the best deals. No holiday can be truly fulfilling without the swipe of a Seylan credit card and the amazing benefits and the best value it offers. 
Seylan Bank Deputy General Manager Retail Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera said, “Our discerning credit card members have come to expect unprecedented offers from Seylan Bank and we are delighted to fulfil their expectations year after year by extending exclusive holiday offers that unfailingly exceed their expectations. We engage closely with customers to understand their aspirations and hope for their dream holiday and will continue to offers such exclusive lifestyle experiences for our valued credit card customers through future offers and benefits in the months ahead.”
This year too, Seylan Bank has risen to the occasion by extending impressive 40 percent savings for Seylan credit card members and 25 percent savings on Seylan debit cards at Cinnamon’s resort properties. The card members can also avail of a further 10 percent discount on dining at Cinnamon’s resorts and a 25 percent discount off full body massages at the Balinese Azmaara Spa. All these offers are valid until May 31, 2017. The discounts on the dining and spa can even be used independently of a stay at the resorts, perhaps on long drives to any nearby Cinnamon’s resort property to spice up a weekend. 
The fact that customers can convert their payment into Seylan’s Easy Pay Plan offers further unmatched convenience for holiday-goers. It is the only payment plan in Sri Lanka to give the flexibility of choosing from multiple monthly instalment plans. As one of Sri Lanka’s premium hotel chains, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts offers a range of signature vibrant experiences at its stunning properties.
Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts Head of Sales and Marketing Leisure Resorts Sri Lanka and the Maldives Romesh Walpola added, “We are delighted to partner with Seylan Bank on this promotion and we are confident that this will encourage more of the bank’s clientele to join our constantly growing database of local guests. The domestic market is one of the largest contributing markets to our overall guest nationality mix and we remain committed to growing this market year-on-year. With the view to provide all our guests with the very best products and services, we look forward to more mutually beneficial initiatives, such as this in the future.”
