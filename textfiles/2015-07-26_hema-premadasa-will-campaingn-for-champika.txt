Former first lady Hema Premadasa today extended support to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka for his Colombo District campaign for the August 17 general election, a media release from his office said.
President Ranasinghe Premadasa's widow joined Minister Ranawaka at the Ape Gama complex in Battaramulla where the minister explained his policies while launching his propaganda campaign.
The late president Premadasa's son Sajity is contesting from Hambantota under the UNP and is the district group leader.
Minister Ranawaka told those who had gathered there that just like the manner in which different ethnic and religious groups came together in 1947 to form the United National Party (UNP) several groups with diverse ideologies have joined together to bring about a fresh beginning to the Sri Lankan nation.
