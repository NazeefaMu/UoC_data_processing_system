Sri Lanka's sovereignty never disturbed

"The US initiated resolution clearly recognises sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka".
So states the paragraph 16 of the resolution welcoming the government's commitment to a political settlement through necessary constitutional measures. The resolution also encourages the Government's efforts to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population. The Government of Sri Lanka is thereby encouraged to enable all Provincial Councils to be able to operate effectively, in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Therefore the resolution will reap healthy benefits according to Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr Rajitha Senaratne.
Excerpts:
Q: What are your views on the domestic mechanism to probe war crimes?
A: Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa met UN Secretary General Ban Ki- moon on 23rd of May, 2009. The two leaders discussed about war crimes. Rajapaksa promised UN Secretary General to investigate and take action accordingly.
On May 27, the then Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Dr. Dayan Jayatilleke submitted a 11-point proposal to the UNHRC (United Nations Human Rights Council) and that was adopted by the UN. At that time, certain people opposed it but we managed to adopt the same by a majority and agreed to initiate a war crime investigation.
In his proposals, he spelt out good Governance and other prerequisites to create a better Human rights environment. That was how it all began. But the only problem was that the Government did not act on what they promised to the UN. It created a conflict between the Government and the UN. In the final resolution brought by the US it states thus: "Recognizing that the investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes in Sri Lanka requested in Human Rights Council resolution 25/1 was necessitated by the absence of a credible national process of accountability".
Here the resolution very clearly says in the absence of a credible national process, it necessitated them to take this course of action. Thereafter in the next resolution they wanted an international investigation. Sri Lanka lost when it was tabled at the UNHRC. That proposal was adopted by majority.
The third proposal they won was by a bigger majority. India also supported that resolution. Now it has come to a point that the UN Human Rights Council brought a proposal of a hybrid mechanism but Sri Lankan Government could, with effort and diplomatic skills, bring it down to be a domestic inquiry. All the countries, including the US, will support that. All the countries which supported us in the past such as China and Russia and the countries which opposed us like India will come together and support us. It will pass as a consensus resolution for a domestic inquiry and this is very important.
Q: What about the involvement of foreign judges?
A: It is explained in the resolution. It is clearly explained in paragraph six. It welcomes government's recognition that accountability is essential to uphold the rule of law and build confidence in the people of all communities of Sri Lanka and the justice system. It also notes with appreciation that "the Government of Sri Lanka's proposal to establish a Judicial Mechanism with a Special Counsel to investigate allegations of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, as applicable; and affirms that a credible justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for integrity and impartiality; and further affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsel's office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators."
In paragraph number 20, the proposal states thus "encourages the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant special procedures mandate holders to provide, in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Government of Sri Lanka, advice and technical assistance on implementing the above mentioned steps". It clearly says the participation of foreign judges will be in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Government of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has to decide on the degree of participation. The participation may be as observers, technical assistants, and technical advisers or in some other way. It should not be the judges. They have agreed in the same proposal that this would be with the concurrence of the Sri Lankan Government.
Q: Can you describe the new legal measures that will be introduced to facilitate the domestic inquiry?
A: That we have to work out with the consultation of the UN. We have to have some kind of framework which is acceptable to the International community. It should be on par with International standards. That type of legal framework should be set up. Discussions will have to start on the relevant mechanism.
Also in paragraph number 16 it welcomes the government's commitment to a political settlement by introducing necessary constitutional measures and it also encourages the Government's efforts to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population. It also encourages the Government to enable Provincial Councils to be able to operate effectively, in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. This is very reasonable because it does not speak about 13 plus as envisaged by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Now it is only the implementation of 13th Amendment.
Further the resolution states that it encourages the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant special procedure mandate holders to provide, in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Government of Sri Lanka, advise and technical assistance in implementing the steps stipulated above.
Q: What are your views on the criticism being levelled against the domestic inquiry?
A: The paragraph 4 of the resolution says "reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka".
According to this, they will abide by the sovereignty. They will abide by the independence and they will especially abide by the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Whatever the proposals they bring, whatever the actions they suggest, it will be within the ambit of sovereignty of Sri Lanka.
They, specifically and without any alteration, accept the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Therefore nobody needs to worry over that.
The other important fact that is included as paragraph number 10 of the proposal is "reaffirming that all Sri Lankans are entitled to the full enjoyment of their human rights regardless of religion, belief or ethnicity, in a peaceful and unified land". This means it is under a unified land. Not in a separated land. It is very clear. Everything will be done accepting the fact that Sri Lanka is a unitary state.
In paragraph number 21 of the resolution says "Requesting the Government of Sri Lanka to implement effectively the constructive recommendations made in the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission". It says only the constructive recommendations and not all the recommendations made in the LLRC Report.
Q: What is your response to the former President's recent statement?
A: He has not read the Resolution properly. He takes advice from Dr. Jayatilleke, Prof. Peries and the likes. They can give various interpretations and can speak for and against any subject. That depends on the benefits they may reap. In the past, they spoke for and against the former President depending on whether they are being looked after by him or not.
Q: The future of Malabe private medical faculty (SAITAM) has been a hot topic. What is the current situation?
A: The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) appointed a special committee to formulate a report on Malabe private medical college. Now the report has been handed over to the SLMC by that special committee and according to this report, there are certain things that need to be improved by the Malabe Medical faculty. The report has both pluses and minuses. The SLMC handed over the report to me and I sent it to the SAITAM for their comments and submit their proposals. If both parties can come together on the various proposals such as facilities and other standards, the matter can be resolved.
Q: During some recent press conferences, some doctors criticized the slow implementation of the National Drug Policy. Do you accept the criticism?
A: The person who commented does not know anything about the implementation of a policy, governance etc. Such matters cannot be implemented overnight. First of all, the act should be passed in Parliament and then the authority should be created. We have attended to these. Then we have an onus of introducing regulations to create the authority, furnish the place etc. Specific powers had to be given and the Cabinet decisions had to be taken. We did all those.
After the General Election, the second stage of the process has already commenced in order to gazette the regulations. Only after gazetting the regulations, we can take action against drugs. This is not an easy task. We need to recruit 100 pharmacists to carry out this operation. This will be similar to the Consumer Affairs Authority. Thousands of pharmacies scattered all over the country need to be inspected in order to find out whether they follow relevant rules and regulations. This is a huge task. Qualified persons have already been appointed to the authority. They are now moving forward.
In the meanwhile, we allowed the use of the trade name within brackets. We need to set up the quality assurance laboratory. The Chinese Government granted the lab following my coordination. Those things also had been done in addition to the other tasks but the persons who speak do not know anything.
