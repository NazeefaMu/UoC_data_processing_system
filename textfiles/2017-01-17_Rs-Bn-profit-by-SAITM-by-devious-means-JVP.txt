Monetary rewards and politics had resulted in the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) earning an illegal profit more than Rs.1.2 billion, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)said today.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said this after last morning's meeting with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) officials including its President Prof. Carlo Fonseka.

When asked by a journalist about the SLMC's response responded to the request made by the JVP for the SLMC to refrain from recognising those who pass out as doctors from SAITM, the JVP leader said money and politics had made the SLMC and the government to stand firm on this matter.

He said SLMC should follow the recommendations made by the 10-member committee it had appointed.

“The ten member committee comprising Prof. Rezvi Sheriff, Dr. L.B.L. de Alwis, Prof. Nilanthi de Silva, Prof. Ranil Fernando, Prof. Ranjani Gamage, Prof. Wasantha Gunathunga, Dr. B.J.C. Perera, Dr. Hemantha Perera, Prof. K. Sivapalan and Dr. H.M.S.S.D. Herath had recommended that SAITM graduates were not suitable to practice the medical profession given the number of shortcomings in that institution,” the JVP leader said. (Yohan Perera)
