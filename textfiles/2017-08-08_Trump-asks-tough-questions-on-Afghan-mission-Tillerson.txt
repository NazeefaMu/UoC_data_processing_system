Trump asks  ‘tough questions’  on Afghan mission: Tillerson


	



 

President Donald Trump has asked his advisers “tough questions” about American strategy in Afghanistan and is not willing to continue on as before, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday.   
The White House has launched a review of the US plan for Afghanistan after 16 years of war; reports suggest Trump’s national security team is divided on whether to send more troops or to pull out.   
Speaking in Manila on the sidelines of a regional security forum, Tillerson said Trump would not be content with continuing the fight as before.   


 “The president is not willing to accept that, so he is asking some tough questions,” Tillerson told reporters.   




Tillerson said the president’s National Security Council has met three times on the issue and that Vice President Mike Pence has joined Trump in taking a close interest in the strategy review.   


Trump’s generals have called the Afghan conflict a “stalemate” and even after years of intensive help from the US and other NATO nations, Afghanistan’s security forces are still struggling to hold back an emboldened Taliban. In an early move to address the situation, Trump gave his Pentagon chief, former general Jim Mattis, broad powers to set troop numbers. But several months later the level remains stuck at about 8,400 US and about 5,000 NATO troops.   


Mattis wants to wait until the White House has come up with a coherent strategy for not just Afghanistan but the broader region, notably Pakistan and how it deals with terror groups, before he commits to adjustments.
