Is a top head about to roll?


	



 

Political circles are abuzz with the talk about a reshuffle of the top team these days.

 


There is a strong demand by the opposition to sack a certain purohita holding a key portfolio and this demand is being backed by a sizable section from the government. This has fueled the speculation about a shake-up of the top team in the offing. 


Meanwhile, there is a growing general consensus that an astute and well educated person completely free from the taint of corruption should hold this key portfolio, they say.  In the wake of the speculation that the unpopular purohita is going to be dumped, two Green hopefuls from the Colombo district have already entered the running for the coveted office. One of them is a young academic and the other a mature intellectual, they say. 


However, a high political authority is said to have indicated his preference for a senior Green man hailing from the Kegalle area. A clearer picture about the situation is expected to emerge within the coming fortnight, they say.
