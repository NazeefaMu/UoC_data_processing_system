Tea-party snacks lead to a birthday party


	



 

There was a move to shift a certain provincial body to a new building and its political chief held a series of staff conferences to work out the shifting arrangements. 

 


These white-collar high-ups, of course, had no any official intimation, but learnt from the parties concerned that an order for snacks to be served at the usual tea party hosted to the participants of the conference had been placed with a catering service of a high-end hotel. Later they found to their surprise that food items ordered for delivery were far in excess of the normal requirement. Several days later, the white-collar ones were surprised to learn that the snacks for the staff conference had been duly delivered and the Ministry involved had paid the bill although the conference was not held!
Those baffled by this mystery learnt that  their political chief had held a bash at his official residence to mark his birthday!
