"We owe this success to the support of our shareholders, the trust that our customers have in us and last but not least the commitment of our staff.
Thus, we dedicate this prestigious award to our staff and customers who deliver weighty support to our success.
As a truly Sri Lankan bank we will continue to aim for excellence in our growth and performance while maintaining the balance between stakeholder expectations and our responsibility to the community" said Aravinda Perera, Managing Director, Sampath Bank PLC commenting on this achievement.
