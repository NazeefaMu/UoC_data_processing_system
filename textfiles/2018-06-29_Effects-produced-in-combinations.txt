DM Astro 46 - Sun in Astrology – Part 2



 

A fall Sun, an ideal position for political success

 

According to Astrological principles, a debilitated Sun confers humility. Therefore, it becomes a great asset to ordinary persons, politicians in a democracy, but detrimental to kings and rulers. 


In fact, some great men in history have been born with a debilitated Sun. The first Prime Minister of India Shri Jawaharlal Nehru was one of the world leaders who had been born with a debilitated Sun. Among the Sri Lankan leaders who had a fall Sun at birth are the former Prime Ministers D.S. Senanayake, Wijayananda Dahanayake, the first Sri Lankan governor Sir Oliver Goonetillake, former Ambassadors Sir Senarath Gunawardena and Gunapala Malalasekera. Humility is an essential quality for a politician or a statesman. A debilitated Sun confers that quality.

 

Sun with other planets
The Sun produces good results when he is posited in his sign Leo. He gives good results for Aries as the lord of the 5th   trine and for Sagittarius as the lord of the 9th trine.


The Sun is strong in the 3rd House and confers good health, integrity of character, and courage. But he is bad for younger brothers of the native except when the 3rd House falls in the Leo sign.


The Sun is favourable in the 6th as the lord of 6th, for Pisces and in the 8th as the lord of 8th for Capricorn. The Sun produces very good results in the 10th where he commands Digbala, provided he is not the lord of the 6th, 8th   or the 12th. The Sun produces excellent results in the 11th for the Sagittarius ascendant as the lord of the 9th House.


The Sun is normally good for the 11th House unless it happens to be the Badhakasthana for a movable ascendant.


A strong Sun in the 10th or the 11th is as auspicious as a good Jupiter in the 4th. The Sun exalted in the 7th Aries and as the lord of 11th produces for the Libra ascendant Kalatrasaubhagya or a happy wedded life.


The Sun, in the 2nd Bhava of Leo as the lord of the 2nd for Cancer ascendant and in Aries for Pisces Ascendant, produces Dhanayoga.


For the Sagittarius ascendant Sun–Mercury combination (as the lords of the 7th, 10th and 11th Houses) produces Rajayoga. Mercury in Gemini or Virgo with the Sun even in combustion produces Rajayoga.


The Sun, the royal planet and Jupiter, the divine planet together produce a very favourable combination. This combination confers on the native sincerity, devotion to duty, political patronage, and immense wealth.


Sun-Moon combination produces Kuhoo Yoga. However, this Yoga would not produce good results unless the combination is in the 3rd or the 11th House either with Jupiter or Venus or aspected by one of them.


Sun-Mars combination in the 10th despite both commanding Digbala is unfavourable. The reason is that both Mars and Sun are fiery planets and their combination makes the native rash, impulsive, and hot-tempered. Besides, the combination gives a hot constitution that causes diseases like hemorrhoids.


The Sun and Mars in the 10th make the native arrogant and dictatorial thus he becomes an object of hate of his subordinates.


Sun-Mars-Jupiter combination in the 10th is very favourable. This combination confers position of authority or high office, wealth, pleasing and candid speech, and uprightness.


Sun-Saturn combination or opposition is not favourable for holding high office in the government. It also signifies friction with father.


Sun-Saturn-Moon combination is very unfavourable unless it receives the beneficial aspect of a strong Jupiter.


Sun-Rahu combination is not good especially if Rahu is very close to the Sun.


The Sun in the 12th if in Taurus, Aquarius or Cancer aggravates diseases and may even cause death.


The Sun and the Moon in opposition or in conjunction with, cause accidents if they are aspected by Mars.
