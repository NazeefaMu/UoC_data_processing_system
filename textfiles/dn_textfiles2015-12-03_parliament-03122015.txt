[Parliament]-03.12.2015

Former President spent Rs. 1,152 on expenses annually - Ravi
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told Parliament yesterday, that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa spent Rs.1,152 billion on expenses annually, but present President Maithripala Sirisena is spending only Rs. 337 billion which is a huge saving.
The minister said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not participate in the debate, but had made comments on the budget proposals addressing people at temples.
Winding up the speech, Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that 182 MPs had participated in the budget debate. There were some constructive ideas and proposals as well as negative responses. We
prepared this budget with the intention of creating a new economy.
He said that MP Rajapaksa draws both a MP’s salary and pension entitled to him as former President. He responded to many comments made by the opposition in newspapers.
The new government has allocated the largest ever funds for education from the budget of 2016, while previous governments could never allocate such an amount for education from their annual budgets.
The previous government also agreed to sell 216 acres of the Port City outright to the Chinese. They alleged that today we are attempting to sell lands to foreigners. But we are not doing so. We will give lands to foreigners only on a 99 year lease.
We will rebuild this country. We intend to increase investments and local products. We did not increase the budget deficit. But the former government was engaged in massive white elephant projects which caused Rs. 280 billion. These projects have commenced even without calling for tenders and Cabinet approval.
This budget has allocated a massive capital expenditure since 1977.
Lack of pension funds is a major problem in our country. The governmentis seeking to establish a contributory pension fund for government servants with an initial capital of Rs. 1 billion. The budget has also allocated Rs.14 billion to improve the livelihood activities and infrastructure facilities in the North and East. Minister of Telecommunication & Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando, said this is historic political moment, it being the first budget of the new unity government. We have been able to provide a number of reliefs for the benefit of the common man.
The Mahapola scheme will be increased up to Rs.5,000. Former Minister Bandula Gunawardene said that a family could live on Rs.2,500 and it is such an era that we have changed. Out of the six million vehicle population in the country, around 4 million vehicles are mainly motor cycles and three-wheelers, which would not be liable for the increase of emission test fee.
State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said the budget had been aimed at giving relief to the poor people and developing the country. We have given subsidies when necessary. But we cannot
please everyone through this budget. So what we want is to see the whole nation getting all the benefits. UPFP MP Pavithra Vanniarachchi said it is a question whether this budget can be turned on the right path even with all the proposed amendments. There is no vision and long term development plan in this budget.
Present govt following unsuccessful path - Anura
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told in Parliament yesterday, that the JVP is ready to join in a debate within a week regarding the youth uprising which occurred in 1989, to find out who breached the laws.
Responding to comments by MPs Susil Premajayantha, Dilan Perera and Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe during the budget debate, the JVP Leader also said the history of the JVP had no connections to budget 2016.
He also said that it is unfair for allocating time for members of the joint opposition for the debate from the time allocated to the opposition. Both UNPers and the SLFPers represent the present government and the members of the joint opposition have not informed Parliament that they function as independent MPs.
If they really want to allocate time from the opposition, they should have informed Parliament that they function as independent MPs such as Sri Ranga and Ajith Kumara.
He also questioned the government as to whether they were elected to Parliament by the votes of foreigners. Highlighting that the Budget 2016 had provided relief to the foreigners but not to the local people.
“During the previous regime, the country’s economy had been bankrupt and there was a rapid increase of crime and suicide. The country’s exports had been heavily reduced during the previous regime.
He also noted the present government was following an unsuccessful economic path.
Kiriella dubious as to whether KDU is accepted by Medical Council
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, yesterday stated that he was dubious if the Medical Faculty of the Kotelawala Defence University is accepted by the Medical Council.
He made this observation yesterday while Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the KDU.
State Minister Wijewardena stated that so far 137 foreign students have been enrolled to the KDU Medical Faculty, while 195 locals have been enrolled. The State Minister said the KDU Medical Faculty is accepted by the University Grants Commission. “We don't know if the KDU Medical Faculty is accepted by the Medical Council,” Minister Kiriella said.
Admission to national schools:
No political intervention - Akila
There had been no political intervention on admission of students to national schools since January 12 this year, said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
He also said that the government would not in any way hesitate to take immediate action in that regard.
Minister Kariyawasam made these observations yesterday in response to a supplementary question raised by Opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma, following his question for oral answer. MP Alahapperuma questioned whether the minister was aware that four students who had obtained lesser marks at the scholarship examination, had been admitted to the Matara Mahinda Rajapaksa Vidyalaya.
“No influence had been made to admit students to schools since January 12,” the Minister said. “Give me those details, I’ll take actions in that connection,” he said. The Minister said further that the government had not halted constructions of the Matara Mahinda Rajapaksa Vidyalaya. He added that this government’s objective is to increase the quality of education.
He also said that the construction of the hostel of the same school had been halted due to lack of allocations made in the previous year. He said that however the construction would be completed soon.
Amalgamation of Divi Neguma funds with NSB won’t be allowed - SB
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said that he would not allow the amalgamation of the Divi Neguma funds and National Savings Bank (NSB), as the Divi Neguma fund had helped the poor people immensely.
“We urge the Finance Ministry to strengthen the Divi Neguma fund instead of amalgamating it with any other institution,” he said.
Participating in the debate on the second reading of the Budget 2016, the minister said when the ‘Samurdhi’ programme was initiated in 1995, the poverty ratio was 26.7 percent. Today it has come down to 6.4 percent.
This shows the massive contribution made by the ‘Samurdhi’ programme to eradicate poverty in the country. This also turned into a saving and social security scheme. We have planned to increase its benefits to the Samurdhi benefactors in the future.
The Opposition had claimed that there are so many deals in this budget and the government should probe these claims. This is the first budget presented by a unity government. Although President Maithripala
Sirisena is the country’s leader, this budget has been designed mainly by the UNP, depending on its needs.
“We have also some problems regarding certain aspects of the budget. We have discussed it with the Prime Minister and resolved many issues.
However, we should not despair, but we should resolve any issue and move forward. The main objective of the two main parties joining together is is to resolve the main problems affecting the country for a long time.
UPFA MP Rohitha Abeygunawardene said the budget had being designed to fill the pockets of the cronies of the government. Taxes have been reduced on tile imports to provide an advantage to certain persons. This would affect local tile manufacturers badly and the industry would collapse. Taxes have been increased heavily on vehicles, including a Rs.3.7 million tax on Hi Ace vans.
TNA MP Mavai S. Senathirajah said that people of the North and East contributed immensely to elect this government.
The problems of these people have still not been solved and these should be discussed directly with the TNA, without going through third parties.
Former President did not fulfill his duties as MP - Ajith
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said in Parliament yesterday, that new laws and regulations should be brought to Parliament for the abolishment of parliamentary membership of MPs who do not fulfill their duties.
He was joining the Second Reading Debate on Budget Proposals 2016 for the 9th allotted day.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said that there were MPs who had not made a single speech in Parliament, since being elected to Parliament.
He also said that Kurunegala District Parliamentarian former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not take part in the budget debate and did not fulfill his duties as a MP.
Those MPs who have been elected to Parliament from the valuable votes of the people, have the responsibility to raise their voices on behalf of these people. “If the MPs cannot fulfill their duties, should resign from the post,” the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister said the Budget 2016 is consisting of a proper economic plan which is highly appropriate to the country.
He also emphasized the necessity of allowing private sector investments in power generating activities under better conditions, as the government had no capacity to do so alone. But the government is responsible to ensure the electricity needs of the country.
The government is currently experimenting with regard to the innovative social market economy. Both UNP and the SLFP have agreed to help this experiment.
Condemning allegations made by the opposition claiming that the government was selling lands to foreigners, the Deputy Minister said that the government is making a huge effort to provide legal ownership to the lands where innocent people live in and not for foreigners.
Student’s suicide: TNA attempting to gain political mileage - Devananda
Foreign Ministet Mangala Samaraweera yesterday observed in Parliament that he would reply EPDP Leader Douglas Devanada’s query on the Tamil Youth’s suicide incident and to divulge the real picture in that regard.
Devananda making a special statement in Parliament, condemned the TNA for trying to gain political mileage by provoking the youth in the North.
He also accused the TNA of playing politics with the Tamil prisoners’ issue.
“They earlier said they would have discussions with the government to get these prisoners released and obtain the lands acquired by the military and the government,” Devananda said. “What had happened to those discussions? Now they are criticizing the government and provoking the youth against the government.” He said that provocations were made for petty political advantages and not for the love of those Tamil youth.
At this stage raising a point of TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said the matter did not come under Standing Order 23-2. He said the provisions are made for the opposition and not to criticism another political party in the opposition.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the government would answer such a question and the opposition parties should solve their problems.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala however permitted MP Devananda to continue with his statement.
Devananda said the incident concerning the student Rajeshwaran Senthuran’s suicide was a sensitive issue. He said he conveyed his sympathies to the victim’s family. He said a day would dawn when the youth would react against those forces who are attempting to provoke them.”
