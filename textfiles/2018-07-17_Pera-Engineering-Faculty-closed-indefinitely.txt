Pera Engineering Faculty closed indefinitely


	

The Engineering Faculty of the Peradeniya University would be closed until further notice due to an issue relating to students sitting for exams without 80% attendance, Faculty sources said.

The Engineering Faculty students had also launched a Sathyagraha campaign three weeks ago against the decision.  

The Senate of the University had informed the students to vacate their hostels before 2.00 p.m today. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
