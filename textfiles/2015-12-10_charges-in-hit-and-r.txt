Salman Khan acquitted of all charges in hit-and-run case


	

The Mumbai High Court has overturned Bollywood star Salman Khan's conviction for a 2002 hit-and-run case, BBC news reported.
In May, a lower court convicted him of culpable homicide and sentenced him to five years in jail for driving over and killing a man sleeping on a pavement.
But the appeal judges ruled there was not enough evidence.
It was only when the judge insisted that Salman Khan must be present before the verdict was read out, that the actor hurried to the court in south Mumbai on Thursday, the BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from Mumbai.
"The appeal is allowed and the decision of the trial court is quashed and set aside. Salman Khan is acquitted of all charges," news agency AFP quoted the Bombay high court judge Anil Ramchandra Joshi as saying.
Thursday's verdict is the latest twist in a case that began 13 years ago when Khan's Toyota Land Cruiser car veered off the road, killing one man and seriously injuring four others.
During his trial in the lower court, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol.
Now the high court has now said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who has since died - was not reliable. The prosecution is likely to challenge the verdict, reports say.
