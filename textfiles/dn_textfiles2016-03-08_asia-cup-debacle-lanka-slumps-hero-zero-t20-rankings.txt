Asia Cup debacle: Lanka slumps from hero to zero in T20 rankings

 
Not so long ago Sri Lanka were enjoying top Twenty20 status as the world champions in that format and being number one in the ICC Twenty20 rankings.
But over the last three months series defeats against New Zealand (0-2) and India (1-2) and following the Asia Cup debacle in Bangladesh where they won only one match (against UAE) out of four has seen Sri Lanka slump from number one slot in the ICC T20 rankings to a staggering eighth place days before the start of the ICC World Twenty20 in India where they are supposed to defend the title they won in 2014.
This is an unbelievable slump for a national team in the rankings and mind you being the current world T20 champs.
It shows the current form they are in and gives little in confidence to anyone following Sri Lanka cricket.
The countries below Sri Lanka are apart from Bangladesh and Zimbabwe all associated nations. Afghanistan are the nearest to Sri Lanka in ninth position.
India who won the Asia Cup on Sunday beating Bangladesh in the final confirmed their status as the number one ranked team going into the World Twenty20 tournament where they will be the hosts.
India is on 127 points, nine points clear of 2012 winner West Indies and South Africa, who are on equal points (118). New Zealand is fourth on 116, followed by 2010 winner England in fifth, 2010 losing finalist Australia in sixth, 2009 champion Pakistan in seventh and defending champion Sri Lanka in eighth.
These eight sides qualified directly for the second round after finishing inside the top eight of the ICC T20I Rankings as on 30 April 2015.
Since the ICC World Twenty20 Bangladesh 2014, India has played 16 matches and has won 11, including 10 out of 11 T20Is this year. This is in stark contrast to Sri Lanka who since winning the World T20 title in 2014 has won only four of the 14 matches played since then – and lost 10. –ST
