Mirissa, Merry making and objections


	



 

The Police officers investigating the CCTV camera footage on the Mirissa assault, spotted  to their amazement a big-wig Cabinet politico from the Blue Party leaving the sand-filled premises of the Surf Bar, half an hour before the incident took place. 

 


They weren’t amazed however, to  find the same politico up in arms against the Coastal Conservation Department which ordered all illegal entities in Mirissa be removed by May 1.  The CCD took this decision to ensure safety in the area after thousands of victims used the social media to vent their anger at what had taken place over the years, following media attention to the attack on the Dutch Tourists.


Many tourists and locals detailed the horrid experiences at the Bar in question and Mirissa in general. “Beach bums were allowed to harass us,” was the cry from all quarters, going back a few years. 


Does the Politico have a business interest or any other interest at the sordid terrain. Surely crying against doing what is lawful can’t be all that innocent in Paradise land!!!!hmmm
