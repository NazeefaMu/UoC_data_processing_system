SUROL, established and registered in 1971, is the only organization that looks after the welfare of disabled Leprosy-affected persons in Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnicity or religious beliefs. This organization is led by a group of volunteers who function as the Board of Management, which is committed to continue this work of charity towards the less fortunate in our society.   

In the wider context of Sri Lanka, there are some 2,000 new cases being identified and treated per year; of these about 75% get cured. A great many of them are being cared for by the Government in a very limited way. The authorities are now of the opinion that the disease is at a manageable level and have arranged for treatment at all Base Hospitals throughout the island. All the patients now live with their families and attend Clinics in their own areas. So are the patients who have not been cured and end up with deformities.   

Here is a brief note of the work we do for those disabled persons affected by Leprosy and being looked after by SUROL.   

It looks after 274 Disabled Leprosy-Affected persons and 62 School-going Children of these families. We are targeting to reach out to 350 Adults and 100 Children of patients going to school, if possible this year.   
	At the moment we have been able to get sponsorships for about 80% of Adult patients and 62 children. The unsponsored Adults are supported through general donations, which is fast diminishing.   
	We have a Staff of eight along with six Sisters as Field Volunteer Coordinators. These Sisters are in Convents around the places where some of the patients live. They visit these families from time to time.   
	As you can understand, most patients do not live in places where public transport is readily available and very often the roads are not motorable, Officers from Surol visit them twice a year for Christmas and the Sinhala/Tamil new Year, where we give each Patient a Hamper costing around Rs.7,000.   
Besides the above, there are other needs we look into among them.

Sponsorship of a disabled person -- Rs.2,500 or Education of a Child of the family -- Rs.2,000 a month.   
	Building a House costing Rs.700,000 or Repairs to Houses or Roofs, etc ranging from Rs.25,000 to Rs.100,000 a family.   
	Building of a Toilet -- Rs.60,000 to Rs.75,000 a family.   
	Provision of amenities such as Water and Electricity, Construction of Wells and Water Tanks, etc costing about -- Rs.50,000 to Rs.75,000 per item.   
	Self-Help and Livelihood Projects -- Rs.35,000 to Rs.90,000   
	Purchase and supply of Medicines/Skin Creams for wounds. Spectacles/lenses. Artificial Limbs / Special footwear/Wheel Chairs, Crutch etc -- Rs.5,000 to Rs.25,000 a person.
