The Joint Opposition had requested for a meeting with the visiting UNHRC Chief Zeid Al Hussein to express their opinion on the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka, Joint Opposition’s Foreign Affairs Expert G.L. Peiris said on Wednesday.


Addressing a news briefing, he said that the Joint Opposition would express their displeasure over the UNHRC Chief’s selective approach towards Sri Lanka.


“His approach to Sri Lanka is different to the approach on other countries and we see his actions as biased. He had intervened into the internal matters going beyond his mandate. We have requested for a meeting, so we could express our objection in person,” he said.


Meanwhile, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said in the event they were not given an opportunity for a meeting, the Joint Opposition would inform the UNHRC Chief in writing.


“Our objective is to inform the Commissioner Hussein about the wrongdoings he had committed as the UNHRC High Commissioner,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
