Death in police custody is a grave matter: Dinesh


	

The joint opposition told Parliament today the death of a Tamil youth while in police custody was a matter of grave concern.

MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the youth was an estate labourer and that the Police were bound to protect the lives of arrested and anything untoward happening to them while in custody would amount to a serious breach of their fundamental rights.

He said the politicians representing the estate areas were silent on the tragedy despite the public protests raging in Pusselawa.

The MP said the government should take swift action on this matter without attempting to sweep it under the carpet. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
