GMOA postpones tomorrow’s strike


	

The GMOA has postponed its work stoppage by a week after discussions with Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.

Earlier, it had decided to stop work from July 5 claiming that the government had failed to resolve the SAITM issue.

The GMOA said it decided to postpone its trade union action in the wake of requests made by the Asgiriya Mahanayake the Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera, Colombo's Archbishop Rt. Rev. Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and several other religious dignitaries.

Its secretary Haritha Aluthge said the GMOA is not an association that is prone to trade union action and a work stoppage was the final step.

Meanwhile, Dr. Aluthge warned that they would withdraw from the talks any moment if the GMOA felt there were any double standards on the part of the government or the relevant ministers. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
