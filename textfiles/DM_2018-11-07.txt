A revolt against the Coffee Group in the making!
	
Factionalism leading to arising of intraparty cliques and groups is not a new phenomenon in national politics. We have had occasion to hear about such cliques called Mulberry Group, Ginger group etc. from time to time in the past.
The latest such group making news these days is Coffee Group in the Green Party, they say.
The backbenchers charge that the doings of this exclusive Coffee Group made up of some top ones in the party, a onetime powerful madam and her so-called advisors are responsible for the fall of the Yahapalanaya Government.
This Group would meet practically every evening to talk politics over coffee and it was this group that had been taking vital decisions on behalf of the party, they say.
The irate backbenchers say that it was this group that had always been enjoying the plums of office, but it was they alone who had to suffer the consequences of their ill-conceived decisions.
Now these backbenchers have decided to take decisive steps to save the party from the clutches of this Coffee Group, an informed source said.

A taste too sweet to give up  !
	
The country witnessed a series of somersaults by our Diyawanna politicos with the sudden regime change. However, there are more somersaults in the offing, say observers.
Most of these turncoats keen on exploiting the prevailing situation to make a fortune are set to offer themselves to the highest bidder.
A leader of minor political party enjoying the support of a city-based community while looking after the interests of the people in the upcountry estate sector had recently received an invitation to throw in his lot with the new regime.
He had readily accepted the invitation and at the negotiations that followed had asked for a host of perks and concessions and had received a positive reply. However, negotiations had hit a snag when he had asked for the trade portfolio at the top table. Asked to consider taking up another subject, the man had stuck to his guns and the talks ended with each party assuring the other, no hard feelings!
However, the politico unable to resign himself to the idea of being reduced to a nonentity after enjoying power and perks of a top team member is said to be looking for a chance to meet the new Number Two again or another round of talks, they say.

## Title: Constitutional Governance   in a Parliamentary Democracy
## Section: News Features
## Date: 7 November 2018 12:00 am
Constitutional Governance   in a Parliamentary Democracy
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has purported to govern this country during the last week by presidential decree, without explaining to the nation how he placed a Government in office on October 26, 2018 without summoning Parliament. The Constitution does not permit him to administer a Government of his choosing without fulfilling his responsibility to Parliament.

Article 33A of the Constitution states clearly that the president shall be responsible to parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and functions under the Constitution. It is very clear that despite any legalistic and technical arguments, the basic principles are that the president is governed by the Constitution and must act with accountability to Parliament. His prorogation of Parliament is unconstitutional and flouts this basic principle of governance in a parliamentary democracy.
The citizens of this country have a right to demand that parliament be immediately convened
	History has shown that would-be dictators take office promising stability and the well-being of the country
It was earlier announced in the media that the President had agreed to convene Parliament on November 7. Now a Gazette notification has been issued indicating that Parliament will meet on November 14 , two days before the prorogation expires. This postponement is contrary to his obligations to respect and safeguard the Constitution and is a violation of the rights of the people. Presidential power is subject to the concept of the sovereignty of the people and the presidents obligations under Article 33A.
When Parliament cannot meet until November 14 it has no opportunity to discuss the current crisis in governance or to facilitate the formation of a lawful Government. The President has appointed an interim Government, replacing at his will and pleasure, a Prime Minister, a Cabinet, senior Heads of State institutions and public servants. The newly appointed persons have taken office, accepting the Presidents argument that he is exercising lawful powers under the Constitution. This is despite a powerful alternative opinion that has challenged the legality of his action. Unfortunately for the country these opinions expressed by diverse individuals and groups, especially lawyers, supporting or challenging him, are now being perceived as partisan.
The newly appointed persons have taken office, accepting the Presidents argument that he is exercising lawful powers under the Constitution. This is despite a powerful alternative opinion that has challenged the legality of his action.
We as citizens must recognise the importance of Article 33A of the Constitution. The President must therefore summon parliament immediately and not wait till November 14. It is Parliament that must decide whether he has acted lawfully from October 26, 2018, and clarify the Prime Minister and Government that comes into office. The only other alternative is for the President to go before the Supreme Court, the third agency that represents the sovereignty of the people under Article 4 of the Constitution, and seek a clarification on the legitimacy of his actions in this time of crisis.
In this critical time of national crisis day by day there is speculation that Members of Parliament are crossing from one party to another for large sums of money and the plums of office. Shamelessly, political leaders supporting the Presidents action are claiming that they have obtained the magic numbers to form a Government. The fact that corruption is entrenched in the body politic should not deter us as citizens from expressing our disgust at these acts of treachery to the voters, at a time when the country is facing an unprecedented political crisis in governance.
The only other alternative is for the President to go before the Supreme Court, the third agency that represents the sovereignty of the people under Article 4 of the Constitution, and seek a clarification on the legitimacy of his actions in this time of crisis
We remind the President that it was he who promised to introduce limitations on presidential powers under our Constitution. When the 19th Amendment was passed in Parliament, it was in response to the persistent public demand to reduce presidential powers. Therefore the 19th Amendment limited the presidential term of office, established a Constitutional Council and independent commissions, and repealed the discretionary power of the president to remove the Prime Minister. It is a shameless disregard of this political mandate given to him by the people, for the President, some ministers, political leaders and members of parliament to use technical legal arguments to undermine the fundamental constitutional changes introduced by the 19th Amendment.
There are several MPs and holders of ministerial office who were rejected by voters, but were sent to parliament by the President on the national list. They joined the President in passing the 19th Amendment. They have now become spokesmen for the authoritarian exercise of this same presidential power. We must not permit such politicians, or a president who does not exercise his powers with accountability to parliament, to be considered the saviours of the nation. We must not be misled by the money being poured into public cutouts and the efforts taken to make heroes out of individuals who have subverted parliamentary democracy.
Article 33A of the Constitution states clearly that the president shall be responsible to parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers duties and functions under the Constitution
The citizens of this country have a right to demand that parliament be immediately convened in a conflict-free peaceful environment where all members behave with dignity and accountability to electors who voted them in to office. If the Government cant lawfully govern this country and its Prime Minister cannot be identified, we call for a dissolution of Parliament under the exceptional provisions in Article 70, so that the people can decide for themselves who they will place in office. An interim Government cannot seek to administer the country without a vote in Parliament or the President asking for an interpretation from the Supreme Court under Article 129(1).
History has shown that would-be dictators take office promising stability and the well-being of the country. History has also demonstrated repeatedly that once in office they consolidate their grip on power and suppress the rights of the people. President Maithripala Sirisena came into office in 2015 on a majority vote where the people expressed confidence and a deep desire for accountable democratic governance. Let him not go down in our history as the person who trampled on parliamentary democracy and the rights of the people. (Media Release from The Friday Forum)

Danger Lurks
	
From the day President Maithripala Sirisena unseated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to replace him with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the country is fast drifting towards anarchy and a dangerous situation is in the making. The statement by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on Monday that he had been compelled to recognize the previous status quo in Parliament until the new faction in the fray shows its majority in the Parliament has intensified the tense situation.
Despite the Speaker having indicated that the situation would be normal once the newly appointed Prime Minister shows that he has the confidence of the majority of members of the Parliament, the procedure to show the majority is not clear. There had been a practice before the second Republican Constitution was introduced in 1978 where the Governor General or the President, at the beginning of each new session of the Parliament delivered the Throne Speech over which a vote was taken. If the Throne Speech was defeated it was deemed as the defeat of the government of the incumbent Prime Minister. For instance, it happened in 1964.
Under the present Constitution the President makes a policy statement in the House at the beginning of the new session of the Parliament, but it is not a must. Also even if he made such a statement a vote on it was not normally taken, since it was also not a must. 
And in countries like India and Pakistan, a confidence vote is taken in the Parliament after every change in premiership or every cross over by a considerable number of members from the ruling party to the Opposition. The practice is followed in the State Assemblies of the two countries as well.
However, there is no provision in the present Constitution in Sri Lanka for a prime minister to prove his majority power in the Parliament, other than a no confidence motion brought in by the Opposition. But who is the Prime Minister in the Parliament Speaker says it is Ranil Wickremesinghe, as he recognizes the previous status quo in the Parliament. At the same time the President who is to convene the parliament on November 14, according to his latest gazette notification recognizes Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. 
In a practical sense, when the Parliament meets, where are Mahinda Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe going to sit in its Parliament chamber The earlier statement by the Speaker that the Prime Ministers seat in the House would be allocated to Rajapaksa is being annulled by his latest statement that he recognized the previous status quo of the House. Accordingly, Wickremesinghe would take the Prime Ministers seat. Will the Rajapaksa loyalists allow him to do so Will it lead to a physical clash between the two groups Should such a situation be allowed to happen 
And also, is it in the Opposition benches or the ruling party benches in the Parliament that the Rajapaksa loyalists (and Wickremesinghe loyalists) going to sit How the Speaker, as the sole authority in the legislature is going to solve these problems is not clear, as this situation has arisen for the first time in the country. 
The most dangerous matter is that both the groups might bring in thousands of people to Colombo on the day parliament is to meet and there is a possibility of spilling over of any unfortunate situation in the House to the people outside. let saner counsel prevail on the part of all stakeholders to avert any such untoward situation and to resolve the crisis amicably. 
Even if the Speaker managed to save the day on November 14 and any one of the two Prime Minister aspirants established his majority in the House, probably there would be a hung Parliament for the remaining period of the House. Therefore, it is advisable now for both the groups to amicably agree upon a process to bring in a new composition of Parliament forthwith, through a fresh election, as the hands of the President are tied in that regard till February, 2020.

Democrats win House of Representatives in setback for Trump
	
The Democrats have taken control of the US House of Representatives in the mid-term elections dealing a blow to President Donald Trump, BBC reported a short while ago.
Taking control of the lower chamber of Congress for the first time in eight years will enable the Democrats to thwart the President's agenda.
However, Mr. Trump's Republicans are set to strengthen their grip on the Senate.
Tuesday's vote was seen as a referendum on a polarising President, even though he is not up for re-election till 2020.
The election confirms a historical trend for the party that is not in the White House to make gains in the mid-terms.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi - who is set to become Speaker, a position she held from 2007 to 2011 - said told cheering supporters in Washington: "Thanks to you, tomorrow will be a new day in America."
The BBC's US partner network CBS projected the Democrats will win the 23 seats they need to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House.
The Democrats could now launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest.
They could also more effectively block his legislative plans, dooming his signature promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico.
Female candidates performed particularly well in an election cycle that had been billed as the Year of the Woman.
Two 29-year-old Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Abby Finkenauer - are due to be the youngest women ever to win House seats.
Ilhan OImar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women and Sharice Davids and Debra Haaland the first Native American women to be elected to Congress. All are Democrats.

Full Cabinet before 14: Samarasinghe
	
All members of the Cabinet of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government would be sworn in before the opening ceremony of the new Parliamentary session on the 14th after prorogation, Cabinet Spokesman, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said today.
He said the Government would have to finish the job before the 14th to enable the Parliamentary staff to arrange new seating in the House and also to facilitate the smooth running of the Government.
Minister Samarasinghe added that Party leaders would likely to decide an early date, probably before November 20 to present the Vote on Account and to take up the UNFs No-Confidence Motion against the new Government, he added.
Minister Samarasinghe said the Policy Statement of the new Government delivered by President Maithripala Sirisena would be the only Parliamentary business on the 14 after the opening ceremony of Parliament following the prorogation.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday both, Minister Samarasinghe and co-Cabinet Spokesman Mass Media and Digital Infrastructure State Minister Kheliya Rambukwella criticized the contents of a letter sent to public officials saying that he was still the Minister of Public Administration.
Public officials must not take order from the Ministers appointed unconstitutionally, he said.
It was an illegal letter sent on the letterhead of the Public Administration Minister by an MP. He has no right to send an illegal letter to public officials requesting them not to obey orders coming from the top, under a power he does not have. Therefore, this letter has no authority. It was an attempted sabotage and officials must not take it seriously, Minister Samarasinghe said.
State Minister Rambukwella said the President had the power under the Constitution to take over any Ministry and appoint Secretaries to Ministries and added that public servants were intelligent enough not to take illegal orders seriously.
Even Speaker Karu Jayasuriya accepts this fact and that is why he has said that public officials must follow the Gazette notifications issued by the President, he noted.
Responding to the Daily Mirror on the media reports that there was a drug shortage in several areas and the Health Ministry did not have funds to purchase drugs, State Minister Rambukwella said it was not correct and the Ministry Secretary had authority to approve funds to purchase drugs.
If the UNF had any issue regarding the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister or on the prorogation of Parliament, they must resolve it in the Supreme Court as done by lawyer Naganada Kodithuwakku, who had filed an FR case, he said. (Sandun A Jayaskera)

Ms Premachnadra told a media briefing that her aunt had told the caller that she would not accept any portfolio.
My aunt had told the caller that her niece cannot be bought over. Then the caller said they would destroy my political career, she alleged.
She said she had been made many offers to join the new Government by many individuals.
I have recorded all phone calls given to be offering various things but I dont want to reveal them to the public now as the true face of some Buddhist Monks and even Christian priests would be revealed if I did so, she said.

Hope never dies  !
	
When the scent of a new regime was in the air, a former purohita from the upcountry, now a Pohottuwa stalwart thought that the time had come for him to use all resources at his disposal to secure a key portfolio in the new administration.
He knew that there would be a mad scramble for key places in the new top team and he should seek the divine intervention too to achieve his ambition.
The politico, thereafter, visited several famous Kovils in the neighboring country and participated in poojas and participated in several other yaga-homa rituals seeking the blessings of powerful deities. He returned home later brimming with hope that he would be offered a key portfolio in the new regime.
Meanwhile, the new regime had taken over power and several purohitas were soon sworn in, but this politico got no invitation from the powers that be.
He has now found solace from the decision taken by the Pohottuwa party that no senior member should accept a portfolio in the top team of the new regime, they say.

How vibrant social media is undermining a politically biased  media culture
	
Around 2:00 pm on the afternoon of November 2, actor turned politician Ranjan Ramanayake went live on Facebook. He is an artiste, a popular personality at that, and when Facebook launched live, it was celebrities like Ranjan that were the stars. 
In this case, however, Ranjan Ramanayake was wearing his other hat, that of the MP. He went live from within the corridors of parliament. He had just come out of a meeting where MPs representing the UNP, JVP, TNA, SLMC and other parties had pledged support to reconvening parliament as soon as possible. 
The 19-minute video is an eye-opener at so many levels. It gives an undiluted insight into the democratization of the public information sphere that social media can engineer. The video was partisan, obviously, he represents a political party and an agenda, there was not a shade of doubt on that. Gone was the veneer adapted by news channels to assume that pretense of impartiality . 
Ranjan Ramanayake was interviewing MPs on the just concluded meeting and their take. Gone too were the sterile stand and deliver of the usual on camera reporting. This was spontaneous and unscripted. You can clearly hear Ramanayake desperately searching for the JVP representative to get hold of him. Some MPs look stupefied into the phone before being told that they are live on Facebook. Four days after the video was posted  it had been watched over 104,000 times and shared over 1700 times.Ramanayake has around 745,000 following his page. 
Just before Ranjan used Facebook to reach out live, another of his colleagues Nalin Bandara also used the same platform to send out images, including a selfie, of the meeting. Social media has become the main source of information for tens of thousands of Sri Lankans and during the current political turmoil, it has become a cleaning house of info, rumour, political skullduggery and fake news. It is where all this is posted first.
The 19-minute video is an eye-opener at so many levels. It gives an undiluted insight into the democratization of the public information sphere that social media can engineer
Politician will use it, unabashedly for his/her own benefit, like they have used everything else. There have been many complaints that state media flipped over on Friday, the 26th night. It did, but there were such flips every time governments have changed. The difference this time was that those who came for the takeover had no idea about subtlety. Private media fare no better. Reliant of algorithms that push for engagements, social media will allow for computated manipulation, though we are yet to see any evidence of such during the ongoing political turmoil here. 
But it also allows for the unfretted flow of info. The cabala-like hold that media groups have on information is no longer sacrosanct. In Sri Lankas highly politicized and embarrassingly partial media landscape, what you decide to keep out of reporting is as vital as what is being reported. Social media has made sure that keeping stuff out now is far more difficult than ever before. 
Social media that allows for those like Ramanayake and Namal Rajapaksa (his live feed of the pro-Rajapaksa rally racked over 3000 shares and 120,000 views) to remove the media conduit, also makes anyone with access to the platform come out with his/her opinions, lies and info. 
Social media has become the main source of information for tens of thousands of Sri Lankans and during the current political turmoil, it has become a cleaning house of info, rumour, political skullduggery and fake news
And so, it was that people were calculating the bribes that have been offered for crossovers, calculating that with the number of preferential votes and even calling the MPs and seeking their part of the loot. The recordings were on social media very quickly. 
This is a political backroom drama that is played out in the full glare of social media. Only the super secret now can be kept out, even that with the greatest of efforts  everything else gets on to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, almost instantaneously. It is a rumbling, raucous argument that is taking place there. Many have tried to control that line, none has succeeded. 
Democracy is a messy business.

I can only follow Presidents orders: IGP
	
IGP Pujith Jayasundara said today that he would only act according to the orders given by President Maithripala Sirisena, who now handles the Law and Order Ministry.
He expressed these views at a media briefing held at the Police Headquarters in Colombo.
Responding to a request made by former Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara to provide additional security to former Prime Minister, the IGP said he could not do so.

UNP MPs Nalin Bandara, Daya Gamage and Palitha Thewarapperuma on Tuesday handed over a letter of former Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara to the IGP directing to provide security personnel and other facilities given to the former Prime Minister and former Ministers as given before October 26 saying that they were still Ministers of the Government.
The UNP MPs handed over a letter requesting to reinstate their security personnel as before. But the President had appointed a new Prime Minister and new Ministers.
In line with new appointments, we have already provided required security personnel for the Prime Minister, Ministers, Deputy Ministers, State Ministers and Parliamentarians according to the IGP provision of the Police circular issued on 2015-11-09.
Therefore the Police could not act on the request of the MP Ranjith Maddumabandara, the IGP said.
He said that he had informed the UNP MPs that the Police could not implement their written request.
We will act only according to the instructions and the directions of the President as the Law and Order Ministry is now comes under the Defence Ministry, which is handled by the President, the IGP said.
However, when asked about the Speakers Statement that he would only recognise the status quo that prevailed in Parliament before the appointment of the new Prime Minister, the IGP refrained from commenting. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Leading high-end leather garment manufacturer, Lanka Leather Fashion (LLF), was awarded CarbonNeutral status for a fourth consecutive year by the independent sustainability verification, validation, and assurance body  The Sustainable Future Group (SFG).
With the assistance of The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC)  Sri Lankas leader in Integrated Sustainability Solutions  LLF underwent a comprehensive assessment of their organisational greenhouse gases (GHGs) to determine its environmental impact. The impact was then compensated for through the reinvestment in a renewable energy project in the Ratnapura and Kandy districts of Sri Lanka, in return for registered Carbon Credits to match their Carbon Footprint.
LLF continues to push the boundaries when it comes to introducing diverse initiatives to tackle social and environmental issues within the workplace and communities in Sri Lanka. Through the introduction of new technologies and adaptation of newer, greener and more efficient business practices, LLF has been able to continuously lower its operational expenses and enhance employee engagement. From using discarded leather waste to create new products for clients to joining forces with a local fashion designer to create upcycled leather jewellery, LLF is helping create a sustainable culture within its communities.
Sanith de S Wijeyeratne, CEO of CCC, congratulated LLF on their efforts by stating, LLF is an noteworthy example of what a company can achieve when focusing on getting the balance right between the social, environmental and economic impacts of its business operations. Marco, along with his team, have done an extraordinary job leveraging their niche position in the market to change the conversation in its supply chain across the globe. We are a proud partner and hope to continue this fruitful relationship as they continue on their sustainability journey.
Marco Weidemann, Director of Lanka Leather Fashion, added, With the ever-evolving business landscape, we are proud to be on the forefront of sustainable innovation, methodically finding ways to reduce our global footprint in the luxury leather market. Apart from an environmental benefit, we are starting to see the economic benefits in cutting our energy spend while improving other business processes. Our aim is to build a greener future, and appreciate the guidance The Carbon Consulting Company has provided us over the past four years.

## Title: LOVE ONES NEIGHBOUR AS ONESELF Love commandment and example of Fr. Mike
## Section: News Features
## Date: 7 November 2018 12:00 am
LOVE ONES NEIGHBOUR AS ONESELF Love commandment and example of Fr. Mike
	
(31st death anniversary of Fr. Michael Rodrigo falls on November 10: Gospel reading for Sunday, November 4 - Mark 12: 28-34)
ABBA EXPERIENCE
Any experience is personal, something which I individually experience, to which I have an insight and to which I respond. The Abba Experience is an experience of being accepted, it is an assurance that I am alright and that I am loved. In the Abba Experience  the world is an accepting world. This experience leads to a community belief and a community faith. It is the faith of this community which nourishes the experience and is nourished by the experience that God is love. Christian life is meant to be a spontaneous way of living, which comes from an experience. I experience Gods love and so my life is transformed and I live it as one who has experienced God.
LOVE COMMANDMENT
The love commandment is given to us in all three synoptic gospels. It is found in Matthew 22: 34-40; Mark 12: 28-34 and in Luke 10: 25-28 and added to the Lukean version is the parable of the Good Samaritan from verse 29 following. In Marks version, it is taken up in the context of a discussion on what the great commandment of the law is. The great commandment means the essential commandment, the basic commandment, the one prescription of the law that sums up the rest. It is in answer to this, that Jesus formulates his love commandment.
Jesus is doing a number of things here in his interpretation. Firstly, what is significant is that Jesus has brought in love of neighbour on par with the love of God. This is most clear in the Matthew version of the Great Commandment, where it says the first commandment is, You shall love the Lord your God, with all your heart and with all your soul and with your entire mind. And the second is like the first, You must love your neighbour as yourself (Matthew 22: 37-40). Both are aspects of the Great Commandment.
Christian life is meant to be a spontaneous way of living, which comes from an experience. I experience Gods love and so my life is transformed and I live it as one who has experienced God
Secondly, Jesus generalises the concept of neighbour. Neighbour in Leviticus 19:18in the Old Testament is a fellow Israelite. Four different Hebrew words are used: a brother, a companion, a son of your own people and neighbour. Love does not extend outside this. Later on in Leviticus 19: 34 (following) this is extended to what is called stranger a category quite frequent in the Old Testament. You shall love the stranger as yourself. A stranger is a refugee, someone who has come to live in your tribal territory. It might be a fellow Jew, a gentile or someone adopted by you and therefore part of your people.
Scene where Fr. Mike was killed
There are three categories of people who are powerless, hence specially loved by God: the widow, the orphan and the stranger. This would be the limit of Old Testament love. If you love your neighbour, you will love the refugee. However, there is no command that you have to love the gentile and those outside your people. The Old Testament says that you must love God and Jesus says, you must love God and love your neighbour, as you would yourself.
Again, we find another kind of formulation in John, which is a Christological formulation. All the Johanine texts: John 13: 34, 15: 12and 1 John 3: 23 and II John verse 5 are Christological formulations. Love one another, as I have loved you. Jesus is brought in as the exemplar of our love. In these texts only love of neighbour is mentioned; there is no mention at all of loving God, for God is to be found in the neighbour; the neighbour is the sacrament through whom God becomes present. We need to keep in mind that Jesus himself and the early church understood the Love Commandment to be loving our neighbour, and that we love God when we love our neighbour. In other words, the Love Commandment of Jesus is to be read as follows: You must love God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind and this means you must love your neighbour as yourself. The immediate focus of our love is neighbour and the ultimate focus is God.
When two texts are brought together, as above, one text interprets the other. Jesus is probably doing this when he quotes the Great Commandment from Deuteronomy and adds Leviticus 19: 18 as an interpretation of the Deutronomic text. This is a very common Jewish technique. It does not indicate the separation of two objects. Jesus is not saying, object one, you must love God; object two you must love your neighbour. There is only one object in the love commandment. God in neighbour.
When you speak of Love of God it sound good but it could mean nothing. Jesus fills it with meaning when he shifts the emphasis of the Great Commandment to the love of neighbour.
In his first epistle, John elucidates what love is. The basic statement is that God is Love. Let us love one another for God is love. Love comes from God. Love is of God. This love is all inclusive. That is why John says Let us love one another, for this love with which we love one another, comes from God. This is a very important theological assertion that wherever there is genuine love, there is God.
The basic Christian doctrine is that all love is of God  therefore God is the only possible source of love; God is love. God is loving. All love comes from God. God is always with us. The moment we are loving, we know that God is there. This is the one and only Christian value that we as Christians must die for. Our ultimate value is that God is love. For this I am ready to give my life. Jesus is the deepest expression of Gods love for us.
People are friends when they share. Sharing is possible only when there is great acceptance. The ultimate test of friendship is when people are able to be themselves with others without wearing masks
In John 4: 7-12 he declares, My dear people, let us love one another, since love comes from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Anyone who fails to love, can never have known God, because God is love. If there is no love in our lives, there is no God. In this the love of God is made manifest among us, that God sent his only son into the world, so that we might live through him. Not that we loved God, but that God loved us and sent His son to be a reconciliation for our sins. In verses 11 and 12, we go back to our exhortation. If God so loved us, we ought to love one another. No person has ever seen God, therefore we cannot speak of loving God. But if we love one another then God abides in us and Gods love is made perfect in us.
In John 4: 7-23, the first act in this relationship of love is that God has loved us first. Gods love for us is not a response to what we do. Our correct response to Gods love for us should be that we love our neighbour. God loves us and when we love our neighbour we find we are loving God. This is what John is trying to say, and what the synoptic Gospels call The Kingdom or the Reign of God. This is a process and not a question of decision-making. When one loves God and accepts Gods love one becomes loving  then one can love ones neighbour.
Love comes from God and is made tangible in the neighbour who is the sacrament of Gods presence. Incarnation means that God has taken flesh, taken up his dwelling in us and humankind is the locus or place where Jesus encounters God. What happened to Jesus of Nazareth has an effect on all of us. And what happens to one individual in humankind happens to all and we are no more isolated individuals, for we are HA ADAM humankind as a whole, excluding none. We are intimately bound together in our origins and in our destiny. God is present in all people.
LOVE: PHILIA
In the New Testament, love is spoken of as Philia, translated as friendship. Jesus says, I have not called you servants, but I have called you friends. Friendship is a sharing of oneself with another person. For Jesus goes on to say: I have called, you friends, because, I have shared with you all that the Father has revealed to me (Jn. 15: 12-17). I have shared with you my vision, my dreams, my aspirations, all that I am.
When you speak of Love of God it sound good but it could mean nothing. Jesus fills it with meaning when he shifts the emphasis of the Great Commandment to the love of neighbour
People are friends when they share. Sharing is possible only when there is great acceptance. The ultimate test of friendship is when people are able to be themselves with others without wearing masks. The sharing of oneself with someone is normally a process which is affective i.e. there is emotion in all kinds of friendship. This builds up communication with ones friends, which is quite specific. It is often limited to a few people for one cannot build up friendship with everyone to the same degree. There can be circles of friends of different kinds.
LOVE: KOINONIA
The New Testament speaks also of Koinonia, which is community love and fellowship. In I Thessalonia 3: 13 Paul tells us you must love everyone but especially those of the household of God. In Koinonia, there is a sense of belonging which we have with those who belong to this group of ours. This sense of belonging comes from a shared vision, a shared goal, a specific mission, a tradition which gives us a sense of belonging as a group. Koinonia is also affective but it is less intensely affective than Philia. Koinonia is limited to those of the group and household.
LOVE: AGAPE
Agape is described in the New Testament as doing good to.Jesus exhorts his disciples to Love your enemies and do good to those who hate you. (Luke 6: 27-35) and Paul too urges the Thessalonians to always seek to do good to one another and to all (Thessa. 5: 15). So, Agape is doing good effectively to everyone. There are no limits to Agape. You have to do good to all, and all means to all without exception. No one is excluded in this claim on our love. In this inclusive love we encounter people with a whole hierarchy of needs. Our response to these needs would be determined by our conception of the human person and our understanding of society.
Agape is the love of experiencing people as brothers and sisters irrespective of who they are. It is a more effective love than affective. Agape is linked to the Abba experience; i.e. of Jesus experience of God as Father-Mother and of experiencing people as brothers and sisters. The important thing here is experience.Agape is the Christian understanding of a basically human experience, realising that these human experiences of love are from God. It is not a feeling of being close to people or not being close to people, but it is the acceptance of responsibility for them. We acknowledge the claims that people have on us.
Effective love today calls for a change of oppressive structures, which make people victims of the system. Here we are no longer dealing with individual change but rather with structural changes, of patterns of relationships, in the way resources and wealth are distributed and power exercised
LOVE: JUSTICE
Justice is the historical expression of effective love today. Today there is no love possible without justice (Synod of Justice 1971). We define the New Testament understanding of love as doing good to, effectively. Hence, love means responding appropriately to human needs.
Effective love today calls for a change of oppressive structures, which make people victims of the system. Here we are no longer dealing with individual change but rather with structural changes, of patterns of relationships, in the way resources and wealth are distributed and power exercised. In effecting structural change one has to have alternate models. One cannot merely destroy an unjust society: It has to be replaced by a just society.
Where would Jesus fit into this kind of analysis Did Jesus opt for structural change in proclaiming the values of the reign of God; both in word and in deed What was Jesus vision of a new society, a just society, a contrast community Did he initiate a totally new framework of social relationships What challenge does He offer us in our context of today

Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child Showering them with love and care

The lack of resources and knowledge in caring for the differently abled children, not forgetting the social stigma associated with them, has made life difficult and challenging for these individuals. They deserve to be treated better, shown more love and given attention compared to other children. Taking care of these differently abled children is costly and becomes a burden for parents of low income families. In an era where there are less than a handful of schools catering to the differently abled children in Sri Lanka, Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child has done creditably well.

The school which commenced with only five students later expanded to an institution catering to 32 students affected either by Autism, Hyperactivity, Downs Syndrome andCerebral Palsy
Located in Dehiwala, Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child is a day school for the differently abled and also for children with special needs. Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child Director Satha S. Rajanayagam, a chartered accountant by profession, had come up with the idea of establishing such a school when he was in Seychelles and volunteered in a school for the differently abled children and children with special needs. Eventually, when he returned to Sri Lanka with his wife, he wanted to make his dream a reality by starting Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child.
The school was established in 2013 and registered under the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare. The school which commenced with only five students later expanded to an institution catering to 32 students affected either by Autism, Hyperactivity, Downs Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy. Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child aims to cater to students hailing from low income families while providing them with daily transport, meals and swimming lessons, training in dancing and special therapies. They engage in fun activities like making cards, which are later sold for fundraising initiatives.
Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child was initially established with a personal investment and later attracted donations from well-wishers, individuals and the corporate sector. These contributions helped immensely in the schools development

The School currently lacks a van and a three-wheeler to meet its daily transport requirements. They are looking for volunteers to join their staff, which has a strength of only 10 members. The staff at Menhandy School for the Exceptional Child also emphasised that individuals can celebrate their birthdays, anniversaries and other especial occasions at this institute because they are of the opinion that sharing such happy occasions with these children will be immensely

Monthly lecture of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society CSI:Wildlife Fighting wildlife crimes
	
Approximately every nine hours a rhino is killed in this world, and every 15 minutes an elephant is poached. Thousands of snare traps are used by poachers in Africa for game meat, and many a big cat and elephant also fall prey to these devices that cause an agonizing death.
While Anti-Poaching Units have increased and poachers have been apprehended, very often convicting them of the crime is impossible without physical evidence. These poachers get away, only to return to the jungle and start poaching again.
Introducing forensic training to Rangers and Anti-Poaching personnel to document the wildlife crime scene, preserve and collect evidence, and using the evidence to substantiate the crime, is becoming successful.
Ravi Perera has been a Crime Scene Investigator for law enforcement in the United States for 24 years. Having graduated from the FBI
Forensic Academy in Quantico, Virginia, he is a crime scene instructor specializing in shooting
reconstruction and surveillance photography. Ravi is also certified in electronic forensics, where analysis of cell phones and computers produce significant evidence of criminal activity.
3Ravi is the CEO of Serendipity Wildlife Foundation, and has trained Anti-Poaching Units in Kenya, and also introduced Gun Shot Residue testing, which helps to identify the shooter when many people are present at a crime scene.
Last year a project was started by him to detect fingerprints from elephant tusks and rhino horn, which would help identify individuals involved not only in poaching, but in trafficking as well. The second phase of the project is to start a fingerprint database dedicated only to wildlife crimes. 
Wildlife & Nature Protection Society (WNPS) is happy to announce that Mr. Ravi Perera will be presenting the November instalment of its monthly Lecture Series on 15th November, 2018 at the Jasmine Hall BMICH starting at 6.00 pm.

## Title: Plight of Sri Lanka Railways

Plight of Sri Lanka Railways
	
Public transportation now in Sri Lanka has developed to a certain extent that most people tend to use them. Modes of public transport in Sri Lanka comprise buses, cars, trains, tuk tuks (Three wheelers) and helicopters. Among the mentioned modes, the train is the most commonly used mode for travelling in terms of convenience and low charges. Sri Lanka Railways has had its ups and downs after Sri Lanka gained independence from the British. However, concerns have been raised regarding the lack of substantial development in the Sri Lanka Railways. 
This article reflects on why the relevant authorities have turned a blind eye to improving the efficiency of the railway service and further discusses the institutes future plans in terms of raising the standard of service. 
Inception of therailway service 
In the early days, there were only few primary level roads in the coastal areas during the rule of the Portuguese and Dutch. But there were no roads in the up country. It was very difficult for a vehicle to reach Kandy through forests and inclines. Therefore, traveling along these up country routes became dangerous. Transportation was done by men themselves. Palanquins, horses and elephants were used for the journeys by the aristocrats whereas the ordinary people traveled on foot. In such a backdrop, the British took the initiative to introduce a railway to Sri Lanka in 1864. At the outset, it was introduced as a mode to transport tea and coffee from the hill country to Colombo. Subsequently, it became an effective mode of transport. 
The railway service was inaugurated with a 54-kilometre (34 mile) main line. Sri Lankas first intercity railway connected Colombo and Ambepussa. Eventually, the service was extended to Kandy, Nawalapitiya, Nanu Oya, Bandarawela, and Badulla. Additional lines were added to the system, including to Matale in 1880, the Coast Railway Line in 1895, the Northern Line in 1905, the Mannar Line in 1914, the Kelani Valley in 1919, the Puttalam Line in 1926 and finally lines to Batticaloa and Trincomalee in 1928. It should be noted that there was a blooming associated with Sri Lanka Railways when it was under British Empire.
No worthwhile thing would happen to the railway service on account of this transfer of powers. Hence, the Government should see that adequate authorities are provided to the SLR in order to render an effective service
Railway today 
Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) is a Government department functioning under the Ministry of Transport. It is a major transport service provider and is the only rail transport organisation in the country. SLR transports both passengers and freight. At its inception, the railway was carrying more freight than passengers. But today, the service is passenger oriented. SLRs market share for passenger transport is about 6.0 % and about 0.7 % for goods transport.
Additional General Manager (Operations) Wijaya Samarasinghe told the Daily Mirror that Sri Lanka Railways operates approximately 396 trains which include 67 Long-Distance and 16 Intercity trains and carries about 2 Million passengers daily.
SLR owns and maintains 1561km of rail tracks, 74 locomotives, power sets 78,565 carriages and the signalling network. At present, it has a workforce of 17,634.
SLR functions under the General Manager of Railways. The General Manager reports to the Secretary of the Ministry of Transport.
According to the Sri Lanka Railways Administration Report-2016, SLR has been divided into eight Sub Departments and five Units. The sub departments are managed by the heads of the Sub Departments who report directly to the General Manager of Railways.
It should be noted that the authorities have spent billions of rupees on building highways, expressways and new link roads. But has it initiated effective projects to upgrade the railway entity The authorities are liable to answer that question. Although some work was carried out through projects in the past, what was commenced has not been properly maintained. 
Huge responsibilities,few authorities 
One of the principles of management is authority. This principle reflects the concept of managerial authority. It underscores that authority is necessary to ensure that managerial commands are carried out. If managers do not have authority then they would lack the ability to get work carried out. Managers should use their authority responsibly and ethically. 
Former General Manager of Railways and Senior Lecturer at the University of Colombo, Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan told the Daily Mirror that there was an imbalance at the Sri Lanka Railways when one considers the huge responsibilities and authorities designated to carry them out. 
The powers of the General Manager of Railways have been curbed and decentralised to the branches like Management Services Department, Public Service Commission, Establishment Department and Ministry of Civil Service Affairs, National Salaries and Cadre Commission and Treasury Operations Department etc., said Dr. Gunaruwan.
This situation is not good for the well-being of Sir Lanka Railways. No worthwhile thing would happen to the railway service on account of this transfer of powers. Hence, the Government should see that adequate authorities are provided to the SLR in order to render an effective service to the railway service, Dr. Gunaruwan opined.
When issues emerge with regard to the railways, the blame is easily palmed on the Sri Lanka Railways. What most of us have not fathomed is that the General Manager of the SLR does not possess the powers over the appointments, promotions, determination of train charges and salaries and taking action regarding disciplinary issues etc. The only authority he has is to place his signature on letters, Dr. Gunaruwan added. 
Undue interventionof Govt. 
Movement of Workers and Passengers for Protecting the Railway Service convener Ven. Adurathwila Chandrajothi Thera charged that it was due to the undue intervention of the Government that the Sri Lanka Railways had dropped to a low ebb and consequently, it had become an inefficient entity and lossmaking department. 
At present the SLR is functioning thanks to the income generated through tickets. The rest of the income earning facilities which the SLR previously enjoyed, have been taken under the purview of the Government, Ven. Chandrajothi Thera complained. 
If the Government really wants to make the SLR a profit making entity, it should provide diesel without taxes. At present, the SLR has to bear diesel costs in millions, Ven. Chandrajothi Thera added. 
Nevertheless the monk said that the recent Budgets had curtailed 50 percent of the funds allocated to the SLR during the past two years. 
Meanwhile, Ven. Chandrajothi Thera said that the recent Governments move to revise the train fares was a fraud and added that it was unfair to increase train charges without considering its inefficiencies. 
The Government recently revised the train fares which somewhat puzzled commuters and led to a debatable situation. The majority of the commuters were of the opinion that it has not been done sensibly. According to the new fare revision, the 15 per cent increase did not reflect on the current fare, but the price was based on the train fare per kilometre.
New Projects todevelop railways
Projects commenced in the year 2016 and some new projects commenced during the year 2017 are as follows.
1. Procurement of new Rolling Stock.
2. Rehabilitation of 200 Nos. of carriages.
3. Improvement of Kelani Valley line.
4. Installation of 200 Nos. of Protected Railway Crossings.
5. Construction of double line from Kaluthara South to Payagala South.
6. Completion of double line from Seeduwa to Katunayaka.
7. Light Railway construction - The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry is set to begin the Construction work of the proposed light railway system at the end of 2019. Ministry Additional Secretary Madhawa Waidyaratna said that seven railway tracks had been identified by the ministry under the proposal.
According to the proposal, one line with a total distance of 33km would be constructed from Ragama to Kirulapone via Kadawatha, Fort and Bambalapitiya.
The 28.3km long second line would be constructed from Kelaniya to Moratuwa via Dematagoda, Borella, Narahenpitaand Nugegoda.
The 22.3 km long third line would be constructed from Hunupitiya Tyre Junction to Kottawa via Koswatta.
Performance of the SLR
According to the Performance Report of Department of Railways 2017, passenger revenue has dropped marginally due to several strikes led by some Railway Unions which affected the railways operational activities.
Passenger Facilities and other Developments
Development of the facilities for disabled, providing wheel chairs, sanitary facilities and ramps.
	Commencing a new weekend train service from Colombo to Matale .
	Extending the daily evening Meerigama train up to Polgahawela to improvepassenger comfort.
	Renovation of rest rooms and introduction of a system to reserve the rest rooms in a convenient way.
	Development of overhead bridges, station platforms and maintenance of station buildings, and raising the heights of platforms.
	Introducing new train services.
	Opening of sales outlets in mainstation premises.
	Improvement of ticket reservation for intercity train service.
	Provide extra services such as canteen, stalls, shops and parking facilities for railway passengers.
	Introducing Rail Bus Services between Kandy- Peradeniya and Gampola
	Installation of 6 new ATM machines atrailway stations.
In conclusion, it is noteworthy that now is the right time to convert and overcome its weak points by transforming the railway to match the need of the Sri Lankan society. Therefore, by standardising sanitary facilities in onboard trains and railway stations, the authorities can transform the Sri Lankan Railways into a better service provider which in turn will ensure that people enjoy a safe mode of travelling.

Politics: From civil to evil
	
No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.
~Niccolo Machiavelli
Siddhartha Gautama was one of the most pioneering thinkers who revolutionized the very manner in which man used to think, act and operate at mundane levels. Long before the Magna Carta or the American Constitution came into being, the Buddha told us that no man was unequal to the other; long before this modern-day social-scientists castaway the discriminatory caste system in the Asian world. The Buddha showed us by example that man is not born a Brahmin or a coolie, but his actions alone defined the lines of such divisions among man and women; that alone would shape and explain whether he is one or the other.
Such sophisticated and erudite thinking has endured its own corruption specifically by the order, Buddhist Clergy, and still guiding us in trying times telling us right from wrong, good from bad and reasonable and unreasonable, all of which qualities that set the human being apart from all other species.
Transformation of politics from civil to evil has already begun
	The system that sustained a civil service that was apolitical has now become the victim of an extremely corrosive political intervention
	When one sees whats occurring today, all teachings of the Buddha, Chanakya, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle seem meaningless
Siddharthas attainment of a supreme state of mind- Buddhahood- set him apart from all his contemporaneous thinkers and philosophers until this day.
Although we, mostly Sinhalese Buddhists, believe in the philosophy taught and preached by Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, we cannot or should not disregard another school of erudite thought, a very classical group of doctrines and social theories that attempted to analyze and dissect human behaviour at a fundamental level and present quite a sophisticated macro philosophy.
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, the ancient Greek Thinkers were amongst the initiators of this thinking, which formed the foundation of Western Philosophy.
Plato writes in his Republic:
Until philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophize, that is, until political power and philosophy entirely coincide, while the many natures who at present pursue either one exclusively are forcibly prevented from doing so, cities will have no rest from evils,... nor, I think, will the human race. (Republic).
Socrates, who was a contemporary or one who roamed the cities of Greece with his exquisite dialogue and immensely wise discourses in the aftermath of Buddhas Maha Parinibbana, prescribed a set of dialectical and logical thinking for the ordinary man to understand and attain.
Yet, it did not happen. The majority in Greece, as in other parts of the world, were more ready to accept an easily marketable religious merchandise- the concept of God. Clouded by the avaricious orders of organized religions, the clergy, wisdom and intellectual curiosity of a few could not withstand the onslaught of politically sweetened storms; nor did they create novel ways and mechanisms of how to take a sophisticated thought and teaching into the next level of mass-comprehension.
History bears testimony to the fact there were only a handful of religious leaders, who dared the prevalent thought and practices and became successful to create a religion that would later add to itself the essential meat and bone in order to endure and embrace mass participation at the multiple rituals that ultimately were mistaken for the essence of the central gospel of the teacher.
This has happened to all religions and Buddhism too was not spared of this debasement of the core teaching. Politicians identifying the magic of mans vigorous faith and unbending allegiance to the religious order began cultivating these various orders and sectoral leaders. Amongst many allurements offered by politicians to cultivate and sustain this relationship between politics and religious order are money and tangible offers of the rebuilding of temples and the provision of material assistance.
In a real and perceptible sense, the context of political thought and action has changed beyond recognition. Sri Lanka is no exception in this contextual transformation; her ancient history as well as the recent post-Independence time span, politicians dependence on the Buddhist Temple has grown exponentially.
While our monarchical-rule in the ancient past was more or less equal to a theocracy, introduction of democratic elements such as universal suffrage and Westminster Rules of Parliamentary Affairs have embellished the mind of the average Sri Lankan.
What transpired last Friday, October 26, was the swearing in of an ordinary Parliamentarian, who also happens to be the former President and the Chief Antagonist of the Governing Coalition, which was elected on a platform of anti-corruption, anti-nepotism and anti-dictatorial rule by the very man who opposed him.
The country was in a state of profound shock; it may have taken one-half day for almost everyone, whether one favoured or hated the news, to gather from the ensnaring limbo of a collapsing value system.
The system that sustained a civil service that was apolitical in every sense of the word and resisted its own corruption by selecting the best of the best students, who passed out of the Universities at the time, now has become the victim of an extremely corrosive political intervention at every level of governance.
Arthashastra , the Eastern counterpart of Platos Republic, authored by Kautilya, also known in history as Vishnugupta and Chanakya, the teacher and guardian of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, went to the same or even greater extent to define and term the ideals of a just polity.
Chanakya also prescribed a very workable and practical blend of socio-economic-political strategies and tactics with a sublime purpose of attaining a perfect union between the ruler and the ruled and also with total and dynamic equilibrium between the two parties.
However, when one comes down to earth and sees whats occurring in Sri Lanka today, all these teachings of the Buddha, Confucius and Chanakya of the East and Socrates, Plato and Aristotle of the West seem meaningless.
Especially in the context of the developing culture of corruption, nepotism and resort to means of Stalinist approach to power, erudite political philosophies flow out of the window in a hurry.
Transformation of politics from civil to evil has already begun.
A civil transformation of power within the constraints of our Constitution is not only a necessary element of good governance; it is also a political probability.
That is why negotiations between the aggrieved parties in this confrontation, President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, should have been towards a more amenable and acceptable candidate for the position of Premiership within the coalition that brought Sirisena into power.
That is where the fundamental misjudgment and error were committed. Whether it was willful or as a matter of oversight due to the rush of problems that confront a President as the arbiter-in-chief of government machinery is of no less significance than otherwise. Both paradigms are as problematic in the larger scheme of things.
What is even more severe is the total collapse of the governing machinery at all levels.
The total focus of the new Cabinet and parliamentarians seems to be on whom to persuade to leave their current affiliations to the United National Party (UNP) and join the emerging political reality of another Rajapaksa-led Joint Opposition. The confusing realities of non-democratic alliances and political machinations have produced a new reality of parliamentarians being treated as cheap merchandise for buying and selling in the open marketplace. Such devaluation of those who have been elected to high office is a direct affront to the supreme teachings of Chanakya in the East and Socrates and his fellow philosophers in the West. Both, Chanakyas Arthashastra and Platos Republic have been thrown into the dustbin of contemporary back-channel lobbying. Trading of politicos for the convenience of coming into or staying in power has come to occupy supreme significance.
This disgraceful practice of buying and selling of politicos for the attainment of power is not new in the history of man. Nor would it come to a sudden halt in the future. But the clever and intelligent ones who still possess some modicum of civility, grace and self-respect would reckon that what must be denied and rejected for the sake of civility and inner progress of society must take control of the situation and demand that justice prevails.
Justice, as defined in terms of Socratess teachings is that It is to your advantage to be just and disadvantage to be unjust.
In such a confused context, the UNP has the following options:
Accept the grossly unjust current political manoeuvring and sit on the Opposition benches.
	Negotiate with both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Maithripala Sirisena and find a third person to be the Prime Minister and continue with the same Cabinet and Government party as it existed prior to October 26.
	Fight the new reality of seemingly unconstitutional act and persist with the demand that Ranil Wickremesinghes position as Prime Minister be restored before any other resolutions are considered.
Then resolve the matter of Wickremesinghes future as head of the Government with an acceptable and third candidate who is capable of mustering the support of the coalition that brought the current President into power.
The reality of transformation of politics from civil to evil has dawned!

Prez should apologize, says LGBTQ+ community
	
President Maithripala Sirisena should apologize to the LGBTQI+ community over his remark made at Governments rally on Monday in Colombo where he said he was promoting homophobia and public incitement of homophobic hatred.
Members of the Sri Lankan LGBTQI+ community categorically condemned President Maithripala Sirisenas statement made at Governments rally in Colombo saying he was promoting homophobia and public incitement of homophobic hatred.
Addressing a news briefing yesterday, LGBTQI+ activist and a lecturer at the Colombo University of Colombo Thiyagaraja Waradas said the President should be held responsible for any injustice that would happen to any LGBTQ+ community following this remark.
It is the minority LGBTQI+ community in rural areas, who have to undergo the repercussions because of this statement, Waradas said.
It is not a matter that can be taken lightly. The President used this term called butterfly life with a deliberate purpose to insult the LGBTQI+ community. Although it is a laughing matter for President Sirisena and the audience gathered, it is a huge blow to the entire LGBTQI+ community in Sri Lanka.
He said this was not the first occasion where he disregarded the community.
When a Cabinet Paper was brought to the Cabinet regarding the LGBTQI+ community rights, President Sirisena showed his agitation and prevented it from being approved in the Cabinet.
It is unfathomable as to why the President wanted to compare the LGBTQ+ community with the previous Cabinet and Ranil Wickremesinghe, Waradas added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Sajith reiterates he wont accept the premiership
	
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa, who confirmed that President Maithripala Sirisena had invited him to take over the Prime Minister Post, said today that he would not accept it even if President made another request, but would work towards settling the present crisis.
Mr Premadasa expressed this sentiment at a media briefing last morning.
The President asked me to take over the Premiership but I declined as my sole objective was to see the Yahapalana Government continued with the leadership of Mr Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.
I will not accept it even if President made another request as my sole effort is to see that the crisis is resolved, Mr Premadasa said.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also held the same policy.
What matters today is the welfare of the people and not the person, who holds Premiership, he added.
Asked whether he was scared to confront the UNP leader, Mr Premadasa said he was only scared of the negative impact, which the country was going to suffer as a result of this crisis.
At the same time, he said the move by President Sirisena to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister was unconstitutional.
He said the matter should be resolved through Parliament. However, he said who sits in Prime Ministers chair when the House is convened does not matter as the issue could be resolved by the MPs. (Yohan Perera)

SELFISHNESS
	
the selfishness of our time has reached gigantic proportions
	we prosper in our ignorance or we think we do!!!
	The lawmakers are now the lawbreakers



With the progress of time, man has become progressively selfish!!! It is time we started thinking in terms of WE not I, the selfishness of our time has reached gigantic proportions and the reason is that we prosper in our ignorance or we think we do!!! It is only the truth that can set us free; the acceptance that we come with nothing, we go with nothing so why all this traitorous scurry to HEAP THINGS, to AMASS WEALTH, POSITIONS, POWER, MONEY, millions and more notwithstanding how we do it Plotting, planning, manoeuvring and scheming; why do our people continue in the relentless pursuit of material things, irrespective of who gets hurt or gets killed in the process


Two PMs; one country (RW and MR)
Because of selfishness, our country is in absolute and utter chaos!!! The lawmakers are now the lawbreakers, the Police force in particular; they are an absolute disgrace to the uniform they wear!!! Now the highest in the land has succumbed to the selfishness of greed!!! The situation in general smacks of a coup detat; numerous little innuendos leading up to the grand finale  TWO PRIME MINISTERS IN ONE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY!!! It could have and would have been above board had they not resorted to such secrecy, carried it out within the framework of the Constitution, and not at a time when the citizens of this country were all in their homes, totally unprepared for the shock of a swearing-in of a Second Prime Minister!!!


Twist in the plot

Amazing how DIG Nalaka de Silvas alleged involvement in an assassination attempt on the President and former Defence Secretary suddenly SWITCHED to the alleged assassination of an ASP!!! Heaping more coals, Namal Kumara alleges that Sarath Fonseka is at the bottom of this coup with the Piece de Resistance being the President alleging that the incumbent Prime Minister was also privy to the contemplated assassination!!!


Change yourselves

For many Asian countries, if there is money no democracy is needed!!! The politicians can weave their magic and the people are deceived!!! Whatever they do, people accept them because democracy is not necessary for people dancing in the gallery; people must realise they cannot change the Government, they must change themselves!!! The sad part is that people accept the dirty politicians and when they come in procession they are greeted with kiribath and kavun !!! As long as there are people like this, the politicians are happy because in a country like this we dont need a Parliament, we dont need law and order!!! All problems can be solved like animals solving their problems on the road!!! Would the SUN EVER SHINE ON A COUNTRY SUCH AS THIS AS A NATION, WE AR E STUCK IN THE MUD!!! If and when a change occurs, will we as a country be governed by the criminals who will be brought back If the father in a house is a madman, what happens to that family We must keep in mind that leadership is not measured by how many people serve you; it is measured by how many people you serve!!! Serving is the greatest act of Leadership and serving the people is why you exist!!


Two options

Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once said there were two options for him!!! Either I get corrupted and I put my family in the Forbes list of the richest people in the world and leave my people with nothing; OR I serve my country, my people and let my country be in the list of the best 10 economies in the world; I chose the second option!!! Sri Lanka politicians said there were two options for them too, but the second option was already taken by the Singapore Prime Minister!!! NO SELFISHNESS, ONLY THE COUNTRY INVOLVED!!!


The difference
There was this lady in the USA, who after a long hard day at work would find time to take small parcels of food and give to the poor homeless!!! One day a businessman approached and questioned whether her work made a difference; while the businessman was reproaching her a man came up and said Excuse me, madam, I had no food and I thought I would have to go to sleep hungry; I prayed to God to send me some food and when I opened my eyes you were there, God bless you!!! God bless you too, the lady said and turning to the businessman with tears in her eyes said, Well it made a difference to him!!!
Every day we all have an opportunity to make a difference, but with so many problems going on it is hard not to think how much of a difference can I really make!!! How is my one small action actually going to change anything What is important to remember is that you do not need to change the world, you do not need to solve the countrys problems; but if you just focus on helping solve one persons problem to make even one small difference in just one persons life; TO THAT ONE PERSON IT COULD MEAN THE WORLD, REMEMBER IF YOU CAN MAKE JUST ONE PERSON SMILE, LAUGH OR FEEL LOVED AND TREAT HIM OR HER WITH KINDNESS, WITH RESPECT, THEN YOU HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE!!!

Sinhala Only  in retrospect
	
The Sinhala Only legislation of 1956 was immediately turned into a bogey by anti-majority propagandists to frighten off progressive political reforms aimed at redressing the historical injustices perpetrated against the nation by European occupations of the previous 450 years. But the dethronement of English by making Sinhala the only official language in 24 hours (as S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike had pledged) was not the renegade step which it was made out to be. An obviously well-informed senior citizen signing as ND, in an opinion piece published in The Island/November 1, recalled that even (Prime Minister) John Kotelawala of the UNP, during electioneering that year, promised to make Sinhala the official language, though it was Bandaranaike who was elected to power and was able to implement the proposal. Making the language of the majority Sinhalese the official language was one of the well meant affirmative actions taken to put an end to the oppressive discrimination that, particularly, they were made to endure under the British and even under their native successors who got into their boots on the formers departure. ND also recollected that it was J.R. Jayawardene who moved in the State Council that Sinhala be made the official language in 1944. In other words, it was a necessary transitional first-step taken towards a fuller realisation of national independence from foreign domination; it was not intended to further disadvantage any section of the broad mass of the Lankan population that had long been oppressed and dispossessed by British colonialism.
Affirmative action regimes implemented by some progressive governments since 1956 including language policy reforms have generally failed due to non-cooperation from certain opportunistic minority politicians who exploit race or religion to win votes at elections, for whom politics is everything and national interest is nothing. It has often been charged that so-called Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinism has done a lot of damage to Sri Lanka. The truth is that the Sinhala Buddhists have always been victims of chauvinists of other brands.
The 1956 Sinhala Only slogan has to be understood in terms of the political context that prevailed at that time. The existing political reality then was characterised by the majority of the common people being oppressed by an English-speaking Westernised native ruling elite (a privileged minority) that followed at the heels of the recently departed European colonizers in government. Whereas English was a key to privilege and a badge of prestige for this elite, it was a sword of oppression (kaduwa) for the masses. The Sinhala Only policy knocked it off its pedestal.
The Sinhala Only legislation was before long amended in Parliament allowing reasonable use of Tamil. This reformative trend continued until Tamil was also made an official language in the early 1980s, and today both languages enjoy the same official language status. However, there are still lapses in the implementation of the official languages policy, which affect both communities. Scarcity of Sinhala and Tamil bilingual proficiency among government servants has been a perennial problem, but this is not an insurmountable obstacle, provided politicians in power make themselves responsible for the implementation of official language policies made into law. Such issues need to be addressed by those elected to power without unnecessarily politicising them.
The 1956 Sinhala Only slogan has to be understood in terms of the political context that prevailed at that time
Language policy changes introduced in 1956 and appropriately reformed since have done a lot of good to the common masses of the country, particularly in the education of the young. Although language management began to rouse wide popular awareness only after 1956, the subject had already engaged the attention of the patriotic segment of the countrys intelligentsia decades before that date. This was mainly due to rising levels of education among common Sinhala and Tamil speaking masses who had been deliberately denied it in colonial times; at that time a decent education was available only in the English medium for the children of the privileged class, and it prepared them to serve as cogs in the colonial government machinery, in the businesses, and in professions such as law, medicine and engineering. This English medium education was superior to the rudimentary kind of Swabhasha or vernacular (Sinhala and Tamil) medium instruction that catered to the rural poor who far outnumbered the privileged minority.
The instruction provided in English medium schools cost the government many times more than what it spent on vernacular education. This was deliberate government policy. To prevent poor parents from sending their progeny to English medium schools, the authorities introduced a fee levying system. The fee charged was not very high, but it was high enough to be too prohibitive for poor parents to afford. The education minister of the State Council C.W.W. Kannangara succeeded in 1944 in seeing his free education bill through after an intense six-year struggle against severe opposition mounted by the privileged class. Initially, his reforms benefited the minority of children attending English medium schools more than it did rural children, because the former didnt have to pay for their education any longer. But this was insignificant compared to the immense benefit that the free education policy brought to the rural children studying in the Swabhasha mediums. It was not possible to provide English medium education to all the children at that time, and it is not possible even today for a variety of reasons.
It is sometimes argued that Bandaranaike played the official language card to gain power in 1956. This is wrong. Bandaranaike left the UNP in 1951 on a principled basis to form his own SLFP. He later conceived of the countrys polity as a close-knit society consisting of a Fivefold Great Force or Pancha Maha Balavegaya spelt out as Sangha-Veda-Guru-Govi-Kamkaru or Buddhist Monks-Native Physicians-Teachers-Peasant Farmers and Workers. This was seen as an authentic analysis of the prevalent socio-political reality of the time. It seems that the small Westernised ruling elite represented by the UNP was excluded from this formula. Thus dawned the Era of the Common Man -- as Bandaranaike often described it. It is nonsense to say Bandaranaike did away with English as the medium of instruction in all educational institutions, as someone said recently.
The minority of schools that had English medium education continued to function as before while Swabhasha education greatly expanded. Kannangara reforms started the Central School System in order to extend English medium education to the villages, where well-performing rural students were selected at a competitive examination to study in the English medium from Class Six onwards. However, since it was held that children learn best in their mother tongue, the pioneers of free education decided to phase out the English medium from government schools completely by 1960. And this is what happened.
Although the limited English medium instruction in the government school system thus came to an end, the importance of English for a proper education was never lost sight of. All post-independence governments, particularly, those after 1956, paid the highest attention to the teaching of English as a second language. But the effort became a failure for various reasons, which I dont want to elaborate on here. It is not true that nationalist politics led to an abandonment of English. The truth is that English was made available to children from all classes irrespective of their economic or social background only after free education was introduced. This was done in compliance with the advice of the farseeing political and civil nationalist leaders of the past century who unerringly recognised English as the indispensable key to modernisation.
All nationalist intellectuals of the time emphasised the importance of English for a decent education. Even Anagarika Dharmapala (1864-1933), who used to be condemned, until recently, for his alleged racism, chauvinism, fanaticism, etc., (though he was not guilty of any of these) stressed the need to learn English, in addition the mother tongue; he also wanted young people to learn science and technology, for these were indispensable for creating a modern independent progressive society. He was not averse to the adoption of good social etiquette from the Westernised class. For instance, he wrote articles in Sinhala explaining, for those who liked to use forks and spoons during meals, how to do so in the proper manner. Anagarika Dharmapala was a passionate anti-imperialist, and he made no secret of this, either in his words or in his deeds. But he was careful to ensure that his criticism of the government was within the law. Anagarika was primarily a Buddhist missionary and secondarily a fervently nationalist social reformer. In both roles, he was a prodigious writer and speaker. According to the late Ananda Guruge, who researched into the Anagarikas life and work for over fifty years, the bulk of his writings and speeches (75%) was done in English. All the pioneering nationalists who worked for freedom from foreign rule were English educated, and acknowledged the value of the language for the betterment of the future of the Sri Lankan people.
The language policy changes that began with Sinhala Only were meant to eliminate English language based discrimination that prevailed even after independence was achieved in 1948. Sinhala is our birthright. It is an inalienable legacy of profound importance for us. Sinhala is a most ancient language. Even Mahinda Thera who formally introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka more than two thousand three hundred years ago preached in the language of the islanders, Sihala/Sinhale. While preserving that invaluable linguistic heritage, we need to learn English with the same dedication that we learn Sinhala for our survival as a modern nation. There has never been a question about this need over the past one hundred and fifty years, though colonial discrimination against the dispossessed majority of the population prevented its fulfilment over most of that period. However, English language learning in combination with ICT and even English medium education received a new impetus in the last fifteen years. This trend must be fostered and properly channelled in the broad national interest, while preserving our own proud linguistic heritage.

## Title: SL students duped into working in Taiwan slaughterhouses

SL students duped into working in Taiwan slaughterhouses
	
The Kang Ning University in Tainan, Taiwan has been reprimanded by the Education Ministry for allowing over 40 of its Sri Lankan students to work in slaughterhouses in Taipei and Tainan, Taiwan News reported quoting China Times. 
Sri Lankan students have said that, at the end of last year, senior officials from the university, travel agents, and government officials from Sri Lanka went to seven or eight high schools in their hometown to give presentations on the study opportunities in Taiwan.
Kang Ning senior officials reportedly said to the students, "As long as you pay for your air tickets, you can go to Taiwan to study for free, and you can earn money by working part-time."
Yu Jung-hui, chairman of the Union of Private School Educators (UPRISE), said on Tuesday that more than 60 Sri Lankan students came to Taiwan and received admission permits from Kang Ning, but strangely, they entered the country on sightseeing visas. Once they entered Taiwan, many did not go to school, but were instead sent directly to work ,while others worked after class.
Yu said that perhaps because of the different relationships between departments, some students were sent to Taipei to work, some were sent to Tainan to work instead.
Yu said that the director of the Tainan campus of Kang Ning coordinated with brokers in dispatching the Sri Lankan students to work in underground factories and poultry slaughterhouses. It was illegal at first, so they all worked in the middle of the night, and the work was unstable. For this reason, one student may end up working at several different jobs over a short period of time.
The students had been told that they would receive a monthly salary of NT$ 22,000 (New Taiwan Dollars), but only actually received NT$6,000 to NT$8,000 per month.
The students believed that the remainder of their salaries was being paid by the brokers to the school to cover tuition, however, the university said it never received such tuition payments.
A Sri Lankan student, who went by the pseudonym Roger, told the United Daily News that, in the six months since he came to Taiwan, he felt he was not studying, but rather working, and said, "I regret studying in Taiwan, and I don't trust Taiwanese anymore."
After the news broke about the Sri Lankan students being exploited at Kang Ning, they had to make the difficult decision of staying or returning to their home country. Yu said that each of the Sri Lankan students on average owed about NT$40,000 in fees to the school.
As the school felt they were innocent, all the tuition fees for their first year at the university were waived. However, if these students cannot pay their tuition fees for their second year of college by August of next year, they will have no choice but to return to Sri Lanka.
Yu pointed out that many universities are facing the dilemma of inadequate enrollment. After the government introduced the New Southbound Policy, they recruited students through brokers, but they also fell victim to fraud rings.
In the case of Kang Ning, the broker it used to recruit the Sri Lankan students, a Mr. Chu, had already become notorious for bringing a Chinese acrobat troupe to Taiwan to engage in prostitution.
Yen Kang-tsung, Chief Secretary of the University of Kang Ning said that some Sri Lankan students wrote letters to the Education Ministry complaining about the situation.
The Ministry then asked the school to carry out an investigation, after which it found that Chu had been using a fake name and suspected him of being a fraudster, making the school also a victim, said Yen.
Yen emphasized that arrangements had been made for the students to work illegally by the "fake brokers" before they came to the university to attend classes, and the school had issued work permits. Yen said the school was completely unaware of the situation.
Of the 61 students from Sri Lanka originally enrolled at the university, 20 have since returned home, while 41 still remain.

## Title: SLIM Brand Excellence  A Gateway to the Global Sphere of Brands

SLIM Brand Excellence  A Gateway to the Global Sphere of Brands
	
Mr. Pradeep Edward- President of SLIM Brand Excellence & Mr. Roshan Fernando- Vice President of SLIM Brand Excellence
As the curtain comes up on one of its major events - the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards, the luminaries of the countrys National Body for Marketing, apprised the public on the role of the organization and the successful re-launch of its event for 2018. The President of SLIM, Mr. Pradeep Edward and the Vice President, Mr. Roshan Fernando recently addressed queries from the media about the organizations success in implementing new developments to help the local industry stand among the biggest and best players in the international arena.     
Q: Describe the inception of SLIM and its foremost purpose
P: The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing was founded in 1970 as a means of building a cohesive network amongst the countrys marketing fraternity. It was incorporated by an act of Parliament, recognizing it as the National Body for Marketing. The difference between SLIM and any other institute is its open environment, which welcomes marketers from all backgrounds and companies. We have had Presidents who are graduates from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, PIM and CIM among other groves of academe. As such, SLIM could be considered the Maha Gedara of Marketing in Sri Lanka, bringing all of the countrys marketers together under a single banner.
How do events by SLIM contribute to the development and growth of professionals in the Marketing fraternity
VP: We organize several national level events. Apart from Brand Excellence we have the Effies, the SLIM Nielsen Peoples Awards and NASCO. This year we have initiated two new events  the SLIM DIGIs, which will be held next year in January, and Brand Week, which is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka and will serve as a link to SLIM Brand Excellence. These are the national level awards programs organized and hosted by SLIM to provide platforms of recognition and education to various sectors of the industry. We have also introduced a special CSR project titled Gamata Marketing as a means of boosting entrepreneurship, and Marketing Rocks a program for school children, which is dedicated to encouraging and educating the next generation of marketers. In all, we have eight major events through which we contribute to the growth of the Marketing fraternity.
What kind of developments do you see in the countrys Marketing and economic sphere due to the efforts of SLIM
P: The activities of SLIM are segmented into two primary parts  events and education. However, most of SLIMs events consist of an educational segment. At SLIM we dont just introduce a product, we ensure its continuity. For example, the Brand Excellence program includes a number of informative workshops in order to educate participants on the best practices in the industry and most effective methods by which to boost their brands. It is not just about organizing an awards ceremony but about ensuring that those who participate in our events leave with much more than a trophy.
We have always made sure that the projects, programs and products we introduce are relevant to the industry. In the case of Brand Excellence, our objective is to introduce Sri Lankan brands to the global Marketing community. Before the inception of Brand Excellence, we noticed that Sri Lankan brands took a back seat to Indian, and other foreign and multinational brands. Following the introduction of Brand Excellence, we have seen many Sri Lankan brands that have won awards, go global, build their presence in other countries and become market leaders across the world.
What are the most significant changes made to SLIM Brand Excellence over the past seventeen years
VP: The original SLIM Brand Excellence blue print was devised by the late Professor Uditha Liyanage. Brand Excellence was launched in 2002 under the presidency of Mr. Taslim Rahman. This year we will be celebrating the 17th anniversary of Brand Excellence. At its inception SLIM Brand Excellence was the primary platform for brands to judge their performance and effectiveness. The past seventeen years have witnessed major brands battle it out amongst themselves for the ultimate prize.
As the National Body for Marketing we asked ourselves what is our next step The obvious next level is to encourage local brands to compete with global brands, to be recognized as international players. We realized that the next stage of Brand Excellence is to open a star gate for our local brands to reach the global sphere. To do so we decided on a 360-degree re-launch of the entire process including the award itself and the logo. I would like to thank Mr. Thushara Perera and the Blue Print Committee for their hard work in coming up with and implementing all the relevant changes.
One of the main changes is the inclusion of SMEs. We simplified the entry kit and encouraged members of the SME sector to present their brands with no language barrier whatsoever. We simplified the entry kit to give them a basic knowledge of branding, and how to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their brands. This time we reached out to all twenty-five districts, with our committee fanning out and conducting many presentations and training programs. This was a tremendous achievement for us, as it serves as a testament to the fact that as the National Body for Marketing we have spread the message of Brand Excellence throughout the entire country.
What post-event results do you hope to see following the conclusion of this years SLIM Brand Excellence campaign
P: I look forward to seeing more Sri Lankan brands enter the global community. Our infrastructure is currently laid out in such a way, with the ports and infrastructure development, which this is the ideal time for exports to flourish. I personally believe that tourism and exports have the potential to become two of the fastest growth areas for Sri Lanka.
One main result we hope to see is the development of the SME sector. We made significant changes to this years SLIM Brand Excellence blue print to make sure that it was not only for the big boys but for the smaller players of the industry as well. So we would definitely like to see a lot more SMEs coming up to the level of global brands.
We have also seen a significant number of new entries this year, so maybe we will witness some significant changes in the results of this years Brand Excellence. We are also confident that we will see a number of brands going global.
As the President of SLIM, I would like to thank Mr. Thushara Perera, a past president and his team who were in charge of the entire turn-around process. I would also like to offer my gratitude to Mr. Dinesh Nalliah the Head of the Judging Panel and all the judges for their commitment, and the Brand Excellence Committee headed by the Vice President of SLIM, Mr. Roshan Fernando.
What do you foresee for the future of SLIM Brand Excellence
VP: In the near future we will set up the platform and begin the journey towards taking SLIM Brand Excellence out to the region. We hope to develop and expand the new model further next year, beginning with the CMO Forum, including Brand Week and concluding with the Brand Excellence Awards.

Sri Lankan politics stoops to a new low
	

Though the present political crisis highlights the fact that political crossovers influenced by financial inducements are punishable offences, it also poses the question whether the law is in place (Photo AFP)


The days of Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake are history now. In fact, the prevailing political scene in Sri Lanka has left no room for gentleman politics. While politics was more often a money spinner with mud-slinging thrown in, it stooped to a new low when candidates, elected through peoples votes, began to crossover. Initially a crossover meant that one would lose his seat in Parliament, but a judgement passed during the latter stages of the Sri Lankan melodramatic political scene, crossovers became a common phenomenon; common to the point that they are instigated with staggering inducements. The recent political crisis bears testimony to this scenario. While experts claim that a political crossover followed by an inducement is a punishable offence under the Bribery Act, the law definitely doesnt seem to be in place.

Taking a close look at the unethical political crossovers and the staggering inducements involved
	In the long-term there will be an ever growing trust deficit in elected officials
	there is deep mistrust in elected public officials at present and its necessary to investigate


This also relates to a question about transparency and the entire concern about selling peoples votes. Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on why political crossovers and accepting inducements are unethical and why such practices are an insult to the peoples sovereignty.

Background of crossovers
1965 : 13 SLFP MPs led by C.P De Silva left the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government.
Dr. W Dahanayake crossing over during Dudley Senanayakes Government to form a seven-party coalition.
1994 - 2005 : G.L Pieris, Mahinda Wijesakara and S. B Dissanayake featured in a batch who crossed over.
Early 2000 : When RW was PM several people crossed over including Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Wijepala Mendis and Stanley Kalpage.
: Tissa Attanayake, after holding the post of the UNP General Secretary for eight years.
: Dayasiri Jayasekara, from UNP to SLFP
: Udaya Gammanpila, JHU to SLFP
: Wimal Weerawansha, JVP to SLFP

The person taking money should realise that he or she is in that party because of the people. Crossing over is unethical and in that sense theres no point in having elections



A judgement to legitimise crossovers
A crossover previously meant that one could lose his or her seat in Parliament. However in 1999 a judgement attributed to former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva allowed MPs to switch sides without losing their seat in Parliament. Hence the legitimisation of crossovers took place. The result was crossovers becoming a common phenomenon and adding hay to the fire are staggering inducements offered to the politicians which could be seen in todays political landscape. A common debate in this scenario is why there needs to be an election if elected candidates could crossover for staggering inducements.

An insult to peoples sovereignty
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Terence Purasinghe, Senior lecturer and Head - Department of Political Science at University of Sri Jayawardenapura, said that defecting is an insult to the peoples sovereignty. The person taking money should realise that he or she is in that party because of the people. Crossing over is unethical and in that sense theres no point in having elections. They can form Governments among themselves. Therefore it is a blow to democracy, said Purasinghe.
He further said that politicians should abide by principles if such things are to stop. All ministers have a responsibility and this is a problem regarding discipline. In the long -term, it has a negative impact on democracy. he added.


Inducements a criminal offence
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Professor Suri Ratnapala, Emeritus Professor of Law at the University of Queensland, Australia and former Senior State Counsel said that crossovers are undemocratic in a list system of proportional representation. Electors vote for the party even though they have a preference right to rank members within the list. Inducements to crossover will almost certainly amount to a criminal offence under bribery and anti-corruption laws. Bribing a member of parliament to influence his or her conduct as parliamentarian is a very serious contempt of Parliament and a breach of parliamentary privilege. The person who offers the bribe and members who accept them are both guilty of contempt. Crossovers on illegal inducements are a scourge in emerging democracies. They defeat the will of the people and debase the polity, said Prof.Ratnapala.

In this regard Transparency International Sri Lanka has filed a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) on November 5

Bribing of an MP a punishable offence
It is in contravention of the law, said Asoka Obeysekere, Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka. Section 14 of the Bribery Act makes the Bribery of a Member of Parliament an offence punishable with up to seven years of rigorous imprisonment. It is also of concern that the President, despite his commitment to fighting corruption, has prorogued Parliament. In a democracy, at times of uncertainty, it is essential that public trust in democratic institutions is built by ensuring institutions such as Parliament is open to the public and are not closed off to facilitate back room deals, said Obeysekere.

When asked how it affects the political culture in a country, Obeysekere said that there is deep mistrust in elected public officials at present and it is important that the necessary investigations are done and action is taken against those having attempted to bribe parliamentarians and those allegedly accepting such bribes. In this regard Transparency International Sri Lanka has filed a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) on November 5 along with a CD of selected voice recordings highlighting alleged offers of Rs.500 million for MP crossovers. CIABOC must now take the appropriate action and be mindful of the need to build public trust in its fight against corruption. It must therefore investigate thoroughly and also importantly conduct investigations in a timely manner, he added.


Bribing a member of parliament to influence his or her conduct as parliamentarian is a very serious contempt of Parliament and a breach of parliamentary privilege


In the long-term there will be an ever growing trust deficit in elected officials and these actions further cement a troubling decline in standards of elected officials, he added. Whats most concerning is that this would dissuade talented young people from engaging in serving the people. Their involvement in serving the people is what the country will need to rely on to ensure future prosperity. A further step in the right direction is to ensure that there are publicly available asset disclosures of parliamentarians. Whilst this will not curb corruption on its own, this will ensure that there is sufficient public oversight to make those in elected offices be more accountable to their voters, he said.

Too many aspirants for key portfolios!
	
Scrambling for portfolios by too many aspirants had reportedly posed a formidable challenge to the Top Two who were in a hurry to form the top team to run the new government, they say.
For example, the Top Two had to face the toughest time when both the Tuition Master and the gabby match-maker from the central hills wanted to be the custodian of the big purse. As for the Tuition Master he had got his party organization in the electorate also to press that he be offered the big purse.
Meanwhile, the gabby one from the central hills had been calling on the new Number Two at regular intervals to inform him that Number One was quite willing and what mattered now was his (Number Twos) consent.
Not to be outdone, Tuition Master had put his foot down he would accept nothing but the big purse. Meanwhile, the white-collar experts handpicked to supervise the purse had thrown their own spanner in the works saying, We are not prepared to work with either one!
So, Number One had no alternative, but to entrust the job of handling the big purse to Number Two himself. The disappointed duo has gone into a sulk, they say.

Tourists giving SL a miss amid its crisis: Reports
	
A political crisis in Sri Lanka, where two prime ministers are fighting for power, is scaring away tourists and raising questions over foreign aid, ringing alarm bells for the economy as the currency slumps to record lows, the Straits Times reported.
The turmoil in the Indian Ocean nation that has seen one premier refuse to be sacked, and another battle to prove a majority in a Parliament that is banned from meeting, has caused the major upheaval that Sri Lanka cannot afford.
Amid warnings from politicians of a bloodbath, if the dispute escalates, tourists are cancelling hotel bookings just as Sri Lankan beaches and major sites like the Temple of the Tooth prepare for peak season.
While no official figures have been given, deluxe hotels have reported cancellations and a critical decline in new bookings in the past 10 days.
"This comes at the worst possible time when people in Europe are making their holiday plans abroad," a Colombo city hotel executive said.
"We have had a lot of cancellations from the United States."
Western nations have warned their citizens to be on their guard in Sri Lanka.
"You should exercise vigilance and avoid all demonstrations or large political gatherings," a British government advisory said.
Tourism is a cornerstone of the economy. More than 2.4 million foreign holidaymakers visited Sri Lanka last year, spending US$3.2 billion (S$4.4 billion). The authorities had been counting on a rise of more than 10 per cent this year.
And whether Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe stays in office or former president Mahinda Rajapaksa takes his place, foreign earnings will be badly needed.
The Asian Development Bank had predicted that the economy would grow by 3.8 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 2019, but all bets are now off.
The power vacuum has raised doubts over a US$1.5 billion Japanese-funded light rail project and another US$480 million of US finance for transport and health, a Wickremesinghe minister, Mr Patali Ranawaka, said last week.
The International Monetary Fund was about to announce an agreement on releasing a new tranche of a US$1.5 billion loan to Sri Lanka when President Maithripala Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe on Oct 26.

He has said this in response to a question asked by Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry on Monday whether the British Government recognises Ranil Wickremesinghe or Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
State Minister Field said they were deeply concerned by the political situation in Sri Lanka.
I have called on all parties to ensure that the constitution is respected and due political and legal process upheld.

We would not protect politicians, but the Constitution - JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has taken a firm decision to vote against the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaka as the Prime Minister and the prorogation of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena in Parliament, the Politburo member of the JVP, Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath said yesterday.
Mr. Herath told Daily Mirror that the JVP would not protect any politician, political party or group in this political cum Constitutional crisis but the Constitution and democracy.
We are not ready to protect President Maithripala Sirisena, Ranil Wickremesinghe or Mahinda Rajapaksa. Our prime concern is to safeguard democracy and uphold democratic principles. Our position is that the appointment of Rajapaksa and prorogation of Parliament by President Sirisena is a violation of the Constitution and against the democratic way of governance. Therefore, all six members of the JVP will vote against this action in Parliament when a vote is taken, Mr. Herath told Daily Mirror.
He added that if a No Confidence Motion was brought against the new government or against Prime Minister Rajapaksa in Parliament, the JVP would also support it. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
