SL fined for slow over-rate against WI


	

Sri Lanka has been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate against the West Indies in the fifth match of the tri-nation series in Bulawayo on Wednesday, the ICC announced today.

Javagal Srinath of the Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fine after Upul Tharanga’s side was ruled to be two overs short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration.
 
In accordance with Article 2.5.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.
 
As such, Tharanga has been fined 40 per cent of his match fee, while his players have received 20 per cent fines. If Sri Lanka commits another minor over-rate breach in an ODI within 12 months of this offence with Tharanga as captain, it will be deemed a second offence by Tharanga and he will face a suspension.
 
Tharanga pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing.

The charge was laid by on-field umpires Richard Illingworth and Jeremiah Matibiri, third umpire Michael Gough and fourth official Langton Rusere.
