MP Namal Rajapaksa today filed two defamatory cases in the Colombo District Court against two investigative officers of the FCID on the manner in which it had investigated allegations of misappropriating Rs.70 million paid to him by the Krrish Company for a rugby tournament in 2013.

Counsel Athula Silva appearing for Mr. Rajapaksa filed two separate cases claiming Rs.100 million each as compensation from the respondents -- FCID OIC R.A.K.Premaratne and SI Shantha Lal.

In his petition, Mr. Rajapaksa stated that the manner in which the investigation was carried by the FCID was improper and illegal and that the prosecution had deliberately violated the procedural aspects of conducting an inquiry with the intention of tarnishing his political image.

He said he had suffered physical and mental stress while in remand custody in connection with the inquiry.

Mr. Rajapaksa was remanded for seven days from July 11 to 18 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate on the misappropriating charges. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
