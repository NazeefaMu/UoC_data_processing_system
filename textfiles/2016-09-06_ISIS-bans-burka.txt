ISIS bans burka


	

The ISIS has outlawed the burka at their security centres in a northern Iraqi city, despite previously brutally enforcing a law requiring them to be worn, Daily Mail reported today.

The terror group has banned women entering the buildings in Mosul while wearing the full-face covering after a number of commanders were killed by veiled women.

Previously women in Syria and Iraq have been beaten or even killed by ISIS's 'morality police' for not wearing a veil to conceal their body and eyes.

The website Iran Front Page were informed of the ban by a source in Nineveh, Iraq, on Friday.

The normal strict dress code implemented by ISIS forces all women to be covered from head to toe in black.

Women in the rest of Mosul except for the security centres, and in all other areas controlled by ISIS, will still have to abide by the strict dress code, it is understood.

Last month, women were pictured celebrating the liberation of the Syrian city of Manbij by burning the sombre outfits.

One girl grabbed the black burka she was wearing and pulled it off her head to reveal her face, an act which would have seen her severely punished under ISIS.

Meanwhile, another group of youngsters were seen dancing around a burka that has been discarded on the ground and left to burn.
