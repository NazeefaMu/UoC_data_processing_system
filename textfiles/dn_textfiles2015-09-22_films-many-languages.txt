New Gleanings
Of films in many languages

Why do we watch a Movie/Film/Cinema? For that matter, why do we read fiction/flash fiction or even theatre/drama? It is for entertainment you would /may say. Right.
But it is not merely for sheer entertainment or to while away the time. At the same time, more serious minded people among us would like to be entertained in a fruitful manner, meaning that they look for artistic qualities in what they perceive. There are experts in particular fields of interests who are critics who expect certain standards in what they perceive. As against the dictionary meaning of criticism, such critics are not mere condemners, but appreciating the finer points in a workout and politely point out the shortcomings or defects in such works and thus hold a balance in their judgment. That’s why their candid opinions are welcomed by the creators of such works.
The perceivers of art are sometimes excited by the discovery of critics of things that did not strike them at first. The enlightened viewers or readers and the critics identify themselves with the characters in a film for instance and are engrossed in experiencing the same pleasures or pains. They learn how the characters resolve their problems and so on. They find what they could not do are achieved by the characters and are thrilled by their actions.
