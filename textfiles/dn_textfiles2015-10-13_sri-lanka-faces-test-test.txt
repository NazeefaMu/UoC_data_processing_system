Sri Lanka faces test before Test

While Sri Lanka will be looking to salvage some of its lost prestige after losing back to back Test series against Pakistan and India, the West Indies is in search of their elusive Test victory formula in the island which they have found hard to attain. The West Indies has never won a Test match in Sri Lanka.
The two sides meet in the first Test at the Galle International Cricket Stadium today.
But the Sri Lankans also cannot hide the fact that picking the final eleven has caused them the biggest headache following the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara, the lost case of Jehan Mubarak, the poor form of Upul Tharanga (both dropped), the injury to fast bowler Shaminda Eranga, the banning of Tharindu Kaushal's so-called 'doosra' and the non selection of off-spinner Suraj Randiv who plucked five wickets in a side match against the West Indies, which have all contributed to the uncertainty.
The only aspect that Sri Lanka can look forward to with some form of positivenes is that the series is on home turf and the West Indies are currently not the strongest of teams.
The preparation for both sides has also been hampered by rain, but at the same time are confident that they had adequate exposure prior to the all important Test and trying out the new faces for the right combination will be another test.
Sri Lanka in particular has been quite successful in discovering a couple of players who no doubt can be an asset for the future. One such player is left-hander Milinda Siriwardena who has proved his class beyond doubt.

Sirwardene who has made many tours with the Sri Lanka 'A' team has finally given the selectors a stern reminder by scoring a century against the tourists in the concluded three-day game. Siriwardena also gave out an impressive display in the ODI series against Pakistan.
Minodh Bhanuka is the other player who went on to score a century in the three-day game at the SSC ground.
The experienced duo of Dhammika Prasad and Nuwan Pradeep will share the new ball for Sri Lanka. Veteran Rangana Herath who bowled Sri Lanka to victory against India at Galle in the First Test will spearhead the Sri Lankan spin attack and is likely to be supported by young off spinner Tharindu Kaushal. Kusal Perera will bat at number seven strengthening the lower middle order.

Sri Lanka (from): Angelo Mathews (Captain), Lahiru Thirimanne (V. Captain), Kaushal Silva, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Milinda Siriwardena, Kusal Mendis, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Tharindu Kaushal, Dhammika Prasad, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha Chameera,
