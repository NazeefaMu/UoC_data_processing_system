Angered over the inaction of the Puducherry Government to rescue the 10 fishermen detained by the Sri Lankan Navy, families of detained Indian fishermen went on hunger strike on Monday, The Hindu reported.
Sixty-five year old Alamelu from Karaikalmedu on Monday threatened to commit suicide by dousing herself with kerosene in front of the Head Post Office in Puducherry, if the government fails to rescue the 10 fishermen detained by the Sri Lankan Navy.
Eight fishermen from Karaikal and two from Nagapattinam were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy on poaching charges on December 8. Veeramani, owner of a mechanised boat named ‘Veerarajan’, along with nine others were alleged to have been fishing in the Sri Lankan waters east of Point Pedro coast. The boat was moved to the Karainagar jetty.
Alamelu said: “We want Katchatheevu back. Why is the government not taking any action? Why are they not giving us Katchatheevu? To whom does the sea belong? Fishing is our livelihood. If the government does not want us to venture into the sea then let them provide us jobs.”
She added that they will go back only when the government takes a decision in this regard.
