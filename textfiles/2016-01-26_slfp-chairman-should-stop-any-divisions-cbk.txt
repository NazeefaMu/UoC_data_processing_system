Former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga responding to a question asked by journalists on attempts by a section of the SLFP to form a new party under the leadership of ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, pointed out that it was the party's chairman who should decide on this matter and said had she been the chairperson she would have known how to handle them.
Addressing a gathering at the Thaipongal ceremony organized by the Gannoruwa Ranabima Rajakeeya Vidyalaya, she said that bringing an end to the war did not mean that peace prevailed in the county.
Ms. Kumaratunga said the attempt to gain cheap political mileage by claiming that the Sinhala community was the majority and then discriminating other communities resulted in anti-Tamil anti-Muslim political movements spreading racism.
