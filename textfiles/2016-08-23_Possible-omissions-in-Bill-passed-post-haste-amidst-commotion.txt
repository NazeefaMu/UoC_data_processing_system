The Betel leaf purohitas in yahapalanaya met the new Big Boss by appointment the other day. They wanted to discuss in particular the ugly scenes played out in the well of the House the day the OMP Bill was passed sans debate.

 


The Betel leaf purohitas at these talks requested the Big Boss to ascertain whether some amendments put into shape by the AG’s department on his initiative had gone into the Act. 
“If those amendments had failed to get into the Act due to the rush of things in the midst of the commotion that prevailed in the House, we may have to re-introduce them,” the new Big Boss had assured the purohitas.
