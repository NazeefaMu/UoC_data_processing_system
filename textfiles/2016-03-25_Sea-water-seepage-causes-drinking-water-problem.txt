Sea water seepage causes drinking water problem


	

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said sea water had seeped into the rivers in the Kalutara and Matara Districts due to the prevailing dry weather.

A DMC spokesman said this is caused by the reduction of water levels in the rivers.

The flow of river water into the sea comes to a standstill and the process is reversed with the reduced water levels in rivers.

The DMC has made arrangements to supply drinking water to people in the affected areas.

Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department predicted that dry weather will continue. (Yohan Perera)
