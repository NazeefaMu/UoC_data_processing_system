Minister John Amaratunga has told a UNP rally in Ja-Ela recently that no one should be afraid of anyone, because the government and the police belonged to the UNP this time.

“The government and the police are ours this time. No one should be afraid. We will deal with anyone. What we want is your vote only,” he said and added that the prices of rice, vegetables and coconut had risen because of the prevailing drought and that the government had allowed anyone to import these commodities.
