The former strongman has called off his much talked- about visit to the land of the dragon, they say. 
Initial reports said that the former boss had planned to attend a Buddhist temple ceremony in that country. 
The former strongman’s planned foreign visit attracted the attention of not only the authorities here, but also of the powerful world leaders as well. And there had been swaps of intelligence reports between interested countries. 
Meanwhile, the former strongman had made it known through his office he had called off the planned visit due to health reasons. By the way, when a senior politico inquired from the former strongman about the conflicting reports about his planned visit going viral, the latter had replied: “Some have set stories afloat that I have been planning to hold talks with leaders of that country. If I want to speak to those leaders, it would be only a matter of giving them a call. All stories about my visit to that country making rounds these days are baseless. I have not cancelled the visit. I have only postponed it.”
