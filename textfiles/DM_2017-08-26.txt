A must read for those who value peace and joy
	
The book of joy
Lasting Happiness in a Changing World
His Holiness The Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu with Douglas Abrams
Hutchinson, London, UK. 2016. 599.00 (1,795.00)
As students we were advised to read autobiographies and biographies. Hence my reading of this very valuable book gifted to me by a very good friend recently. 
In this book, the author, in the context of a dialogue conducts a discussion on the subjects of joy and peace. 
This book has an introduction presented in the context of the Archbishops visit to celebrate the special birthday of Dalai Lama, where a discussion takes place. 
The Dalai Lama is a refuge in India in the context of the Sino-Tibetan conflict. 
The Archbishop, has a sense of victory and triumph having survived the horrible apartheid in South Africa. 
The Dalai Lama says, the ultimate source of happiness is within us. The Archbishop says We grow in kindness when our kindness is tested. 
When Nelson Mandela invited the Archbishop to chair the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Archbishop produced a report in which the theme is No future, no life without Forgiveness. 
Thereafter the BBC invited the Archbishop to get involved in the Peace Process in
Northern Ireland. 
Several years ago Pope John Paul the 2nd had a Congress of Religions at which the then Dalai Lama was present. 
Having read this valuable book, I am of the opinion that all of us interested in Joy and Peace should read this. Happy reading!

Changing abortion law: Catholic Church says No
	
The Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka yesterday overwhelmingly condemned the governments decision to legalize abortion.
Catholic Bishops Conference President Rt. Rev. Dr. J. Winston S. Fernando in a letter said the matter was discussed indepth during a plenary meeting held recently.
We say no to abortion under any circumstances. We believe that the precious life of a human being starts at the very moment of conception and is sacred, he said and underscored the fact that no one had the right to tamper with human life in any way.
Catholic Bishops Conference General Secretary Rt. Rev. Dr. D. Valence Mendis said one could not safeguard ones rights at the expense of violating the rights of another.
Contradicting the opinion expressed by the Catholic Bishops, a former Human Rights Commissioner, Prathiba Mahanamahewa said a human being is endowed with rights from birth according to the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
"Hundreds of illegal abortions are taking place in the country," he said.
A study carried out in 2016 by Colombo University students and volunteers from other organizations and monitored by academics including Dr. Mahanamahewa has found that most number of cases of illegal abortions have been reported from Katunayake, Ja-ela, Jaffna, Ratnapura, Colombo and Rajagiriya.
All these abortions are performed on teenage mothers, some of whom are students. The well-to-do can go to Singapore and get the abortion done. What will happen to the poor people They will eventually be victims of illegal abortion resulting in trauma and mental agony and health risks, he said.
Dr. Mahanamahewa said Sri Lanka must approve the abortion law, but with conditions.
In cases of an impregnated rape victim, if she doesnt have protection, she can decide to terminate the pregnancy within three months of conception. In western countries, there are proper institutions to look after such victims. In Sri Lanka, we dont have any, he said.
The second condition he proposed was the abortion under medical circumstances of the mother such as abnormalities of the fetus and risk of having stillbirths and said even on these two grounds, abortion should take place ensuring the mother's privacy though Sri Lanka does not have privacy laws for such situations.

CV proposes caretaker Govt. if PCs dissolved
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has proposed a caretaker government for provincial governance in place of the clause, in the proposed 20th Amendment, which seeks to vest control of the provincial councils in Parliament.
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution also provides for the holding of elections to the nine Provincial Councils on a single day and until then the PCs whose terms of office had expired to be vested in Parliament.
The CM told Daily Mirror he was opposed to the clause which would allow the central government to take control of the provincial councils in the event they were dissolved until the date of elections.
He said such a move was against the concept of power devolution.
In such an eventuality, the central government can formulte laws detrimental to the interests of the PCs, particularly the Northern and Eastern Provincial Councils, the CM said.
The NPC will hold a special session on September 4 to discuss the Bill presented in Parliament. Meanwhile, the North-Central Provincial Council has approved the Bill while the Uva Provincial Council rejected it. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Investing in Govt. securities today riskier than Greece bonds
## Section: Breaking News

Investing in Govt. securities today riskier than Greece bonds
	
Former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said an investment today in the Sri Lankan Government Securities such as Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, Development Bonds, and International Sovereign Bonds pose a much higher credit risk than that faced by those who invested in Greece Bonds in April 2011.
He said this in response to allegations made against him with regard to the investment in the Greece Bonds.
Mr. Cabraal said, Several MPs and politicians have been regularly referring to the Greece Bonds investment by the Central Bank, insinuating that a massive fraud has been perpetrated by persons in authority at the Central Bank including myself. I have refuted these allegations on many occasions with detailed explanations, but these politicians and their followers have continued to make their baseless allegations, ignoring the explanations and contentions that clearly disprove their allegations.
"Therefore, I now wish to refer them directly to the Fundamental Rights Case No: 457/2012 in relation to the Greece Bonds investment which was filed against the Monetary Board in 2012 by Sujeewa Senasinghe, MP, and argued by Upul Jayasuriya, PC, at which the Attorney General appeared for the Monetary Board.
"In that FR action, after 17 hearings that spanned about 2 years, leave to proceed was refused by a 3-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justice K. Sripavan, (later Chief Justice), Justice R. Marasinghe and Justice S. De Abrew in September 2014 with the order that, Considering the totality of the circumstances, it is neither possible nor desirable to hold that the Members of the Monetary Board in taking a decision to invest in Greece Bonds, have acted arbitrarily, unreasonably and in a fraudulent manner. Refer SC Judgement of 18.09.2014 in the website of the Supreme Court at: http://www.supremecourt.lk/images/documents/scfr_application_457_2012.pdf
"In the light of such a clear and unambiguous decision of the Supreme Court, it is shocking to see some politicians and their followers attempting to maintain the canard that there has been a fraud in relation to the investment in the Greece bonds. In this connection, a few extracts from the Supreme Court decision may also be significant to understand the context.
The Auditor General has stated though the Central Bank had incurred a loss from the investment in Greece Government Bonds, it has earned a total net profit of US$ 430.2 million on International Reserve Management during the year 2011.
The investment in Greece Bonds and its trade forms part of the risk management strategy. If all investments are maintained as risk free investments the return would be negligible. The Central Bank therefore has to select a mix of low risk and risk bearing investments expecting a reasonably high return.
The decision to invest in such Bonds was based on the trade-off between different risks faced and the Central Banks tolerance for higher risk on a very small part of its portfolio
Investing in high yielding sovereign paper is an integral part of fund management of many funds in the world and the Central Bank too had followed a similar practice in investing a tolerable proportion of its resources (0.6%) in Greece Government Bonds.
"From the above Supreme Court decision, it would be patently clear that the accusations by the various politicians and their followers are only designed to tarnish my reputation and that of the senior officials of the Central Bank. Unfortunately, those efforts seem to have intensified in recent times because some of the current government politicians have been caught red-handed in scams which have caused losses amounting to hundreds of billions of rupees to our country.
"It is also relevant to reiterate that the Central Bank made its highest ever profit from International Reserve Management in the year 2011 amounting to US$430.2 million, even after setting off the loss arising from the investment in Greek Bonds. As a percentage, this profit represented a yield of 6.6% on the average International Reserve. In comparison, in the years 2015 and 2016, the profits from International Reserve Management has crashed to just US$111 million and US$53 million respectively, which represented return of a mere 1.5% and 1.1% on the average International Reserves in the respective years.
"Further, it is also to be noted that in April 2011, when the Central Bank invested in the Greece Bonds, the international credit rating of Greece was BB+ which was 3 notches higher than Sri Lankas current rating of B+ (negative)."

Recalling  a dark day during Mrs Bs political career
	

On a day like yesterday (August 25 in 1980), thirty seven years ago, a report was handed over to the Commission to strip former Premier Sirimavo Bandaranaike of her civil rights. It was a dark day for Sri Lanka largely because she was the first woman Prime Minister in the world. She was sworn in as Premier on 21st July 1960. 
There were ten charges against Bandaranaike. One of the charges pertained to the 1972 Lands Reform Commission. On 27 February 1980 under section 18 of the Special Presidential Commission, she was issued notice to appear before the Commission. Bandaranaike requested for time to appear before the Commission and this was allowed. The Commission decided to summon her on the 7th May 1980. 
Bandaranaike didnt appear alone. She was accompanied by her two daughters, Chandrika, Sunethra and some stalwarts of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party like Attorneys at Law H.L de Silva, E.D Wickramanayake, K.Shammugalingam, D.W. Kularatne and Gomin Dayasri. 
Appearing on behalf of the State were Deputy Solicitor General Sunil de Silva, Senior State Counsel C.M.N. Bogollagama and State Counsel R. Perera. 

There were ten charges against Bandaranaike. One of the charges pertained to the 1972 Lands Reform Commission
The present Bullet proof cubicle at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy was built as a result of negotiations between Bandaranaike and a high priest in Japan
Bandaranaike submitted to the Commission seeking permission to make a statement. This was allowed by the Commission. Her statement continued for around 45 minutes. Her first paragraph is reproduced here since it was a long statement.  I am here before this Commission, since I have been issued notice. This statement is to make my position clear. I am making this statement on behalf of the people of the country and not for the members of the Commission nor the Government were how the words in the first paragraph of the statement penned.
From the long statement she made, I quote two more paragraphs. This is because even the foreign media, at that time, hailed her for her courage. In the statement she also said,  With your permission, permit me to say that the constitution of the Commission was to debar me for seven years and strip me of my civil rights so that I would go into oblivion in my Political life. Why is the Government afraid of a normally constituted Court of Law Sentence me. But, they are finding other Courts to sentence me. Therefore the Government is looking for other legal methods. When the UNP is in power, they find ways and means to do whatever they think. This is political victimisation The other paragraph quoted here, which formed the conclusion of the statements, was worded as follows,  I have placed my facts and therefor I will not appear before the Commission from now. I am pleased that you had the patience to hear me and I respect you for that purpose. 
The Commission decided on charges four, six, seven, eight nine and ten using its powers. Thereafter the Commission decided that the former Prime Minister should be stripped of her
civil rights. 
There were 25 witnesses listed for the prosecution. 
This article hasnt been penned to probe in to the pros and cons of the issue or highlight any other political issue. But its purpose is to highlight the manner in which a straightforward female politician was treated. She was treated in the worst possible manner.
The present Bullet proof cubicle at the inner shrine room of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy was built as a result of negotiations between Bandaranaike and a high priest in Japan. The cubicle stood in good stead when LTTE rebels triggered a bomb blast at the temple in 1998. The installation came about during the time when Bandaranaike visited the shrine. This was the time when the Diyawadana Nilame was H.B.Udurawana. The Diyawadana Nilame, being a simple man, suggested that it would be good to have Bullet Proof Cubicle. This is possibly because the Diyawadana Nilame had the foresight that the Temple of Tooth might come under a attack in the future. The Premier was noncommittal and left the Maligawa. 
Around two months later, when this writer happened to visit the Diyawadana Nilame at his office, he showed a letter he had received from the Prime Ministers office. The letter mentioned that a bulletproof cubicle was to be presented to be installed at the inner shrine room of the Maligawa. That was how Prime Minister Bandaranaike worked in her noncommittal way, but with dedication and purpose. 
The first person who came forward when the news about the inquiry conducted by the Commission spread was the Mahanayake of the Asgiri Chapter Ven. Palipanne Chandananda along with artiste Vijaya Kumaratuga. This was the first and the last political discussion held inside the historic Asgiri Poyage. The then President J.R Jayewardene was called upon and requested not to proceed with the findings of the Commission. The former president was told of the repercussions the Government would have to face if they went ahead with their decision. But, that President Jayewardene never heeded the advice of the temple authorities.

The first person who came forward when the news about the inquiry conducted by the Commission spread was the Mahanayake of the Asgiri Chapter Ven. Palipanne Chandananda along with artiste Vijaya Kumaratuga
President Jayewardene gazetted the land given to the Asgiriya Temple which was taken over from the Department of Commerce. The land was used afterwards as a training Center for carpenters. 
The Mahanayake Thera toed the line of the UNP and was faithul to both D.S.Senanayake and Dudley Senanayake. But in this instance he said that he stood for what was right and in support of a woman who had done so much for the country. 
But Mahanayakes are of a complete different breed. They arent worried about what the people say. They stand for whats right. Sometimes they foresee the future, something which our politicians fail to do. Their role goes beyond being draped in a saffron cloured robe. They have shown dedication in educating the public with their Buddhist philosophies. The piece of land came under the custody of Ven. Chandrananda. Jayawardene had to eat his words. The land now houses the auditorium.
The president didnt realize that the Prince and Princess of Japan, at that time, were going to come to Kandy. It was one of the places the Royal couple would visit during its tour of Sri Lanka. They were also expected to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic. President Jayewardene didnt realize that the Sacred Tooth Relic was placed within the karanduwa (Casket) and that the keys to the casket were kept at the Asgiri Maha Viharaya. The president was in a quandary, having taken over the land offered to the Asgiriya Maha Viharaya. 

President Jayewardene didnt realize that the Sacred Tooth Relic was placed within the Casket and that the keys to it were kept at the Asgiri Maha Viharaya. 
To find solace, he turned to the Government Agent Damunupola - that affable man who was calm as a cucumber. So an assurance was given to President Jayawardene that the programme would continue and the Asgiriya Mahanayake would be present. It was clear that without the monk there would be no exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic when the Prince and Princess visited the Maligawa. 
The day arrived and everything went the way the President wished. Exiting from the Southern entrance of the Maligawa, the president told the Government Agent, Give back the land. I didnt expect what they have done for me.
But, the report of the Commission was handed over and the great stateswoman Bandaranaike was disenfranchised. That date went down in the annals of Sri Lankas political history as one of its darkest days. 

But Mahanayakes are of a complete different breed. They arent worried about what the people say. They stand for whats right. Sometimes they foresee the future
The reentry of Bandaranaike to politics was due to the efforts of Minister T.B.Illangaratne. However, there have been efforts in the past to give this credit to other politicians. Illangaratne threw his weight behind Bandaranaike at all times. She had always given an ear to Illangaratne. There could have been no nationalization programme of two conglomerate companies like Shell and Caltex  without Bandaranaike. Illangaratne had his own way, even in the midst his loosing everything. His children can look back and say, this was
my father.
Bandaranaike was a woman with human qualities. Very few people realized this trait while she was alive. The repercussions of the 1971 insurrection were a good example as to how many youth were saved. This was due to her rehabilitation programme. No doubt there were allegations of the exessive use of Police during her office. But the end result was Bandaranaiake offering a lifeline to the unguided youth.

SAITM: Prez to give final decision on Monday
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday said that President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to provide a final solution to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue on Monday.
Addressing the media at the Presidential Secretariat premises following a discussion with President Sirisena on the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that overall discussion was a success.
We have forwarded a request to the President to issue a gazette ordering the suspension of student admissions and the degree awarding at the SAITM. It is also necessary to gazette the minimum standards of medicine, he added.
He said that President Sirisena had also assured them to provide the governments stance on the SAITM through the Attorney General to the Supreme Court where a hearing was taking place with regard to this issue. He said that the Attorney General had agreed to abide with the President's decision on the matter.
He was of the view that this assurance given to them by the President was a great achievement of the anti-SAITM forces in the country, including the GMOA.
Meanwhile, he said it was significant that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, who was present during the discussion, had kept silent right throughout.
Earlier, we held several discussions with President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and they all turned out to be futile due to the interference of several forces. We hope that it would not happen this time, he added.
It was reported that representatives of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Higher Education Ministry, Health Ministry, University Grants Commission (UGC), deans of state universities and several teachers were also present at the discussion. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: Several conversations missing in PTLs phone recordings

Several conversations missing in PTLs phone recordings
	
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake yesterday said that several phone recordings were missing in the provided call details of PTL, which were possibly relating to the concluding part of dealers conversations between PTL and EPF regarding the first secondary market transaction after the controversial bond issue.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake yesterday commencing the Cross-examination of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena-after a one week of preparation-questioned about the first deal struck between PTL and the EPF in secondary market on June 5, 2015 through a broker.
In this deal, PTL had sold Rs.2 billion worth of 30-year bonds to the EPF in the secondary market.
During the questioning, DSG Gunathilake was of the view that even though the deal had taken place through a broker, PTL had negotiated the deal with EPF directly.
The witness admitted that he would have negotiated with the EPF at that time.
The DSG then questioned him as to why they went through broker.
The witness said the broker came into the deal to get the immediate confirmation of the deal between the two parties.
When Justice Jayawardena questioned, the witness admitted that a deal would be concluded once two parties (dealers) agreed upon it via phone conversations.
Justice Jayawardena: When PTL and the EPF agreed on a deal then the matter is over
Witness: Yes
J: Broker comes in to speed up the process
W: Yes
J: Merely by way of documentation
W: Yes
When Justice Jayawardena questioned, the witness said that the conclusion of the deal happened between two dealers of PTL and the EPF, and the broker was a mere formality for documentation and to get immediate confirmation.
DSG Gunathilake then played three voice recordings.
The conversations dealing with the secondary market transactions were between PTL dealer at that time Nuwan Salgadu and EPF dealer Udayaseelan and had taken place on June 5, 2015.
The witness also identified the voices and affirmed that none of them were relating to the conclusion of the deal.
DSG Gunathilake said that they were not able to identify phone conversations relating to the conclusion of the deal from among the phone recordings provided by PTL, which were recorded in their internal voice recording system.
It was explained earlier by the witness that the PTLs recording system only records the index number and date of the phone call which has a sequence of serial numbers.
DSG Gunathilake revealed to the Commission that there are five serial numbers relating to the possible conclusion of the deal that were missing. (SN- 6816-19, 6825)
DSG Gunathilake: Were those details tampered with by deleting
Witness: No, no need for that
DSG: Then why are those conversations relating to the conclusion of the deal could not be found in the given phone recordings And why are five serial numbers missing
Witness: That I have to check.
Justice Jayawardena: Are all calls are recorded with a serial number (sequence of numbers)
Witness: Yes
J: There cannot be missing numbers
W: Yes
J: You earlier said that you have given all call recordings to the commission, but this contradicts that
W: I need to check about it
J: Can you think as to why those are missing
W: No, I cant
Earlier, filing an affidavit, with the assistance of PTL IT expert, the witness informed the Commission that the phone recording system setup in PTL has no options to identify the incoming or outgoing numbers.
Contesting that stance of the PTL CEO Palisena, DSG Gunathilake yesterday played a voice recording related to a conversation between the PTL IT person and the CEO which had taken place on December 2, 2015.
Voice recording in Sinhala - Palisena: Sachith !.. (IT person) some outgoing numbers are not recorded.
The DSG was of the view that the testimony of the witness is questionable since he had referred as Some outgoing numbers to be checked by the IT person in December, 2015 and that would possibly reflect that PTL had caller numbers recorded in their system as outgoing and incoming.
The witness said that he had a dispute with a counter party at that time and thereby he asked to check about some serial numbers which were not recorded at that point of time.
It was revealed that subsequently, the IT person, Sachith Devathanthri had lodged a complaint with its service provider, Metropolitan in December 2015 on the instructions of CEO, Palisena.
DSG Gunathilake was of the view that the witness was not telling the truth about the recording system of PTL and his affidavit submitted earlier was also false. The witness however, denied that.
It was earlier said that the witness had only examined about the system on August 16, 2017 and thereafter informed the Commission that PTL has a phone recording system which has no options to record the caller number or the time durations of calls.
DSG Gunathilake: You checked about the system only on August 16, 2017
W: Yes, when I checked there was no such option.
DSG: But you were already concerned about the outgoing calls much before that time in 2015 December Would it be possible that your system had reflected the caller ID before you examined it in August 2017
W: That I need to check
DSG: You earlier had given an affidavit confirming that your system does not record the caller ID and now you are saying that you have to check So, are you saying that the system was not tampered with at any point of time
W: Yes
Subsequently, DSG Gunathilake was of the view that the investigation wants to get the backup data of the phone recording system of PTL and thereby, requested the Commission to issue an order on PTL to recover those data.
The DSG also sought an order to permit the Metropolitan engineer to extract the backup data from the system, if PTL was unable to recover the backup data.
Consequently, the Commission asked the relevant individuals to comply with the DSGs request.
Justice Jayawardena subsequently questioned the witness again on the issue and asked about the importance of having a recording system which records no phone numbers.
Justice Jaywardena observed that such a recording system is used with regard to the possible disputes that could arise in the dealing process, and therefore a system which does not record the caller ID serves little purpose of having such a recording system. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
