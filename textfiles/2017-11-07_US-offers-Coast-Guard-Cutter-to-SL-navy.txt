The US yesterday announced that it would offer a second US Coast Guard cutter to the Sri Lankan Navy, pending completion of Congressional notification, as a sign of strong bilateral ties and deepening US engagement in Sri Lanka. 

US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas A. Shannon announced this on Monday during a news briefing held at the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Colombo.

The Secretary Class High Endurance Cutter would allow Sri Lanka to more effectively police its coastline and Exclusive Economic Zone and to protect its sea lines of trade and communication, US said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Shannon said the US was also working with the Sri Lankan government to return US Peace Corps volunteers to Sri Lanka’s English classrooms. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
