His daring scares away top bureaucrats


	



 

There is a certain purohita who is said to be highly upset these days due to a problem that defies a solution. 

 


None of the secretaries appointed to his Ministry ever since his first secretary going on retirement had stayed put in this key post for more than a few days. A senior bureaucrat who succeeded the retired one had tendered his resignation shortly after assuming duties. Another mandarin from the provincial service appointed to fill the vacancy too had quit office a week after taking up the post.  So the purohita has made a desperate appeal to the authorities in the highest echelons to appoint a secretary who would stick to the post.


Some parties who had been wondering as to why the top white collar ones have come to shun a high post like this in public service like the plague think that they have found an answer to this riddle; their strong aversion to certain goings-on in the Ministry and fear of being hauled before courts at a future date if the Ministerial orders are carried out. 


No wonder no sensible white collar high-up would want to work under a purohita known to have the daring to resort to Wilpattu-type of activity, informed ones say.
