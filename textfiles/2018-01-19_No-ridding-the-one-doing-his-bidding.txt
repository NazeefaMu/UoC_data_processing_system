No ridding the one doing his bidding


	



 

This is a high post in higher education. Statutory provisions restrict the term of this post to a five-year period. 

 


By the way, the five-year term of the current holder of this high post is about to expire and the political authority above him is said to be planning to give him another five-year service extension, 
they say.


The political authority reportedly has good reasons to retain the incumbent for another term. This high post holder would generously dispense appointments to every Dick, Tom and Harry referred to him by the political authority with no questions asked about qualifications or any other requirement under the regulations. That is not all. He makes it a point to send the lion’s share of the commission collected on every contract awarded by the institution. 


This highly unpopular white collar bigwig is said to be facing five court cases, two of which relate to human rights violations.


Despite strong protests from several quarters, the political authority is set to give the man another five-year service extension effective from February 5, they say.
