Indian Railways will supply modern locomotives and train sets worth Rs.6.8 billion to Sri Lanka, in what could be described as the largest export order for the public transport sector, the PTI reported today.

Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES), a railways PSU, has secured its largest export order from Sri Lanka Railways for the supply of 10 broad gauge diesel locomotives and six DMU (diesel multiple units) train sets.

DMU train sets do not require separate engines because they are incorporated into one or more of its coaches.

A senior Railway Ministry official said all locomotives and train sets would be equipped with the state-of-the-art technology and manufactured in Varanasi and Chennai.

He said the contract would be funded under the Indian Line of Credit to Sri Lanka announced in 2011 and supplies would be made over the next two years.

RITES, which also serves as the export arm of the railways, is at present executing a contract for the supply of 18 locomotives to Myanmar Railways.

It had earlier exported 20 DMU train sets, three locomotives to Sri Lanka, besides providing expertise for setting up railway maintenance facilities and training of the island nation's railway officials during 2008 to 2012.

Supplies of locomotives from Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) in Varanasi will be completed in 2017-18.

RITES has also actively pursued the export of locomotives and passenger coaches to the Bangladesh Railway.

It has been the endeavour of RITES to facilitate rail infrastructure development in the South Asian countries, particularly in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.
