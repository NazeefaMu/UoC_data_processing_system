‘T-shirt’ envoy gets a dressing-down


	



 

Sri Lankan envoy serving in a predominantly Muslim country located close to Europe came back here recently accompanying the Foreign Minister of the host country.

 


As preplanned the visiting Foreign Minister held official talks with both the Head and the Second in Command of yahapalanaya and at these talks visiting dignitary discussed the nature of development aid his country could extend to ours. 


Incidentally, this envoy hailing from a remote village in the Eastern province had previously served in the same capacity in several other countries as well and had later been confined to the ‘pool’. 
The envoy sought an appointment to meet the Big Boss before returning to his post and he was readily granted an audience with the latter one evening.


And the envoy appeared before the new Big Boss at the appointed time dressed in a T-shirt. The Big Boss who naturally felt both affronted and awkward to find the envoy making an official call dressed in casuals later asked the Second-in-Command of Yahapalanaya to give this worthy a good lesson on savoir faire – dress code in particular. 


The Second-in-Command later sent for the ‘T-shirt envoy’ and gave him a dressing-down for his callous disregard for professional etiquette, they say.
