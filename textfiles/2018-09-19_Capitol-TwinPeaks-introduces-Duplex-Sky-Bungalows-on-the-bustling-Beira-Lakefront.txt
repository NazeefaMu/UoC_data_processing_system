The shift from landed housing to apartment living is a growing trend in Colombo; 24hr security, convenience of amenities, managed maintenance and elite community, adds to the allure of it all. The City’s unrealized potential for livability is being addressed with a steady supply of luxury apartments, and with Port City’s impending rise, Colombo will undoubtedly transform to a cosmopolitan ‘big city’, joining the ranks of richer nations in the region. The Beira Lakefront especially is fast becoming a sought after location for city-living with lifestyle conveniences in the immediate surrounding. Capitol TwinPeaks, as the purely residential project on the Lakefront, is introducing two-storey Duplex units or ‘Sky Bungalows’ that stack two apartments together to create magnificent double height units. The spectacular vistas of the surrounding Ocean and Lake are heightened and can truly be enjoyed in these purpose-built units. This, as well as the ability to customize standard units, rather than accept cookie-cutter models, has increased the popularity of the project for the easy transition from traditional housing to sky living. 

Capitol Developers as a member of the Sanken Group, is in a unique position to extend this custom design opportunity with synergy as Contractor/Developer. Sanken is the trusted name in construction for timely delivery and responsible for a vast majority of the Colombo skyline. The renowned P&T Group of Singapore as architects has designed a contemporary classic for TwinPeaks, incorporating 75% glass to its sparkling façade. Capitol TwinPeaks has thus, got ‘good bones’, evident with sales surpassing fifty percent of the 435 units on offer. The project is also well ahead of schedule in construction at level 17 of 50; building at a rate of one floor per week. Ready for occupation in December 2020 is the Group’s promise and judging by their track record, a promise likely delivered.

Capitol TwinPeaks, along with Colombo City, is rising fast, and investors are encouraged to book before 1 December 2018 to avail themselves of Sky Bungalows and custom units at 24 Staple Street, Colombo 2. A visit to the model apartment at 18 Lillie St, Colombo 2 will have you talking with the sales and engineering teams of Sanken Group, to design and build your own piece of sky in the heart of new Colombo City. Lines are open 24/7 on 077 869 3787.
