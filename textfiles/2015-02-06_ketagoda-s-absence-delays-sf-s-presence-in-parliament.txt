Though Democratic Party leader Sarath Fonseka was to be sworn in as a Member of Parliament today, he couldn't do so as MP Jayantha Ketagoda was yet to resign.
Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya had sought the instructions of the Attorney General on the matter and the AG had informed that Mr. Fonseka could be appointed as a member of parliament as his civic rights were restored and cleared of allegations.
However, they informed the Commissioner that MP Ketagoda has to resign if Mr. Fonseka is to be sworn in.
Mr. Deshapriya had therefore informed MP Ketagoda in a letter that the latter should resign to make way for Mr. Fonseka in parliament. (SD)
