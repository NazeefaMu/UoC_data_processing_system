Seven of the nine accused in Sivaloganathan Vidya’s abduction, rape and murder, were sentenced to death by a three-judge bench of Jaffna High Court a short while ago.

Jaffna High Court Judge M. Elancheliyan while sentencing them said the first and the seventh accused should be released because of the lack of evidence against them.

The seven men found guilty were also sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment and ordered to pay Rs.1 million as compensation to Vidya’s family and in the event they failed to pay, the Jaffna High Court said their term of imprisonment should be extended.
