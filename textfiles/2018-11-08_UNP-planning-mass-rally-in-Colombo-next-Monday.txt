The UNP is planning a mass rally in Colombo on November 12 against the prorogation of Parliament and urging the upholding of democracy in the country, party General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.

Mr. Kariyawasam who was speaking to the media amidst the vehicle parade to Parliament organized by his party last evening said this would be a part of his party’s continuous struggle against the sacking of the Prime Minister and forming a new cabinet.

“The country has come to a standstill. No investor makes any decision. We will fight continuously. We will hold street protests. We will have a rally in Colombo on November 12,” Mr. Kariyawasam said.(Yohan Perera)
