SF devoid of STF security


	

Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka is reported to have been denied security by the Special Task Force (STF) triggering concerns whether it was linked to his criticism of the elite police force in Parliament last Friday.

He had launched a scathing attack on the STF last Friday and claimed that the STF was harassing his supporters over baseless charges.

Sources close to the minister said, the STF had not deployed its personnel assigned for his security both on Friday and Monday resulting in the minister complaining to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya about this citing it as a breach of his parliamentary privileges.

When asked about this turn of events, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said he had directed Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara to investigate this matter. (Kelum Bandara)
