Usain Bolt wins gold in 200m final


	

The Jamaican won gold in the men’s 200m final, beating his rivals with a time of 19.78 seconds.

It’s his third Olympic gold medal in the event, further reinforcing his status as one of the greatest athletes we’ve ever seen.

It’s also his second gold of the Rio Games to go with his victory in the 100m earlier in the week.

Canada’s Andre de Grasse was second, France’s Christophe Lemaitre won bronze.

Despite his incredible feat, Bolt looked less than impressed after he crossed the line well ahead of his rivals.

That was probably because he wasn’t able to break his own world record of 19.19 seconds — a mark he was hoping to reset here in Brazil.

His anger at not being able to achieve that goal was laid squarely at the feet of his rivals, according to ESPN’s Anthony Becht.

He’s the ultimate showman who’s never been shy of speaking his mind. Bolt had a crack at de Grasse for pushing him too hard in the 200m semi-final, and now he’s taken aim at his fellow runners again.

Ironically, by his logic, the very reason he was upset with de Grasse on Thursday (AEST) was the very thing he desperately craved in the final.

Speaking to Channel 7’s Pat Welsh after the race, Bolt admitted his race was tinged with sadness, knowing it was the last time he’d ever run the event at an Olympics, but was still proud of what he’d accomplished.

“I have proven to the world over and over again that I am the greatest. That is all I can do,” he said.

“I really wanted to race faster, but I came out here to win and that’s the first thing. I’m happy about that.

“Just coming back form injury and staying focused, I think that’s been the hardest part and I’ve got it done so I’m proud of that.

“I keep telling these young ones, ‘I’ll never let you guys beat me, it’s never going to happen.’

“I’m getting older, I’m slowing down, that’s why I need to get out of the sport.”

The 29-year-old is hoping to pull off the “triple triple”. He won individual gold in the 100m and 200m in Beijing and London, and was a member of Jamaica’s victorious 4x100m relay team at both those Olympics, giving him six golds from two Games.

Gold in the 200m in Rio has kept that dream alive, and with the relay to come on the weekend, we could be bowing down to him yet again before the Games are over. (news.com.au)
