A recurring craze for importing coconuts


	


A certain purohita has presented a proposal to the highest decision- making body to import coconuts to meet the prevailing short supply in the local market.
This proposal came under fire particularly from a certain Diyawanna member from the Kurunegala district at the Green party’s workshop held in Bentota recently. 
By the way, this purohita had wooed approval for coconut imports without avail even in 2005. He is dead set on getting the green signal this time round despite the protests from a section of Green party Diyawanna members, they say.
