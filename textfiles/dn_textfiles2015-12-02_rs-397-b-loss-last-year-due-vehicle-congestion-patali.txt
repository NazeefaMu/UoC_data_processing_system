Rs. 397 b loss last year due to vehicle congestion - Patali

The country incurred a Rs. 397 billion loss last year on account of the massive vehicle congestion in Colombo and its suburbs. Due to this congestion, the vehicle speed in the city had dropped from 20 kmph to 12 kmph, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. "A Megapolis Development Authority will be set up by an Act of Parliament in January next year for the development of the Western Province and major cities in the country. This will be in addition to the Western Megapolis Authority set up to develop the Western Province," the minister said.
Ranawaka was addressing a seminar at the SLFI, Colombo on Monday to obtain public ideas and views on the proposed Western Province and megapolis development projects to be undertaken by his ministry.
The minister said the powers and the duties of the Urban Development Authority would be vested in the Western Megapolis Development Authority in addition to some additional powers to enable it to carry out its duties efficiently and systematically.
Ranawaka said megapolis and other massive development projects would be completed by 2030 in three stages.
"When one considered the Western Province, it had more than 100,000 slum dwellers. The Megapolis Development Project would find a solution to the slum problem by taking public views into consideration," he said.
The minister said the megapolis development plan formulated with local and foreign expertise would be changed every five years in keeping with changing times and needs.
He said speedy urbanisation has caused traffic congestion and a garbage problem, developing into a major economic problem.
"Three decades ago, only 132,000 vehicles entered the Colombo City daily but it had increased to nearly 500,000 today.
Of them, only 15 percent accounted for public transport while the other 85 percent included motorcycles, three wheelers, cars and vans," the minister said.
He said the new national identity card to be issued shortly would have technical features enabling it to be used as a credit card, passport or a bus fare payment card.
