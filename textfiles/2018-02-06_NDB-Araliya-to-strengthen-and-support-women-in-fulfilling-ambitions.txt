NDB believes that women are the real architects of society, often carrying a load far greater than possible- whether they’re mothers, sisters, or wives, and therefore NDB has designed ‘Araliya’, a savings account which will support women in fulfilling their ambitions.


The NDB Araliya Savings Account will act as a pillar of strength by providing far more than a great platform to save. NDB Araliya will also provide life insurance and medical insurance not just for the account holder but also for her immediate family members.


NDB, as a bank that holds three decades of excellence and experience in financially empowering Sri Lanka continues to take longer strides to reach out and strengthen Sri Lankan Women. With Araliya, NDB will be supporting ‘Ara-liya’ (her) in all walks of life, be it her 21st birthday or the birth of her first child. In addition to the welcome gift for initial deposits of over Rs.10,000, a gift voucher will be given to the account holder on her 21st birthday.


Araliya Savings Account will also provide free life insurance cover of up to one million Rupees and free hospitalisation cover for family members and the account holder. Furthermore, periodic medical checkups will be provided free of charge to the account holder, 
through Araliya.


NDB has made continuous efforts to empower women through various initiatives significantly through SME and Micro Finance. As a bank, NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow in their life.
