UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena in a petition filed in the Colombo High Court today sought bail over the Fort Magistrate’s refusal to do so.
On an earlier occasion, Colombo Fort Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage turned down Mr. Gunawardena’s bail application based on medical grounds and ordered that he be remanded till June 15 on charges of misusing vehicles belonging to the Presidential Secretariat.
The bail application is to be taken up in the High Court on Thursday (11). (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
