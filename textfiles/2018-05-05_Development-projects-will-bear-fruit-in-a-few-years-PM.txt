People will reap the benefits of development in a few years time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

He said this at the opening of the newly built auditorium at the Milleniya Divisional Secretariat.

“Many are asking what this government had done during the past three years. One will begin to feel and reap the benefits of the development work carried out by this government only in few years time,” the Prime Minister said. “One will be able to see imagined opportunities with the industrial and tourism zones being set up now. You will be able to put up hostels, shops and even one could lend his or her garden space to keep large containers and earn money. If you allow two containers in your garden that will help you to earn a considerable amount of money,” the Premier said.

He said the work on the Milleniya Industrial Zone will begin in June this year. He said the final agreement with the Thai company which is going to manage the zone would be signed shortly. “The Hambantota Industrial zone is also ready to take off and so is the tourism zone in Deduwa and Iranawila," the Premier said.

He said divisional secretariat offices have a major role to play when it came to development of villages. “If the divisional secretariat becomes inefficient all development work will come to a standstill,” the Premier said and recalled that the industrial zone project in Biyagama became a success story because of the divisional secretariat carried out its work effectively and efficiently.
