Delight and wisdom in creativity

As most literary critics over the years have pointed out, novel in the field of creative writing is unquestionably the dominant literary form, both in quality and quantity. In quantity, its only rival is the magazine and newspaper short story.
Millions of people who would not think of reacting any other form of literature regularly read a considerable quantity of poetry and creative columns of human interest. In this aspect, the short story writing has been at times overshadowed by human interest column writings. I found a series of Sinhala human interest columns titled as 'Husma Ganna Akuru' (Breathing Letters) written by a young journalist Ranjith Kumara Samarakone.
He has been contributing these columns over the years to a midweek newspaper with the intention of creating a new series of insights on social matters. They are resourceful and stimulating transcending the mere borders of common investigative reporting. They touch sensitive experiences of human existence.
Local conditions
The basic significant factor about these 32 columns is that they tend to blend global events with these of the local conditions. The columnist Samarakone bridges his situations drawn from the profiles of great writers, scientists, statesmen, explorers and poets.
He tries to capture subtle nuances in the life of mothers, fathers and teachers paving way to seek certain hidden dimensions. For instance, he sees the hardships encountered by fathers and mothers in bringing up children in various walks of life.
A father who engages in selling ice cream is seen near the gate of a big school where the children who pass time seeing him, had not forgotten even when they reach the apex in their respective professions like being doctors and lawyers.
Similarly there rare occasions when the teachers who have dedicated their lives to the profession shave been observed as never changing persons even if the entire surrounding has changed grossly. He sensitively juxtaposes situations as found in the narratives of such writers as Paulo Coelho and Marquez into local situations. This enables the reader to feel a human experience transcending the narrow barriers of narrations to wiser plane of vision. While being an observer to local events he gradually ascends to other global areas of wisdom quoting such persons as Mao Tse Tung and Abraham Lincoln.
Courage and inspiration
Then he shifts his attention to the abilities of the disabled. He captures a moment of experience of a skillful artist who makes a Vesak lantern with one hand as the other one is amputated. All in all there are human events that surpass the borders of mere success stories, entering the realms of courage and inspiration. The hallmark of these sensitive and creative columns is the brevity and the belles lettre expression employed.
A wider spectrum of reading material has gone into the columns. They cover countries such as India, China, US, Africa, Australia, Russia and Japan. He inserts poems both metrical, free verse and Haiku. He draws human experiences from such places as hospitals, universities, newspaper offices, cinema halls, byways, alleys and travels. The wit and humour too play a vital role in his expressions enabling even a dull moment to look a bright. The title is symbolic and metaphorical.
Creative situations dialogues and short narratives too play significant techniques in the expression of human experiences. Perhaps these columns touch the new areas in short story writing in new garb. I was reminded of the series of creative columns of Paulo Coelho in Like the Flowing River.
The writer is gifted with amalgamation of events from the past into the present context and the reverse order.
The writer Samarakone says that being a user of social media, out of which he transfers his abilities and shares them with the fellow like minded pals, he has gained quite a lot of experiences.
As such on the day the discourse on the book held at the Sri Lanka Press Council, quite a number of them participated and aired their views.
This enables Samarakone to widen his visionary horizons and the sensitivity of expression.
The collection of these columns looks more like an investigative encyclopedic notebook, than a mere compilation of a series of articles.
