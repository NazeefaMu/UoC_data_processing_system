Bus conductor’s monkey tricks


	

A private bus conductor operating on the Matara-Colombo route has found a new technique to squeeze himself through the passengers in the jam-packed bus between the front and rear exits.

This was observed recently when the conductor was clinging on to the overhead poles of the bus and jumping over the passenger seats in a typical monkey-style show, causing much inconvenience to the passengers.

It is reported that this conductor was manhandled by some passengers when he tried this tactic sometime ago.
