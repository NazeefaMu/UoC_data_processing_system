Carlo rejects GMOA requests


	

Turning down requests by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to be reappointed as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Prof. Carlo Fonseka cited his medical condition as the reason to do so.

Referring to the GMOA strikes, Prof. Fonseka said he would not approve of strikes which demanded the extension of his term as the SLMC Chairman.

“Please do not resort to a strike because of me,” he said to GMOA executive committee members who met him at his residence this morning.

However, Prof. Fonseka pledged to support the GMOA even though he would not be actively engaged in the SLMC office.

Meanwhile, Prof. Fonseka stressed that the standard of medical education should not be diluted at any cost and said that the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) should be immediately abolished if it cannot adopt the necessary standards. (By Thilanka Kanakarathna)
