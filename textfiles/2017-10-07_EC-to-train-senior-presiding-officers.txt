The Elections Commission has taken steps to train 15,000 Senior Presiding Officers and Assistant Election Commissioners in view of the upcoming local government elections.

However, EC sources said there was the possibility to delay elections to local authorities by delaying the enactment of needed legislation to hold elections and that there was little or nothing the EC could do in such an eventuality. (Kelum Banadara)
