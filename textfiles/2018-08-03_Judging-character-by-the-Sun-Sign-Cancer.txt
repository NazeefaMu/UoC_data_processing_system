Cancer people appear to be docile, but they are firm in their convictions. They are very emotional and sensitive, but often maintain a placid exterior. 


Cancer is the 4th sign in the Zodiac governing the home and the domestic environment.  Cancer subjects are attached to their homes and their native environment.  They usually maintain a good rapport with their neighbors and the local community. 


They have a great desire to go places and explore new frontiers despite their attachment to home. 
Those born during the Cancer Solar month are moody and melancholy.  They are endowed with the gift of intuition and clairvoyance.  They often get a premonition of what is going to happen. 


Cancer rules the stomach and Cancer subjects take a keen interest in cuisine and good foods. 
Cancer people often suffer from emotional stress and strain. They are prone to diseases of the chest and the stomach.  They are subject to bouts of melancholia and mental depression. 


Cancer people make good skilled workers as well as eminent academics.  They are good teachers and writers as well.      


Cancer people are normally not wealthy. They are not successful gamblers and speculators either. 
A landmark event would mark their career at the age of 35.  They would fall victim to intrigues and machinations by rivals and enemies at the ages of 20, 32, and 40.


Those born in the Cancer Solar sign are advised to marry subjects of the same sign and those of Scorpio or Pisces.
