The British government on Sunday said it plans to extend licensed pub opening hours by two hours over the weekend of May 19, the day Prince Harry marries his American fiancee Meghan Markle.
“The royal wedding is a time of national celebration in which everyone should be able to participate,” the Home Office said.


Pubs and other licensed premises will be allowed to serve alcohol for an extra two hours after 11 pm (2200 GMT) on May 18-19.


The English Football Association cup final also takes place on May 19, with many people expected to watch the match in pubs.


Prince William, Prince Harry’s older brother and widely expected to be his best man, is the president of the FA and would normally present the trophy. Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, announced plans last week to invite hundreds of members of the public to view their wedding at Windsor Castle from inside the royal residence. The couple “want their wedding day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too,” Kensington Palace said.
