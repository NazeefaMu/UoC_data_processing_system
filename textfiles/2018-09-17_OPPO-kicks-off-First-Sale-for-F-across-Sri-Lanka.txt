5 lucky customers who purchased OPPO F9 at the first sale were rewarded with special gifts and got the opportunity to pose for a series of selfies with their favourite stars.

On this First Sale Mr. Bob Li, CEO, OPPO Sri Lanka said, “The initial response from the Sri Lankan market is overwhelming. The fact that OPPO F9 offers best-of-both-worlds, the technological superiority with VOOC flash charging and aesthetic beauty of the design are being embraced by a cross-section of Sri Lankans, especially the youth who leads a fast and vibrant lifestyle.”



With several breakthroughs such as industry’s first 6.3 inch ‘Waterdrop Screen’ design, high screen to body ratio of 90.8%, unique gradient color design and a 3500 mAh battery, the OPPO F9 offers much more in addition to an excellent selfie function – an immersive experience, fast charging and long-lasting battery. OPPO F9 is powered by Media Tek Helio P60, the SoC platform featuring AI technology that offers flagship features to consumers without a premium price tag.

OPPO F9 comes with VOOC Flash Charge that has a charging speed which is up to four times faster than general charging at 5V/1A.

And if you’re in a hurry, a quick 5-minute is enough to maintain 2 hours of talk time. To meet the growing and trending demands of the young consumers, OPPO offers two gradient color combinations - Sunrise Red and Twilight Blue. The Gradient Spraying Technology and “Frame Gradient” tech used by OPPO realizes a perfect combination of gradient design on the back and the user a more unified viewing experience. 

Besides the gradient color design, the F9 screen is also beautiful and appealing. OPPO has always believed that a smartphone is not just a tool for communication but also a piece of art. The screen occupies almost all of F9 front except for a small droplet at the top due to which it’s called the “Waterdrop Screen”, inspired by a water drop. The F9 comes with an impressive 6.3-inch bezel-less screen that features a resolution of 1080*2340 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9, a super-high screen-to-body ratio of 90.8%. 

For the first time, OPPO F series is equipped with dual rear cameras (16MP + 2MP). The main camera for F9 at the rear is a 16MP plus f/1.8 aperture lens. This, plus the secondary camera, will calculate the depth-of-field to achieve better Bokeh effect for rear photography.



OPPO F9 25MP front-facing camera can accurately collect 296 feature points for each subject, referencing them against its massive database of facial images, analysing features before making enhancements, customized for each subject. The AI Beauty Technology 2.1 can provide users with up to 8 million different personalized beautification effects – now selfies are more attractive while keeping the natural look of each human subject intact. 

Based on Android 8.1, OPPO brings the Color OS 5.2 Operating System to create a smarter interactive experience for users. When it comes to hardware, the 4GB/6GB + 64GB memory combination improves the speed of operation. F9 also supports 256GB memory expansion.
