Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa and Deputy Minister M L A M Hisbullah confronted each other in Parliament yesterday over the subject of religious reconciliation.

The arguments flared up when Deputy Minister Hisbullah charged that a dialogue of Muslim, Buddhist and other religious leaders initiated by the government on Tuesday had been a failure as one monk had threatened the Muslims.

Minister Rajapaksa who responded said Mr Hisbullah and other Muslim leaders who were allies of the previous regime were silent during the Aluthgama incident. “It was myself and MPs such as Lakshman Kiriella who spoke on behalf of Muslims during the Aluthgama drama while you people were silent. Religious extremist groups were formed by the government in which you were an ally" Mr Rajapaksa said.

“You people work for your own benefits and not for the benefit of the country" the minister added stressing that reconciliation cannot be achieved overnight. (Yohan Perera)
