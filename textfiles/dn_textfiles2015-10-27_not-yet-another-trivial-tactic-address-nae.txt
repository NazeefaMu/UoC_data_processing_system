Not yet another trivial tactic: Address Nae

For a Sinhala film to be successful within this country it has to simply attract many filmgoers. Also it has to be made with a moderate budget. In a country that is smaller than a single state in India one cannot expect handsome revenue by making an epic film for Sri Lankan audiences.
There exist three kinds of filmmakers in this country. First is the breed of local filmmakers who feel the pulsation of natives and make films to a very local audience. While majority of them cater to masses some stick to making mainstream films that attract a special segment of viewers.
The third kind of local filmmakers who make art house movies do films to stand out in international film festivals more than for local audiences. However it is very unbecoming to see them wasting their talents on projecting sex let alone discrimination to minorities in their movies. An art house movie maker does not have to confine to these types of trivial tactics.
Benchmarking with the plots of French films that has sex in abundance is not an excuse. They could instead benchmark with various styles of movie making in the art house genre. Indian, Japanese let alone some Sinhala movies lined up to be shown at the international film fest in Colombo this year (IFFC2015) will be an eye opener for local art house filmmakers.
The art of catering to a very local market
Jackson Anthony is a director who makes films for a local audience. He made Juliet ge Bhoomikawa and Aba before his latest creation Address Nae. We can easily read his movie making temperament if we carefully read the three films of his. When Jackson made Juliet ge Bhoomikawa decades back critics tried to brand him as an art house movie maker.
When he came back decades after with Aba he was labeled as a filmmaker who harps on Patriotism. Now he has made a totally different one to the first two. How are we going to label him now?
We have to accept the fact Jackson set a trend in the local cinema by making Aba. Since of making Aba up to this date local filmmakers are unable to break the barrier of making historic films. Many filmmakers did not identify the lucrative market for such films which has been there like an iceberg until Jackson made Aba. Eventually a gamut of films in this genere was made and many more are in the pipeline. Jackson must have read Matalan and Sandeshaya once again on his quest towards Aba project. He has been smart enough to foresee the magic and ability of this genre of films to contribute towards pumping Oxygen to a dying local film industry.
With Address Nae Jackson has brought to fore the magic that was in 70s decade films making us to identify him as a trend setter.
One would recall how filmgoers of the 70s decade enjoyed films that were rich with songs, comedy and action. An actor like Gamini Fonseka or Alexander Fernando could keep the viewers at the edge of their seats with their action sequences while Freddie Silva and Don Sirisena induced humour to these films. Vijeya Kumaratunga catered to lovers.
Address Nae too has all these ingredients. Action sequences of Jackson Anthony and Roshan Ravindra in the film is nothing second to what Gamini and Alexander did. Jackson as the director doesn't use cables and special effects to project fighters as superheroes and sticks to basics. That also is significant.
Jackson also gets Mahendra de Silva to portrait the greatest comedian of all times Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin himself portrayed Adolf Hitler in his silent movie The Great Dictator. Jackson writes the script opening doors for Mahendra to follow suit and in the process brings out the greatest performance by this world class actor.
The plot in Address Nae revolves around shanty dwellers. These people engage in all sorts of unlawful acts to make a living. Acting like beggars and fortune tellers and indulging in prostitution is part and parcel in the lifestyle of these people.
Music scores harmonizes with the story well. The Reggae style theme song is very appropriate for the film and blends with the storyline perfectly. Jackson uses Rohana Weerasinghe to compose the exact music that he needed for the film. Prof Sunil Ariyaratne did the same with Victor Ratnayake in Anupama and Sarungalae. A film is not an Opera and the film director should educate the music director of his limitations in the project. Jackson has done it well.
There are also major drawbacks in the film. Casting is poor and some artistes fail to project a credible performance. Some dialogues are directly taken from old films. One prostitute talks ill of a client who has been acting like an animal the previous day. We have heard the same dialogue in Soldaadu Unnahae from Malini Fonseka's voice decades back. The storyline has no focus thus the whole movie resorts to mere incidents. Hence we could only talk of direction and performances by the artistes. The blame again has to be put on the script.
Jackson directs Roshan Ravindra marvelously to bring out his acting prowess. Roshan Ravindra is geared with all capabilities to become an actor to reckon with.
His voice is a major strength that adds credibility to his acting. Thus filmmakers should make use of this actor.
Kamal Addaraarachchi does justice to his character. However the poor script does not allow him to add more credibility to the character. Thus he too becomes a mere performer. Jackson Anthony himself as Nasiwatte Hitler brings out a commendable performance.
All-in-all Address Nae is an original Sri Lankan film and no Indian actors are imitated by any of the artistes.
The script though poor too is original. Thus Address Nae becomes a very local film with the power to make revenue and set a new trend in local cinema.
