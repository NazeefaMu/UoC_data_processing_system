Is he playing a double game?


	

A surprise was in store for those who thought that tensions would run high at the meeting between the Big Boss and the JO group held on the eve of the Paadayathra. The event expected to generate much heat turned out to be ‘a tame affair’, they say. 



A prominent member of the JO group who was the livewire behind this ‘goodwill meeting’, had paid several secret visits to the palace in connection with organizing the event. Some believe that this JO big name who launched his political career from Nilwala environs is working on an agenda of his own aimed at earning brownie points from the powers that be while remaining in the good books of the JO stalwarts.
