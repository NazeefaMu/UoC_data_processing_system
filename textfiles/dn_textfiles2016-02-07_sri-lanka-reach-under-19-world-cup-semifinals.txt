Sri Lanka reach Under-19 World Cup semifinals

The Sri Lankan Under-19 Team has made sure all the South Asian teams are on course to reach the semifinals as they have beaten the England team by 6 wickets in the Semifinals as Avishka Fernando scored 95 runs and helped his side set up a semifinals clash with India.
 
The Sri Lankan side had finished second in their group after losing to Pakistan but they made sure that they recovered from the loss even after losing the toss. The Sri Lankan captain said that they wanted to bat first but English captain asked them to bowl.
 
Even that went in their favour as both English openers lost their wickets in first 7 overs for score of 18. Callum Taylor batted steadily and scored 42 runs off 57 balls as he made sure that his side came back after the early loss. But they were unable to get partnerships.
 
The Sri Lankan bowlers kept taking wickets in regular intervals and did not let English batsmen have a partnership of 50 runs in whole innings. Wanidu Hasaranga took 3 whereas Asitha Fernando took 2 wickets as English side were bowled out for 184 in 49.2 overs. 
 
The Sri Lankan opener Avishka Fernando was very aggressive as he scored most of the runs in his 76 runs partnership with Kaveen Bandara. The latter got out but Fernando kept going and missed the century by just 5 runs. Sri Lanka were easily able to chase the total with 6 wickets in hand and 86 balls to spare. (cricketnewsworld)
