A picnic that went a begging!
	
This department in an august assembly is responsible for bringing out in print every audible word uttered during the sessions of the assembly.
The high-up heading the administration of this assembly had recently provided a bus for free for the employees of the aforesaid department to go on a picnic.
However, all employees had rejected the free bus ride just to spite the boss they disliked.
Informed there were no takers for the free offer, an affronted high-up had told his aides: If there is at least one person willing to go on the picnic, take in some village people as well and proceed on the trip. It does not matter even if you dont proceed on the picnic in which case, you may park the bus in the village till about 6 in the evening before you bring it back here!

A racket in refuse tea in central hills!
	
It is illegal for anyone to store, transport or export refuse tea. However, complaints being received from foreign trade sources that some of our tea shipments have been found adulterated with refuse tea are galore.

By the way, a racket of procuring and storing refuse tea for exports is reportedly being operated with the connivance of two big cops in an area known for Davul stones in the Central province.
Teams sent by higher authorities several times to raid the dens had failed to nab the culprits as the patron cops had forewarned the latter every time a raid was to be made, they say.

COPE Chairman and Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti said that as there is a reasonable doubt that the government was attempting to protect the persons involved in the Central Bank Bond issue, the country was looking what further action would be taken with regard to the COPE report into the bond issue.
Addressing a media conference, MP Handunnetti also said the main priority in the new year should be a parliament debate on the COPE report.
Stressing on the importance of taking the COPE report on the Bond issue for debate in Parliament, he also said that as the report belonged to Parliament itself, it should be taken for debate as the first task next year. (Indika Hewawitharana)

Carol mix-up: Organizers apologize for error in hymn sheets
	
Those responsible for the error in the carol service hymnal have apologized to Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and the Catholic Church, a spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese said today.
We consider the matter closed on the basis that those responsible for the error have apologized," Archdiocesan spokesperson Fr. Edmund Tillekaratne said today.
The organizers had mistakenly printed the lyrics of gangster rapper Tupac's hit song, 'Hail Mary' on thousands of its hymn sheets.
The unfortunate mix-up took place at the Catholic 2016 Joy to the World Festival held at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo. The festival was organized by the Archdiocese of Colombo and the Joseph Vaz Trust.
Fr Tillekaratne told Daily Mirror the matter was not really an issue because the hymn books were withdrawn. One or two books must have got into the hands a few who must have leaked it to social media websites, Fr. Tillekaratne said.
Meanwhile, a priest told CNN that no sooner organizers realized their mistake they had asked for the books back.
He said the printer had been a young boy who had simply downloaded the wrong version of the song.
We are very sorry about what happened, the priest said. The page was in the middle of the booklet. Two people who had noticed it and alerted us.
Instead of the traditional Catholic prayer, 'Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus'; the hymn sheets had the line, 'I ain't a killer but don't push me, revenge is like the sweetest joy, Next to gettin' p***y.' (Yohan Perera)

CDB excels at National Business Excellence Awards
	

At the recently concluded National Business Excellence Awards organised by the National Chamber of Commerce, CDB was lauded with a Gold award in the non-banking financial services sector, while also showcasing its uncompromising stance on conformance to governance tenets with an overall merit award in excellence for corporate governance. Competing in the extra large category which places CDB among industry giants, these two awards both signify that the Company has affirmed its status as an undisputed leader in the countrys NBFI sector.
Undoubtedly improving on its silver award won last year in the NBFI sector, Managing Director/CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara opines that in the 21 years of its existence, CDB has built a solid foundation of excellence, building a unique brand of resilience and fortitude to ensure consistent results that are now entrenched in these awards. We have continued to post consistent results that embed our strength not only within our financial platform, but also reflective of our primary philosophy of financial inclusivity through social empowerment. This award signifies the stability, strength and sustainability thats now very much a part of the CDB fabric. It also underlines that the way we conduct our business stimulates social empowerment in how we strengthen the bottom of the pyramid to build a sustainable economically empowered cohort of citizens, who will contribute productively to the national development agenda.
As Nanayakkara pointed out, CDB is undoubtedly the best example of a turnaround company, in that, by using astute vision, strategic initiatives and unbridled resourcefulness, transformed itself from a negative net worth company in 2001, to one which has crossed the Rs 1 Bn milestone in profitability among other landmarks. Our reputation has been built on being a respected, responsible public deposit taking corporate steward and it is inbuilt into our mindset that we must continuously forge a sustainable triple bottom line. Hence, our profitability, assets and shareholder funds continue on a strong growth trajectory, well supported by our strategic network of 69 outlets and a highly advanced technologically driven touch-point platform that has given us a competitive advantage for our stakeholder engagement processes. 
Being an organisation that believes in imbuing the rudiments of consistency into its overall sustainability ethos, Nanayakkara mentions that it is stakeholder value that must be optimized, because at CDB, it is stakeholders that form the foundation for our success, he says. By 2020, we intend to reach a balance sheet of Rs 100 billion, while etching more milestones into our legacy and empowering our nation through financial inclusivity initiatives, social empowerment and the unrelenting need to trailblaze and innovate. We will aggressively pursue our strategic priorities, fostering entrepreneurial innovation, pioneering pathways and ensuring responsible corporate stewardship to be a mentor to the NBFI sector in Sri Lanka.

China to levy environment tax to fight pollution
	

THE HINDU, 26th DECEMBER, 2016-Battling recurring pollution enveloping its cities, China has passed a new law to levy environment tax on polluters, specially on heavy industries.
The Environment Tax Law was adopted by the legislature, the National Peoples Congress (NPC) Standing Committee which concluded its meeting here on Sunday.
However, carbon dioxide, one of the major contributors to global warming, is not included in the levying list.
The law followed nearly week-long red alert due to heavy smog over Beijing and 23 other cities last week leading to imposition of odd-even number system to regulate vehicles and closure of schools.
The law, to enter into force on January 1, 2018, will be key to fighting pollution, Wang Jianfan, director of the Ministry of Finance tax policy department said.
China has collected a pollutant discharge fee, since 1979.
In 2015, it collected 17.3 billion yuan (about $2.5 billion) from some 280,000 businesses, Wang said.

Don't proceed with H'tota lease: Handunnetti tells MS
	
COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti today requested President Maithrirpala Sirisena not to go ahead with the signing of the lease agreement to hand over of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese Company.
He requested him to at least present the agreement in Parliament so that the people would know its contents.
In a letter to the President, Mr. Handunnetti said the Government is morally bound to reveal the conditions stipulated in the agreement when state property was handed over to a foreign company and it was also the people's right to know because none of those involved in this transaction would be alive in 99 years.
He said this was a clear case of the government being responsible for the future generation as well and added that one reason for electing President Sirisena was to oppose the secret and illegal deals of the Rajapaksa regime and to take legal action against them.
People had strongly objected to the handing over of state property and contracts to fraudsters by the previous regime. One of your main election slogans was to ensure transparency and corruption-free governance. But people and parliament are unaware of the agreement to hand over the Hambantota port with less than two weeks to do so. We do not know why these secret transactions were not considered as deals, he said in the letter.
Mr. Handunnetti said the handing over of the Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease was a serious matter as it was an important sector in the national economy and national security. (Ajith Siriwardana)

This provincial political chief is said to be clever at quickly adjusting his sails for an easy ride with the wind.

This chief was a close buddy of a former powerful politician when the latter was at the height of power. However, these days he uses every trick in his bag to avoid meeting the onetime mentor whenever the latter is due to attend some public function in his province.
By the way, this provincial chief makes it a point not only to sing praises of the new political boss at all public functions, but also to accord a right royal welcome to him whenever he makes a private or an official visit to his province.
This chief also very often takes to task his former boss for his misdeeds in the past both in private and public, they say.

Farmers forced to dump the produce as banknote ban turns bumper crop worthless
	

Farmers across India are battling a steep fall in wholesale vegetable prices and are forced to discard their produce as a nationwide cash crunch following the scrapping of high-value banknotes hurts demand. 
The crash in wholesale prices comes at a bad time for farmers, who reaped a bumper crop and were hoping for good returns to make up for losses induced by two straight drought years. 
Last Wednesday, S Raju, a farmer from Anantapur district, brought around two tonnes of tomatoes to Bowenpally market in Secunderabad but had to return home empty handed. 
He was shocked when traders at Bowenpally offered not more than Rs 2 a kg for his crop. 
Frustrated, he unloaded boxes of tomatoes and dumped them in the market yard, before cursing the traders and market authorities.
In Uttar Pradesh the state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.
The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.

Next year crucial in terms of delivery   Harin Fernando
	
Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando, in an interview with theDaily Mirror, says the government will start execution of projects next year, and people will feel the benefits by the end of the year or at the beginning of 2018.
Excerpts: 
"It is beyond my control. The Finance Minister also has a long term view on this. Sri Lanka has too many providers in the telecommunication sector.These tariffs will be a burden, but services will be better. We will give better value addition in future. "

Q How do you see the current political situation 
The next year will be a crucial one. For the last couple of years, attention was paid the consolidation of the government and getting the necessary mechanism in place. We have levelled the ground to have the race in the proper manner. The next year will be very crucial for us in terms of delivery. We will start seeing results. As you all are aware, there are lots of expectations of the people. It was difficult to live up to them. Though there is a change of government, the working order or the system did not change. It does not happen overnight. In the first year, what was done was the change of policies and all. It was done slowly and steadily. The international community has confidence in us. Now, we have built a roadmap for the development
of the country. 
Execution of work will be done next year. People will see the results at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2018. 
Q In what way 
That is in terms of development, job creation, investment coming in and new innovations. There will be a new mechanism working in Sri Lanka. I think the first year was meant for bringing reconciliation and strengthening the rule of law. People have freedom of expression. It shows when you look at social media, print media and electronic media. They are not controlled any more. The Prime Minister just makes a noise in Parliament. That is it. It is his pure right. But, they are not victimized. They are not being whisked away and harassed. 
Q You talk about the government with optimism, and plans for development. But, we see a lot of tension between the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the government. How does it affect the very survival of the government 
It purely depends on the President and the Prime Minister. They realize the January 8th promise they gave to people. They have different parties to maintain. The President has to look after the SLFP and the Prime Minister the UNP. Unfortunately, there are scattered incidents in which some MPs become stingy. They want their own party to govern the country. They do not have a mandate for it. Some have even come to Parliament on the National List. That is their sheer luck. When you are in a national government of this nature for the first time after 1948, it wont be easy even for the politicians to understand the concept. They may make irrational comments. It is up to the leaders to see that the party cadre is kept in line. This kind of odd statements may be heard. 
I am a Cabinet Minister. I know how the President and the Prime Minister handle the situation. 
Q Actually, some of your own party MPs were critical of the SLFP MPs and asked them to leave the government if they want. What do you think of it 
It was a pure retaliation probably from the UNPers. We have watched how the SLFPers have behaved. They have been very arrogant. I come from a district where all the nine electorates were won by the UNP. Unfortunately, I am placed in a very bad situation now.
I got the third highest percentage of votes in Sri Lanka. My hands are really tight because of the national government. I feel I got a very bad deal. However, I believe in the concept of national government. That is the Prime Ministers vision. I always want to support it. My leader has a bigger picture in mind. What is good for the country is not to fight on party lines but to deliver something to the country. We have to grasp this opportunity and move forward. I sometimes disregard my personal ego because I feel the county will benefit in the long run. I have beaten Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and Dilan Perera at three consecutive elections. Now, what is asked is what Haring Fernando has done. To be frank, it is very difficult for me to do when the people who have lost got ministries. If it were a UNP government, I could have done a lot more for the people. There are sacrifices one has to make. Personally, it is hurtful when people complain about non-delivery. We still have four more years. I am certain that the national government will start working. Some politicians are unfortunately selfish because they want to have the whole cake and eat.

	UNP will have a very clear victory at local government polls
	
Q What do you feel about the work you do for your constituents 
I do not handle a subject directly relevant to people in Badulla. It is a ministry similar in standing to the Mahaweli Development Ministry and Mahapola Bursary Scheme in the past. The Ministry in charge of digitization will be one like that. It will change the whole landscape of Sri Lanka. It is very difficult to explain it to people because they may not understand what it means. Digitalization is bringing your life into your fingertips. I will be able to transform the country by changing the way people think in terms of their education, health, and e-governance. Everything will be brought into smart phones so that people can get services without any travel. That is the industrial revolution assigned to me along with this Ministry. It may take time for me to deliver. It is a new ministry. It has to be formulated. 
I am impressed with the last budget. Next to the north, there are rebates for investments in the Uva Province. I have been able to talk to four companies. The Prime Minister has also instructed to extend the expressway from Hambantota to Badulla. That way, he wants to promote tourism. 
Q In this manner, the government has been talking about ambitious projects. However, people complain that nothing has happened on the ground for the last couple of years. What is your response 
As I said, though the last government was changed, the faces did not change. Ground level mechanisms have not changed. The thinking pattern of Ministry Secretaries is very different. We need to infuse positive thinking. 
Q Does it mean that bureaucrats do not listen to the government 
Not all of them. I would say most of them are very laid back. They do not want to have progressive thinking. They do not want to move fast. They try to keep the time growing. For a politician, it is only five years. But a bureaucrat remains there till he retires. 

"Execution of work will be done next year. People will see the results at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2018...They do not have a mandate for it. ...Some have even come to Parliament on the National List.  "
Q What is the alternative then 
That is why, we have a separate fast-tracking system. Various bureaucrats s are brought and pushed to work. We have figured out a way forward. Procurements are sometimes delayed for months. It is not about the politicians, the policies or whatever. 
Q How certain are you that this government will serve its full term 
I am absolutely certain. The next local government election will be an ideal opportunity. Some people think this will be a chance for them to get a stand against the government. People are smart enough to understand that this government has a vision. There are issues. But, the UNP will have a very clear victory. 
If US $ 8 billion investment as planned comes in, it will be a major boost. If the Free Trade Agreements with India, China and Singapore succeeds, it will be a boost to develop the country. We want to be an alternative to Dubai and Singapore. People are looking at Sri Lanka. You need to have a stable government to instil investor confidence. 
Q How are you getting ready for the local government election 
I will start work on it in January. People must have confidence. They need to understand that what we said would be delivered. A few will be unhappy as one year passed without anything. We have to go to the grassroots level and explain about it. We will ask for one more opportunity to perform. It is easy for the government. It is always the party in power that wins local elections. 
Q There are rumours that you will move away from Badulla to do future politics. Is there any truth in it 
It is an absolute falsehood. There is a certain segment of Badulla politicians in the opposition spreading such disinformation. I got the highest number of preferential votes. Once I deliver, people will begin to realize. A modern hospital is coming in Badulla. Three call centres will be set up in Badulla creating 1000 jobs. I know my time is four years more. We are going to develop dairy farming in our area. A foreign university will also be established. 
Q In the run up to the last election, the government promised free Wi Fi zones. How has it materialized 
When these zones were launched, they were done by five service providers. They did not want integrate among themselves. When one service provider gives free Wi Fi access at one place, a customer using another service cannot use internet in it. So, the project did not get off the ground as fast as we expected. We had to redo the whole thing to integrate all. By now, we have 500 sites. There is a problem. We did not have proper advertising on the project. We did not have a budget for it. After this festive season, I have planned a massive promotional campaign on it. 
Q The recent tariff hike has hampered the use of internet. What is your response 
It is beyond my control. The Finance Minister also has a long term view on this. Sri Lanka has too many providers in the telecommunication sector.
These tariffs will be a burden, but services will be better. We will give better value addition in future.
We will bring down the cost. In the long run, the Finance Minister has a different plan. At the moment, I take the blame and keep quite. 
"There is a certain segment of Badulla politicians in the opposition spreading such disinformation. I got the highest number of preferential votes. Once I deliver, people will begin to realize. A modern hospital is coming up in Badulla. Three call centres will be set up in Badulla ...."

Shehan Semasinghe: UNP-SLFP diatribe a drama
	
The Joint Opposition MP for the Anuradhapura District Shehan Semasinghe, in an interview with the Daily Mirror , says it is thoroughly unacceptable to delay the local government elections. He says the country is going through a turbulent period.

How do you see the current political situation
It is really a disaster. There was a change of government in January, 2015. Peoples expectations were raised at that election. They were promised a better standard of living. The picture drawn was that the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration was tainted with corruption, and that the rule should be changed for the installation of the Yahapalana government. The exact opposite to what was promised has happened. Today, people have come to realize that the previous government was better than the current administration in every aspect. 
The country has fallen back in every aspect. The government has no way out of it even. It does not have a future plan. It is only occupied with criticizing the last government. 
Today, democracy has failed. The local government elections are due. It is something crucial. Two years would have passed as of March, 2017 without elections. It is very unfair to delay this election merely for the fact that the governments popularity has waned. 
On the other hand, media freedom is at stake. It is deteriorating by the day. There is a witch-hunt on media because it brings out news unfavourable to the government. 
The government understood that social media was a key factor that brought them into power. Two years has passed. What is the governments stand on social media today It is seen as anathema to the forward march of the government. There is absolute contradiction in policy stand. 
You talk about the local government election. But, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which you represent is divided. You sit with the Joint Opposition. How confident are you that your side can make it at the election
When it comes to a party, members are the most important factor. In a private company, employees matter the most. But, employees are paid. In a political party, members are not paid. It is voluntary. As of now, the main principles of SLFP have been rescinded. When a party compromises its policies and joins the government that leads the country down the path of disaster, what is the choice for its members at grassroots level They will look at alternative factors. 
Today, both the United National Party (UNP) and SLFP are parts of the government. Sadly, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), with its 16 MPs, has virtually become a part and parcel of the government. The JVP also acts in the same manner. Imagine what would have happened if 51 of us in the Joint Opposition joined the government! Then, there would not have been any Opposition to the government. People are rallying against the government today. 
There is a school of thought that the split of the SLFP will eventually translate into the UNP having the edge at an election. What is your view
There is a thought like that. That is a story planted by those sitting with the government. SLFP voters have not mandated them to sit with the government. The UNP has got 106 seats. It is by the manipulation of peoples wish. Majority of the people, in fact, wanted the SLFP-led United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) to win, and Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa to become the Prime Minister. But, different steps were taken during the election to ensure the victory for the UNP. Secondly, people are today against the government in general. 
They do not find any reason to support any of the governing parties. So, at an election, people will be divided as pro-government people and anti-government people. Otherwise, there is no such division of public opinion on party lines. Actually, there will he split within the government with its allies going in different directions, but not in the Joint Opposition. People will rally behind the party opposed to the government. That party will have the edge at the end. 
How do you brace for the election
First, let the government decide on the election! Once the government decides, we will decide. We do not harbour personal grudges with anybody. We want to protect the principles of the SLFP. We do not want to become part of the UNP. The Yahapalana government is not carrying forward even a single principle of the SLFP. 
You served in the last Parliament as a young member. In your view, what was the reason for the downfall of the then government which you represented
There were several issues which we have to accept. There were several persons whose acts people did not like. Secondly, the then opposition established through propaganda that the then government was riddled with corruption. Thirdly, there was a lot of international pressure regarding the issue of the north and the east. 

"They do not find any reason to support any of the governing parties. So, at an election, people will be divided as pro-government people and anti-government people. ... "

The previous government was planning to work out a solution to this problem, acceptable to all the ethnic and religious groups with favour for none. The international community did not realize it. In fact, it was supportive of the LTTE ideology.  The pro- LTTE activists were living all around the world, extending support to this ideology. But, there were certain issues, despite all that, we should have corrected. We, in the previous government, did not look at them because we felt that we were doing fair enough for the country. 
People decided at the end. We genuinely respect it.  Actually, the people who were responsible for the downfall of the last government are with the present government. Almost all of them are with the present government. 
Today, we see a lot of differences between the UNP and the SLFP section in the government. Will it result in the unification of the SLFP factions in the government and the opposition against the UNP at one point
As I said earlier, there is nothing personal here. If 95 of us on the UPFA ticket remained together, we could have taken over the government by now. I doubt whether these differences visible at the moment are something staged. The UNP back benchers take on SLFP MPs serving in the government and ask them to quit if they wish. Nobody has made a move yet. Secondly, some SLFPers in the government say they are bogged down in a quagmire. State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa clearly said it. Then, Minister Dilan Perera called this government Paanduwa. 
It means the government is fragile. This could be another drama to cover the failures of the Yahapalana government. Nobody should be too optimistic about it. However, I am glad that both the UNP and the SLFP have realized that their political marriage is incompatible. 
Do you see any possibility of former President Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena mending their differences
That is up to them. However, I would say people want Mr. Rajapaksa to play the role and lead the country. I represent a very rural district. Economically, people are suffering. Expenditure is very high. The government is not acting fairly. The government is only acting in the interests of the sections of the international community that helped it in coming to power. The government always talks about a debt trap. It is only a phenomenon created by the Yahapalana government. During the previous government, we developed the country.

"When it comes to a party, members are the most important factor. In a private company, employees matter the most. But, employees are paid. In a political party, members are not paid. It is voluntary. As of now, the main principles of SLFP have been rescinded. When a party compromises its policies and joins the government that leads the country down the path of disaster, what is the choice for its members at grassroots level They will look at alternative factors."


The current government is so inefficient. When it comes to corruption and frauds, this government has set a record. Nobody can match the government in this regard. The economy is crashing as a result. The general public are suffering hugely. The government should be sympathetic towards the citizens of this country. This issue has become critical. Not even a single measure is taken to address it. With the budget, nothing but more and more taxes came in. 
Today, the Joint Opposition is accused of being racist. What are your views
We are definitely not. We do not support any sort of extremism. We advocate the middle path. This allegation is also part of a conspiracy against us. It was made against us two years ago. The same is being hatched against us now. I am telling you with responsibility that we do not take extreme ends. 
As a young parliamentarian, how do you look at parliamentary democracy today
It is very sad. The reason is that the parties have gone against the mandate they go. Secondly, 51 of us sit in the opposition. It has been accepted as a separate group. The TNA has only 16 MPs. But, it has been made the main opposition. 
The JVP has only six members. Yet, the Chief Opposition Whip post has been given to them. It is unfair. These 22 members together get 60 percent of oral time allocated to the entire opposition in Parliament. We, 51 members, do not get even 20 percent of time. Is that fair in that sense 
The government has introduced new committee system in Parliament. How do you see it
The committees are not functioning well as of now. These committees need much more improvement.

Tamil politicians squabble over damaged Gandhi statue in Mullaitivu
	
Two leading Tamil politicians of North Sri Lanka, both belonging to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), are squabbling over a controversial statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Mullaitivu town which was found destroyed on Monday.
TNA Member of Parliament Dr.Sivamohan had installed the statue recently, with the money given to him by the government for carrying out social and development works in Wanni electoral district, his constituency.
He told Express on Tuesday that the installation of the statue was part of his project to honour heroes, and that he had put up statues of Mother Teresa, poet Subramania Bharathi, and the local hero, Pandara Vanniyan, in several places with explicit consent from the authorities.
He was however shocked to find that Gandhis statue in Mullaitivu town, which he had put up recently, had been pulled down.
Miscreants encouraged by a local politician had done it. I have asked the police to investigate, the MP said. He declined to name the local politician.
This local politician had been encouraging a social media campaign against the installation of the statue on the grounds that Gandhi had done nothing for the people of Mullaitivu, Sivamohan said.
Asked to comment on the charge that he had put up the statue without official sanction, Sivamohan said that he had it cleared by the District Coordination Committee.(DCC).
The DCC meeting was attended by the Northern Province Chief Minister. In addition to getting the sanction of the DCC, I had written to the Central Resettlement Minister D.M.Swaminathan and he had approved of it in writing, Sivamohan explained.
Asked to comment on this, T. Ravikaran, a TNA member of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) who has been against Sivamohans project, said that he has nothing against Gandhi or the installation of a statue in his honour in Mullaitivu. His opposition stemmed from the unauthorised way in which it had been put up.
The statue does not have the authorisation of the local Pradheshiya Sabha, Ravikaran contended.
The installation was done in secrecy on a holiday and in the dead of night, he said.
Ravikaran said that forces wanting to put up Buddha states in the Tamil areas might be encouraged by the way in which the Gandhi statue was up.
These forces could also put up Buddha statues without proper authorisation, he said.
When the Tamils are protesting against the unauthorised installation of Buddha statues in areas in the North where there are no Buddhists, how can we allow the unauthorised putting up of a Gandhi statue he asked.
Ravikaran refuted the charge that the Gandhi statue had been pulled down deliberately.
It may have fallen on its own, toppled by the wind. At any rate, the CCTV footage would show if someone had deliberately pulled it down, he said.
He further said that about four local boys have been taken in by the police for questioning. (New Indian Express)

Tunisian security forces warn of returning jihadis
	

TUNIS AFP Dec25, 2016- Tunisias security forces called on the government on Sunday to take exceptional measures to combat the return of jihadists fighting for extremist groups abroad. 
Tunisia has seen a wave of jihadist attacks since its 2011 revolution, including on foreign tourists, and the United Nations estimates that more than 5,000 Tunisians are fighting for extremist outfits, mainly in Iraq and Syria. 
The return of terrorists from hotbeds of unrest is worrying and could lead to the Somalisation of the country, said a statement from the internal security forces national union, referring to the Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab group in Somalia.

The warning came a day after the authorities said they had arrested three people including the nephew of Anis Amri, a Tunisian suspected of carrying out a deadly truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market this week.

Victims of identity theft Impersonation restricts  right to free  movement
	
Victims of identity theft are seldom aware of their plight. Thakshila Sumanasiri from Kandy alleges that a former housemaid has stolen her identity card to make a new passport and obtained Singapore citizenship. She told Daily Mirror that the authorities have failed to establish her identity and restore her identity rights. She has therefore placed her confidence elsewhere to conduct unbiased investigations to establish her identity so that she could travel unhindered. 
NIC Stolen
Thakshilas story dates back to more than twenty years ago. In 1993 her half-brother requested to accommodate Ruwani Nimalka, a housemaid who worked in Singapore. He was involved in transferring goods belonging to housemaids and had met Ruwani at the airport. Thakshila says that she does not know why Ruwani stayed at her house avoiding her own family members. However, Ruwani was treated as another member of their family. She was called by her nickname Rajji. 
During the three months Ruwani stayed in Thakshilas house, Thakshila lost her National Identity Card (NIC). There was another housemaid called Renuka with us. She told me that she had seen my NIC in Ruwanis bag, said Thakshila. Thereafter Renuka had called Ruwani outside her room while Thakshila checked her luggage. To her dismay Thakshila found her NIC in a pocket of the bag. 
When Ruwani was questioned she had flippantly told Thakshila that someone would have hidden it in her bag in jest. The incident was soon forgotten and Ruwani subsequently left the house. There was no cause for alarm as the NIC had been recovered. 
Anonymous calls
Afterwards there were rumours that someone had impersonated Thakshila. It 1995 Thakshila received anonymous calls informing her that Rajji (Ruwani) had impersonated her, had made a passport under her name and was currently residing in Singapore. At this point in her life Thakshila herself had not obtained a passport. 
I informed the Balagolla Police about the calls. They said that if my NIC was lost I could make a complaint. But I was in the possession of my NIC and I had no evidence to prove the allegations, said Thakshila. However, Thakshila was yet in the dark as to who gave her the initial tip but believed that it was someone who resided in close proximity to her. 
Her family members were afraid that she would be arrested for impersonation and requested her not to make a passport. She also feared for her three children who were very young at the time. Hence she gave up on her dreams of going abroad to pursue a course in bridal tailoring. Thereafter Thakshila had opened her own bridal tailoring shop in the country. 
Obtains a passport
In 2008 the police had informed her that she should inquire from the Department of Immigration and Emigration. I narrated the whole story to a head I met at the Department and told them about my miserable fate of not being able to obtain a passport, recalled Thakshila. After four hours at the Immigration Department she was informed that there was a fault in the system which would be rectified. Consequently she was given a passport on the same day. 
On my way out another Immigration Officer approached me. Out of concern for me he asked me not to investigate further as I may face detrimental consequences. I explained to him my situation and he handed me two printed sheets, said Thakshila. The Immigration Officer had rushed her outside and she had no time to look at the sheets of paper. 
Later she realised that the Immigration Officer had given her two sheets that contained Ruwanis photograph but Thakshilas details. It was a copy of the details of the forged passport. Thakshila immediately contacted the Immigration Officer who had given his number. He requested her not to take action as he may fall into trouble. She had been advised to use the printed sheets when a dire situation arose. He had further asked her to keep her ID, Birth Certificate and the printed sheets with her at all times. 

"I have a recording of the meeting with the Deputy Controller. I dont know if it is legal or not. But Ive come to a point where I cant trust anyone and now I have to depend on such evidence"

Threats
I started getting anonymous calls threatening me. They knew that I had obtained a passport. They asked me not to go to the police. If I did, they said that I would face the consequences, Thakshila recollected. She also felt that she was being followed and as a result had to move her salon which fetched high profits by then. 
One day someone rang the bell late at night. I was hesitant to open the door and did so gradually. But two people rushed in. One of them grabbed me by my hair. My little children started crying. Despite my disabled aunts pleas they threatened me, Thakshila said. 
Revisits the Immigration department
In 2009 she had revisited the Department of Emigration and Immigration and had met the same Department head who informed her that it had been an issue in the system which would be rectified. I told him that I have evidence and showed him the sheets of paper. I pointed out that the photograph and signature did not belong to me. He asked me if I was crazy to investigate the matter and asked if I wanted to get arrested, Thakshila said. The head had taken the sheets away from her but Thakshila retains copies of them. 
CID Investigation
In 2011 Thakshila flew to India and did not face any unnecessary interrogation or detention. Later the same year she was asked to come to the International Unit of the Criminal Investigation Department on September 13, 2011. I met the OIC. He showed me a file with copies of an ID, birth certificate which the Singapore Interpol had sent. He informed me that there was a petition against Ruwani in Singapore, Thakshila said. When asked as to how Singapore Interpol started investigating she said she believed that the anonymous caller had informed them. 
The OIC had asked her to verify that she was the genuine Thakshila. Fingerprints were obtained and further documents were gathered. She had to provide a certificate by the Gramaseva as well. The OIC promised Thakshila to send them to Singapore Interpol. He had also told her that he received calls asking to close the case. However, he had asserted that justice would be delivered. 
That day when she returned home Ruwani had called her. She apologised and she said she has two daughters. She offered me money but I refused. I asked her why she did it. I told her that I wanted my freedom, Thakshila recalled. 
Thakshila was later informed by the OIC that the case was closed and Ruwani will be deported and arrested. Thereafter Thakshila had flown to Bangkok and Singapore, and did not come across any difficulty. 
US visa rejected
However, in 2014 Thakshila was denied a visa to Japan. When she applied for the US visa it had been rejected as well. At the interview I was told that I had flown to the US before from Singapore. I told them that wasnt me and that I had never flown to the US. Though they didnt specifically state the reason for denying a visa I think they thought that I had a forged passport, Thakshila said. 
Investigations halted
Thakshila had gone to the CID once again and was notified that the OIC whom she had met before was abroad. I spoke to an officer who was working in his place. He looked at the file and informed me that investigations have halted halfway through, recollected Thakshila. An argument had ensued afterwards and Thakshila had blamed the CID. The officer had asked her to write a complaint demanding the matter be solved. When Thakshila inquired from the CID later on, she was informed that the CID was awaiting a response from the Singapore authority. Then the CID had asked her to go to Singapore and inquire from the authority. I was not allowed to enter the bureau. So I placed a complaint at a police station in Singapore. I gave them the reference number but they didnt give me information as I was from Sri Lanka. But they gave me a letter stating that I came to the police station and placed a complaint stating that someone has used my name and NIC to make a passport and obtain visas to other countries, Thakshila said. 

"I started getting anonymous calls threatening me. They knew that I had obtained a passport. They asked me not to go to the police. If I did, they said that I would face the consequences"
Thereafter when she inquired again the CID informed her that nothing could be done. In 2015 she had written to the President as well. Subsequently a friend suggested to place a complaint at the passport section of the CID. Though the first complaint was ignored she received a response to the second letter. The letter asked her to come to the CID. 
The OIC of the passport division asked me to meet the Deputy Controller of Immigration. When the Deputy Controller, Mr. Lakshan [n1] was checking my information on the computer I saw the printed sheets I had received before, displayed on the screen, Thakshila said. She had explained to him that she was unable to go to any country that Ruwani had visited. He had asked her to provide a written complaint certified by the Gramasevaka, so that she could be directed to the Legal Department. The very next day she travelled back to Colombo from Kandy with the documents. 
I have a recording of the meeting with the Deputy Controller. I dont know if it is legal or not. But Ive come to a point where I cant trust anyone and now I have to depend on such evidence, she said. 
Travel ban and arrest warrant
Thereafter she was informed by the CID in writing that investigations were carried out by the section responsible to prevent illegal immigration. The letter notified her that there was a travel ban obtained from the Colombo Magistrates Court against Ruwani. [n2] It further stated that Thakshila would be informed about the progress of the investigation once the alleged impersonator was arrested. 
Migrated to Australia
Meanwhile, Thakshila conducted her own investigation. Her half brother who had initially brought Ruwani to their house had met a friend coming from Singapore. Thakshila said that the case had gained some notoriety in Singapore that they were all on the look out for anyone coming from the country so they could inquire about it. Thakshila found that Ruwani was married to Dissanayake who was related to the friend the step brother met at the airport. Thakshila alleges that Ruwani had flown to Singapore under her identity after she left her house in the 90s. According to Thakshila, Ruwani had befriended an Indonesian Tamil called S.Nadaraja alias Ricky whom she married and later divorced. 

"On my way out another Immigration Officer approached me. Out of concern for me he asked me not to investigate further as I may face detrimental consequences. I explained to him my situation and he handed me two printed sheets"

The friend of the step brother, whose name Thakshila did not disclose to us, knew Ruwani as Thakshila. The friend has told her that though they did not know that Ruwani had stolen someone elses identity, there had been instances which raised concern about the family. Ruwani and her husband did not move about well with the people whom they had associated long time back, who presumably knew about Ruwanis background. 
Disanayake had borrowed Rs. 1.2 million from the friend to migrate to Australia as his business in Singapore was declared bankrupt in 2011. As the family had obtained Singapore citizenship (in 2008) they were able to move to Australia smoothly. 
Two passports one identity
The friend had recollected how Ruwani had renewed her passport at the Department of Immigration and Emigration in 2008. This was after I made my passport. Ruwani had gone to the Immigration and Emigration Department with the wife of the friend who was in the car while Ruwani went in. Ruwani had come back saying that someone had made a passport under her name. However after she called Disanayake and informed him about the incident, her passport had been renewed consequently, Thakshila said. 
Officers of the Immigration Department had clearly detected the falsehood. They could have arrested her. If they were still unsure they could have immediately arrested both of us, and interrogated us to verify who was genuine, she added. 
According to the friend they have migrated to Australia in 2012. Disanayaka had not returned the money and allegedly threatened the friend. Thakshila also alleges that Disanayaka was an influential person which was why they were able to bypass being arrested and brought to justice. 
Plot to arrest the culprit
The friend had provided Thakshila with photographs of Ruwani and her husband, and the address of their residence in Australia. The friend also informed her that they were coming to Sri Lanka in April this year for an alms giving. 
He notified her that Ruwani and her family would come to Kegalle on April 09. She had provided this information to the CID OIC and as they had obtained an arrest warrant, Thakshila depended on them for support. The friend had given Disanayakas number as well which Thakshila had given to the police so they could trace him. The CID had promised to arrest Ruwani. When she contacted the CID again they have told her that they were busy with New Year Celebrations. She had requested the duty be passed over to the Kegalle Police. However, no arrest was made until April 11. In the meantime I called the CID but no one picked up the phone. Later when the OIC did pick up the phone he asked how he could know who the genuine person was. If that was the case he should have arrested both of us and held an inquiry. Ruwani has left the country on the 13th though she was supposed to leave at the end of April, she said. Thakshila suspects that Ruwani left the country because the CID informed her that Thakshila was after her. 
The friend of her half brother had also given her information of a friend Ruwani befriended in Australia called Ayomi. After some digging Thakshila found that Ayomi was from Bentota and that they managed a hotel. Thakshila had created a fake facebook profile posing as a New Zealand girl and had befriended Ayomis brother. She had chatted with him and somehow convincingly obtained the address of the hotel. Thakshila visited the hotel and obtained Ayomis house address. Ayomi told me that she had been suspicious of Ruwani when Ruwani asked them not to post her photographs on facebook. Ruwani has told her that she had not wanted her relatives back home feel jealous of her looking at her successful life. Ayomi has also heard rumours about the impersonation, which she had not given much thought, as she trusted the Disanayake family, Thakshila narrated. 
Ayomi also said that the Disanayakes always shift from one hotel to another and never stayed with their families. Ruwani hasnt introduced her parents to Ayomis family, Thakshila added. Ayomi had informed her that Ruwanis family and Ayomifamily were supposed to leave together at the end of April, but that Ruwani had left hurriedly before the due date. 

"I was not allowed to enter the bureau. So I placed a complaint at a police station in Singapore. I gave them the reference number but they didnt give me information as I was from Sri Lanka"
I became suspicious of the CID and didnt give them any further information I found, said Thakshila. Thereafter she had complained to the Human Rights Commission. 
Someone told me that the current director of the CID was just and fair. So I went back to the CID. The OIC who promised to arrest Ruwani was absent. I gave him Ruwanis address in Australia. He said that he would write to the Australian Embassy, she said. 
We asked Thakshila if she suspected her half brother to be part of the plot. I suspected him. I was not on talking terms with him for a while. But later he explained himself and cleared all the doubts. He has been very supportive, she said. 
As her efforts to pursue justice through local authorities failed, Thakshila appealed to International authorities to look into the matter. Daily Mirror withholds information on current investigations on the request of Thakshila, so that fair and uninterrupted investigations are conducted. 
I have been deceived many times. Now I have no faith in our countrys law which supports corruption, Thakshila expressed.
