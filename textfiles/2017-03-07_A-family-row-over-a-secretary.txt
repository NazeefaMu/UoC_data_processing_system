A family row over a secretary


	



 

A male secretary among the personal staff of a prominent female politician has become the cause of a protracted row between her and her husband. 

 


On being informed by reliable sources that the secretary in question was getting bribes from people promising to have their needs attended to by his political boss, the husband had asked the wife to sack the guy. He had also cited instances among others where the secretary had got kickbacks from teachers who had called at the female politico’s office seeking help to get a transfer to a school of his or her choice and parents desperate to have a child admitted to a popular school.


However, the lady had refused to sack the secretary saying that she did not believe the graft allegations against him and this has led to the wrangle between the couple, they say.
