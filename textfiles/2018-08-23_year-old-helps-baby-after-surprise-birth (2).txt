10 year old helps baby after surprise birth


	



Chloe Carrion from Virginia, USA has become a hero after her Aunt unexpectantly gave birth in the bathroom of her home.  After hearing her aunt shout for help, 10-year-old Chloe entered the bathroom just in time to see her aunt losing a lot of blood and before eventually passing out in the bath tub.  Quick thinking Chloe then sprang into action, calling 911, who then coached her through cutting the umbilical cord.  She then cleaned and swaddled the baby, something she had learnt from watching YouTube videos on how to care for her toy dolls.  Once the paramedics arrived, they transferred Chloe’s aunt and her new baby cousin to the hospital where they are both during well.  Chloe has even been given the honour of naming the new bub – a sweet, healthy little boy she has called Isaac.
