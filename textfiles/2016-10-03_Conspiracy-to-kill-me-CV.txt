Conspiracy to kill me: CV


	

A conspiracy is being hatched up to assassinate me and put the blame on the LTTE, Northern Provincial Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran said.

He said this in the felicitation message he sent to the function of launching the book on 'Constitution of Sri Lanka’ authored by former Senior Lecturer and independent researcher M.Thirunavukarasu.

"I denounced the building of Buddhist temples arbitrarily in the Northern Province. A hate-campaign in going on in the South against me misquoting me as saying that Buddhist temples should not be built in the North and that Sinhalese should not live here and they should be evicted from North, are utter lies," the CM said.

"The majority of people have a mind set that we should not express our grievances and we have to accept meekly whatever given to us. I hear that a plot has been designed in the South to kill me and put the blame on the LTTE" he said.
