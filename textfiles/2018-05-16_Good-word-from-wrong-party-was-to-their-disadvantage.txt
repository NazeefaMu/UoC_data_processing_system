None of the Blue party’s Diyawanna ones --  either the backbenchers or purohitas at state or deputy level --  got a promotion to top team status at the latest reshuffle of the pack.  According to reports, there were several Blue ones who were eagerly looking forward to a kick upstairs and conspicuous among them were grey-haired and bearded senior from Colombo, Lucky from Mahiyanagana and the business tycoon from Negombo. 

 


Those who had made inquiries about this matter had learnt that a suggestion made to him by the Green leader had led Number One to decide not to promote any of the Blue aspirants to top team status at the latest reshuffle. 


The Green leader had suggested the names of some Blue ones as those deserving top team status and that had led Number One to come to his own conclusions. So, he had immediately decided not to promote any of the Blue party ones believed to have one foot in the Blue party and the other in the Green party!
