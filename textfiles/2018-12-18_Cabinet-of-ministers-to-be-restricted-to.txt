 Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has informed the UNF parliamentary group that the Cabinet will have to be limited to 30 ministers and that some will have to voluntarily give up aspirations of holding posts.

This was mentioned by MP Mano Ganesan on his twitter message. "Myself and Rishard Bathiudeen will stay out of the cabinet if Mr. Wickremesinghe so wished," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriiwardana)
