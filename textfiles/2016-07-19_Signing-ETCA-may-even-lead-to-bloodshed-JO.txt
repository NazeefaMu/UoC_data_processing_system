The joint opposition today said that there could even be ‘bloodshed’ in the country if the government signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) disregarding the objections raised by the people.

MP Bandula Gunawardane said the majority of the people including intellectuals and professionals are against the signing of the agreement. “The ETCA comes as a politically-motivated decision and not as a financial decision,” he said.
