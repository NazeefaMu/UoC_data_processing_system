Connecting Muscat with Moscow, we expect this daily service to further stimulate economic, trade and business relations between the two friendly countries. Trade between Oman and Russia continues to rise and we are happy to be able to facilitate this further with the start of this service. Oman is turning into a very important regional logistics hub with world-class infrastructure and we are sure this is recognised by the business enterprises in Russia. Apart from strengthening and opening up new business opportunities between Russia and Oman, our flights will also open the gates for Russian tourists to come and enjoy our beautiful country.”

This new route will be serviced by Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, designed to offer exceptional performance, flexibility and efficiency.
