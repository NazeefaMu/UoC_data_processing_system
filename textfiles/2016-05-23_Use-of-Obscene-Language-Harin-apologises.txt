Use of Obscene Language: Harin apologises


	

After Telecommunications and Digital Technology Minister Harin Fernando abused Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage in obscene language, the parliamentary authorities have begun to consider amending the Standing Orders to ensure the dignity and decorum of the House.

The incident took place last week.

The Joint Opposition’s parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena had raised the issue at the Business Committee meeting and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had agreed to look into it.

It is learnt that MPs who use unparliamentary language would be prevailed upon to withdraw their remarks forthwith or else face disciplinary action. Meanwhile, party leaders have stressed the need to amend the Standing Orders to provide for stern action.

Mr. Fernando, in a video clip posted on the internet, apologised to the country and its citizens for his actions. He said the Speaker had asked him about it last Friday.

“I am willing to accept any punishment given to me. Today there is a sinister mudslinging campaign against me in the social media. There is no video evidence against me,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
