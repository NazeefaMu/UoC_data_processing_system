A number of cases were waiting to be filed in the recently established Special High Court, against the incidents of financial misappropriation occurred during the incumbent Government’s tenure, MP Susil Premajayantha said today.

Addressing the Joint Opposition’s weekly news briefing, the MP said there was ample evidence to prove the financial frauds which had been taken place under the present Government.

“The Special High Court is good. We too know how to file cases. More cases are waiting to be filed in this court when the Government’s tenure ends in 12 to 14 months.

“Not a single probe had been launched by the FCID or any other entity so far over the incidents of financial frauds of this Government,” he said.

He said the new building for the Agricultural Ministry was rented at a cost of Rs. 2.5 million per month and the rent had been paid for at least 10 months even before the Ministry moved into the new building.

He also said the Government had to pay a penalty of USD 98 million when the agreement to purchase four Airbus aircraft was cancelled.

“This Government accused the previous Government of paying Rs.1.5 million to the then SriLankan Airlines’ CEO. However, the new CEO has been paid a salary of Rs.3.5 million. These are only a handful of financial misappropriations committed by this Government,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said the MPs who recently defected and joined the JO would take part in the protest organised by the JO on September 5.

“All of us decided to pledge our support and join this protest which will be held against the Government,” he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
