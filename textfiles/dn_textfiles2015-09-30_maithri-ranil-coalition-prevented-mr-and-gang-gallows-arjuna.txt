Maithri - Ranil coalition prevented MR and gang from gallows - Arjuna

It is the Maithri - Ranil coalition which prevented former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and others from being arraigned before an international court and sentenced to the gallows by regaining international confidence for Sri Lanka and its government, said Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
He said the advent of two leaders who transformed an international investigation into a local probe is a good fortune for the country and its people.
Minister Ranatunga expressed these sentiments addressing a felicitation ceremony organised by the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya's Sri Lanka Ports Authority Branch recently.
He said the international community had become our friends under the national unity government.
"Earlier, the international community dictated what ought to be done regarding the alleged war crimes and human rights violations. But today, they were agreeable to listen to our suggestions and proposals," the minister said.
Ranatunga said directing two political parties with divergent policies and views towards consensual politics was no easy task. But the Maithri - Ranil coalition had succeeded in achieving that difficult aim today," the minister said.
