In Love With Theater

One of Sri Lanka's great entertainers Indu Dharmasene uttered his most famous words when 'Aunty Netta' (played by Nimmi Harasgama) asked him 'Do you prefer to be called a dramatist?' - his response: "I am just Indu." Those four words show his inimitable humor, simplicity and humility. Having written 63 plays, for Dharmasene, 59, talent is like a polished diamond.
Dharmasene showed great promise at a young age and all his teachers sensed his potential for greatness in theatre.
"I acted in nursery and school concerts when I was very young. The first play in which I acted in a main role was also written and directed by me when I was twelve years old. Yoland Abeyweera was my guru and I learnt acting techniques and stagecraft from her.
She encouraged me to write and direct plays and always supported me. She was a great lady. In fact she and the teachers in charge of our school Sinhala Literary Society encouraged me to write plays," said Dharmasene.
Indu can be inspired anywhere and in any way. His muse is everywhere - while watching T.V while seated in the company of others at the dinner table. "Society inspires me, I observe people around me. I keep my eyes and ears open all the time."
Dharmasene's pen has spawned some of the finest pieces of literature that Sri Lankan society has ever seen. Not for him is melancholy. He likes to elevate people into a 'feel good' mood.
"I actually think of myself as more of an entertainer than a writer. Theatre/drama is subjective. It is not possible to cater to everyone. The people who come for my plays come to relax and laugh. So I focus on entertaining the audience.
I prefer comedy. So I have not written any tragedies. Having said that, some of my plays have a serious theme even though it has a happy ending. The only tragedies I have directed are Shakespeare plays. The Tommiya series is a very popular comedy. And the cast and I have a lot of fun doing them."
It seems that the most talented playwrights tread the path of political satire, one of the most famous being the Greek playwright Aristophanes. Dharmasene is not new to the field of political satire. "I have done a couple of political satires. In 1997 I did 'A Real Change'. Then this year, 'Maru Palanaya'".
English playwright and actor Ray Cooney is one of Dharmasene's favorites. A seasoned campaigner, Indu knows the business inside out. His spectrum of talent certainly beguiles the mind.
"I have acted in all my plays as well as a few Musicals, a couple of Ray Cooney plays, some of E.C.B. & Lanerole plays. All in all, maybe about eighty plays. This is not taking into account the roles I have played in short plays staged at special events."
Dharmasene is a multi -tasker. He directed the musical 'Camelot' and acted the role of King Arthur and successfully pulled off one of the most difficult projects in his career. The fact that he was the very image of the knight in shining armor is testimony to the fact that Dharmasene has huge mental faculties.
"The musical 'Camelot' is my favorite. I really enjoyed playing the role of King Arthur."
An accomplished and experienced thespian Dharmasene is able to bring the best out of his cast. "As a Director I want my cast to be comfortable playing the role. So I don't insist on them coming out of their comfort zone. If the Director thinks I can do justice to the role, I have no problem playing any role."
Dharmasene feels that the whole theatre scenario needs to be upgraded and that affordable state of the art theatres will help more people to do productions and to further improve production values. "Theatre going public is rather small in Sri Lanka compared to the West. As a result a career in theatre is not considered lucrative. So there is talent in abundance but not many professionals."
The Tommiya Series shows Indu's greatest strength which is his humor, the prized weapon in his arsenal.
"The Tommiya series started as a skit which was performed at a coffee evening. Then the first in the series, 'Madai Ithin Dubai Giya' was well received and the characters became popular. I was asked to write more about them. Some of my friends say that the character 'Tommy' is my alter ego. I have a couple of plays as well as skits based on Mr. Gajasiri."
It seems that Dharmasene's ambitions are not limited to the stage as he is also thinking about doing a TV series. Those are things in the future but right now it is plays and more plays!
"Next production is going to be a Ray Cooney, a playwright who has had an impact on my work other than Shakespeare. I am also thinking of doing one of my very first plays next year. I feel that it would also be nice if more people would support local or original productions."
Someone once said: 'Do what you love doing best. Because if you do that you will succeed in life'. Indu has come a long way. His journey from the time when he was a twelve year old youngster to who he is now, is nothing short of astounding. He has fallen in love with theatre.
"I simply love theatre! I enjoy every aspect of it."
