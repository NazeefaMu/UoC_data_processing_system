President Maithripala Sirisena, who blamed extremist groups for creating a constitutional monster, appealed for a peaceful transition towards a new era.
" Some elements are trying to create a constitutional monster as usual whenever efforts are made to enact a new constitution and I request these elements not to resort to such a thing as it is nothing but a crime" he said making a special statement in Parliament this morning.
It is extremist elements which spread false stories, he said.
He assured that the new constitution would be a home-grown one and added that no country had advised Sri Lanka on the constitution. (Yohan Perera)
