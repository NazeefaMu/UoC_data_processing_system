Boat owners and equipment in custody must be penalised - Herath
Fishing vessels and equipment of the Indian fishermen poaching into Sri Lankan waters must be taken into custody and the owners of the equipment must be produced before courts, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
The MP was moving an adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday. He observed that the vessels are mostly owned by South Indian politicians.
"The politicians including Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, have politicized this issue. The Sri Lankan government too releases the Indian fishermen on a regularly basis due to political interference.
The Indian fishermen are arrested for violating the Immigration and Emigration laws. Instead, we request the government to use the provisions of the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act of 1979 and take those vessels into Sri Lankan custody," he observed.
The MP also urged the President and the government to take immediate action to protect the Sri Lankan maritime bounding, as it is a matter of territorial integrity and sovereignty. He pointed out that the Indian trawlers take away Rs 8,640 million worth of fish annually from Sri Lankan waters, which was directly affecting the economy of the country.
Seconding the motion TNA MP S M A Sumanthiran urged the government to revise the law to completely ban the bottom trawling.
He observed the bottom trawling is only regulated under the existing provisions in the Fisheries and Acquatic Resources Act, adding that this Act should be amended to completely ban this destructive fishing method. He noted all the marine resources including sea bed are badly affected due to bottom trawling.
He also directed the attention of the government over the poaching of fishermen from the Southern and Western parts of the country into the seas off the Northern part.
To prevent fishermen crossing IMB, naval and coast guard help vital
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan told Parliament yesterday, that the Sri Lankan Government should discuss with the Indian Government and the Tamil Nadu State to device a programme to get Sri Lanka's and India's Naval and Coast Guard support to prevent fishermen of both countries crossing the International Maritime Borders(IMB).
He made these observations while participating in the debate at the time of the adjournment of the House. Northern fishermen met with President Maithripala Sirisena recently. They told President Sirisena of the problems they face due poaching by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters.
The President instructed the Navy to stop Indian fishermen entering Sri Lankan waters, but later, this programme was not implemented properly.
Once again, fishermen in the North are continuing to be deprived of their livelihood.
"We hope that this issue would be sorted out with any problem to both countries. Fishermen of the North and East could not ply their trades due to the 30-year long war. Even after the war ended, they lived a life burdened with debt.
"Now the time has come to provide a permanent solution to this problem. Indian fishermen poach in Sri Lankan waters at their will. Their use of bottom trawling has resulted in depriving us of our future harvest of fish, the Opposition Leader said.
Govt. responsible to solve poaching by Indian fishermen
This government has a responsibility to solve issues pertaining to Indian fishermen poaching in our territorial waters by way of diplomatic discussions with the Indian Government, said UNP Parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar.
He also said the previous government was unable to find a solution to this issue though it was debated once every two to three months. He added that this government had developed cordial relationships with the Indian government unlike the previous government, so that there is a conducive environment to solve this issue.
He also stated that poaching by Indian fishermen in our waters had been a 30-year-old issue. They exploited the situation of terrorism to poach into our waters as our fishermen could not go fishing.
MP Marikkar further stated that with the elimination of terrorism, the people were under the impression that the economy could be developed by fishing and tourism industries. He also added that it had not been able due to the poaching. He further said the Indian Government did not attend to the issue due to the fact that South Indian politicians are benefiting from this situation.
He made these observations yesterday joining the Adjournment Motion moved by JVP Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath.
Govt will take measures to uplift living standards of fisher folk - Niroshan Perera
National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Niroshan Perera, said that the new government is committed to solve the issues pertaining to fisher folk.
He said the previous government did not take any measures to find a tangible solution to the Indian - Sri Lanka fishermen's conflict. He added under the Leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government would discuss this matter with the Indian government to find a solution.
He added the government would also take measures to develop the fishing industry to uplift the living standards of the fisher folk of the country.
