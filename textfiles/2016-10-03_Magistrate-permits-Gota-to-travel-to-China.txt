Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today permitted former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to travel to China.

Rajapaksa was permitted to travel between October 5 and 30 to attend a Defense Seminar.

A travel ban was imposed on the suspects, including Rajapaksa on September 30 when they were released on bail. However, the Magistrate today lifted the ban on an additional personal surety bail of Rs. 5 million.

The decision comes amidst investigations by the Bribery Commission against Rajapaksa and seven others related to corruption charges at Avant Garde Maritime Services. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
