Mohamed Deen – who identified himself as the father of slain businessman Mohamed Shiyam, today claimed that former DIG Vass Gunawardena had no connection with his son’s murder.
Speaking to the media outside the court, he alleged two others called Krishantha and Fausdeen were responsible for the murder of his son.
“I have no doubt in Mr. Gunawardena. He didn’t do anything to our son. I told Mr. Gunawardena that I will testify on behalf of him in case he decided to appeal,” he said.
