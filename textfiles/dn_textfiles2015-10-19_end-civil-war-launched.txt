'To end a Civil War' launched

A record of Sri Lanka's peace efforts and the role played by Norway in peace talks titled "To end a Civil War" was launched last week.
Erik Solheim, the main negotiator in the peace process in Sri Lanka from during 2000-2005 peace talks and former Norwegian Development Minister, is one of the two main contributors of the book which records a detailed account of the Norway's engagement in country's peace negotiations.
The book authored by Mark Salter, a journalist and writer also carries contributions by Norwegian Minister for Europe, Vidar Helgesen who also held the Deputy Foreign Minister portfolio.
The content of the book focuses mainly on elections, peace talks and stalemate, and the situation after the tsunami, ending with summery on the last phrase of the war and the political complications thereafter.
