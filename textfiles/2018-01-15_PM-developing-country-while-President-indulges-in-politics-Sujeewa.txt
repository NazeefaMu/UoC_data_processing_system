State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe gave a reminder yesterday that it was the United National Party (UNP) that had brought President Maithripala Sirisena to power, but he was now seeking to stay President for six years without consulting the party.

Addressing meeting in Chilaw he said that while President Sirisena was busy doing this Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was busy developing the country.

“That is the difference. Let’s do politics in 2020! What is important right now is the getting the country out of the mess it is in. The Prime Minister is going about this quietly but the President's priorities seem to be elsewhere. Whatever anyone might say, Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the President of this country by 2020. He will be the President until 2025. After that, he will entrust the country to the next generation of UNPers,” Mr. Senasinghe said.

He said LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran started politically destroying the UNP until it fell flat on the ground literally. “Prabhakaran, despite being a terrorist, had a sharp mind. He realized that the UNP would deliver development to the country when it was in power,” he said.

He said nobody would be able to prevent the rise of the UNP. “Even if the President attacks us, we will emerge victorious,” he said. (Jude Samantha)
