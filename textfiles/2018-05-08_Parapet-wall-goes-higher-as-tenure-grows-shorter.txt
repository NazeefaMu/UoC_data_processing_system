Parapet wall goes higher as tenure grows shorter


	

A certain provincial political chief has taken action to put up a very high parapet wall around his official bungalow after demolishing the five-foot parapet wall which was already there. 




“There is no reason why people should see from outside what is going on in my residential premises,” the provincial chief is said to have told his aides and political associates. 


However, this chief’s term of office is due to expire in another four months, they say.
