The first batch of nine restored Romanian compartments will be put on track this morning on a special train from Colombo Fort to Ragama, Railways General Manager Mahanama Abeywickrama said.

“The first batch of the completed compartments will be put on track to Ragama today under the patronage of Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe,” he said. “A total of 200 compartments are being repaired and restored under a joint project between a private company and the Railways Department.”

Mr. Abeywickrama said the Romanian coaches were imported between 1990 and 1992 and that most of the coaches were more than 26 years old with many passengers complaining to the Railways Department that they were not suitable for travelling. “The important parts of a compartment are the technical parts such as the braking system, which is more important for the safety of the commuters. Only the technical parts of a compartment are handled by the Railways Department technicians,” he said. “Each compartment is being repaired at a cost of Rs.10 to 15 million."
