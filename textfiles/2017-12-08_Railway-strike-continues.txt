Railway strike continues


	

The work stoppage by the Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA) is continuing in the absence of any signs of this matter being resolved.

A spokesman said they had launched a work stoppage from Thursday midnight because of the failure by the authorities to accept the Cabinet paper approved by the Prime Minister's Secretary.

“The strike action was a success. Several trains had operated on Thursday, but not after midnight. No higher authority has responded, therefore we will continue the strike today,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Kalathma Jayawardhane)
