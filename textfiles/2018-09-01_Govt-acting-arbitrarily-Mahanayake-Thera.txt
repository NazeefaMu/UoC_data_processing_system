Govt. acting arbitrarily: Mahanayake Thera


	

While claiming that the government was acting arbitrarily, Asgiri Chapter Mahanayake Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thera said yesterday the government must take steps to curtail the increasing crime in the country.

“Crime is on the increase. No one is paying attention to it. Shooting incidents are reported everywhere,” he said when a group of joint opposition MPs including Namal Rajapaksa, Kanchana Wijesekara and Mahindananda Aluthgamage called on the Mahanayake Thera to brief on the janabalaya protest campaign.

They also met Ramanna Nikaya Mahanayake Ven. Napana Premasiri Thera, who said the programme of the JO was praiseworthy and wished them success. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
