A caring relationship beyond boundaries
	
Not all children are blessed with a happy home. Some may be blessed with a caring family while others fall under the fates of faults in their stars. 
In Sri Lanka its estimated that 340,000 children have lost parental care. Children lose their parents through diseases, accidents, natural disasters, poverty and social issues. To add salt to the wound, these innocent individuals are constantly taunted by abuse, which comes either in mental or physical form. 
With the calls being heard loud to eradicate social criticism and indifference to these children, SOS Childrens Villages have come to the rescue. The SOS Villages ensure every child gets a happy childhood.The SOS model is fuelled by the belief that in order to thrive, every child needs a loving mother, a safe home, siblings and a stable community 
SOS Childrens Villages have branches in 135 countries. SOS Childrens Villages have branches in Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya, Monaragala, Galle and Piliyandala. These villages provide alternative care to over 41,000 children who have been deprived of parental care. The service provided by the SOS Childrens Villages adds colour to the lives of children whose lives would otherwise have been grey. 
But despite riding on the rough seas of life, the lives of these children are now experiencing a smooth sailing, thanks to the SOS villages. Having been run on funds granted largely by international individual donors and European benefactors for the past 36 years, the SOS Childrens Villages in Sri Lanka are now facing a challenge. The SOS Childrens Villages International, has implemented a gradual reduction in their funding on the grounds that Sri Lanka has now become a middle income country in Asia. Since 2016, part of the funding has been withdrawn and by the year 2023, funding is expected to completely cease. 

I joined the SOS village in Piliyandala in 1981. I was a mother to 27 children. Most of them are married now. Some live abroad
Seeing is believing and spending a day at the village is enough for one to be awe-struck at the efforts made by SOS ChildrensVillages to bring happiness and hope into the worlds of these children. The air is filled with the happy laughter of children. What they are enjoying under this system of care confirms how rewarding the efforts of the villages truly are. 
The most loved concept of the SOS village is that every child grows up in a SOS family. This allows a child to grow up in a loving environment. Children are cared for in family homes by SOS mothers. These wonderful females have dedicated their lives to play the role of mother to these children. Even though I am not the birth mother of the children, they are my children and I do everything for them. They have become the meaning of my life and I love them very much, said Yamuna, a SOS mother. The villages also have SOS Aunts as supporting roles for the mothers. The SOS village is also a retirement homes for the mothers. The walls of these retirement homes are adorned with photographs of generations of children who lived in these homes. They are now grown up and have left these homes. The pride that the retired mothers have in their children is no different from the pride that a mother would have for her own offspring. This shows the intimate bond that exists between the SOS family members. Having just returned from a trip abroad, the retired mother shared her experiences. I joined the SOS village in Piliyandala in 1981. I was a mother to 27 children. Most of them are married now. Some live abroad. I was taken to the UK by one of my children, Mali, who is now a UK citizen, said Yamuna. She proudly showed us the pictures during her trip abroad. The pictures contained images of the children when they were little.
Each SOS family is each given a cozy spacious house equipped with all facilities. When this writer visited this home it was satisfying to see how the children got together with their SOS mothers to prepare the meals, and set the table. As the children grow older, siblings are separated by gender. When these children reach youthhood they are moved to the SOS Youth Facilities. The individuals who are subject to this change are boys who turn 14 and girls who reach their 18th birthday. Apart from education, children are taught life skills such as cooking, shopping and maintaining vegetable gardens. They are engaged in activities such as air rifling, shooting, swimming and going on outings. We ensure that they do things on their own. The children surprised us with a music video that they had created for the Mothers Day especially organized in the village. The fact that they had done it all on their own was very impressive, said the youth worker. 
According to the youth worker pilot programmes are being set up to address these areas.  We have also lined up internships in companies for the youth to get them used to social and office environments, the youth worker added.
Dealing with youth isnt an easy task as most parents with teenagers will agree. This could aggravate the negative influence on them. So it is very important how you handle this sensitive issue, said the expert youth worker. 

Through this program we empower families to enhance their capacity to protect and care for their children and strengthen safety nets regarding vulnerable children
Education is a right of every child. SOS Villages offer the children the golden gift of education to ensure that they turn into members who contribute to society. The SOS village has a kindergarten and a school that is open to not just the SOS village children, but to the residents of the locality as well. The school syllabus is designed in keeping with the local education guidelines. The school is managed by the Government. Stopping by the preschool of the village, it was quite satisfying to witness the colourful little classrooms adorned with colourful art works, posters and paintings.
The health of the children is taken care of by two nurses who are attached to a medical centre. A medical file is maintained for each child and holds records of the individuals medical status. 
The village is equipped with a large playground that opens up many opportunities for the children to engage in sports. The purpose behind introducing them to sports is to produce a balanced individual. Each child in the village is also allocated a budget. What is extremely heart-warming is that the SOS Villages fulfill duties of the children as families would do for their own kids. The budget includes an allocation for weddings. Weddings are funded when the children are grownup and the time comes for them to tie the knot. This shows that the relationship between the child and the SOS village remains intact even when the child leaves alternative care. This kind of caring relationship isnt seen in most alternative care institutions. This is again another unique quality of these SOS Villages. 
The village also renders the service of conducting family strengthening programmes for children. Through this program we empower families to enhance their capacity to protect and care for their children and strengthen safety nets regarding vulnerable children. At present we serve around 3350 children around the country who have come to us from nearly 2000 families, said Divakar Ratnaduri, the Deputy National Director of SOS CVSL. 
Everything considered, the service that is provided by the SOS Villages around the country is exemplary. Therefore a call for help is made to make people come together to safeguard children who live under the care of SOS Villages. For the meritorious task of sponsoring a child at the SOS Villages, the public is invited to contribute LKR1500 monthly or Rs 18,000 annually. These contributions can help sustain a SOS family. So feel free to contact them on their phone lines 011 2702712/ 0772366106 or send an email to donate@soscvsrilanka.org

Accumulating merit at others expense
	

A prominent government politico had bought about half a million rupees worth of banner-flags from an upcountry businessman saying that he intended to use them as an offering to a Buddhist temple at a site hallowed by the visit of the Buddha. But he had conveniently forgotten to settle the bill.

The businessman had called on the politico from time to time to remind him about the overdue payment, but had failed to receive the money.
Later the businessman had learnt that this politico has made it a practice to dodge paying for things that he buys to use as offerings to places of religious worship.

## Title: Did Saradiel realise some truth before his death

Did Saradiel realise some truth before his death
	
The Sri Lanka Police which celebrated its 151st year on September 7th took our minds back to the year 1864. This was the year when history recorded the death of constable Sabhan, the first Sri Lankan policeman to die while on duty. If we turn the pages of time to that era there were several uprisings. These were the times of the British and the downtrodden masses were suppressed. Those who had power and wealth exercised control over the less affluent. The acquisition of wealth happened in a disproportionate manner. One person who stood against this injustice was folk hero Saradiel. 
Those were the times when people used the jungle to answer a call of nature, citizens received a temple education and farmers religiously attended to their paddy fields. A common saying that a person might go astray due to the misdeeds of another, was prominently applicable then with happenings in society giving ample examples of this dictum. The victim of such a circumstance was Saradiel (1832-1864), who lived in a village called Uthuwana, in Mawanella. 
Like most other children in the village Saradiel received an education at Illukgoda Temple. But that education was cut short due to Saradiel having a brawl with another student whose father wielded power in the village. The parents of this child framed that Saradiel stole a piece of jewellery from their son. Saradiel, who was 12-years-old then, spent several days in Police custody. Its said that this incident had a huge impact on Saradiels life. 


We are living during a time when most television stations are now telecasting tele dramas which arouse patriotic feelings. Maharaja Gemunu and Muthukuda take us to the times when Kings ruled this island. There were uprisings even then. Most of them are documented. Mathalan and Veera Puran Appu were folk heroes and stood up against injustice.

How could Saradiel have changed two things which were so close to his heart like name and religion within the short period of a day

Their lives touched the common man so much that film directors were convinced that their life stories should be told via film. But no worthwhile effort has been made to date by film producers to tell the public that such a character as Saradiel existed 153 years ago. This is perhaps one reason why Dr. Ariyasena U. Gamage, the former Chief Medical Officer of Mawanella, spent his savings on building Saradiel Village in Unthuwana on a six acre block land. Saradiel Village offers the public an opportunity to go back in time and observe how simple life was in this island. But concealed under this simplicity we can observe enough traces of mans desire to acquire wealth and power. And the quickest way to obtain this was to play in to the hands of betrayal. From the times of the kings up to the times of highwayman and gang leader Saradiel, most of the Sri Lankan heroes perished because there were those willing to betray. 
The story of Saradiel also depicts how human perspective can be contrasting like night and day. The Sinhala writers and historians look up to Saradiel not as a bandit, but as a folk hero. The little literature available about him reveals that he had the fortune to gather public support and sympathy. When at his peak Saradiels gang had 300-400 members. Its said that as many as 5000 people came to witness him being sent to the gallows. People mourned his death and asked The Gods above to save him when the authorities were preparing the gallows for Saradiels hanging.
But English literature about Saradiel sows seeds of scorn and hatred when referring to him. Another important fact that should be highlighted during the time of Saradiel was the harmony in which the Sinhalese and Muslims lived. During present times we saw how a leading monk tried to set the Sinhalese against the Muslims. It was heartening to see the monks efforts failing to bear fruit. Its with a lot of interest that this writer underscores the fact that Saradiels most trusted ally was a Muslim named Mammale Marikar, whose real name was Mohammed Lebbe. Those were times when the society practised both polygamy and polyandry. A woman named Thangamma, the wife of merchant Cadar, had an affair with Saradiel. Marikar was Thangammas brother. These statistics show that about a century ago Sinhalese and Muslims lived in harmony and even considered each others company for business dealings and human relationships. Saradiels romance with Thangamma is a classic examples of this. 
According to astrological calculations, Saradiels planetary positions indicated that he would be guided by wrong thoughts. He was born with debilitated planetary combination known as Kalasarpa Yoga(When all planets are trapped between Rahu and Kethu). Astrologers state that those born with this debilitated planetary combination will eventually have a failed life, even if they do enjoy a few successes. 
History reveals that Saradiel was very strong despite being small-made. He possessed many skills. He was known to be fleet-footed and athletic. He could even disguise himself as a woman. Above all he had a very sharp mind and could think his way out of trouble. Once he was captured. Those who had captured him had decided to break journey for the night. Saradiel had money in his possession and had bought liquor for his captors. The bandit had then slipped away when his captors were fully intoxicated! 
This sharpness of mind he maintained till the time he was captured. But what we got to hear about him after his capture makes us wonder whether his mind became clouded.
Literature related to Saradiel reveals that at the time of death he had converted to Christianity and even changed his name to Joseph. All this was due to the influence of a Christian priest. Critics can pose the argument that the Christian priest gave the bandit a new beginning in the way a person could view life. Had Saradiel realized some truth in life just before he died We know that Saradiel was a Buddhist. There is a statue at Saradiel Village which shows the bandit and his mother offering alms to a priest. This creation depicts the faith he had in Buddhism. But like all bandits, terrorists and murderers at the time of being captured Saradiel too seemed to have not been in his senses. Otherwise how could a person change two things which are so close to his heart like name and religion within the short period of a day
Saradiel is a folk hero to the villagers of Uthuwana despite the bandit having had 121 cases filed against him. People were moved to tears at the time of his death. This could be the last occasion in Sri Lankas recorded history that people in large numbers shed tears when a criminal was sent to the gallows. To be spoken about even a century later and have a village build in his name makes this writer express the sentiment; not bad for a bandit!  Many more unrecorded tit bits about Saradiel may surface as writers and historians continue to research and write about him. Like how Saradiel clasped his hands and told a large gathering of people who came to witness his execution, this writer too tells Saradiel fans, Adios, till we meet again.

JR paved the way to boost Asias clout: PM
	
Asia would not have become a powerful region today and would not emerge as a stronger one in the future if President J R Jayewardene did not open up Sri Lankas economy and set the course for the region to become what it is today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said this during a ceremony held last evening to commemorate the late President Jayewardenes 111th birth anniversary which fell on Sunday, September 17.
President Jayewardene began taking about opening the Sri Lankan economy when he was in the opposition before 1977. Many laughed at him. However he opened up the economy in November 1977 after coming into power in July in the same year. He set up free trade zones. A while later China sent a team to study the free trade zone concept and then set up such zones in China. India criticized Sri Lanka for opening up its economy in 1977 but they also did the same thing when Prime Minister Narasimha Rao assumed office. As a result of these decisions both India and China had become powerful today both economically and also in terms of military strength. Military in these countries are expanding. India is said to own 200 warships and China 300. They were able to become powerful and make the region powerful because of the economic development they had achieved. This economic development became possible because they opened up their economies following Sri Lanka. Therefore the Asian region would not have been powerful today if President Jayewardene did not decide on introducing an open economy policy, the Prime Minister said.
He added that President J R Jayewardene made all the decision in a bold manner. The Prime Minister said the late leader was able to construct reservoirs bigger than the ones constructed by the kings through the Mahaweli Project. Our country has been able to become self sufficient in paddy as a result of the Mahaweli project, he also said.
The family members of President Jayewardene, several ministers including Nimal Siripala de Silva, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and Opposition Leader R Sampanthan were present at the ceremony. (Yohan Perera)

The Local Government elections could only be held in January next year while the party leaders could decide on the Provincial Council polls later, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament today.
The Prime Minister, who made a statement in the House said Local Government elections could only be held January next year because of GCE Ordinary Level Examination, which would be held in mid-December and because of the budget.
He said the Ministry of education has requested that the polls should not be held in December this year.
UPFA MP and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa then raised a question as to when the Provincial Council elections could be held.
"You said Local Government elections will be held in January next year but we would like to know as to when the Government intends to hold the polls for Provincial Councils, whose terms end next month," Mr. Rajapaksa questioned.
He said that Elections Commission had said it would be possible to hold elections to these councils in December.
Prime Minister who responded said the issues of GCE Ordinary Level examination and the budget would pop-up for these elections as well.
"We will have to talk with the Polls Chief and political parties on this issue," the Prime Minister said.
Further the Prime Minister said the Local Government polls were delayed as there were many issues to be resolved.
"The previous Government had created wards, where there are not enough voters. These were done in order to get political mileage," he said.
The Premier said the Government would be able to bring in a new mixed electoral system for the local bodies based on a ward system.
"We have also been able to secure the minor parties and ensure a fair slot for women in all local bodies," he added.
The Prime Minister assured that the mixed electoral system would be extended to Provincial Councils and Parliamentary elections as well.
"All changes will be done with the consent of all parties," he also said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Little Johnny and New Charley feature in conversation between Aloysius and Palisena
	
At the onset of the todays proceedings, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleka played a new Voice recording, in which PTL CEO Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius were part of.
In this conversation, Kasun Palisena initially refers to some Little Johney and in the latter part they were discussing about getting the yield rate down of a particular bond maturity (2026). In this conversation, Palisena talks about an individual called New Charley.
When Palisena refers to New Charley, Aloysius does not seem to remember about that individual and at that moment Palisena says no no, this is Little Johnnys Narahenpita guy.
After this conversation was played, DSG Gunatilleke and the Commission repeatedly questioned Palisena as to who was he referring to.
This conversation took place on February 1, 2016
DSG Gunatilleke: Who is this New Charley
Witness Palisena: Can be someone from that point
DSG: It clearly says Narahenpita. So dont waste the time. Tell who is this person
Witness: This was some time back. So cannot recall exactly who that was.
DSG: It was very clear that you and Aloysius are talking about the 2026 bond and about some individuals. Your answer is deceitful. It is self evident from this conversation that Aloysius was aware about this Little Johnny and the others. So Im asking one final time, who is this Little Johnny Was it Kaveen Karunamurti (DFCC dealer) or Saman Kumara (EPF Dealer)
W: I dont know.
DSG: In this conversation you refer as this is Little Johnnys Narahenpita guy.
W: Yes
DSG: The ETF is there in the Narhenpita, right
W: Yes
DSG: Tell the truth at least now, and disclose the names of these people.
W: it could be anyone
DSG: I told you earlier that there is a limit to lying
At this point Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness about the conversation. It was revealed that Aloysius was keeping an eye on the PTLs activities regularly.
Justice Jayawardena: It is clear now that you and Aloysius were talking in that conversation to influence on the yield rate to manipulate the market, right
W: Yes
J: And you used Little Johnny to push the rate, and is this a common occurrence
Witness answer was negative
When Justice Jayawardena questioned as to why they used to talk with nick names. The witness said that they do not want it to be known by other counter parties.
Justice Jayawardena again asked the witness to reveal the names but the witness maintained his stance that he does not know.
Justice Jayawardena: In a previous conversation that you had with Aloysius on March 29, 2016, you said I got Little Johnnys bids
W: That was about clients bids which I was referring to.
Justice Jayawardena: Either way, it is clear now that you and Aloysius had colluded to bring down rates using Little Johnny and New Charley
W: Yes. But we were only talking about it.
Meanwhile, when Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne who was appearing on behalf of Arjun Aloysius was re-examining the witness, Justice Jayawardena said not to question about the matters relating to Aloysius other than the phone conversations because his client was given all the opportunity come before the Commission to present his case.

The leading politicians close relative, a dealer in building materials is the owner of a fleet of tipper trucks which are often seen speeding along roads with a callous disregard for traffic laws and the safety of other road-users. Traffic Police would turn a blind eye to the traffic offences being blatantly committed by these truck drivers.

Mahendran wanted letter from Ravi after he was asked to come before COPE in 2016
	
Initiating his testimony before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI), Former CBSL Governor Arjuna Mahendran yesterday said he had never talked with his son-in-law, Arjun Aloysius, or with anybody on matters with reference to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka while he was serving as the Governor.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing on behalf of Mr. Mahendran led the evidence of Arjuna Mahendran.
At the onset of Mr. Mahendrans testimony, it was explained that he had obtained academic qualifications with regard to the economics and finance from the Oxford University. He had also acquired more than thirty years of professional experience in different fields in the financial sector.
It was revealed that he had begun his professional career by joining the CBSL in 1982.
After the early 1990s, he had from time to time obtained considerable international experience in several leading commercial banks as an investment advisor. Between the time period 2001-2004, he had served as the Chairman of the Board of Investment (BOI).
After that, it was said, that he had served in a leading bank in Dubai as an investment advisor (wealth management) till 2014.
When Mr. De Silva led evidence from the witness, it was explained that he was asked to take up the CBSL Governors position on January 9, 2015.
It was said that his official appointment was given on January 23, 2015.
According to the witness, it was explained he had extended the open door policy to the officials in the CBSL when he first assumed duties as the Governor, so that anyone could come to him over any matter and also allowed him to go to any place with regard to official matters in the CBSL.
Mr. Mahendran said that when he was serving first the CBSL in the 1980s former Governers, Mr. Rasaputhram and Dr. Karunathilleke had also been in the practice of walking around the Department to look around.
He also explained the difference between the Public Auction system and the Private Placement Method (Direct Placement) used in raising governments funds by the CBSL.
He said when he assumed duties as the Governor; it was the Private Placement Method (PPM) which was dominating in raising funds.
According to Mahendran he was not in favor of PPM for many analytical reasons and had discussions with several Deputy Governors in this regard.
He was of the view that the Public Auction system is more suitable since it happens only between two parties where negotiations could happen outside any market prevailing norm and also to ensure more participants when raising money for the Government.
He said that in latter part of the January and in the beginning of the February, 2015, the Government was in need of funds.
According to the Mahendran, his advice on that occasion to the Government was to keep borrowing without suddenly stopping because it could lead to much chaos in the countrys economy.
He said that he was of the view at that time that more borrowings could be obtained from the private sector within the country to avoid an economic crisis since at that time the Government was paying 90% of its revenue for the payments on borrowings.
When questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, the witness said that he had discussed about these matters with the Government officials on January 22 and 23, 2015 including the PPM system which was used to raise money.
Mr. Mahendran said he raised the issue on the way in which the CBSL had previously managed the Governments debt at the time he assumed duties.
He was of the view that the CBSL was not managing Government debt properly at that time. Showing an example, he said there was a Sovereign bond repayment to be made on January 22, 2015 amounting to Rs. 500 million and the CBSL had no mechanism as how to pay it without losing the Foreign Reserves of the country, he said.
Mr. Mahendran also said that the CBSL had sustained a loss of Rs. 39 billion in year 2013 and 2014 and that was a shocking result.
He said with the newly appointed Government (in 2015), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe wanted transparency in the Government and thereby he also wanted to bring transparency into the CBSL.
He said therefore, he had examined the entire organizational structure and the line of command and the fault lines which had caused these losses to the CBSL with the assistance of the other Deputy Governors.
It was explained there were three Deputy Governors in the CBSL below the Governor.
Mr. Mahendran was also of the view that there was a conflict of interest in the structure of the CBSL as the EPF and the Public Debt Department was under the same Deputy Governor. So he wanted a change.
According to the witness he had introduced three new clusters to the CBSL re-allocating the subjects.
Policy Advisory - headed by Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe. This is the Cluster which contains domestic and international operations including the EPF.
Financial regulations and development of the financial activities in the country- headed by Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri. This is the cluster which contained PDD, banks and non- bank institutions.
Third cluster was Capacity Building, which relates to consumer protection and regulations aspects.
Mr. Mahendran was also of the view that he had to transfer several officials who had been serving more than five years at one particular section at the CBSL, because according to the CBSL law it was mandatory to do so.
Mr. Mahendran said that he made all of these changes only in good faith considering the losses that had been sustained by the CBSL over the years.
It was also said that there were Attorney Generals Department officials attached to the CBSL who were instructing on the legal matters relating to the CBSL.
The witness said that he had conveyed about these transfers to them but none of them said that these transfers were bad.
Going into the controversial February 27, 2015 auction, Mr. Mahendran explained his stance as to what happened prior to that auction and thereafter.
Mr. Mahendran said on February 23, 2015 he was told by the Secretary of the Treasury through telephone that there was a fund requirement of Rs. 13.5 billion by March 2, 2015.
He said on February 26, 2015 a meeting took place between himself, the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Minister Kabeer Hasheem and Advisor to the PM at that time Malik Samarawickrema.
At this meeting Mr. Mahendran was asked to raise urgent money for the Government within one month period amounting to Rs. 75 billion for the purpose of Road Development.
He also said that when he was asked to give evidence before the COPE in June, 2016 regarding the bond issue, he had requested on June 7, 2016 from the then Finance Minister to send a letter verifying holding of this meeting and about the discussions that had taken place. That letter was later received to the Governor referring those matters from the then Finance Minister.
He also said according to cash flow statements of the treasury the required funds for the Government for the month of March were amounting Rs. 172 billion.
He also said that the treasury had informed that there was a considerable short fall in January by CBSL in terms of meeting the Treasurys fund requirement.
According to Mahendran, it was in this backdrop that the February 27, 2015 auction was initially publicized as for only Rs. 1 billion.
He also said that he did not agree with the PDD officials for advertising such a low amount but the PDD officials were of the view that if they advertise more then the bidders would come up with higher rates and that could lead to an increase of the rates.
Eventhough he did not agree with them, he said he had given the benefit of the doubt to them and proceeded.
He also said that the PDD officials had only managed to obtain Rs. 3.4 billion using the Private Placement Method a week prior to February 27, 2015.
Mr. Mahendran said that on the February 26, 2015 morning he found out from some media reports about a fall in forward exchange rates and some other financial factors that could effect the market badly. Therefore, he had the idea of removal of the fiver percent penal rate.
He said he wanted to talk about this matter immediately with the Deputy Governor Dr. Weerasinghe at that time.
According to the witness, thereby he had visited a Market Operation Committee (MOC) meeting, which was chaired at that time by Dr. Weerasinghe.
He said he purely went there to meet Dr. Weerasinghe to talk about the urgent requirement. He said he was new at that time and walked into the room while that meeting was happening
It was also revealed that he had discussed with Dr Weerasinghe about the importance of the increase of the interest rate at that point by removing the penal rate.
However, this decision was contrary to the Monetary Board decision at that time therefore needed ratification.
Mr. Mahendran however had discussed with Deputy Governor Dr. Weerasinghe in this regard and the witness said that he was told by Dr. Weerasinghe that the ratification could be got from the Monetary Board at the next meeting.
It was also said that this decision to remove the penal rate was later ratified by the Monetary Board on March 6, 2015. It was also said that the decision was not argued about. Mr. Mahendran yesterday took the complete responsibility on taking such decision as it was very urgent.
Mr. Mahendran also explained as to why he went inside the PDD while the auction was happening on February 27, 2015.
He said he first went to the PDD at 11 a.m. in the morning to see the result of the bidding with his security person and then came to know that the auction was not concluded.
He said that he was told at that time that the auction would finish within an hour. Then he had left the floor and gone back again with two other Deputy Governors to see the result at about 12.15 pm.
He was of the view that it was his first auction and he also wanted to see it and the activities inside the PDD.
He said prior to him seeing the result of the auction he did not ask about the identity of the bidders.
He said that then he found out that there were bids amounting to Rs. 20 billion at the auction.
In the backdrop of the Governments huge fund requirement, he said that he wanted to accept the whole amount, but the PDD officials disagreed to that pointing out about some dummy bids and the some of the rates at which bids had placed.
However, after having a discussion with the PDD staff and the two Deputy Governors, the witness said that the PDD came to a conclusion to accept up to Rs. 10.05 billion in bids.
He said that thereafter, the PDD passed that recommendation to the Tender Board as the Tender Board would have to approve it. Finally it goes to the approval of the Governor.
He said he never directed the Tender Board (TB) to approve the amount or express his view of accepting Rs. 10.05 billion to the members of the TB.
Mr. Mahendran also contesting the methods used by the Auditor General in loss calculation said that it was highly erroneous since the two assumptions adopted in calculating such losses were not acceptable.
Mr. Mahendran said that he had nothing to do with the EPF and he had not engaged in any decision making of the EPF in it secondary market transactions; selling or purchase of bonds.
But he said he knew about the fact that the EPF was gaining profits through the secondary market transactions too from the reports submitted to the Monetary Board by the EPF. He said those reports also did not contain the counter parties that the EPF had engaged in their secondary market transactions.
He said that he had nothing to do with the decisions that had been taken in March 2016 auction (29 and 31). He said it was the Tender Board which took all the decisions and he did not alter them ultimately.
It was revealed that the Governor of the CBSL has the ultimate veto power to approve the Tender Board decision.
When Justice Jayawardena asked, whether he had ever changed TBs decisions, Mr. Mahendran said that there were several occasions that he had suggested a few recommendations before approval.
Mr. Mahendran yesterday also revealed those who attended his daughters wedding where she married Arjun Aloysius in 2012.
It was revealed that, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, Ravi Karunanayake, John Amaratunge, John Seneviratne, Nimal Siripala De Silva, Sajith Premadasa, Sagala Rathnayake, three sons of Mahinda Rajapakse, and some leading business individuals in the country were present at this wedding according the witness.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva who led the evidence was of the view that it was a well known fact that Mahendrans daughter had married Arjun Aloysius and it was not a secret.
Mr. De Silva was of the view that Arjun Aloysius obtained his Primary Dealer license in 2013 much prior to Mr. Mahendran assuming duties as the Governor of CBSL and it was also a well known fact.
He said when Mahendran was appointed as the Governor, everyone knew about the relationship of Aloysius and it was not an unknown fact.
It was also revealed that Mr. Mahendran had resided in his residence at Flower Road, during the period he served as the CBSL Governor. The residence was gifted to his daughter by him after her marriage.
It was revealed that at that time his daughter and her husband Aloysius were also residing at the same residence in which Mr. Mahendran lived.
When questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena it was revealed that Mr. Mahendran had not used his official residence given to a CBSL Governor. This he said was because the condition of the official residence which not suit him. He said there were damages to the carpets in the rooms and the furniture was basic.
However, Mr. Mahendran said despite him residing with his daughter and her husband Aloysius at the same residence while he was serving as the Governor, he had never talked with them at any point on matters relating to the CBSL (Shehan Chamika Silva)

New Zealand flights disrupted after oil pipeline bursts
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 18th SEPTEMBER, 2017 - Thousands of airline passengers faced cancelled flights and lengthy delays in the New Zealand city of Auckland on Monday after a burst oil pipeline triggered a shortage of jet fuel. 
Auckland Airport said 14 flights were cancelled, including one international flight, while Air New Zealand said about 2,000 customers would be affected after it cancelled seven flights in and out of the city.  The disruption was expected to last for about a week and airlines said they would look at refuelling in other cities domestically, or at Pacific and Australian airports to ensure long-haul services could continue.  As well as Air New Zealand, Qantas, Cathay Pacific and Emirates all said on their websites that some flights had been affected by the fuel shortage. 
The disruption followed a leak in a supply pipeline owned by New Zealand Refining Co Ltd that forced it to be closed for repairs. The pipeline was expected to be working at 70 percent of its full capacity by September 24-26, a spokesman said. 
The New Zealand government, which faces an election on Saturday, noted that the pipeline was privately owned and urged the parties involved to look at contingency plans to stop such incidents in the future.

Pakistans ruling party wins close parliamentary race
	

By Pamela Constable, Shaiq Hussain 
Voters in the longtime stronghold of Pakistans ruling party signaled they were looking for change Sunday, when the main opposition candidate did unexpectedly well although losing the race to fill the parliamentary seat of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. 
Sharif was ousted by the countrys Supreme Court in July after a legal battle over charges that he and his family had hidden their wealth in overseas real estate. His wife, Kulsoom Nawaz, hospitalized in London with lymphoma, won the race in absentia as the candidate from his Pakistan Muslim League-N party. 
But after a day marred by vote-rigging charges and physical clashes at polling stations, opposition candidate Yasmin Rashid, a medical doctor from the liberal Pakistan Movement for Justice, made a surprisingly strong showing, Returns showed the candidates running neck and neck all evening, but by 10 p.m., with all 220 polling stations counted, Nawaz had pulled ahead to defeat Rashid by about 13,000 votes. The final unofficial tally was 59,413 to 46,145. 
Still, many analysts said, the relatively close margin was in itself an astounding and historic upset. National Assembly Precinct 120 is a bellwether district whose voters have been among the Muslim Leagues most reliable supporters for a generation. Sharif has been elected prime minister three times.

6th Month Remembrance of Rukie Eheliyagoda (26.03.1926 - 19.03.2017)

God looked down on His creation 
Saw a life that was a godly celebration 
Held out His hand and invited her in 
The crown of life for her to win. 
She brought me happy days, day after day 
Though I willed it, she could not stay 
My need for her will never abate 
But heavens need was not for debate. 
Broken I whispered, God knows best 
As she entered Gods eternal rest 
Leaving behind a powerful legacy 
Following her footsteps wont be easy. 
When the setting sun paints the canvass of the sky 
With sweeping colours that enchant the eye 
Lingering golden memories in cascading poignancy 
Embrace me leaving me lonely. 
At her feet the valuable lessons learnt 
Keep me happy, wiser and unhurt 
No path in life is easy and straight 
Those words of wisdom reverberate. 
Until someday on that golden shore 
Together again forever more 
In Gods eternal home on high 
Never again a need to say goodbye. 
Forever my love

Tamil Idioms - coined to add humour and wisdom
	
While speaking to one of my non-Tamil speaking friends, I spiced my conversation with translations of Tamil idioms, similes and proverbs, which was thoroughly enjoyed by him. Following this, I was impelled to write on the topic, for the sake of keeping non-Tamil readers interested. 
Tamil idioms, similes and proverbs have plenty of rhymes and alliterations, which make them precise, beautiful and sometimes humorous. The precision and the beauty go off once they are translated, but the humour remains. They are used to keep the listener interested, or to support ones argument or advice and also to have the last say. 

As before, I would like to state that this article would be coloured by my own experience, as I feel that the best way of convincing the readers is to say that it happened to me, truth being stranger than fiction. 
When a person is clueless about what is happening around him, we say, He doesnt know whether it is dusk or dawn. A similar one is about a person who is a non-starter or utterly inefficient, he is said to be a person Who cannot open his mouth, if someone shuts his nose!If a non-entity of a person becomes important overnight, we say He would stretch an umbrella at midnight.
If a person is stubborn or inflexible or likes to hold on to his fallacious views, he is referred to as The rabbit I caught has only three legs, indicating his unwillingness to admit that it has only four legs or that the other person is right.

Another proverb related to the same theme, should not be misconstrued as an aspersion on the Burgher community. It is ,No matter how many times you tell him, a Burgher will never chew betel. This proverb also hints at heedlessness or unwillingness. Another related one is the simile, Like blowing a conch shell in a deaf mans ear.
If one has to wear a full sleeved shirt and a neck  tie only for one day, we say, It is like shaving the moustache for one nights drama. If a boss or a superior person commits a trivial offence and has the freedom to do it without being questioned by others, we say, It is not wrong for the temple, priest to break wind.This is always uttered as a joke. If you look around when youre yawning, you would find another person yawning! This is because yawning has been found to be contagious, we say, A girl who has attained puberty might go alone down the street, but a yawn will never.
If one person flatters another person or butters him up, he is aid to have been Kept on top of a Papaw tree. If a braggart talks big as if he is wealthy and yet goes about on foot, we say, His speech is palanquin, but thamby (Malli) goes walking!. If an unwanted or unpopular person comes uninvited we say like a bear that enters at a Lord Sivas pooja. 
From humorous one, we move on to words of wisdom or statements of facts. If you have to put up with a person who talks nonsense after drinking liquor, you could take consolation in the dictum A drunkards utterance is gone, once its morn. If your better half forgets to add salt to curry, then only you would realize the worth of salt. Similarly, once ones father dies only, one would realize what a worthy person he was. Another bit of adviceA shrunken waist is pretty on a woman.
Another statement of a fact, not known to the child is, If you give birth to a child, tie your stomach,which means one has to make a lot of sacrifices once a baby is born. If your little son doesnt have any understanding of the painful sacrifices you make, we say The mothers heart is crazy over the child but the childs is made of rock. This is, of course, an everyday occurrence in most families. Another word of wisdom, What you learn as a child, would remain on your mind like words carved on a tablet of stone Personally, the writer remembers a lot of things he was taught in the Primary School.
Troubles are said to come one after another. The writers one time neighbours had to bear three funerals, first the father then the mother, later the servant, and finally, the dog whom they looked after like their child. All that in a space of 6 months. But when good things happen one after the other, we say the fruit slipped into a bowl of milk.
The crow is looked upon as an unimpressive bird. We say even to a crow, its chick is worth gold. No matter how ugly a child is, it would be very precious to its mother. 
If the woman is vile or wicked and her husband is very much more so than the wife, we say If the woman jumps ten feet, the husband would jump 20 feet.
Similarly, there are thousands of idioms in Tamil, Sinhala and in several other languages, which were coined to add humour and wisdom in the day-to-day usage of the languages spoken around.

The late and  lamented
	
In Ajantha Ranasinghes lyrics there is a coming together of the literary and the romantic. This is nothing new, nor was it something Ranasinghe wrought; the truth is that he belonged to a tradition that bred Mahagamasekera and Premakeerthi de Alwis, Kularatne Ariyawansha, Sunil Ariyaratne, and Rathna Sri Wijesinghe. 
If there is a quality of freshness in the work of these men its not because they were radically experimenting with, or rebelling against, the accepted conventions of their day, but because they were able, within the confines of those literary conventions, to comment on the social systems they lived in from an individualist, relatable standpoint. The best love songs are those that relate to us the experiences of a single lover, after all, just as the best satirical songs are those that relate to us the misadventures of a misfit (think of Aron Mama, Handa Mama,Aluth Kalawak, all by Premakeerthi). Thats what their package was: their ability to root the social in the individual. And thats why their work continues to be enjoyed, even today. 

Ranasinghe belonged to this literary milieu. His death last year at the age of 75 was significant in that sense, since he was the last of his generation, a generation that would be followed by the more idiosyncratic Sunil Ariyaratne and Wijesinghe
Probably the best thing to happen to our poetry was the fact that these men were able to transcribe it to the three-minute song, and probably the best thing to happen to the three-minute song here was the availability of a rich poetic tradition it could take from. But the lyricists who were nourished by our poetry, like the first film composers in Hollywood who were influenced by the symphony (William Walton, Max Steiner, Camille Saint-Sans), didnt want to be inhibited by the classical; consequently, even in the choice of themes they went for, they often defied those conventions which had shaped them. Now to defy tradition you need to be steeped in tradition, which is what they understood all too well: they read, they wrote, many of them worked as journalists or broadcasters, before moving into music. They were all literary romantics, who never confused their abilities, their experiences, for their greatness.

Ajantha Ranasinghe


Ranasinghe belonged to this literary milieu. His death last year at the age of 75 was significant in that sense, since he was the last of his generation, a generation that would be followed by the more idiosyncratic Sunil Ariyaratne and Wijesinghe. This is not a tribute to him, however. This is a sketch, or rather an attempt thereat. 

He was born in Thalammahara in the Kurunegala District to a fairly middle class family. We revelled in the village and our childhoods, he remembered for me two years ago, adding, That was because we were schooled by our experiences, around where we lived. We were at one with our surroundings. In fact most of my songs owe their legitimacy, their feel of life, to those experiences and surroundings. He could have added, as he did, that the lack of such childhood experiences partly explains why most songs today seem to be un-moored, cut off, cast away. Todays generation are not fortunate, he observed, That is why they cant feel, they cant write. 

Ranasinghes most prodigious period was the 80s, just as Sekeras had been the 60s
Educated firstly at the local school at Pannala, again in Kurunegala, he was later sent to St Johns College, Nugegoda (where Sunil Ariyaratne studied as well) on account of his familys decision to have him schooled in English. Given the fidelity that artistes in general exhibit towards such institutions of learning I expected him to be thankful, to be nostalgic. He was thankful, yes, but not nostalgic. To be honest, I didnt come across our culture as much as I had in the game iskole. I am not finding fault with missionary schools, but the truth was that they were established to spread their faith and only then to embrace our way of life. That was why, apart from the Language and Literature periods, I didnt encounter Sinhala in Nugegoda. Perhaps for that reason, he left St. Johns after completing his GCE Ordinary Level Exams. 
Eventually he found himself among a group of like-minded lovers of literature and the arts led by Sunanda Mahendra. We would buy books, discuss them. We got to appreciate both Sri Lankan and world literature, and met every fortnight to talk, to debate. It was while purveying our language that I discovered the link between the written word and the articulate lyric. Because we found time to dabble in fruitful conversations over the arts, we knew what to write on and how to write on something. You just dont come across that kind of interest among youngsters today. Forget the fact that they arent interested: even if they did, they dont have the time! 
Ranasinghe began his career in the media, through Radio Ceylon,(The present Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation) where he joined the Lama Mandapaya programme, and through Lake House, where he started off as a cub reporter and moved up as a local news editor, a short story writer, and eventually a poet. While juggling his work and his interests, 1956 came and went, as the single most significant event to transpire in our cultural sphere in the 20th century. 
At Radio Ceylon, working under the formidable Karunaratne Abeysekera, Ranasinghe met one of his most frequent collaborators: H. R. Jothipala. Jothipala, who through his sister had heard of the man, wanted him to write a song. It was to be about his newborn daughter, he remembered, And it had to be, in his own words, the worlds most beautiful lullaby. Apparently Mohomad Salih was to direct and compose it, and I had to meet him. I felt helpless at the time. Forget writing what he wanted, how was I to capture and convey what he wanted me to feel, on his behalf Eventually, however, he accepted the challenge, went to Salih, talked with him, and came up with a song: Mage Wasanawan. It marked the first time the two had got together: they would get together, again and again, for much of what Jothipala is known and popular for today, the translated, sometimes transliterated, Bollywood melody. 

After Sekera and Amaradeva, I believe Ranasinghe and Khemadasa to have made up the most prolific lyricist-composer relationship to ferment our music
Perusing his subsequent career, I was struck by the names of two other collaborators: K. A. W. Perera (whose films introduced Ranasinghe to popular audiences) and Premasiri Khemadasa (who composed the music for them in the 70s). Ranasinghes first film song, Pokuru Pokuru Mal Sanakeli, in Pereras Wasana, would be followed by several others, as renowned: Mey Gee Eda from Janaka saha Manju; Manamalayi Manaharayi, Kanata Arungal, and Mata Asai Hinahenna from the phenomenally successful Hingana Kolla; and the quaint, almost unheard of Suba Gamane from Wathura Karaththaya. When Perera opted for Greshan Ananda in the 80s, he left Perera to follow the man who had composed all these hits. That is why, after Sekera and Amaradeva, I believe Ranasinghe and Khemadasa to have made up the most prolific lyricist-composer relationship to ferment our music. 
Consider the following sample: La Nil Lassana (T. M. Jayaratne); Sudu Rosa Malak (Jothipala and Malini Bulathsinhala); Rathu Rosa Pokurin,Wikasitha Pem, and Pemwathune (Amaradeva); Mage Lowata (Neela Wickramasinghe); Ra Hande Henakin (Amaradeva and Niranjala Balasuriya); and my personal favourite, Paloswaka Sanda (Amaradeva and Neela). Like the best poetry of Thomas Hardy and Sekera, these are punctured by the poignancy of expectation, the intermittent sorrow at the lack of fulfilment, and the final anguish of failed hopes:

Ranasinghes most prodigious period was the 80s, just as Sekeras had been the 60s. Here his earlier optimistic conception of love is superseded by a more philosophic, stoic outlook: the lovers in these songs do not have their dreams realised, but wait patiently for the day that they will be, even if takes a chance encounter:

That last song (Tharu Arundathi) was written after he saw a girl, unnamed and unknowable, across the street; he never got to know her, and neither does his narrator. Its experiences like this that colour his best songs, remembered as much today as what I consider to be the ultimate blend of young love and silliness in a Sinhala lyric, Sili Sili Seethala Alle, where hes the incurable romantic hed been earlier: 
<U+0DB8><U+0DD2><U+0DC4><U+0DD2><U+0DAF><U+0DD4><U+0DB8><U+0DCA> <U+0DC3><U+0DC5><U+0DD4><U+0DC0><U+0DDA> <U+0DAF><U+0DD0><U+0DC0><U+0DA7><U+0DD3> <U+0DB1><U+0DD0><U+0DC5><U+0DC0><U+0DD3> 
<U+0DBD><U+0DCF> <U+0DAF><U+0DC5><U+0DD4> <U+0DAD><U+0DDA> <U+0DB4><U+0DB3><U+0DD4><U+0DBB><U+0DDA> 
<U+0DC4><U+0DD2><U+0DB8><U+0DD2><U+0DAF><U+0DD2><U+0DBB><U+0DD2> <U+0DC3><U+0DD3><U+0DAD><U+0DBD> <U+0D9A><U+0DB3><U+0DD4><U+0D9A><U+0DBB><U+0DBA><U+0DDA>

In the 90s he moved on to other themes, more mundane, less personal.

The then and the contemporary Sinhala lyric has been expounded on so much by others that I wont bother dwelling on it beyond a few cursory reflections. The fact is, and this is something Ranasinghe accorded with when I pointed it out to him, that if during his time the lyricist was able to root the social in the personal, today we tend to dilute the social in the personal: manifestly different, manifestly deplorable. 
Without being either a puritan or a philistine, therefore, what I will say here is that the great ability of our greatest songwriters was in making us aware of the world around them, and us, through unnamed narrators, lovers, and aspirer. In Ajantha Ranasinghe we come across one such songwriter, who could speak for all our poignant, unrealised hopes in a way that no one, after him, could. Perhaps thats why his loss, reported rather scantily by our media, is truly and deeply a loss. We dont have anyone to follow him, and if we do, they are hidden away in other fields, other careers.

Travel in a backward area gives her a backache
	

A prominent woman politico who made an extensive inspection tour in a highly backward electorate recently is said to be undergoing herbal oil treatment for a severe backache.

The area the woman politico toured has been neglected by politicians and the administrative authorities concerned for decades and practically all the roads are badly broken up and dotted with yawning ruts and potholes. Despite riding a deluxe vehicle, the woman politico badly shaken up by its frequent jolts and jerks all along the way had developed a backache.
The woman politico who was confined to bed for one full day is now undergoing Ayurvedic treatment, they say.

Visas for Myanmar nationals, not for Rohingya refugees: SL
	
Rejecting reports that Sri Lanka had suspended on arrival visas for Myanmar travellers, the Department of Immigration and Emigration of Sri Lanka said today that it would continue to issue visas for Myanmar nationals as usual, but not for Rohingya refugees.
The Myanmar Times on Monday reported that Sri Lanka has suspended issuing visas on arrival for Myanmar travellers to stop Bengali people from Rakhine State entering the country.
According to the report, Sri Lanka had stopped issuing on arrival visas to prevent entry of Muslims from Rakhine State, who identify themselves as Rohingyas.
The Myanmar Government denied the term and referred to Rohingayas as Bengalis-illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.
Controller General of Department of Immigration and Emigration Nihal Ranasinghe told the Daily Mirror that the Department would not issue visas for Rohingya refugees as they did not have passports to enter a country, but would issue visas for Myanmar nationals who had valid passports.
Meanwhile, the Internal Affairs Ministry said the Sri Lankan Government had acted within the approved legal framework with regard to the situation that had developed in Myanmar and the Rohingya refugees.
In a press release, as the Ministry in charge of Immigration and EmigrationDepartment, it stated that in dealing with this matter, the Government never deviated from the prescribed procedures and would act under the previously approved procedures in future as well.
Numerous groups had expressed divergent views over the past few days with regard to the matter, the statement said.
A group of 55 Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar was rescued in mid sea by Sri Lankan Navy on March 3, 2008 and handed over to the UNHRC.All these refugees have left Sri Lanka in July 2012.
In February 2013,SL Navy had once again rescued refugees in the mid sea in two boats with one boat carrying 138 and the other with 32 refugees who were also handed over to the UNHRC. They left the island in November 2015, the statement said.
Thereafter on April 30, 2017 the Navy rescued near Sri Lanka as they did previously and rescued 30 Rohingyas including 17 children, seven women and a pregnant woman. They were handed over to the UNHRC as was done previously after completing court proceedings, it said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
