After wowing the world of sport with his incredible gesture to a young fan, New Zealand's Sonny Bill Williams has been rewarded by World Rugby with a new medal.
The All Blacks centre gave his Rugby World Cup winners medal to child who had burst onto the field after Saturday's win, sparking praise for the heart-warming moment of generosity.
And the game's governing body, not wanting the superstar to go without a memento for his achievements on the pitch because of his good-natured actions, have 'dug out a spare' to send home with him.
'World Rugby would like every winner this evening to go home with a medal, so they've rummaged in the store cupboard and they have found the final one,' said the event's host Alex Payne, before Williams was given a standing ovasion.
But the centre has played down the exceptional nature of the incident, saying it could have been any one of his team-mates. 'I'm really surprised, most of the boys would have done the same,' he said.
Williams was unaware he would be presented with a replacement medal but World Cup organisers acted following a request from the New Zealand players and management.
When on stage Williams also asked if team-mate Jerome Kaino would be given a new All Blacks beanie hat, with the flanker having given his to teenager Lines on Saturday night.
The sensational moment occurred when Charlie Lines, 15, burst on to the Twickenham pitch after the final whistle confirmed a 34-17 final victory over Australia in search of an autograph, but Williams made sure he left the ground with much more.
The 30-year-old centre, who was lauded for consoling deflated South Africa players after the semis, explained that he wanted to do something special for Lines.(Daily Mail)
