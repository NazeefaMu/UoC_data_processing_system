Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today requested all government school Principals not to send parents to him or to his secretary with requests for letters to admit their children to school.
He said this at a ceremony held at the Education Ministry, where each of the 140 schools, which had now started teaching Advanced Level Science Subjects was granted Rs.2 million. The funds will be utilized to build new laboratories and other equipment.
“The Education Ministry will not intervene in admitting students to grade one or grade five classes. Several Principals have sent parents to me asking for letters of recommendation. Please stop doing it because there is no way that I or the ministry will intervene in these matters,” the minister said.
The Principals were instructed by the Minister to follow the ministry’s circulars in every important decision they make with regard to the schools.
“The ministry allocates adequate funds for schools and therefore principals cannot collect money from the students for any purpose. They may collect a small amount for welfare but other than that they cannot collect money from students. During the last decade we noticed that nobody actually follow the circulars issued by the ministry. We will put all the circulars in place and take actions against those who violate any terms in those circulars,” Minister Kariyawasam said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
