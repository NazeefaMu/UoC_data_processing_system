The National STD/HIV Control Programme today said the number of HIV positive cases were on the rise with 2,241 HIV such patients and 21 AIDS related deaths reported in the country as at October this year.
Health Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala today warned that Chronic Kidney Diseases and HIV infections could become one of the biggest national health problems in the country before long if action is not taken to curb them.
Addressing the monthly progress review meeting of health institutions in the Hambantota District, Dr. Mahipala said 12,000 people were referred for HIV tests and 45 kidney patients were found this year alone from Hambantota.
He told the heads of healthcare institutions of the Hambantota District that Anugunakolapelessa had been identified a risk area for kidney diseases with 45 new cases detected this year.
"With proportionately a higher number of people turning up at the Hambantota District Hospital for HIV tests, we have also found that there has been a sharp rise in cases of Asthma and pneumonia in Hambantota. The Health Ministry will conduct a health survey to find the factors that have contributed to increase cases of HIV, CKD, Pneumonia and Asthma and determine whether there was any connection to fertilizer, pesticide or weedicide used by people in Hambantota as the majority are farmers. Special attention will be paid on the quality of drinking water in the district," Dr. Mahipala stressed.
He said the Health Ministry would provide all necessary human and material resources to Hambantota to keep non communicable diseases like kidney ailments and communicable diseases like HIV, Pneumonia and Asthma at bay in addition to disease control and prevention programmes that are in place.
The Hambantota, Tangalle and Walasmulla Hospitals will be expanded with more facilities and infrastructure to face these challenges. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
