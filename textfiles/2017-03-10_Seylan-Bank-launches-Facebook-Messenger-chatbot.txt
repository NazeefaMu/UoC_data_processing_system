Lauded as Sri Lanka’s most digitally engaging bank, Seylan Bank expanded its digital customer support services by introducing Seylan Messenger Bot – a chatbot that responds to customer queries via Facebook Messenger. 
The latest addition to the bank’s customer service channels helps provide real-time responses to basic banking and finance queries. The number of fans on its Facebook page increased to more than 500,000 fans during the year 2016 and launched a novel youth product Seylan Seylfie, which offers digital interest and banking on Facebook recently.
“At Seylan Bank, we have constantly worked to augment our customer support services and expand our footprint. This latest addition to our service portfolio is one of the many digital innovations the bank has introduced in the recent past. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are two fast-growing messaging applications used frequently by customers. 
As banking and finance institutions, we need to accommodate new technology and social media that will improve our customer engagement. As a growing number of services shift to the digital sphere, customers seek a bank that also evolves according to their preferences. By branching out to a platform used daily by customers, we enable ease of access and convenience for our customers,” commented Director/CEO Kapila Ariyaratne. 
Apart from Seylan Messenger Bot, Seylan Bank also previously launched social media-based customer support channels via WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger in order to facilitate seamless interaction and customer support while customers are on the go and through their handheld devices. The bank will complete its 29th anniversary in March and has embarked on a growth drive to expand and develop its services and consolidate its position as one of the leading banks in the country.
