NEW DELHI AFP Feb9, 2017  - A 42-year-old woman had a painful crawling sensation behind her eyes when she woke up and was rushed to a local clinic where her nose was flushed and she was sent home.   


As the sensation didn’t subside, a specialist explored her nasal passages with an endoscope and she learned the awful truth.

  
 “I saw some tiny legs moving inside,” M.N. Shankar, an ENT specialist, told AFP on Wednesday.   
 “I looked further in and almost 5 cm from the tip of the nose I saw something unusual.   


 “I realised I was actually looking at the bottom of a cockroach.” The invasive critter had burrowed deep inside her nose, almost to the base of the skull, and was still alive after roughly 12 hours, Shankar added.   


Using an instrument akin to a vacuum cleaner, Shankar managed to extract the cockroach from her skull intact -- still alive and kicking.
