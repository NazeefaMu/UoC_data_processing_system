Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said since President Maithripala Sirisena visited the top floor of Pohottuwa (The Lotus Tower), he may also join with the Pohottuwa Party.

Speaking to journalists outside the Welikada Prison after visiting former MP Sarana Gunawardane, Mr. Rajapaksa said Pohottu would bloom all over the island in the near future apart from the Lotus Tower in Colombo.

"The President will also come to our Pohottuwa as things proceed,” he said.

However, he said though they formed a new party called Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), they were still members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)

“We have created a party and are in the process of creating an alliance to contest at elections,” he said.

When asked about the statements made by Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka over war crimes, Mr. Rajapaksa said only a lost candidate should respond to another lost candidate.

He also said there was no need of a No-Confidence Motion against Minister Fonseka as he was someone who was not elected to Parliament.

“I don’t think anyone will bring in a No-Confidence Motion against someone who came to Parliament out of luck and not by votes,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
