The conduct of some parliamentarians stooped down to such low levels today that, for the first time in history, there were allegations that some UNP MPs smuggled in sharp knives into the Chamber of the House for any untoward action.

The photos went viral in the internet and social media showing UNP MP Palitha Thewarapperuma brandishing a knife in an apparent brawl with UPFA MP Prasanna Ranaweera behind the Speaker’s Chair during commotion in the House.

UPFA MPs Johnston Fernando and Mahindananda Aluthgamage were seen trying to stop him from attempts to strike Mr. Ranaweeera who was also behaving menacingly.

Government MP Jayantha Samaraweerra also charged that MP Palitha Thewarapperuma had a knife which he pointed at the government MPs.

Highways and Road Development Minister S.B.Dissanayaka told reporters at his Ministry that he was disgusted, disappointed and ashamed of what happened in Parliament.

"They should not have behaved in this manner and degrade themselves. Some of them behaved like cats and dogs. There was blood letting as two Deputy Ministers had smuggled knives to the House,” he charged.

All Members of Parliament must be determined to safeguard parliamentary tradition decorum and discipline in and out of the House, he added.  (By Kelum Bandara, Sandun A Jayasekera and Yohan Perera)
