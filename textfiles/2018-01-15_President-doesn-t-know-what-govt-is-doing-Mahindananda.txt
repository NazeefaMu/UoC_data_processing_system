President Maithripala Sirisena’s utterance on cancelling the Gazette notifications issued on permission of selling liquor to females and the time extensions on liquor shops, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage today said President Sirisena was unaware of what Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government was doing.

Addressing the media, he said it was astonishing as President Sirisena had not been consulted by both the Premier and the Finance Minister before the relevant Gazette notification was issued.

“It seems that the government headed by the PM is running the country without the recommendation of the Head of the State, President Maithripala Sirisena. Then, can we call this government as Good Governance? The government has been filled with chaos and disagreements right throughout its mandate since 2015,” Aluthgamage said.

Meanwhile, he proceeded to say that the only thing that the incumbent government had been good at is to sell public properties of the country to foreign countries and to the private sector. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
