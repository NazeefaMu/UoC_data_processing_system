The police arrested the driver and his assistant and the bowser and a lorry that transported kerosene taken into custody. It was also revealed that this bowser being used by the LIOC to transport fuel.

When contacted, Mr. Maharoof denied any connection with this racket and that he was unable to contact the driver or his assistant. He insisted that a complain be lodged.
