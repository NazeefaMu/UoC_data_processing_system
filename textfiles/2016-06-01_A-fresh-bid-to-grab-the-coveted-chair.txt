The election of the chair of the body controlling the gentlemen’s game is now a thing of the past. But indications are that some people who made an unsuccessful bid to grab the chair have not given up their cherished desire. 

 


Now they have hit upon a plan to create a situation where the incumbent will have to give up the chair by elevating the latter to the top table level. The Big Boss, falling in line with the plan by the scheming ambitious ones has already offered the incumbent a seat at the top table. Barkiss is, of course, willing, but he is said to be choosey about the subject he is to handle, they say.


The ambitious ones are looking forward to a cake walk to the chair to be vacated in the possible scenario. However, legal eagles have pointed out that a re-election should be held in case the current chair falls vacant.


The plan to acquire the coveted chair is being vigorously pursued notwithstanding the turns and twists it is taking, they say.
