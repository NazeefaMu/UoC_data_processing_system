Number One in yahapalanaya recently opened a sprawling garden featuring a children’s park, a fitness centre and a walking path among a host of other facilities set up on a city suburb. 

 


The top team member who took the initiative to lay out this garden has claimed that it cost the exchequer Rs.306 million. However, villagers in the area say the real total cost should be much less than this figure. 
Villagers also claim that in the process of laying out the garden, the drain system of the expressway running alongside the garden was badly damaged. They say that they propose to raise some questions with high political authorities in a bid to expose some ‘affairs’ related to the garden project.
