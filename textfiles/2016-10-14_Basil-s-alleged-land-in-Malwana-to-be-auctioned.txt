The Court today ordered to auction the 16 acres of land in Mapitigama, Malwana that was alleged to have been owned by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa.

Pugoda Magistrate and Additional District Judge D. A. Ruwanpathirana delivered the verdict on the case filed by the FCID against former minister, under the Money Laundering Act.

Mr. Rajapaksa was earlier arrested over his alleged purchasing of the land for Rs. 64 million and building a house on this land by spending Rs. 125 million.  

Mr. Rajapaksa had rejected ownership neither to the land nor the house. (Upali Ranaweera)
