State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera yesterday vehemently denied that his personal security officer had encashed a cheque received from Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius.

This allegation was made by Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage earlier in Parliament last afternoon. “ I have not had any telephone conversations with Aloysius, had not taken any money from him. I hardly know the Perpetual Treasuries Chief,” State Minister Perera said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
