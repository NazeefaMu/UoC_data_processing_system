Two enjoining orders have been obtained by the police today, restricting the protest organized by Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF).
The protest which demands privatization in the education sector be halted is to begin at the Sri Jayewardenepura University today.
Mirihana police obtained an enjoining order from the Nugegoda Magistrate, requesting the organizers of the protest to act in a manner that would not disrupt the public or cause traffic congestions.
Meanwhile, the Thalangama Police ha also obtained an enjoining order from the Kaduwela Magistrate preventing the protestors from entering the Parliament Road and surrounding area which is a high security zone.
However, IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara speaking to the Daily Mirror said that they would not be discouraged by the enjoining orders and would try not to disrupt the public during their protest.
University students from across the island and HNDA students are to participate in the protest campaign, the IUSF said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
