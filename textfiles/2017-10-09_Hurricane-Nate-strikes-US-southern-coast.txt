Hurricane Nate slammed into the US Gulf Coast for the second time in hours early Sunday after leaving a trail of death and destruction in Central America.   


Officials urged residents to evacuate some vulnerable areas before the storm first made landfall on the southeastern tip of Louisiana on Saturday evening, and residents scrambled to make last-minute preparations ahead of the third hurricane to hit the region in less than two months.    Around 1:30 am (0530 GMT), the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Nate struck again about five miles (eight kilometers) west of Biloxi, Mississippi, where storm surges caused sea levels to rise dramatically.
