It is mandatory for factories to use generators from tomorrow because of the prevailing dry weather resulting in a power shortage, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry announced today.

Media Spokesman Pathum Pasqual said morethan 250 private power-suppliers have registered with the ministry and are able to supply some 500 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.

He said ministry has agreed to pay Rs.36 for a unit of electricity with the generators being used from 7.00 am to 5.00 pm.

Mr. Pasqual said this would continue until the dry weather eases. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
