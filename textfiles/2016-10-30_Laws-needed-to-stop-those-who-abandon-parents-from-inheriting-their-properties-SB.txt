Laws should be introduced to confiscate the properties of persons who abandon their parents or put them into elders homes just so that they could claim ownership of their properties for themselves, Social Service and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said today.


He said there had been many instances reported to the ministry in which relatives claim the properties which belonged to their parents or grandparents who die while they are living in elders’ homes.
