Subject is too important for him to listen to family members!

 


A purohita in yahapalanaya hailing from the Colombo district is getting ready to take wings to the land of kangaroos to undertake an in-depth study of the subject of co-existence in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society as it obtains in practice in that country. He also had decided that he should have secretarial assistance if he were to successfully carry out the proposed study. This has thrown open a window of a wonderful opportunity for his fair and lovely personal secretary to do an extensive tour in that foreign land at public expense.  Meanwhile, the highly disconcerted wife and other family members are reportedly making every effort possible to block the politico’s study tour. However, given the importance of the subject of co-existence, the politico may shortly leave for the land of kangaroos with the comely secretary in tow, they say.
