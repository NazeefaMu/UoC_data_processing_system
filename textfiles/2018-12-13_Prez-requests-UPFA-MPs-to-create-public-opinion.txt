Prez requests UPFA MPs to create public opinion


	

President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have asked for creation of public opinion on the conduct of a referendum on dissolution of Parliament, in case the Supreme Court rules out.

At the meetings of the parliamentary group of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that a referendum would be appropriate at this time to seek public opinion on the dissolution of Parliament.

The President, however, did not commit to call for a referendum. Instead, he asked these MPs to create public opinion in this regard.

According to the Constitution, the President has the power to refer any matter of national importance, in his opinion, to people by referendum. However, the verdict of people at a referendum is not legally binding. (Kelum Bandara)
