MYTH: Eating fish while pregnant can make your baby intelligent.  

BUSTED: “There is such a belief that exists. And it has been proved that the fish can improve the brain development of the child in the womb. Eating small fish is recommended. There are some amino acids that are present which contribute to brain development.

But you have to be careful with the type of fish you get. There are some fish with a high content of heavy metals, such as mercury. A good example for this is deep sea fish. But in Sri Lanka it isn’t very common,” said Dr. U.D.P Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/ Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital.
