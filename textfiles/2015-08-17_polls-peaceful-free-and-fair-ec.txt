While claiming that the Elections Department faced a huge challenge while carrying out duties in the run up to the General Elections as there were only 35 days to prepare for it, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya today said overall the election was concluded in a peaceful, free and fair manner.
He said except for a few incidents on violating election laws, there were no major or serious incidents reported during the past 48 hours.
“We have received only 226 complaints on minor incidents. All stakeholders of the election including the voters, candidates and officials seemed more aware, than before, that no one is above the law and acted in such a manner. However, we request the people to maintain the peaceful situation even during the post election period respecting each other. People should celebrate victory without harming those who have been defeated,” he said.
Mr. Deshapriya said he hoped that there would be no requirement to declare votes as null and void at any polling station. However, he said the counting of votes could be affected if the adverse weather condition continued. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
