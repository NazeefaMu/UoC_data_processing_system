A lift given to a school-girl by a three-wheeler driver had landed him in a whole lot of trouble with her cousin and three of his pals.

The girl, who was approaching the main road from a side road was accosted by the three-wheel driver who asked if she was going to the main road. When she replied in the affirmative, he told her to get in as he was going that way. Upon getting in the 3-wheel driver began to question her about school, her home address etc. She had given him all the information he asked for. After they reached the main road she had got down and thanked him for his kindness in offering her a lift. He had reciprocated by giving her his phone number and took off after giving her a sign for her to call him.

Meanwhile, her cousin had got to know of the fact that a three-wheeler driver had offered her a lift and he had managed to get his hands on the paper with the phone number written on it. He had decided to teach this Romeo a good lesson and had hatched a plot with three of his friends to confront the man and take his revenge. He along with his friends had sent an SMS to the three-wheel driver pretending that it was sent by his cousin explaining that she wanted to meet him and naming the place where they could meet.

The 3-wheel driver swallowed the bait and arrived at the meeting spot only to be confronted by the girl's cousin and his three friends who beat him unmercifully, breaking one of his teeth in the process.

They were arrested by the Bandaragama Police.(B. S. Jayasinghe)
