The Minneriya National Park has been temporarily closed following a tense situation between villagers and forest rangers yesterday.

Minneriya Police said that angry villagers had vandalized the office of the Wild life officers demanding the release of a fisherman who was taken into custody by rangers while he was fishing at the Minneriya tank.

At least three wild life officers were injured during the clash and were admitted to the Habarana Hospital.

A source told the Daily Mirror that an investigation has been launched into the incident, while another confirmed that special discussions were underway amongst the high ranking officers of the Department.

Minneriya is one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) declared as a wildlife sanctuary in 1938. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
