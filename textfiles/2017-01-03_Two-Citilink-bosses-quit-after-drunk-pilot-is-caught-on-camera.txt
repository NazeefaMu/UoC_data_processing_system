Two Citilink bosses quit after 'drunk' pilot is caught on camera


	

Two Indonesian budget airline bosses have quit after video emerged of a pilot allegedly showing up to fly a plane while drunk.

Footage showed captain Tekad Purna, a pilot for Citilink, appearing to stagger through a metal detector at a security checkpoint at Surabaya airport in Indonesia.

The pilot repeatedly drops his belongings onto the floor, prompting security guards to pick them up.

He is believed to have made it onto the plane, which had 154 passengers, before passengers became suspicious when they allegedly heard slurred words and unclear announcements from the cockpit.

Some left the plane and asked for a replacement of the pilot, who they believed to be either drunk or under the influence of drugs.

Citilink assigned a new pilot to fly the Airbus A320 about an hour behind schedule.

One passenger posted a video of the announcement online.
Mr Purna has not responded to the allegations.

Citilink President Director Albert Burhan announced that he and the airline’s production director would resign over the controversy.

“The pilot had committed serious violation of standard operation procedure that endangered passengers,” Mr Burhan said.

“We apologise for the discomfort. I have to be responsible for that and therefore I and my production director resign.”

Citilink, a subsidiary of national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, previously dismissed reports the 32-year-old pilot was drunk, saying initial tests of drug and alcohol were negative.  

On Friday, the airline announced it had sacked Tekad.

He is said to have undergone medical tests at a clinic in Surabaya, East Java, as well as a second test in Jakarta, The Jakarta Post reports.

The results of the medical checkups will be released next week.

In December last year, three crew members, a pilot and two flight attendants, were arrested for allegedly consuming crystal methamphetamine, known locally as shabu-shabu, at a hotel. (independent.co.uk)
