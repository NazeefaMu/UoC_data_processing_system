Life and times of Most Venerable Migettuwatte Sri Gunananda Thera

By the mid-nineteenth century, our Motherland was actually in dire straits. Imperial forces were acutely engaged in bringing down the Sinhala Buddhist way of life and instilling instead, a new Western-biased culture.
However, by the time, a group of leaders well aware of the impending peril was also rising to the fore from the ranks of the clergy as well as the laity, intent on a Buddhist revival. The Most Venerable Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera was one of the foremost and most vigorous among them in evoking such a Buddhist Renaissance.
Born on the 09th of February 1883, to a Christian family in Migettuwatte (also known as Mohottiwatte), he was named as Miguel Mendis Silva by his parents, Ladduwatte Naide and Kaludura Maldo Silva. They wished to make out of young Miguel, who was faring very well in his studies, a Christian Priest. Though that was their ambition, Miguel was fortunate enough to be allowed fraternising with those in the village Buddhist temple. Thus, he studied Christianity in the Church while he learnt about Buddhism in the Temple. But as time passed, young Miguel became increasingly interested in Buddhism. As youth of 20 years, he witnessed an act of Buddhist worship at the Dodanduwe Gala Uda Vihara that was also known as the Kumara Maha Vihara. He found the proceedings so interesting that he stayed at the vihara for several days and took part in the ritual. The 20 year old young man was so enthralled with what he saw in Buddhism, that he became ordained as a novice Buddhist monk under the tutelage of Ven. Thelikada Sonuththara Thera.
But in the meanwhile, it was indeed a very distressing time for the Motherland. Buddhists were being persecuted by the Christians. Almost all high ranking government officials were working for their selfish ends. Under duress from these officials, some Buddhist laymen even feared to admit to their religion or values. Buddhist monks could not walk freely in the streets of Colombo. Those Sinhalese who were rewarded in rank and title by the Colonial government plotted in many ways to destroy Buddhism. They set about organising various debates to denigrate Buddhism as a religion.
In this context, Ven. Gunananda Thera, who had the fortune of studying both Buddhism and Christianity and realising the truth about the former, resolved to engage in these debates. With that intention in mind, the Venerable Thera came to reside in the Deepaduththarama in Kotahena, Colombo. At this time, Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera had also come to Colombo with whom Ven. Gunananda Thera had the good fortune of acquainting. The relationship that developed over time resulted in Ven. Gunananda Thera’s knowledge in the Dhamma rising to new levels, and he resorted to taking part in a number of debates against Christian challengers, in several places.
It is now an established fact by historians that Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera participated in more than 4000 such debates against his Christian opponents. This was in addition to the innumerable leaflets and other literature that were distributed for the same worthy cause. Among these debates that the Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera engaged in, 05 contests stand out in importance. In 1865 he took part in a debate at Waragoda, on 08th February 1865 at Baddegama, 01st February 1866 at Udammita and on the 09th of June 1871 at Gampola. But the most outstanding of these debates was the now world famous Great Debate of Panadura (Panadurawadaya) held in the namesake town on the 26th and 28th of August 1873.
This debate was not by any means merely another event in the Sri Lankan Buddhist’s calendar, but rather one that turned the Sri Lankan Buddhist’s way of life in a new direction. The Great Debate of Panadura ended by bringing in new vigour to the Buddhists and upholding their dignity lost so far. The spectators were made abundantly clear of the value of Buddhism paving the way for their misguided scepticisms to be swept away completely. They were elated with the truth that dawned on them. The news about the Buddhist victory, about Buddhism as a religion and on the truth that was now uncovered, spread far and wide across the world. At the end of the Debate, the honorary name of ‘Vadhibasingha’ was conferred on the Most Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera by the people.
Reports on this debate spread across the international arena in a multitude of foreign languages. It was especially coveted among the great leaders of the West who were on a mission to seek the truth about life; it was plain and simple for them to see from these reports that they had in fact found the answer to their quest. They entered into regular correspondence with the Venerable Thera and were increasingly convinced about the veracity of Buddhism. Many of them opted to pay a visit to Sri Lanka; among them Col. Henry Steele Olcott, Leadbeater, Bennet, and Madam Blavatsky and Madam Marie Musaeus Higgins were most eminent.
Col. Henry Steele Olcott who arrived in Sri Lanka was especially instrumental in the Buddhist revival. He instituted the Buddhist Theosophical Society and contributed immensely to the restoration of Buddhist education. It is most noteworthy that this great Buddhist leader came to Sri Lanka because of the Great Debate of Panadura led by the Most Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera. The Thera also rendered a yeoman service to Buddhist education by founding the Maligakanda Vidyodaya Pirivena together with the Most Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera. We are today left with the pristine Buddhist educational institutions such as Ananda College, Dharmaraja College – Kandy and Mahinda College – Galle due to the untiring efforts of these enterprising members of the Sangha and the laity.
The Most Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera passed away on 21st September 1890 after an unrelenting 50 years of service to the Buddha Sasana in which the Thera pioneered the Buddhist Renaissance and liberated the Sinhala Buddhists from the woes they so far experienced. The 125th Commemoration of the Most Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera falls on the 21st of September this year. The lessons we can learn from the life of this exemplary Buddhist monk leader who rendered so great a service to this country, kindred and Buddhism is beyond compare. Let us firmly resolve ourselves to discharge our duties towards this country, kindred and Buddhism in the same manner, whilst living our lives as wholesomely as possible.
