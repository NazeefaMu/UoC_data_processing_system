Backbenchers of the UNP are urging Minister Navin Dissanayake to step down from his ministerial portfolio and accept the post of party General Secretary.

The move came after Mr. Dissanayake obtained the highest number of votes during the appointment of members to the UNP politburo.

The voting took place among the UNP parliamentary group members at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees. (Anjula Maheeka Weeraratne)
