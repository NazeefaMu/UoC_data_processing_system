Over the last two years, Start Path has worked with over 90 companies across 24 countries. Notably Mastercard is currently running active pilots with or has directly invested innearly20 percent of the companies.

We have put in place different mechanisms including pilots with Mastercard business lines, access to our APIs, and connectivity to our customer base and partner networks.”
