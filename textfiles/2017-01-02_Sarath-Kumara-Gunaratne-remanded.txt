Former deputy minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, arrested by the CID on charges of misappropriating Rs.12 million belonging the Negombo Fisheries Harbour Corporation, was today remanded till January 9 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Bandara.

The CID had produced four suspects in court on the instructions of the Attorney General and that Mr. Gunaratne was the fifth suspect arrested in connection with the allegations with one more to be taken into custody.

Counsel Sampath Mendis appearing for Mr. Gunaratne requested bail for his client under exceptional circumstances considering the health condition of the suspect and his wife.

He said the report filed in court by the CID was erroneous and bad in law on the basis that the offence committed by the suspect had not been clearly stated.

The Chief Magistrate fixed the case for January 9 to consider bail for the suspect.

Earlier, four suspects -- former chairman Upali Chaminda, accountant Lakmini Munidasa, deputy general manager Piyal Abeysekera and deputy general manager Chaminda Palpita were released on bail under exceptional circumstances. (Shehan Chamika)
