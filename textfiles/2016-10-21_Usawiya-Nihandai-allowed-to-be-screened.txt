'Usawiya Nihandai' allowed to be screened


	

Colombo District Court Judge M.U. Gunawardena today decided not to extend the enjoining order imposed on the film ' Usawiya Nihandai' which prevented it from being screened in the country.

Considering the submissions made, the court lifted the enjoining order.

The case is to be taken up again on January 19, 2017.

Former District Court Judge Lenin Ratnayake, the complainant in the case, had earlier filed a petition in the Colombo District Court seeking an enjoining order restraining the film from being screened.

He had informed court in the petition that there was another defamation case pending in court pertaining to a television programme that aired in 1999 in connection with the same subject matter. Therefore, filming a story relating to the same content could influence the decision in that case and his reputation. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
