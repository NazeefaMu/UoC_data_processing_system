Turkish ministers have been forced out of Holland sparking mass riots on the streets of Rotterdam as protesters and police became embroiled in violent clashes. Many of those protesting were Turkish nationals living in the Netherlands. Water cannon were fired at demonstrators in an attempt to control the crowds who were seen to be kicking police officers on the ground as well as throwing stones and metal railings.   


The ugly scenes were in reaction to two Turkish ministers being blocked from entering the country by officials, which prompted Tayyip Erdogan to label the Dutch ‘Nazi remnants and fascists’.   


Thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam demanding action after the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was denied entry into the country.   


Turkey’s families minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, was also blocked by Dutch police from entering the consulate and escorted to the town of Nijmegen, near German border.   
Both have since been escorted out of Holland.
