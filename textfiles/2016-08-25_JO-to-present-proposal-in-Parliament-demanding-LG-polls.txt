JO to present proposal in Parliament demanding LG polls


	

The Joint Opposition would today present a proposal in Parliament demanding immediate local government elections, which has been already delayed by one year and three months, the Joint Opposition said yesterday.

Addressing a media briefing, Joint Opposition member MP Bandula Gunawardane said the Government’s motive behind the postponing of the local government elections, was an attempt to grab hold of the democratic rights of the public.

“Therefore, we will present a proposal, which stresses the House to hold the local government elections in a democratic way,” he added.

Joint Opposition member Prof. G.L. Peiris said the related authorities had no concern of holding the local government elections and they had even not hinted at a time either.

Meanwhile, he said the rulers of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) were in an intentional mission to destroy the party and it was evident from the removal of strong personalities from organiser posts.
“The removal of such personalities is in favour of the United National Party (UNP) and it will help the UNP to be victorious in the upcoming elections,” he added.

He said the Government’s actions were completely against the people’s will and the Prime Minister was in a mission to take the government completely to his hands.

Joint Opposition member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the policies of the UNP were against the ones of the SLFP and it was the reason for them to represent the Joint Opposition.

He also said the remaining SLFP organisers of the Joint Opposition would be removed from their posts even tomorrow.

“No matter what, we will never take a part in a UNP Government,” he added.

He said the Prime Minister had stated in the COPE meeting that 75 percent of the harbour would be privatised and such decisions would also lead the country to a major crisis.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)
