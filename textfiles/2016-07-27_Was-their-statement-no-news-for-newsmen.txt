Was their statement no news for newsmen?


	



A member of the former royal family was ordered into remand custody quite recently.  The JO group also attended the hearing of this case. When the group walked out of the court house it occurred to them that this was an ideal occasion to make a hard-hitting statement against the government. They waited for media personnel to approach them, but the latter ignored their presence.


Johnny from Kurunegala realizing that it was a case of the mountain having to go to Muhammed walked up to the news guys and addressed them: “Mallila, we wish to give a statement to the media about this case of injustice.” However, newsmen paid no heed to his request.  When Johnny repeated his request, they said: “Sorry. Not now. We have to make a dash to cover another event.” And they hurried away while Johnny helplessly looked on.
