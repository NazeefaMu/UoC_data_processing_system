The national ceremony to enshrine treasures and relics on the main dam of the 'Kalu Ganga Reservoir’ of the ‘Moragahakanda – Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Development Project’ (MKMDP) was held a short while ago with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena.

The Rs.61,321.7 million mega development project, second only to the Victoria Dam, and the Hydro Power Project are expected to provide water for irrigation and drinking in seven districts. The Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga project will also generate 25 MW of power, to meet a long felt need for domestic and industrial electricity in the North-Central, Northern and Eastern Provinces.

The foundation stone of the MKMDP was laid by Mr. Sirisena in 2007 when he was the Minister of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Services Development.

The Moragahakanda - Kalu Ganga Development Project was first discussed in 1955 and again in 1977 when the Mahaweli Projects were being implemented. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
