Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka today denied media reports that he had requested President Maithripala Sirisena to assign the Government Printing Department, State Printing Corporation and the National Film Corporation to his new ministry of Land and Parliamentary Reforms.

He told Parliament that he had never requested for any post and added that he had not even met the President after he was assigned the new portfolio.

Minister Karunathilaka said he had not asked for the post of Chief Government Whip, Media Ministry or the Land Ministry even though he was given those positions. "I have no mental illness to request the Film Corporation which has no relevance to the Land Ministry. I have been given a good ministry. Why should I request for more institutions?," he said.
