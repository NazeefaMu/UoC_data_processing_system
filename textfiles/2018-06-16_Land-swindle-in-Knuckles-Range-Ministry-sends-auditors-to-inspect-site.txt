The Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Ministry has sent a team of auditors to inquire into the alleged transfer of 21,000 acres of land in the Knuckles Mountain Range to close associates of government ministers, Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana told Daily Mirror.

He said the auditors were accompanied by officials of the Department of Forest Conservation, Grama Niladharis, Superintendents and officials of the related companies and residents of the area.

“The auditors visited inspected the area on Thursday. The ministry will receive a report on their return next week. The team has reached the site with the coordination of Global Positioning System (GPS),” Mr. Hewavitharana said.

Earlier, the Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform (MONLAR) claimed that these lands which were managed by State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantation Limited had been given to close associates and relatives of two powerful ministers.

MONLAR member and environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara said 6,192 of the 9,675 hectares belonged to the State Plantations Corporation and 2,363 of the 3,693 hectares belonged to Elkaduwa Plantation Limited. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
