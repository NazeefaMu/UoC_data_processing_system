	Colombo Chief Magistrate today ordered the Financial Crime Investigation Division to report whether the former Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake was a suspect or not over the alleged stealing of movable properties in a valuable residence in Colombo 7, which was a gift to the Colombo University by an eminent Gyneacologist.
	Appearing for Minister S.B. Dissanayake, Counsel K.V. Thavarasa and Kelum Ubeysekara sought the Magistrate to direct CID to disclose the suspects in the incident, since there was an attempt to tarnish former Minister Dissanayake’s reputation by spreading rumours through media against him.
	The CID told Magistrate that former Minister Dissanayake was not yet considered a suspect in the incident but investigations were not yet concluded.
	The residence relating to this case of Dr. Siva Shinnathamby, at No.11, Hewa Avenue, Colombo 7 was gifted to the Colombo University earlier to be used as a hostel for female undergraduates studying at the University of Colombo.
	After the demise of Dr. Chinnathambi in 2000 the residence was permitted to be taken by her nephew as per the last will and soon after the nephew’s demise in 2010, the executor and trustee to Dr. Chinnathambi’s will Kandiah Neelakandan handed over the property from a deed of gift to the University of Colombo.
	However, it is reported, up to now the Colombo University has not used it as a female undergraduate hostel. The case was postponed for November 4. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
