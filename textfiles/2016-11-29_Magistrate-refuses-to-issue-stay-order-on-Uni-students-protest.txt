Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansooriya today refused to issue a stay order, requested by the Welikada Police to prevent the protest march organised by the Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) entering the high security zone near Parliament.

The Judge informed the police to take necessary action on powers vested in the Police Ordinance if the protestors disturbed the public. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
