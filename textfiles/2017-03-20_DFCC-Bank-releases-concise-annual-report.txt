DFCC Bank releases concise annual report


	

DFCC Bank continued its revolutionary approach to presenting its annual report in a comprehensive yet concise format, in line with the global trends. This concise approach to reporting enables the bank to reduce its carbon footprint while at the same time making the report user-friendly for stakeholders. 
Almost half the size of customary annual reports, this report balances the need to communicate effectively through concise, relevant information while at the same time providing comprehensive compliance-related disclosures. DFCC Bank has drawn on concepts, principles and guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Guidelines G4, International Integrated Reporting Framework and Smart Integrated Reporting Methodology in producing this report.
The theme for this year’s report is ‘Growth At Our Core’, which is in line with the bank’s brand promise – ‘Keep Growing’. This concept is visually represented using a cross section of a tree trunk. Each year, a tree forms new cells, arranged in concentric circles called annual rings or annual growth rings. These annual rings show the amount of wood produced during one growing season. Thus, the tree trunk cross section featured in the report shows 62 growth rings representing DFCC 
Bank’s journey.
The report is presented in three formats, which include a concise report in print and CD formats, a comprehensive report available online (https://dfcc2016.annualreports.lk) and a condensed annual snapshot in print and PDF formats that communicates across a broad spectrum of current and potential stakeholders. 
In line with DFCC’s digital drive, the bank also launched a Perennial Compendium in 2015. The Perennial Compendium is linked to DFCC Bank’s website and presents the latest news categorised under Messages, Business Model, Value Creation & Capital Formation and Reports & Notices, based on the integrated reporting guidelines.
This compendium is also replicated in an investor relations app format, which can be downloaded via App Store or Google Play. Through this, stakeholders globally can stay up-to-date 24/7 on the bank’s developments through their smart devices, which are synced to real-time updates.
“The bank’s forward thinking brand personality is uniquely captured and embedded in the presentation of this annual report,” said DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando.
“Staying on par with DFCC’s increasingly tech-savvy stakeholder base is an imperative, as they are increasingly migrating to mobile devices to view content and engage with the bank. This is part of the journey of adding value to the stakeholder experience, in line with DFCC’s new brand promise, which is to ‘Keep Growing’.” 
This report also includes four impactful thematic images featuring the bank’s very own staff, which complements and ties into the main growth theme.
