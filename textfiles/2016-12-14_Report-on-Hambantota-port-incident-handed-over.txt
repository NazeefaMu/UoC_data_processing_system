The Navy had handed over its report on the Saturday’s incident at the Hambantota Port, where the Navy Commander had allegedly attacked a journalist, to Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi today.

A tense situation prevailed at the Hambantota Port when the Navy tried to release two merchant ships seized by protesting workers on December 10.

On Sunday, Defence Secretary asked the Navy to submit a report on the allegation that the Navy Commander had threatened a journalist during the protest.

“The Navy yesterday submitted a full report over the incident that took place at the Hambantota Port. First, I need to study the report and then will take necessary steps,” Mr. Hettiarachchi told the Daily Mirror.

Earlier, the Navy said it took swift measures to disperse the port employees, who staged a protest campaign at the Port premises.

They said the protesting employees were obstructing the operations of the Merchant Ships berthed in the jetty and causing damage to the ships and the adjacent facilities by using heavy machinery, equipment and gantry cranes to block the movement of ships. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
