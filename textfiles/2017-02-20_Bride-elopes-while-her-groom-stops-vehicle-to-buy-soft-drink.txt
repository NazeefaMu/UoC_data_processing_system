A bride had eloped with another young man when the bridegroom stepped into a wayside grocery to buy a bottle of soft drink, while on their way to spend their honeymoon. The bride is from Seenigoda, Watugedara in the Ambalangoda police area and the bridegroom is from Kandy

They had met while they were employed abroad and had decided to get married.

After the wedding reception at a hotel in Aluthgama, they had left for Colombo to spend their honeymoon. However, when the bridegroom had entered a wayside grocery on the way, another car had halted behind theirs. The bride had lost no time in getting into this car which sped away. Everything happened in a flash and the bridegroom was left in utter bewilderment by the roadside for a moment before giving chase to locate the car, to no avail. Later he called over at the Ambalangoda police and made a complaint.

The Ambalangoda police are conducting further investigations to trace the whereabouts of the bride.(Hemantha De Silva)
