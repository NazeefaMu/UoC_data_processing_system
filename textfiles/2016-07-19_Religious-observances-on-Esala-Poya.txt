Esala Full Moon Poya Day is significant for Buddhists in Sri Lanka. It was on a day such as this that the Lord Buddha preached his first Dhamma sermon - the 'Dhamma Chakka Pavattana Sutta'. Devotees are seen at the Kelaniya and Gangaramaya Temples taking part in religious observances. Pix by Kithsiri de Mel and Lal S Kumara
