Amana Bank’s CSR focuses attention on children especially in the areas of education and health. Amana bank recently stepped forward to help a fourteen year old Thalassemia Major patient Hasini Imasha Rajapaksha, who is the only child of Retired Sri Lankan Army Soldier Mr. R Maruna Krishantha Rajapaksha.

When Amana Bank got to know via media about Hasini, who waited 13 years to find a matching bone marrow, Amana Bank came forward to bridge the full balance payment required to settle the surgery and hospitalization charges within a few days. When the bank approached them in their financial call, Hasini’s father said “Webegan treatment when she was just eight months old and I have been fighting really hard to raise funds while also serving my country. I am thankful for Amãna Bank for coming forward to support my family during this hour of need”. In addition Amana Bank has offered financial assistance for post-surgery treatment to facilitate complete cure, which is still a daunting challenge for the parents. 

Commenting on this initiative, Amana Bank’s Vice President Retail Banking and Marketing Siddeeque Akbar said “when we heard of the status of Hasini’s surgery, we wanted to come forward and help her and her parents to overcome the situation they were facing.We are happy that Hasini is on her way towards a stable recovery, and appreciate the untiring effort of her parents in curing her illness.We are so honoured to be involve in this contribution supporting the family of a retired war hero.”
