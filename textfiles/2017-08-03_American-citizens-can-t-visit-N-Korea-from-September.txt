The 105-storey Ryugyong Hotel, the highest building under construction in North Korea, is seen in Pyongyang. The ban is to remain in effect for one year, unless it is revoked sooner by US secretary of state Rex Tillerson    

 

 

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 2 August 2017 - The United States on Wednesday officially set September 1 as the start date for a ban prohibiting its citizens from travelling to North Korea.   


“The department of state has determined that the serious risk to United States nationals of arrest and long-term detention represents imminent danger to the physical safety of United States nationals travelling to and within the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK),” read the restriction as it appeared on Wednesday in the US government’s federal register.   


“All United States passports are declared invalid for travel to, in, or through the DPRK unless specially validated for such travel,” it added.
