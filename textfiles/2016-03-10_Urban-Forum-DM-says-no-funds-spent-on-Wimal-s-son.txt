No state funds were spent on former minister Wimal Weerawansa's son though he was included in the Sri Lankan delegation to the Global Urban Forum at Colombia in April 2014, Deputy Minister of Housing Indika Bandaranaike told Parliament today.

He said this in response to a question asked by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Nalinda Jayatissa whether Mr. Weerawansa’s son had accompanied the then minister, Housing Ministry Secretary and National Housing Development Authority Chairman to the Forum in 2014.

The deputy minister said Rs.1.3million had been spent on the former minister's air ticket while US dollars 3,500 had been given to him as allowances. He said a similar amount had been spent on the ministry secretary.

MP Jayatissa then asked how the former minister had included his son in the delegation. At this point the opposition MPs shouted at Dr.Jayatissa asking him to ask this question from President Maithripala Sirisena as well. (Yohan Perera)
