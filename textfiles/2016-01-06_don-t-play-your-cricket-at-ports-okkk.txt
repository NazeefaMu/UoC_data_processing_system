Don’t play your cricket at Ports Authority: Union to Arjuna


	

Ports Trade Union today threatened to take action against Ports and Shipping Minister, Arjuna Ranatunga’s decision to seal the Authority’s Communications and Public Relations Division head office and stated the Minister would not be allowed to play ‘his cricket’ at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
Chairman of the All Ceylon Public Workers’ Union of Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chandra Siri Mahagamage said the office was sealed by the authorities yesterday citing alleged financial irregularities.
Mahagamage said the union believed the closure was due to the fact that the Chairman of the division was also the Chairman of the ‘Janasathu Sewa Cricket Union’.
Decisions made during the Sri Lanka Cricket elections, held last Sunday, had lead to the decision to seal the division office, he believed.
