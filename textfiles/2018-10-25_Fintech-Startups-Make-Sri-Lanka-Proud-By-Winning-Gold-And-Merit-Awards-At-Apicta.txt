Each nominee had to pitch and was rigorously assessed by a judging panel of the highest calibre, making it a difficult selection process.

The Gold award winning product, DirectPay, is an electronic payment option providing a viable alternative to cash and POS systems. It provides an entire infrastructure to facilitate payment requirements with its modular based and service-oriented software architecture. Directpay enables this while supporting the existing structures, allowing the merchants to offer products and services across all possible channels.



Moreover, Park and Pay was awarded with a Merit for their app-based innovative solution for motorists to find vacant parking spaces anywhere in Colombo, allowing seamless booking and payment within the app in only 3 clicks.
