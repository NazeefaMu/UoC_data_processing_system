UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe today said that the majority of MPs backing him to become the Prime Minister once again was a further step towards defeating the constitutional coup of October 26 this year.

Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment speaking in Parliament after a majority of members voted for him during the confidence vote.

“The decision made by Parliament today is another step towards defeating the constitutional coup of October 26 this year if I may use the words of the JVP Leader,” he said referring to a statement made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake that what is important is to defeat the constitutional coup of October 26, rather than allowing any individual to become the Prime Minister.

Mr. Wickremesinghe pledged to come up with a new development plan if he is allowed to form a government. “We will come up with a new development plan and intend to give concessions to people gradually,” he said.

“There are things which we could not do when we were running the government and we will do it if we are allowed to form a government again,” he added.

Mr. Wickremesinghe also pledged to come up with a solution to the national issue which will be based on an indivisible and undivided country. “We will also work towards increasing powers in provincial councils and towards abolishing the executive presidency,” he also said.

He finally thanked everyone who backed him and thanked Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as well for his role in safeguarding the rights of the legislative. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
