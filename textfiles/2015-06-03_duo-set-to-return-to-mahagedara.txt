	Two Deputies of the previous regime are now set to ‘double-cross’ to the Green party, they say. 

One of the ‘double-crossers’ is said to be a politico from the South now representing an electorate in the hill country. The other one is currently representing an area north of the City of Pearls and was involved in foreign matters under the previous regime. 
Both of them have told their intimates that the time had come for them to return to their Mahagedara – the ancestral home.
