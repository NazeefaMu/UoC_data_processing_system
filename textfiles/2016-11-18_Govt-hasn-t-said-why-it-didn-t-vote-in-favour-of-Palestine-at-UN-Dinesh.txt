Joint opposition group leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday expressed his displeasure at the government failure to give reasons why it had no voted in favour of Palestine at the recent UN sessions.

"I posed a question on this matter in Parliament some time back but neither the Foreign Affairs Minister nor his deputy answered my question though they have been in Parliament," he said.

The MP said it was sad to see the Government's Muslim ministers keeping silent on this matter. (Yohan Perera)
