Tamil Outfits Celebrate Slain LTTE Chief's Birthday

 
Several Tamil nationalist outfits and political parties including the MDMK and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi on Thursday celebrated the ‘birthday’ of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, held in the past as ‘Heroes Day’ by the Tigers.
Though a portrait of the Tiger leader was placed on the stage, no floral tribute was paid as the supporters had rejected the reports of Prabhakaran’s death.
Cakes were distributed at the office of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam at Royapettah at midnight, while MDMK general secretary Vaiko distributed sweets at the party office.  VCK leader AThol Thirumavalavan too cut the birthday cake at his party office.
