Away from the hustle-bustle of Colombo, Bolgoda is the perfect destination for anybody looking to enjoy their time in nature. Amidst greenery and by the lake, the sunrises and sunsets are especially beautiful here.

 



 

Historically, the waters here were used for transportation of logs from the Sinharaja forest to the timber mills in Moratuwa. However, this region is now known for travel and leisure. Still a more offbeat spot sans throngs of tourists, it offers peace and tranquility in abundance.

 

The biodiversity in the lake area is interesting to observe - from various aquatic creatures, to beautiful birds, you can see them all in their natural habitat. 

 



 

Fishing, boating, sailing, jet skiing and canoeing are popular activities in this area, therefore making it an ideal place for couples as well as families to enjoy.

 

The Panadura Beach is just about 5km from Bolgoda, and one may visit the Sri Lanka Air Force museum which is 8km from here. 

 





 

To make the most of your stay in Bologda, the ideal place to stay would be right by the lake, and the beautiful Vista Serenity Lake Front Villa more than fits the bill. An airy and spacious villa with abundant natural light coming in, it makes for the perfect place to unwind. Enjoy a cup of tea in the garden, or take a swim in your private pool - the villa offers luxury at an attractive price, thereby making it to the top of our list of recommendations in Bolgoda.
