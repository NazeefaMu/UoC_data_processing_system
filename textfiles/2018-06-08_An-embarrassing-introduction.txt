An embarrassing introduction


	



 

A former purohita had to suffer much discomfiture when a leading politico made a loaded comment about him while introducing him to a Buddhist prelate at a religious ceremony held in a temple recently, they say. 

 


The leading politico presenting the former purohita to the monk had said: “This is…. hitapu amathige putha! (former minister’s son) … He had always been with me! He is also one among the sixteen who recently crossed over to the opposition from the government!”


The former purohita who looked highly embarrassed by the unexpected introductory comment looked on with a sheepish smile, they say.


By the way, this former purohita is said to be set to join the leading politico’s political party.
