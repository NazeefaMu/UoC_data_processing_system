(c) 2017, The Washington Post ·· Jun 10, 2017 - KABUL, Afghanistan - An Afghan soldier opened fire on U.S. troops in a restive eastern province of Afghanistan on Saturday, killing two and injuring at least two more, authorities said.  


The shooting occurred in the Achin district of Afghanistan’s Nangahar province, according to a U.S. defence official, an area where both Islamic State and Taliban insurgents are contesting territory.

 
Early media reports suggested the assailant was an elite Afghan commando, although that is not confirmed. The gunman was killed by American troops, according to a security official in the province. The Taliban are also active in the area.  A Taliban spokesman sent a text message to journalists Saturday claiming the alleged assailant was an “infiltrator” of the Afghan army.
