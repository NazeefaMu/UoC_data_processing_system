Save Your Monkey, Sri Lanka’s pioneering Insuretech company, recently partnered with Uber Sri Lanka to offer their customers a variety of exciting value added services.


As a result of this latest tie-up between two of the country’s most trending startups, Save Your Monkey customers will now be eligible for a whole new set of benefits when travelling the roads of Sri Lanka.


With this partnership, customers will be entitled to a free Uber ride in the case of a road side accident at any time of the day throughout the year and will also be entitled to a discount on their first two Uber rides.


Expressing his thoughts on this latest addition to their portfolio of partnerships, Save Your Monkey Founder/CEO Chathura Jayatissa said: “Since we started our operations earlier this year, we have been working hard to offer our customers the best deals that they could possibly get as a result of staying connecting to us. Our partnership with Uber Sri Lanka is yet another fantastic partnership our customers can reap benefits from. Uber is an internationally renowned mobile application and tech service that revolutionized the taxi industry. This makes them a fitting match for Save Your Monkey, which is also a tech startup trying to innovate and change the game in the insurance industry 
of Sri Lanka.”


“Our partnership with Uber will not be limited to free rides during accidents and discounts on the initial two rides; as we are working with them to bring more benefits to Uber users in the near future,” he added.


Uber, the world’s largest on-demand ride sharing company was launched in Sri Lanka a little over one and a half years ago. Since its introduction to the local market, the application rapidly became a favorite go-to option for those looking to hail a ride; because of its convenient and reliable service.
Also speaking on the partnership, a spokesperson from Uber said: “We are extremely pleased to partner with Save Your Monkey to offer Sri Lankans fabulous deals on the road. Uber is committed to revolutionizing transportation both here and globally, and we are happy to partner with tech companies like Save Your Monkey who are also disrupting the insurance sector through innovative thinking and approaches.”
