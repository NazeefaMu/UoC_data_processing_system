Nominating three names violates 19A: NMSJ


	

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) said today it was a violation of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution for the President to nominate three names to the post of Attorney General (AG).


 “The Constitutional Council is only empowered to state whether the person nominated is suitable to be appointed to the post. It does not have the authority to select one official from among several others,” NMSJ member and Trade unionist Saman Rathnapriya told a media briefing held in Colombo.


Lawyer’s Collective representative Lakshan Dias said the AG’s Department was the state institution which implements the law and it should be headed by a very knowledgeable and competent official.


“Therefore we believe that the AG should be selected from among those at the AG’s department and that such an appointment should be in the order of seniority without political interference,” he said.


Lawyer Anura Bandara Rajaguru said the statement by MP Udaya Gammanpila calling for the appointment of Suhada Gamlath to the post of AG is politically biased and against the judicial process. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
