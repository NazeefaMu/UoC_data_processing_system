The repair work, on the pipeline carrying water to Colombo and the suburbs, was completed by 5.00 p.m. today and the supply of water from the Ambatale Water Treatment Plant has resumed, Ambatale Water Treatment Plant Operations Manager Piyal Rajapaksa said.

However, a spokesman for the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said it would take some time to fill the water tanks and the water supply would come to normal only by tomorrow morning.

The spokesman said the NWSDB had started distributing water to the areas where the water supply had been disrupted but the water pressure would be low as everyone would try to use water at the same time.

Water supply to the Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council area, Wellawatta, Kirulapone, Pamankada, Havelock Town, Bambalapitiya, Kollupitiya, Jayanthipura, Pelawatta, Mulleriyawa, Ambatale and Kohilawatte were disrupted since yesterday evening due to a pipeline that carries water to Dehiwala from Ambatale Water Refinery busting.
