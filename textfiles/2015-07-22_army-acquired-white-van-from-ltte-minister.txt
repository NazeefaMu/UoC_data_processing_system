	The mystery of the white van with three army personnel on board taken into custody on Tuesday deepened further after a government minister today revealed that it had earlier belonged to the LTTE.
	UNFGG Gampaha District Candidate and Minister Joseph Michael Perera who revealed more details at a news briefing said the white van had been acquired by the Army later.
	He said this incident is an achievement of the people and is a step in the direction of revealing more details of the level of crime that had prevailed in Sri Lanka.
	“For the first time three army personnel have been arrested and the white van they were travelling in taken into custody was a victory for peace-loving people and will help uncover the criminal activities carried out in the country,” the minister said.
	He claimed that the three army personnel had revealed that the revolver they had with them was owned by former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
	Responding to a question asked by the journalists why they were released on bail if their arrest would be a possible lead to other crimes, the minister said it was the courts which granted them bail and not the government.
	The minister who referred to a statement made by some UPFA members that the three army personnel in the white van were on a mission to assassinate ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, said those who made this accusation should provide information to the authorities so that a proper investigation could be carried out.
