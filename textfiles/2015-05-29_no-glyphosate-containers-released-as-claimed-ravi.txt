The Glyphosate controversy has taken another twist with Finance Minister contradicting the statement made by acting Customs Director General R. Semasingha that 15 containers of Glyphosate had been released legally.
The minister said none of the containers had been released nor had it been banned in Sri Lanka but that 40 containers detained by Customs would be destroyed on a presidential decree.
President Maithripala Sirisena had banned the import of the highly harmful agro-chemical Glyphosate after studies had revealed that the use of this chemical had in a large way contributed to the spread of Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) in many parts of the country.
Commenting on the circumstances that led to the resignation of former Customs Chief Jagath Wijeweera, the minister said he had done so on his own over a personnel issue. There was no political influence that prompted his resignation as alleged by the opposition.
Responding to a journalist at the news briefing at his office, the minister said Glyphosate had not been banned in Sri Lanka as claimed by former Agricultural Minister Mahinda Yapa Abeywadana but the Customs had been instructed to destroy the 40 containers of Glyphosate on a directive issued by President Maithripala Sirisena.
However, Mr. Abeywardana said Glyphosate was banned in Sri Lanka in February, 2014 in six districts in the North-Central, Uva and Eastern Provinces in a bid to control CKD.
"There was a protest from the tea industry because Glyphosate is used as the main weedicide in tea plantations and the ban was active only in six districts," Mr. Abeywardana said.
Mr. Abeywardana also alleged that former Mr. Wijeweera had resigned because of political pressure to release 15 containers of Glyphosate. However, Mr. Wijeweera is still to deny the allegation if it was wrong. (SAJ)
