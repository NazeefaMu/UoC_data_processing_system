Art by Kekuli

Art by Kekuli, is the brainchild of the artist's current state of mind.
Just as a child develops and grows - mentally, physically and emotionally over the course of life, one's state of mind too develops and continues to grow over time. We are to a great extent the result of the sum of the collective experiences we have encountered throughout the journey of life and "Life" as we all know it, is ambiguous.
We are constantly presented with new experiences; some joyous and some sorrowful. However, what we need to know & understand is that we cannot pick and choose our experiences or potential experiences or the lack of certainly preferred experiences thereof. This is the hard truth.
On a more positive note however, I think it is equally important if not even more critical to stay focused throughout our trying times. We need to take responsibility and we owe it to ourselves and our loved ones. After all we also need to appreciate, enjoy and experience some of the beautiful destinations we discover and travel through.
This is exactly what Kekuli Unamboowe Abeyratne's inaugural exhibition themed "A Tumultuous journey to a tranquil state of mind" is about. The exhibition will be inaugurated on December 2 at 4pm the Lionel Wendt Art Centre, Guildford Crescent, Colombo 7 and will be open to the public from 6pm-8pm and from 8.30am to 8pm on December 3.
It signifies two very important elements. The first being the journey itself: beginning of a distressed journey that ends well with a tranquil and calm state of mind and the Second being the end result of being tranquil itself. It's all about taking your negative experiences and energy and turning them into something beautiful and positive.
In her context the tumultuous journey signifies her state of mind after the passing of her loving husband, Late Victor Kapil Abeyratne. She was filled with grief, sorrow, pain and much more emotions that she has never experienced before not coping very well. It was then that her two daughters encouraged her to start painting. They were aware that she loved to sketch and draw. This was of course not a habit but it was random and she used to sketch if and when she was bored. The daughters reminded her how beautiful her work look and convinced that painting itself is a very good coping mechanism and therapeutic.
Now that she is aware of it, she can vouch that painting is a form of expressive therapy, like meditation and it definitely uses one's creative process of painting to improve one's physical, mental and emotional wellbeing, as it did hers. Gradually she became more involved and focused on her paintings, consuming most of her time which she enjoyed.
She began buying more art supplies, reading books, trying different methods and she was living the life of an artist. She felt calm, emotionally balanced and above all focused. What fascinated her most was the hidden talent that she has been having for decades which she was not fully aware of. Slowly her family and friends after viewing her work encouraged and motivated her to have an exhibition.
Her goal was not to create a masterpiece/s or to have an exhibition but as it turned out she had enough paintings which she was told are very beautiful to display.
She believes Art to be her creative outlet as well as an outlet to de-stress. This is fantastic for her because she is very passionate about it and it kills two birds with one stone.
When people ask her from who she think she has inherited the talent from, she says she think it is from her father. Late Terrence Unamboowe although a lawyer and High Court Judge, was multi talented and loved the artistic sphere. He was a Poet, an Author, Songwriter and Singer. So she guesses it has to be from him without a doubt.
