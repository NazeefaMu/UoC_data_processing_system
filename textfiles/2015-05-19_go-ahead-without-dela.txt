	The construction work of the Defence Headquarters Complex in Battaramulla would be completed without a delay, and there was no shortage of funds to allocate for the construction, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
	Minister Karunanayake earlier said that the construction of the complex was halted because the entire project needed to be evaluated and the exact estimated cost needed to be clarified.
	When contacted by Daily Mirror yesterday, he said that there was no update on the evaluation of the project as yet. “Still nothing,” he said.
	The Minister said that the funds for the project are being released through the Treasury and rejected the reports that the funds reserved for the construction expenses of the Defence Headquarters were being spent to pay the salaries of State employees.
	He also denied that the Army was carrying out the construction of the project through their funds. “This is not true. The Army is not funding the construction and the project will be completed without a delay,” he said.
	Earlier, Rs. 8 billion was transferred to the Treasury from an account maintained by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the construction purpose of this complex. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
