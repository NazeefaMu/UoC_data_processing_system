Wesley’s ‘Walk of Grit’

The excitement is reaching fever pitch as the days to the “Walk of Grit 2015”, draw near. The walk will parade on October 3 starting from the College premises in Borella at 3.00 pm proceeding via Baseline road to Kannatte round about and through Bauddhaloka Mawatha to the CR & FC grounds at Longdon Place Colombo 7. Joining the procession from D.S. Senanayake College will be the year 1- 5 primary school students.
This year’s “Walk of Grit” is expected to raise funds to restore the historic main building which is over a hundred years and iconic to all Wesleyites. The architect behind this masterpiece was the great Principal Rev. Henry Higfield who cycled around Sri Lanka on a push bicycle to collect funds. It will be fitting that every living Wesleyite makes his contribution towards his alma mater in honour this great personality who ensured that an iconic building was constructed to house and educate every single Wesleyite then, now and in the future. Co-incidentally the 150th birth anniversary of Rev. Highfield will be celebrated in December this year.
Plans are also underway to replace the existing furniture with durable wooden furniture in the main campus while improving and developing the playgrounds of both branch schools located at Havelock town and Katunayake.
The walk will culminate with a musical extravaganza themed “Concert of Grit” which will showcase Wesley’s past and present musicians ‘live in concert’.
A colourful parade consisting of classic cars, Harley Davidson, Ducati, Triumph and a variety of other classic motor bikes along with other decorated floats and vehicles will be on parade. The organisers request all batches, past and present boys of Wesley, parents and teachers to rally round and make this event a spectacular and resounding success.
The new Principal Ben Manickam invites old boys, batch leaders, sportsman, past leaders of academic committees, parents and all connected to Wesley to rally round the school and passionately generate sponsorships towards the cause.
He also makes a fervent appeal that the specially designed T shirt and cap for the walk should be worn by all participants to showcase the unison and solidarity of Wesley. A limited stock is no available. Old boys can purchase their T shirts and caps at the Old Wesleyites Sports Club from Tuesday 29 September 2015 from the manager.
