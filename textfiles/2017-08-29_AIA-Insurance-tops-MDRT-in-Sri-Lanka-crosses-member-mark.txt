AIA Insurance tops MDRT in Sri Lanka, crosses 100 member mark


	



AIA Sri Lanka has crossed 100 MDRT (Million Dollar Round Table) members for 2016, making it the first and only insurer in Sri Lanka to do so.


 AIA has the most number of MDRT members in Sri Lanka, with a total of 110 MDRT certificates awarded to AIA Wealth Planners and Bancassurance Executives in 2016. This achievement is testament to the high calibre of advisors recruited, trained and employed by AIA, to provide the best protection and savings solutions to Sri Lankans. 


This is the second consecutive year that AIA tops MDRT from Sri Lanka. MDRT is internationally recognised as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. Its members are required to generate a certain high level of premium, commission and income and demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and exceptional client service. This achievement is therefore a fitting acknowledgement of the relentless commitment and the high level of professionalism shown by AIA’s advisors who, for the second successive year, helped AIA Insurance become the number-one MDRT in Sri Lanka. 


CEO Pankaj Banerjee said: “We are in the business of helping people protect their families, access the best healthcare and enjoy their retirement to the fullest - this is no easy task and it is truly commendable that our advisors are able to not only positively impact people’s lives but also be recognised as being the best of the best.” “Our advisors are renowned for providing the highest standards of professional service and we continue to support their development by offering high quality training programmes, hiring and retaining top talent and providing the most advanced tools for enhanced efficiency and productivity,” he added.


Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe who is AIA’s Chief Agency Officer stated “We adopt a diligent process when recruiting to ensure we have the very best joining our team. We also have an intense and holistic training process to ensure 100 percent competence as well as the necessary technology in place to enable ease-of-doing-business for the Wealth Planners as well as the customers.”
