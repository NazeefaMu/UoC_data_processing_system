The Clearing Association of Bankers (CAB) held its ninth Annual General Meeting on November 24th 2017 at the conference hall of the HNB Towers in Colombo 10.
This special event was graced by Guest of Honour Lanka Clear (Pvt.) Ltd Chief Executive Officer and General Manager Channa De Silva, Chief Operating Officers of various banks, Deputy General Managers, Heads of the Clearing departments of all Commercial Banks, the members of CAB and other distinguished guests.


The AGM and the fellowship was a great success thanks to the usual good support of the Principal sponsor AB Securitas (Pvt.) Ltd and M. Razak Deen of MCB Bank was elected as the President.


This Association was formed in 2008 with the objective of ‘enhancing the knowledge of bankers as well as to promote the good will, understanding and fellowship among bankers engaged in clearing’. Last year too CAB was able to fulfill the above objective by holding seminars related to banking, the much awaited Inter Bank Quiz programme and the popular Inter Bank Softball Cricket tournament with a large participation. The success of these events ensured a rise in the number of the organization’s members.
