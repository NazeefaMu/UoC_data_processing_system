Two underworld characters spending a temporary stay in a state-run outstation lodge had reportedly taken the initiative to hold a New Year bash inside the lodge.

 


These two characters, though expected to be held under tight security in their cells had reportedly enjoyed the free-run of the place for organizing the party.  


Those on duty at the lodge too had participated in the bash where everyone was liberal with the bottle and the merry-making had gone on until mid-night, they say.
