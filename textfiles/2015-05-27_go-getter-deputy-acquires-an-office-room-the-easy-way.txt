Go-getter Deputy acquires an office room the easy way!


	


	Some of the Ministerial ones and Deputies appointed recently have not been provided with office accommodation let alone the basic facilities for them to function in their new positions.

The Deputy appointed to look after urban development was one of the new appointees who had to suffer this fate. However, this one, a typical go-getter was not prepared to resign himself to it. He was scouring the premises when he discovered that the chairman handling urban development had left his office. He walked into that office and summarily established himself there.
The chairman made no fuss when he found himself unexpectedly displaced. And he quietly continued doing his work at a desk inside the conference hall. And he is now compelled even to use the common toilet.
This chairman, a former Ministry secretary and a top executive in a leading bank in the world had kept mum about the unhappy episode until a group of Bell party members called on him the other day, they say.
