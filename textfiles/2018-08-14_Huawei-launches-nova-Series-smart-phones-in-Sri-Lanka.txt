The devices are especially targeted at the younger generation backed by the superior innovation, quality  and service offering from Huawei” 

HUAWEI nova3 and HUWAEI nova3i feature a trendy outlook and meticulous craftsmanship that has been designed as a fashion statement for the youth. The two devices sport the newest generation 6.3-inch FHD+ (2340x1080) 19.5:9 FullView display. These specs enable the display to push out bigger and sharper images while giving the devices a slimmer look than their predecessors. Furthermore, each of the two devices comes with a different range of vibrant colour variants. HUAWEI nova3 and HUAWEI nova3i are both available in a trendy, unique colour known as “Iris Purple, the striking gradient which smoothly transitions from blue to purple. To realize this breathtaking gradient effect, Huawei covers both devices with glass panels. Both sides of HUAWEI nova3 are covered with a smooth double curved glass panel, and the back panel lets the gradient effect come out with exquisite texture. 

HUAWEI nova3 is powered by the flagship-class high performance Kirin 970 SoC, featuring the Neural Processing Unit that is dedicated to processing AI tasks. Combining the NPU with Huawei's HiAI mobile computing architecture, Kirin 970 excels in AI computations and delivers 50 times better performance and 25 times better efficiency than traditional CPUs.  The nova3 series also provides the best gaming experience through the GPU turbo which ensures faster action. GPU Turbo is a revolutionary soft and hard collaborative graphics acceleration technology that opens up the processing bottleneck between the EMUI operating system and GPUs and CPUs, enabling graphic processing efficiency to increase by up to 60% and allowing the speed of mobile phones to be greatly enhanced. It has the added benefit of reducing power consumption while playing games by up to 30%.
