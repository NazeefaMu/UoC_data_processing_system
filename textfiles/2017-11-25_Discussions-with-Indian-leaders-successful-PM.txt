Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said he had a successful round of discussions with Indian leaders on the development projects planned for Sri Lanka with the India's assistance and on the proposed Economic Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) during his visit to the subcontinent.

Mr Wickremesinghe told journalists here before his departure back home that progress had been made on the proposed Economic Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that is to be signed with India. " I had extensive talks with the Indian Prime Minister and our discussions concluded positively," he said.
The Prime Minister said discussions were also held on the agreement signed between India and Sri Lanka in April this year in which both countries have decided to implement several development projects in Sri Lanka. " Our discussions focused on the delay in implementing some of these projects and certain clarifications on others. Japan will play a part in two of these development projects together with India," he added.
" I met Indian President Ram Nath Kovind, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sushma Swaraj and Indian Congress Party Leader Sonia Gandhi and each of these discussions generally focused on Indo-Lanka ties," he added.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe returned to the island yesterday (24). He was accompanied by Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister's Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Additional Secretary Saman Attaudahetti, Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake and the Prime Minister's special aide Sandra Perera.
