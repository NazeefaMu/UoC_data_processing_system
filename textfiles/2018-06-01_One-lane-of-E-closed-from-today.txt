One side of the Southern Expressway (E01) on the Interchange between Kokmaduwa and Godagama had been closed from today, Southern Expressway Deputy Director R.A.D. Kahatapitiya said.

Explaining the reason for closure he said it was as a result of ongoing construction work to connect the Matara-Hambantota extension to the E01.

Accordingly, two of the four lanes of the expressway would be closed during this time. “Since one side of the expressway would be closed, the remaining two lanes will be used by vehicles travelling in both directions,” he said.

“Motorists are advised to reduce their vehicle speed to 40 kmph,” he said. “Speed limit signs will be displayed on the roadside. The two lanes will remain closed for at least six months,” Mr. Kahatapitiya said.  (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
