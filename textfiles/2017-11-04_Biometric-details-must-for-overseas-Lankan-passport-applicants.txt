All Sri Lankans applying for new Passports through the Sri Lanka Embassy in Manila would be required to provide biometric information to the Immigration and Emigration Department upon their first entry to Sri Lanka after obtaining new Passports with effect from December 1, this year.

In a communique on Friday, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Manila said that the necessary facilities for collection of biometrics were available at Department’s Head office, through its branches and at the Bandaranaike International Airport.

It said the Immigration and Emigration Department has successfully introduced the mandatory collection of biometrics (fingerprints and digital face image) from Passport applicants and Automated Fingerprint Identification (AFIS) since 15 August 2015 as a part of ongoing efforts to strengthen the integrity of the Passport issuance process.

“Further, the Department has now decided to extend the above system for Sri Lankans applying for new Passports via any Sri Lanka Diplomatic Mission overseas with effect from December 1, 2017,” the communique said.
