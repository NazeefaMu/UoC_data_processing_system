Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today the ministry had decided to appoint a committee headed by President's Counsel, Nalin Ladduwahetty to probe fraud and corruption in the Ports Authority.
Minister Ranatunge said the committee would look into whether any fraud or corruption had occurred in purchasing  machinery and other equipment such as cranes and fork lifts and would submit a full report within three months.
He said the probes into  fraud and corruption was delayed because they wanted to study the methodology of the ports authority and launch investigations while the authority was brought back to the correct path.
Mr. Ranatunge said  the trade unions attached to the Ports Authority and its employees had assured him that they would support the investigations and provide necessary documents.
He said the report would be handed over to the President, Prime Minister and Attorney General’s Department and added  it would be handed over to the Bribery Commission also if needed.WATCH
