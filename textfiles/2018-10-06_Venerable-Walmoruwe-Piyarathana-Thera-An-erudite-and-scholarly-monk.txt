“Yo Hothi Viyaththocha Visaradhocha 
 Bahussutho Dhammarocha Hothi 
 Dhammassa Hothi Anudhammachari 
 Sa Thadhiso Vuchchathi Sangasobheno”

 

The above quote reflects that any priest who is versatile, eminent and eloquent should adorn the Buddha Sasana and possess deep knowledge on Dhamma. 


Being the first foreign Professor at the Chulalankoon Royal University in Thailand, Ven. Piyarathana Thera possesses the above virtues. Despite obstacles and hardships, the prelate has held many key positions in diverse fields. He is an erudite personality in the Theriya Bhikkhu Sasana. 
The appointment of Ven. Walmoruwe Thera to the post of professor is a blessing for the advancement of the Sri Lankan Buddhist society. It also underpins the platform for the enhancement of the Buddha Sasana.

Born in 1974, Priyantha Kumara was the youngest son of Muthubanda and Heen Amma Dissanayake of Walmoruwe in the Matale District. He had his primary education at Walmoruwa Primary School and St. Thomas’ College in Matale. He was ordained as a samanera (novice monk) in October 1987, under the tutelage of Ven. Malpitiya Somarathane Thera and Ven. Malpitiya Wimalaratne Thera. Following the demise of the then Chief Incumbent Ven. Malpitiya Somaratne Thera, Ven. Malpitiya Wimalaratne Thera succeeded and guided Ven. Piyarathana Thera to the Madanwala Pirivena, a well-known institution for oriental languages. In 1996, the prelate was granted the state of ‘Upasampada’ from the Asgiri Vihara and subsequently entered the Peradeniya University. On the recommendations of Ven. Henepola Nandasiri Thera, Ven. Piyaratne Thera was appointed as a teacher to the Asgiriya ViharaPirivena in 2001. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sanskrit from the Buddhist and Pali University. The Thera was fortunate to serve as a probationary lecturer in Pali and Buddhism in the Peradeniya University. At the time, having won a scholarship to study for the Master’s Degree in Pali and Buddhism, the prelate left for Thailand in 2003. Ven. Piyarathana Thera got this opportunity as a result of the introduction to the Vice Chancellor of Chulalankoon University by Ven. Udagama Buddharakkitha of the Asgiriya Chapter. Having obtained the Master of Arts Degree from the Chulalankoon Universityin Thailand in 2005, he also won a special scholarship in 2007 to read for the doctorate at the same university. In the meantime, Ven. Piyarathana Thera worked as a lecturer in the Chulalankoon University and on a request made by Professor Kabil Abhayawansa, he commenced work at the International Buddhist University. Having obtained the PhD, Ven. Piyarathana Thera became a permanent lecturer at the Maha Chulalankoon University in Thailand. On August 6 this year, the prelate was appointed as an assistant professor to the Maha Chulalankoon Royal University.

As a beautiful flower blooms from a heap of trash, according to the words of Buddha, the prelate shines with knowledge of virtues amongst the mean, blind, low and living being. Professor Ven.
