Responding to President Maithripala Sirisena’s remarks at yesterday’s government rally in Colombo, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said today whatever the President’s personal issues with him may be, the President should not plunge the country into constitutional chaos through his illegal and immoral actions.

Mr. Wickremesinghe said in a twitter message that the President should not hold the people, he has been elected to serve to, ransom by plunging the country into constitutional chaos.
