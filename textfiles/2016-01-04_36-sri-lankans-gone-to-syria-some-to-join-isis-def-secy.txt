	At least 36 Sri Lankans are reported to have gone to Syria with some of them having joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist group, Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said today.
	He said according to reports, several Sri Lankans with their families including several women and children have been among those who had gone to Syria.
	“They had said they were going on pilgrimage but I believe that some of them had joined the ISIS” he said.
	Mr. Hettiarachchi said he was not in possession of the details of how or with whom they had left the country.
	Last year in July, a 37-year-old Sri Lankan, who had joined ISIS was reportedly killed during a bombing raid in Syria.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Hettiarachchi requested the media and other organizations to be cautious and act responsibly when reporting on the ISIS.(DS)
