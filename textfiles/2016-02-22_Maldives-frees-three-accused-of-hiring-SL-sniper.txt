Three people arrested over a plot to assassinate the president that involved a sniper brought into Maldives from Sri Lanka have been released by Maldivian Police on Sunday, Haveeru Online reported yesterday.

A police spokesperson said the three men arrested on December 17 were released by the Criminal Court for lack of evidence. He, however, did not give details.

Confirming the arrest of the Sri Lankan sniper for the first time, police said in a statement in November that the 27-year-old man was arrested on October 24. He has been remanded by the Criminal Court.

Reports of the Sri Lankan sniper’s arrest came a day after Maldivian security forces confiscated assault rifles and hand guns in what has been the biggest weapons bust in the country’s history.

The weapons had been seized from Hibilhadhoo Island in Baa Atoll being developed as a resort.

The army had confirmed that two assault rifles found in the weapons bust belonged to the state armoury.
