Raviraj: Sumanthiran says will appeal against verdict


	

Jaffna District TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumathiran said yesterday that his political party was not satisfied with the verdict in the former Parliamentarian Nadaraja Kaviraj’s assassination case and would file an appeal against the verdict.

 “The judgment is indicative of the people’s distrust in the country’s Judiciary. It is in this scenario that we demand an international panel of judges to probe the alleged war crimes. A lawyer who watched the interests of the aggrieved party, I will file an appeal,” he said.

Replying to a query from the media weather his opinion was based on his belief that the accused in the case themselves were responsible for the murder, he said he would not level a direct allegation against them, but it was sad to find that the government failed to bring the real culprits in the broad daylight crime to book and left them at large for a long time.

He said this situation was not acceptable to the TNA. (Romesh Madusanka)
