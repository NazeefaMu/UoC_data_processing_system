Won’t let canteen, hotel owners to raise food prices: CAA


	

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) said it would not permit canteen and hotel owners to increase prices of food items in the wake of the recent increase in the price of gas.

Last week the price of a 12.5 kg cylinder of Litro gas and Laugfs Gas was increased by Rs.245 resulting in a cylinder of gas now costing Rs.1,676.

The Canteen Owners’ Association (COA) said on Sunday the price of a packet of lunch would be increased by Rs.10 and that of a hopper by Rs.2.

The CAA said the price of a cylinder of gas in 2014 was Rs.2,441 and in January 2015 when this government assumed office the price was Rs.1,896 which was reduced by Rs.564.

However, in September 2017, the price of a 12.5 kg cylinder of gas was increased by Rs.110.

“As such, when compared with gas prices in 2014, canteen and hotel owners have no reason to increase the price of food items,” CAA Chairman Hasitha Thilakaratne said and added that milk powder companies had asked that they be allowed to increase the prices of imported full cream milk powder.

He said the Cabinet sub committee would take a decision on this matter.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
