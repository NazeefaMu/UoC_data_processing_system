New constitution may divide country: MR


	

The 'Yahapalana Government' intends to divide the country by passing a new Constitution, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa charged yesterday.

“We have come to know that the government is trying to pass a new constitution. The constitution may include some hidden terms and clauses that will only divide the country and which are detrimental to Sri Lankan Buddhists and Buddhism. The People and especially the Buddhist clergy must be alert to this situation,” he said.

“It is very important for the people to know that 15 Acts are to be presented to Parliament soon. Most of them were promised in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva. Among these proposals is the establishment of hybrid courts to address allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war,” Rajapaksa alleged.
