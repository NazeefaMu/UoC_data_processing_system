Perks to MPs, but people suffer: JVP


	

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today charged that the government was offering perks and privileges to MPs to secure its power while suppressing the people.

JVP MP Vijitha Herath said it was unreasonable to offer perks and privileges to MPs when people who fought for their rights were attacked with teargas and water cannon.

“Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that the MPs had difficulty in meeting expenses and approved the increase of their allowances while providing them with vehicles. Doesn’t he see that the people are struggling to face the soaring cost of living?,” he asked.

Mr. Herath said the government had approved Rs. 30 million for the renovation of the residence given to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa at Wijerama Mawatha in Colombo and another Rs. 20 million had also been approved to construct a new building.  (Ajith Siriwardana)
