President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have been critical of former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga over some remarks she made on the people's mandate at the presidential election on January 8, 2015.

At the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee meeting on Monday night, Ms. Kumaratunga had insisted that the party should remain in the government because that was in line with the people's mandate on January 8, 2015. Before leaving the meeting, she is also said to have been critical of the CC for not discussing the way forward on policy matters.

However, the President taking a swipe at her said people voted on January 8, 2015, not for a movement but for the person who gave leadership.

“Otherwise, they could have nominated someone from the United National Party (UNP) but asked why that was not so,” he questioned.

The President said Ms. Kumaratunga rarely attended the Central Committee meetings and as such had little or no knowledge about the discussions on policy matters. (Kelum Bandara)
