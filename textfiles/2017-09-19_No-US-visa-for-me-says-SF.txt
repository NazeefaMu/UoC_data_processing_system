Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Saratha Fonseka said on Monday that despite his name was included in the delegation travelling to the United States with President Maithripala Sirisena to participate at the UN Sessions in New York, he was not granted visa for the tour.

Speaking to the media at Kelaniya, Field Marshal Fonseka said he requested to protect the good name of the Army by punishing the wrongdoers and he was also a victim of  war allegations as some have engaged in misdeeds under the guise of war.
