[SINGER CRICKET CORNER]

Come back win over Afghans ensures Lankans quarter final spotICC UNDER 19 WORLD CUP NEWS:
Sri Lanka U19s after a great game of cricket since they arrived in Bangladesh booked a place in the quarterfinals of ICC U19 World Cup 2016 winning both matches they played so far in the first round against Canada Under 19s and Afghanistan Under 19s with a game to play on Wednesday against their Pakistan counterparts. The results of Wednesday's match will decide as to who would clinch the top spot in Group B as both teams, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have already qualified to play in quarters.
Lankan youth's morale was very high as they won both warm-up games comprehensively. The roles of skipper Charith Asalanka and his deputy Shammu Ashan in the four games they played so far were admirable that they led their team from the front in all their victories.
After Lankan youths handed Canada an enormous 196-run thrashing in their first group-game, they had a tough time against Afghans in the second outing as their batters except Charith who made a gallant 71 failed to post a challenging total after batting first. Afghans chasing a modest target of 185 to win were in a somewhat comfortable position when they reached 74 for four halfway through their innings, but panic set in as Lankan bowlers ripped the heart out of the Afghans batting claiming their last six wickets for just 77 runs to win the match by 33 runs.
