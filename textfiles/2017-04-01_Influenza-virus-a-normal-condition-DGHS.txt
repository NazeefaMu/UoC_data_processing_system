The influenza virus experienced by many people recently was a normal condition and it could be cured by following the doctor’s prescriptions, Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said yesterday.

Dr. Bandara told a news conference that the continuous climate changes were the main reason for the spread of the virus, since the nature of the viruses were also subjected to changes with the climate.

“There is nothing to be worried about this condition. It is a common virus. It is necessary to avoid the contact of patients who have been infected with the virus in order to be safe. The Healthy Ministry has taken measures to prevent the effect of this virus,” he said.

He said the ministry has launched special investigations to check on migrants arriving in the country at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to detect those affected by the virus.

He said all hospitals have been provided with the necessary medicines to cure this virus and added that they were transferring the blood samples received by them to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) for further medical tests.

“Earlier we received patients who were affected with the virus from Kandy, Kilinochchci and Bibile areas. The MRI has received about 1548 samples for tests during March, and it was found that 528 were affected by the virus,” he said.
