MYTH:  Reading in bad light can weaken your eyesight  

 

BUSTED:“No, nothing will happen. If you are able to read in low lighting, the sensitivity of your eyes are good. This means that you can see very well even in dark light, implying that your vision is very good. There are children who can’t tolerate bright lights because they have a problem with their eyes. If children or adults prefer reading in lower lighting conditions there will be no strain to the eyes,” explained Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon, Ragama Teaching Hospital.
