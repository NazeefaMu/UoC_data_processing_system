Line rooms under landslide threat

 
Plantation workers in Line Room No. 2 at the Glenfin division of the Hingurugamuwa Estate in Badulla are under threat of imminent landslides. S. Selvaraja, a line resident said that water was seeping in from the ground into the line workers rooms. The troubling emergence of water from under the earth near the playground, are also disturbing factors, he said, laying bare the line room residents' fear of landslides.
