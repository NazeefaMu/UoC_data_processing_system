England's 'Typhoon' Tyson dies aged 85


Frank Tyson
Former England fast bowler Frank Tyson has died at the age of 85, his former county Northamptonshire announced on Sunday.
Northamptonshire announced the news on their website, stating that Tyson has passed away in hospital in Australia -- where he emigrated after retiring -- following a period of ill health.
Nicknamed 'Typhoon' due to his ferocious pace, Tyson notably picked up 28 wickets in five Tests during the 1954-55 Ashes series in Australia, which England won 3-1.
"Northants Cricket offers sincere condolences to Frank's family and friends at this sad time," Northamptonshire said.
Born in Lancashire, Tyson played 170 matches for Northamptonshire, claiming 525 wickets at an average of 20.94, and took 76 wickets in 17 Tests for his country.
His 28-wicket haul in the 1954-55 Ashes included 10 wickets in the second Test in Sydney, as well as seven for 27 in Australia's second innings in Melbourne.
After retiring due to injury at the age of 30, Tyson moved to Australia and became a school headmaster, whilst also working as a coach, commentator, journalist and writer.
"Frank 'Typhoon' Tyson will forever be remembered as a great of English cricket," said Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland in a statement.
"Throughout his career he struck fear into the hearts of batsmen around the globe. But once his playing days were over he chose to settle here in Australia, the country where he had become a household name.
"Over many years he became a much-loved and greatly admired member of the Australian cricket community where he coached and mentored countless players in Victoria and Queensland.
"He also made a wonderful contribution to the coverage of the game in Australia as a broadcaster and cricket writer.
"Cricket Australia mourns his loss and extends its deepest sympathies to his wife Ursula, family and friends at this sad time."
England Cricket tweeted: "Very sad to hear of the passing of England and @NorthantsCCC paceman Frank Tyson. RIP Typhoon Tyson."
Lord's Cricket Ground also expressed its condolences, writing on Twitter: "Sad to hear that former @englandcricket bowler Frank Tyson has passed away." AFP
