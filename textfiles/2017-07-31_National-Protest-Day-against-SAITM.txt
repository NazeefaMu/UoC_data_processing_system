While declaring August 2 as the National Protest Day against SAITM, the SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra (SVJP) today said that protests and black band campaigns will be held across the island.

It was learnt that the professionals, political parties, trade unions, civil societies and university students and their parents had pledged their support to the move, to show their displeasure to the government.

SVJP organizers said the employees in the private and public sectors will wear black bands and the State and private institutions would be decorated with black flags.

Meanwhile, street demonstrations, leaflet and awareness campaigns are also scheduled to be held during the day.

It is expected that a work stoppage for several hours in the fields of medical, teaching, petroleum and several private and public institutions will be due to the scheduled event.

The move is said to be the first collective action after series of individual anti SAITM battles.

Explaining the upcoming move, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said many protesting activities would conduct district and village wise against the government stance over the SAITM. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
