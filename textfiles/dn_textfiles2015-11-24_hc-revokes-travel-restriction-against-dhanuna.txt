HC revokes travel restriction against Dhanuna

The Colombo High Court yesterday lifted the travel restrictions imposed against Dhanuna Tillekaratne over a period of several years in connection with the HiCorp case.
At a previous occasion, Dhanuna Tillekaratne had been acquitted and released from the HiCorp case, on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Counsel Asela Rekawa with Ramalingam Ranjan appearing for Dhanuna moved Court that their client’s passport be released since he had been already acquitted from the case. Taking into consideration the facts, High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena revoked the travel ban imposed against Dhanuna and ordered that his passport be released to him.
The Court had earlier directed the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to prevent Dhanuna Tillekaratne from leaving the country.
Danuna Tillekaratne had been charged under Public Property Act for aiding and abetting to cheat US$299,061.25 of public funds through the HiCorp Private Company Ltd by forwarding forged bid documents to the Sri Lanka Army for certain supplies to the Defence Ministry 2007-2008 after convincing the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) to deposit the money while appearing as an agent of British Borneo Defence Company in Australia.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was also named as an accused in the HiCorp case was acquitted from the case over a double jeopardy issue; where charges in the indictment in the High Court case were similar to that in the second Court Martial trial in which Sarath Fonseka was sentenced. Thus, no action could be instituted twice against an accused on the same charges.
