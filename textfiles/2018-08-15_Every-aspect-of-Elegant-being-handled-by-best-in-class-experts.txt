Reserving an apartment in an under-construction building generally requires careful evaluation. But in the case of the boutique apartment Elegant 16, being developed by Ekroma, the impeccable credentials of the partners in the project reflects the stability, strength and rigidity of the impressive edifice and why it makes for a wise investment. Engaged in commercial property leasing, condominium development and strategic investments, Ekroma is a BOI-approved real estate and development company. It is led by a young and dynamic team committed to maximize the value of their clients’ investments by ushering in global real estate trends. 

Every stage of Elegant 16’s construction is being supervised by experts. The piling work for Elegant 16 was entrusted to D.P Jayasinghe Piling, a well-reputed and leading construction service company in Sri Lanka, hailed as one of the most respected project management companies in the region. D.P Jayasinghe provides the best solutions for piling and ground preparation by controlled rock blasting to make the process of the construction a success. This is a critical stage of the construction and D. P. Jayasingha is best equipped to handle this. Demonstrating its commitment for maintaining the highest standards, Elegant 16 has done piling for just 5 floors to strengthen the structure, proving that safety of residents is high priority, even though piling is usually done for buildings that are higher than 10 floors.
 
The stability of the structure has been ensured by thorough structural design incorporating pile foundation up to bedrock and rigid beam, column frames to transmit various possible loading to the ground safely. Grade 30 concrete with high yield steel reinforcement in each element will ensure the structural system withstands the load subjected. Strict quality control was maintained during construction by careful supervision by the consultants.

Elegant 16 is poised to unveil the boutique living concept to Sri Lanka upon completion by end August 2018. Boutique apartments are a new trend in the real estate market globally. Consisting of two and three-bedroom uniquely curated living spaces, this new-age concept apartment ushers in an exclusive lifestyle concept in Sri Lanka. Our lead consultant Design Advocacy played a key role in coming up with the new ‘boutique’ concept. 

Elegant 16 has a floor configuration of 3-4 units per floor. As per a real estate report by KPMG, apartment projects with 2-4 units per floor are considered luxury projects. Furthermore, although the land value on which Elegant 16 is situated is Rs. 9 million per perch, Ekroma is charging a mere Rs. 35 million for a cozy 2-bedroom apartment and Rs. 46 million for a spacious 3 bedroom apartment. With Elegant 16, Ekroma strives to provide only the best quality at an affordable price offering a great ‘value-for - money’ proposition. 

Elegant 16 is an ideal choice for individuals who wish to buy and lease their dream apartment, as there is a shortage of spaces available for lease in the area. Since the project extends the option to purchase apartments outright or even lease them, Elegant 16 is a fitting choice for savvy investors. A limited number of brand new apartments are available for lease. Located at Elvitigala Mawatha, near leading local and international schools, Elegant 16 offers a unique opportunity to live and work in this highly coveted neighbourhood which has a lack of quality luxury housing projects. Reserve your boutique apartment at Elegant 16 today. Call 0771070774 for more details.
