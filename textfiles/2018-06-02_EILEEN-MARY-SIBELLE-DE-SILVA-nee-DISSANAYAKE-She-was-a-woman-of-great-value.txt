EILEEN MARY SIBELLE DE SILVA (nee DISSANAYAKE)  She was a woman of great value


	

Eileen Dissanayake was my English Literature teacher and later my class teacher in the HSC1 class at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya.  


She was born on September 29, 1922. Eileen had her primary and secondary education at Holy Family Convent. She had a brilliant academic record. She won the Senior Cambridge Scholarship Exam, coming first in the island and was the Head Girl at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya from 1938 - 1941. Eileen was a member of the editorial team that produced the school magazine ‘Refreshing Breezes’.

 


Eileen also loved music, drama and singing. She was a proud member of a unique Sri Lankan choir which sang at many venues in Sydney including at the Sydney Opera House


 


During an era when women weren’t encouraged to study beyond Year 10, one would imagine there was very little support or assistance for women to enter University. Eileen had to compete against students from prestigious boy’s schools that had more resources and also some of the best teachers. But this didn’t deter Eileen. She was determined and focussed. Eileen was the first woman in her family to have a university education and so started her life-long passion for learning, education and teaching. After graduating from the University of Colombo with a BA (English Hons), she joined her beloved Alma Mater as a teacher.  


We were indeed privileged to have her as our teacher at that time. Apart from being our teacher, Eileen was also a friend and confidante and I remember the great times we all had at school.   
In 1955, Eileen left the staff of the school after marrying Aloysius de Silva (Aloy), a lawyer from Kurunegala. She lived in Kurunegala with Aloy and raised three daughters: Marie-lyse, Diane & Sandra.  


Eileen later returned to teaching, this time at Holy Family Kurunegala until she retired at the age of 60! Eileen qualified as a Speech & Drama teacher obtaining a Licentiate and Fellow of the Trinity College of London. Later she set up her own business as a teacher of Speech & Drama in Kurunegala.  Eileen moved to Australia in 1998 and quickly adapted to the Australian lifestyle. 


Eileen loved writing, specially poetry. In 2002, Eileen published a collection of poems called ‘Ripples on a Lake’. These poems showed how she loved life’s experiences.  


Eileen also loved music, drama and singing. She was a proud member of a unique Sri Lankan choir which sang at many venues in Sydney including at the Sydney Opera House.  


Eileen was a teacher who instilled in us a thirst for knowledge and deep passion for learning. 


Eileen touched many hearts and minds. I will always remember Eileen with great fondness and as an exceptional teacher and a dear friend; as a woman of great value.She passed away on April 6, 2018. 
May she Rest in Peace.
