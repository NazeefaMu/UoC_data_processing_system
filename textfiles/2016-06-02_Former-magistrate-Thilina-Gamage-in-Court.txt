Former magistrate Thilina Gamage was present at the Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court today in connection with the CID investigation into allegations of rearing an elephant without a license.

In a B report, the CID named the former magistrate as the fourth suspect in the case on the instructions of the AG.

On an earlier occasion, the suspect’s counsel had sought anticipatory bail resulting in the Court noticing the prosecution to be present in court to respond to the bail application.

The Court is expected to rule on the bail application at 6.00 p.m. today.  (Shehan Chamika Silva)
