The Maldives government has declared a state of emergency for 15 days amid a political crisis in the island nation.

The state of emergency gives security officials extra powers to arrest suspects, reports say.

The government has already suspended parliament and ordered the army to resist any moves by the Supreme Court to impeach President Abdulla Yameen.

The court had ordered the release of nine MPs, which would see the opposition majority restored.

In a landmark decision, it also ruled the trial of ex-President Mohamed Nasheed unconstitutional. (BBC)
