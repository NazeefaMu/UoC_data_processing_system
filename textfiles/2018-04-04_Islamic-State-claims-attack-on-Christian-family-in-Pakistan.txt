Quetta REUTERS April 3 - The militant group Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility for killing four members of a Christian family in southwestern Pakistan.    A statement issued by the group claimed that militants belonging to ISIS fired on the group of Christians as they were travelling in the city of Quetta, killing four on Monday.    Islamic State has affiliates in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, many drawn from existing Islamist militant groups, who support their vehement sectarian views against Shi’ite Muslims and non-Muslims.   


 The family was travelling in a rickshaw when armed men on a motorcycle intercepted them and opened fire in Quetta city, the capital of Baluchistan province.  The family had come to visit relatives in Quetta’s Shahzaman road area, where a large number of the city’s Christian community lives.
