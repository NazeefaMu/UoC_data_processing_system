A‘giant’ in the making!

Pictures by Thushara Fernando
It was pure chance and fate that brought him into active politics. He has not looked back since he took the plunge.
Mayantha Yaswanth Dissanayake, born on January 11, 1974 in Colombo, has sufficient credentials. He was the younger son of Srimathi Dissanayake and the late Gamini Dissanayake. He is currently an MP from the Kandy District and the Chief Organizer for Yatinuwara electorate representing the United National Party.
Mayantha describes himself as a fair and reasonable person with a kind heart. He observes sometimes telling the truth too much and seeing things in black and white have put him in difficulty. More than anything, he seeks truthfulness, honesty, integrity and loyalty from others.
This young gentleman takes late president John F Kennedy’s words “Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country,” as a guideline and says it is his favourite dictum.
Role model
Dissanayake reveals his childhood dream was to be like late President J R Jayewardene.
“He was my hero and idol. I was at a very young age then and I did not comprehend that he was the President of the country. However, when we met him he treated us like grandchildren. He was very warm. We were very close to him because of my father,” he narrates.
Even though he likes when people call him ‘like father like son’, he recalls that it is his mother’s influence which made him who he is today. “No doubt, my father has left a great image and legacy, but it is my mother and brother who played a huge role in my life when I was growing up. My father was a full time politician in charge of the accelerated Mahaweli Project, one of the largest development projects in the history of this country. Therefore, we did not get much time to interact with him as a father and sometimes we hardly saw him,” he ponders his past.
He recollects with a sense of gratitude how his mother and brother Navin, who is currently an MP for the Nuwara Eliya district, stood by him since his father’s untimely death.
“That few seconds, when I heard my father was assassinated for no other reason than his political belief, was the most shocking, horrific and nightmare experience in my life. I don’t think I would ever recover from it. I was about 19 years old then,” he reminisces with pain.
Following father’s footsteps
Dissanayake says he tries to follow his father’s footsteps to contribute to the development of the country and serve its people, but maintains that the comparison is not fair because he and his brother have not yet been given the opportunities his father had.
However, he reasons that there is a saying that ‘the apple does not fall far from the tree’ meaning that one day an apple can become a huge tree like its parent tree. “That is what we want to do. We want to see the UNP government excels and delivers to the people. We would like to see a Mahaweli age back in this country,” he says with resolution.
Dissanyake holds a Degree in Printing Management in Rochester Institute of Technology in New York and has also followed a Higher National Diploma in Printing Technology from the London College of Printing.
“I studied at Royal College in Colombo and St Thomas’ Prep. In the era from 1987-89, there were insurgencies in the country and bombs were exploding all over. There were a lot of political assassinations. It was in that context, my parents decided to send me to a boarding school in the UK. I remember the first time that I went to England. I was the only Asian boy in my dormitory in the boarding school. I was thinking why my parents took such a harsh decision and bring me to this strange land. My English was not so good. My knowledge of history, geography and French was not up to the level of other kids. I had to struggle hard to come up to their standards,” he recalls.
Hobbies
Dissanayake is an energetic youth who loves swimming and diving very much. “I really enjoy diving. I am now doing my technical diving.” He has also played little cricket at school. “Cricket is my favourite game, but I like Rugby and football as well. Currently, I am the Vice President of the Baseball Federation in Sri Lanka and I am beginning to like the game of baseball. Whenever I have time I go and watch international ODI cricket matches or rugby matches”.
Being a dynamic young leader, Dissanayake has also got the opportunity to be selected through the US Embassy to an international leadership programme conducted by the US State Department last year. He has been familiar with the American system of governance during the programme.
“That was a memorable learning experience that I will remember for the rest of my life,” he says with excitement.
Spending time with family
Politicians of our time have little time of their own and it is not an exception for Dissanayake. He likes to spend his precious time off with his family. Among the books he has read, George Orwell’s Animal Farm was a novel that was sticking in his mind when he was growing up. He likes the songs of Sunil Shantha, and when it comes to English he enjoys Frank Sinatra’s music a lot. He describes the film ‘Truman’ based on the American president Harry Truman as the most interesting film that he has watched. He loves to spend his holiday anywhere in the hill country, as he likes the cooler climate and hills.
He also identifies himself as a very shy and private person. “People think when they see and talk to me that I am not, because when I am on stage and make a political speech it is a different personality that they see” he discloses. He also expresses that he is excellent in keeping secrets. “However, if I hear something interesting, but not damaging to somebody I would share it with my wife,” he explains fervently.
Love at first sight? No
He says he does not believe in love at first sight. “I met my soul mate through my mother. My mother knew the parents of her family very well. It was a kind of proposal. I got married in 2004,” he replies.
Commenting on his religious views he tags himself as a good Buddhist and believer in the Hindu Gods, adding that he goes to both temple and kovil. “I want people to be somewhat religious and believe in something because that will give you focus and purpose. I am an eggetarian and drink milk [ovo-lacto vegetarian]. But I don’t eat meat and fish, not even Maldive fish,” he adds.
He thinks the influence of the great leaders and statesmen that he had the opportunity to associate with helped him develop his leadership qualities. “For example, I see Ranil Wickremesinghe as a great leader that I can really learn from. He is a very patient leader. It is he who invited me to be in politics. As for me, I tell people what I can do for them and what I want to do for them. I generally tell the truth. It feels very good to know that you are being loved by the people, but it also humbles you because when people love and care for you it is an encouragement to do more for them. If I can help in any way to make people’s lives better, I will contribute towards that,” he explains.
He maintains that the traditional politics in Sri Lanka has to change. He is of the view that youngsters and people with ability should be given a more prominent role. However he adds that the Government is on the right track, while expressing that Sri Lanka is in need of a new Constitution, a new electoral system, bill of rights as well as the Right to Information Act.
