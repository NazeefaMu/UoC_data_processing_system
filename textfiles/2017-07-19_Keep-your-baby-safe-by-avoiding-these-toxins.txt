Keep your baby safe by avoiding these toxins!

Mums would do anything to protect their babies and ensure safety. It’s an instinct they’re born with. Yet, according to environmental studies, children are exposed to as much as 27 dangerous chemicals a day through personal care products. Mothers allow this not because they don’t care for their children or knowingly expose them to danger, but because they lack knowledge. They don’t understand how dangerous these chemicals can be or the damage they can cause to a developing baby.

 
According to the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG), “The EPA has determined that infants up to age 2 are, on average, 10 times more vulnerable to carcinogenic chemicals than adults, and from age 2 to 15 they are 3 times more vulnerable to carcinogens than adults.”  


This is vital information that every parent must know. As a society, we must be concerned about what our children absorb through their skin, the body’s largest organ. There are numerous ingredients we should avoid in a plethora of products, from soaps, washes, powders, and lotions to laundry detergent, candles, and air fresheners. It’s scary, but true that some potentially toxic ingredients and known carcinogens are not even required by law to be labeled on products.The best option is to stick with natural, nourishing, and certified organic ingredients.   


So to keep your baby safe, always read the labels and avoid using baby-care products that use any of these toxic chemicals.  

 

Talc  
This powdered mineral is added to baby powder (and many other cosmetic powders). It’s used as a drying agent, but it’s a known lung irritant and may also be carcinogenic. As Gillian Deacon describes in her book ‘There’s Lead In Your Lipstick’: “The mineral talc tends to occur in rock mass formations that intermingle with other magnesium silicate minerals, including the highly dangerous asbestos. Since it’s virtually impossible to extract the talc rock from the asbestos during the mining process, the carcinogenic contaminant will almost invariably  be carried over into any consumer product containing talc.”  

 



Fragrance  
Fragrance is added to countless products, either to give a particular fragrance or to mask the odour of the nasty chemicals used in the product. The problem with fragrance is that it’s a catch-all term for whatever secret ingredients companies wish to add and are generally made of coal- and petroleum-derived synthetic chemicals.  


The effects of fragrance are long lasting, linger on the skin for hours, and can cause respiratory, neurological, skin, and eye damage. There is evidence that exposure to fragrance as a child may lead to asthma.   

 

Proplyene glycol  
This chemical is a penetration enhancer that is easily absorbed by the skin and may be carcinogenic. Its job is to open up all the pores and let the other chemicals in. Propylene glycol is used in wiper fluid and to de-ice airplanes, and yet it is often found in baby wipes, which is not safe. Look out for polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) on labels, too.  

 


1,4-dioxane and ethylated surfactants  
This is a by-product of a cheap manufacturing process called ethoxylation. This process uses a cancer-causing petrochemical ethylene oxide. The result is something that is a carcinogen, kidney toxicant, neurotoxin, and respiratory toxin. Not good. Because it’s a by-product of a manufacturing process and not an ingredient itself. You really have to be aware to avoid it.  


If you see any ingredients that contain the letters eth, then that is an indicator of the presence of 1,4-dioxane. Stay away from polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, sodium laureth sulfate, ceteareth, oleth, oxynol, -xynol, and PEG.  

 

Mineral oil  
Baby oil is essentially made of mineral oil mixed with fragrance, which is a nasty combination. Mineral oil is a cheap byproduct of petroleum processing and acts as a plastic wrap on the skin, inhibiting the skin’s ability to release toxins. Opt instead for natural and nourishing oils such as certified organic olive, coconut, or sweet almond to massage into your baby’s skin.  

 

Parabens  
Unfortunately parabens are everywhere. They can be found in all soaps, body washes, shampoos, and moisturizers, including those marketed toward babies. Parabens are neurotoxins and are linked to reproductive toxicity, hormone disruption, and skin irritation. Stay away from anything with ‘paraben’ in its name, as well as benzoic acid and propyl ester.  

 

Triclosan  
Anything that’s labeled as ‘antibacterial’ likely contains triclosan, which is a carcinogenic endocrine disruptor that’s harmful to the environment. Although it makes sense to keep your baby away from unnecessary bacteria, that’s the wrong approach to take. By raising our babies in sterile environments, we inhibit their ability to create natural resistance and immunity, increase the likelihood of allergies, and render antibacterial treatments less effective for when we truly need them to work.   
In summary, as much as its important to apply things on our babies, our children and our bodies, its also important to know what we are putting on them. So the next time you shop for a bath wash or moisturising cream take a good look at the ingredients- where ever possible look for pure, natural, certified organic products because they are the safest. Also remember to watch out for those toxic Phthalates and Parabens that can cause a host of skin irritations and other complications, especially in your precious children.
