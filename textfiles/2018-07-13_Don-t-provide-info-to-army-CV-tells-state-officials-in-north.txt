Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vignewswaran has requested all state officials in the Northern Province not to provide any information to the army without seeking his advice.

“If the army requested for any information, you tell them that I had requested you not to give them any information without my approval,” he said at an event held in Kilinochchi yesterday.

The Chief Minister said people in the north had been inconvenienced due to the three form of administration by the central government, Provincial council and also by administration of the governor.

“That is why we request for federal governance from the beginning. Apart from that we should request for self-governance for the nine provinces,” he said. (Romesh madushanka)
