No regrets: Rosy


	

Former State Minister and UNP Colombo district candidate Rosy Senanayake, who failed in her bid for re-election, told Daily Mirror that having to confine her campaign within the Colombo West electorate was one of the reasons to have obtained only 65,320 preferential votes.
She said her fellow candidates were not too happy when she visited other electorates in the Colombo district to carry out her election campaign and as such found it difficult to widen the scope of her campaign.
“A UNP victory and to install a UNP-led government was my priority and I expended all my efforts to make it happen and I am overjoyed that it did happen. This is another reason why I was unable to fully focus on my campaign while most of my colleagues were focusing on their personal campaign and ensure their victory above all else. However, my party won and I am really happy about that. I respect the people’s verdict. After all this is what politics means,” Ms. Senanayake said.
She said the UNP’s election victory was as good as if she herself had won and therefore had no regrets. (Piyumi Fonseka)
