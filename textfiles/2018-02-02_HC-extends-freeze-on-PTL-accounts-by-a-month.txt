The Colombo High Court yesterday made an order extending the freeze of all bank accounts of the Perpetual Group associated with Arjun Aloysius by one month, sources said.

Following an application made by the Attorney General on behalf of the CID, the High Court extended the order made last week by the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the CBSL freezing the operations of bank accounts of all 24 companies within the Perpetual group.

Earlier, on January 24, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) issued a directive that none of the 24 companies within the group can carry out financial business of any sort using the funds in their bank accounts.

Among the companies in the group are Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd, Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, W. M. Mendis & Co Ltd and Integrated Media Networks (Pvt) Ltd. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
