Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran is to play a major role in finalizing trade agreements with foreign countries including the proposed Indo-Lanka Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ECTA), top government sources said today.

He is also expected to play a role in the government’s programme of providing one million jobs which was one of the pledges made by the Government during the recent elections.

Mr. Mahendran is expected to be assisted by several top personalities from the private sector in implementing the programme to generate one million jobs.

Sources said he would play a major role in initiating the free trade agreements which Sri Lanka hoped to sign with China and Singapore.

Mr. Mahendran is expected to return to the country today and will participate in a meeting with experts in several fields at Temple Trees on Thursday. (Yohan Perera)
