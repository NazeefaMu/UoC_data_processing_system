	Attorney Nuwan Bopage and Kirthi Ratna Perera, who were arrested on charges of having been involved in a protest against the dumping of garbage at Meethotamulla were today released on bail after an identification parade held at the Court premises.
	Additional Magistrate Mohommad Mihar released them on a surety bail of Rs.100,000.
	Counsel Saliya Peiris with several other lawyers appeared for the suspects.
	He said the police arrested them maliciously with an ulterior motive on a false complaint and had done so without conducting a proper investigation by violating certain provisions of the law.
	The counsel said his clients were the victims in the alleged attack at the Meethotamulla garbage dump while conducting a peaceful protest against the Meethotamulla UC. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
