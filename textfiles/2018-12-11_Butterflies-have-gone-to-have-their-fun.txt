“Butterflies have gone to have their fun!”


	

The Green party had recently organized a special pooja at a famous devalaya in the deep South to seek the intervention of deities for the resolution of the ongoing political crisis to their satisfaction.   




A coconut-breaking ritual was the main part of the ceremony. But some party bigwigs, leaving the responsibility of conducting the ritual in the hands of lesser mortals had left for a bungalow in a ‘deniya’ to have a good fun time.   


A party stalwart having his political base in the deep South visibly hurt by the conduct of the party bigwigs had remarked: “We are the log-hauling elephants. Butterflies have gone to have their fun!”
