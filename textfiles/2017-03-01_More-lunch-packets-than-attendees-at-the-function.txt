More lunch packets than attendees at the function


	



 

Number One in yahapalanaya paid an official visit to Uva to inaugurate a big development project in the province.

 


A big-mouthed purohita from Uva who was lucky enough to make it to Diyawanna despite losing at the polls was in charge of organizing the important event and had wanted to make use of the occasion to showcase the extent of his popularity. So he had made all preparations to ensure a good turnout at the inaugural ceremony of the project and got about 3,500 lunch packets ready for distributing to the people attending it. 


However, the turnout at the event turned out to be a severe disappointment for the purohita for it hardly accounted for half the number of lunch packets available for distribution. So the purohita’s wife had generously offered the participants two or three lunch packets each. 


The purohita’s supporters who were involved in distributing the lunch packets, in a bid to dispose of the excess in a hurry had sent a number of parcels to a political office of a member of the former royal family, now an arch political rival of the purohita.


The employees of the political office who had been feeling of the pangs of hunger at the time had thankfully accepted the lunch parcels, they say.
