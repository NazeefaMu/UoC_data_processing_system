A rumour abuzz in political circles says that a yahapalanaya purohita has floated a shipping company from foreign shores. He is a party leader who is clever at boosting his political fortunes by allying with whatever government in power at the opportune moment.
 The company, according to informed ones is registered in a developed country in East Asia and the few ships it owns are already plying in international waters.   
“Now many would ask how this politico had raised enough money to launch a shipping line. The answer is not far to seek. The high office he had held in two previous governments was a veritable gold mine,” a political source explained. 
He added, “While on the subject of shipping business, earlier we could talk only about one politician – a chief purohita – raised to ship owner status by our voters.  Now our voters despite a majority having to make a struggle to eke out a living can proudly declare that at least two of their representatives have become ship owners thanks to their precious vote.”
