A senior official told Daily Mirror Mr. Mahendran was grilled in connection with a complaint made against him in connection with treasury bonds issued to a private company involved with his son-in-law. 
The Governor who left for Singapore on March 9 in the midst of the Treasury bond controversy had said he was ready to face an inquiry when he returned to the country.
