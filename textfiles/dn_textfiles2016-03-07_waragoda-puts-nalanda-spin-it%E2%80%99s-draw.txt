Waragoda puts Nalanda in a spin, but it’s a draw

Off-spinner Supun Waragoda’s seven-wicket haul (4 for 13 and 3 for 28) for Ananda College was the highlight of the final day in the 87th annual Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter against Nalanda which ended in a tame draw at the SSC grounds yesterday.
A supporter who ran onto the playing area is deftly being shown where he belongs by the long arm of the law.
Ananda continuing from their overnight first innings total of 55 for 1 in reply to Nalanda’s first innings of 197 declared at 216 runs for four wickets, with a lead of 19 runs. Opener Rahal Avishka made a flying start racing to 84 off 127 balls with 13 fours but fell 16 short of scoring a hundred when he was stumped by Sandaruwan off Kavindu Bandara. Ashel Sigera (41 n.o. with 6 fours) and Kavishka Anjula (44 n.o. with 6 fours and a six) shared an unbroken 61-run stand for the sixth wicket before the declaration. Nalanda in their second innings struggled to 106 for six wickets of which Suhange Wijewardane contributed a fighting unbeaten 40 off 85 balls (3 fours) to stall the Anandians from running through their batting a second time. Waragada with three wickets and a match bag of seven wickets was adjudged the man of the match.
