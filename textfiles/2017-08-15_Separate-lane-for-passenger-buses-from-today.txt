The ‘Priority Bus Lanes’ introduced by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry with the objective of easing the traffic congestion, was commenced this morning from Moratuwa - Kurusa junction to Katubedda.

Minister Champika Ranawaka inaugurated the event. Under this concept, all private and SLTB buses travelling to Colombo along Galle Road will be restricted to the left-most lane from ‘Kurusa Junction’ at Moratuwa to Katubedda Junction and from Savoy Cinema Junction at Wellawatta to Bambalapitya Junction from today to next Tuesday. From August 22 onward, buses will not be allowed to move out of far-left lane along the specified stretch. (Pix by Kithsiri de Mel)
