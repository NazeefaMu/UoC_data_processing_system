Vavuniya Campus of the University of Jaffna has been indefinitely closed due to a possible clash between Sinahla and Tamil students in the university, the university Administration said.

It was reported that a group of Sinhalese students had complained to the Administration about the Tamil students celebration of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran’s death anniversary on the 26th November and the administration has decided to close down the university to prevent any possible clash between the two student groups.

Around 600 students who are occupying the hostel had been advised to evacuate the university premises by this evening. (Romesh Madushanka)
