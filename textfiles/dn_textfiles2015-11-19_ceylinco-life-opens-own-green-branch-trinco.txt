Ceylinco Life opens own Green branch in Trinco

Ceylinco Life has opened its new branch building in Trincomalee, custom-built to a new eco-friendly model adopted by the life insurance leader for branches being constructed on company-owned land.
The new four-storeybuilding of approximately 11,000 square feet stands on 62.65 perches land at Kandy Road, Trincomalee. It accommodates seven branches and one customer service section and has a 24-vehicle car park for customers, the company said.
The building with a floor area of approximately 11,000 square feet is designed to use natural light on all floors, uses natural ventilation in common areas, lobbies and its lunch room, is solar powered, has a rainwater harvesting facility and is equipped with energy-efficient air-conditioning, making it one of the most eco-friendly offices of its size in the Eastern Province capital.
The new office building was opened by Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan on November 14, one year after he laid the foundation stone for it.
A similar branch building designed to use renewable energy and water is nearing completion at Wennappuwa, while construction of another branch at Horana will begin in late November, the company said.
In August this year, Ceylinco Life opened an eco-friendly, four-storey branch office on company owned land in Bandarawela. The company already owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia, in addition to Trincomalee.
