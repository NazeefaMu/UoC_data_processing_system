	Former Immigration and Emigration Controller Chulananda Perera was appointed as the New Director General of Customs today.
	Assuming duties at the Customs Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, Mr. Perera said the field of Customs is new to him though he had served in Departments, Administrative Services and Ministries.
	“This is a new field to me. I have to study and figure out what the government and the people expect from my duties. For that, I need at least two weeks or one month to study about this Department,” he said. (Pix by Kushan Pathiraja)
