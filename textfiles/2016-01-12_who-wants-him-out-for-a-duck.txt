Who wants him out for a duck?


	


Now it is well known that the star willow wielder who was once offered a top diplomatic posting has become the whipping boy over the recent Enrique show-related tax evasion affair.
The question why the idol of the popular game was being relentlessly attacked over the tax affair was the main topic that figured at a discussion among a dozen of prominent political figures who attended a year-end party in the city.  The political figures at this party had agreed that it was quite okay for the Municipal authorities to take necessary legal action against the organizers of the event if they had dodged payment of the entertainment levy, but there was no justification for making unceasing direct and indirect attacks on the star player. 
The discussion had taken a different direction when one of the politicos had pointed out that the willow wielder’s name was being mentioned as being a likely runner for the main chair of the city at the local polls round the corner. And this bit of news set the others openly wondering whether the tax issue was being used by interested parties to have  the star player out for a duck at the start of his political innings.
