Tax concessions were not given to the Northern and Uva Provinces to open up liquor distilleries or to create employment through them, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.

During a press conference held at the Ministry, Minister Ranawaka made these remarks in connection with the construction of a liquor distillery in Kalkuda, Batticaloa.

“We are against those who open liquor distilleries in the North and Uva provinces, as special relief was given to those areas because of the poverty levels, not to open liquor distilleries. The main intension of the tax concessions is to develop the province and create employment opportunities,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
