Legal age limit for trishaw drivers who provide public transport should be increased to 25, Chairman of the National Council for Road Safety, Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said today.

He said those who were below 25 years of age should not be allowed to transport people considering the safety of the passengers.

Responding to a question, Mr. Kodagoda said a probation period of at least two years should also be given to them.

He said the National Council for Road Safety would inform the relevant government authorities to work on their proposal regarding the age limit.

“This proposal is to ensure the safety of the passengers because many of the fatal  accidents involving three-wheelers have been driven by drivers below 25,” he said.
