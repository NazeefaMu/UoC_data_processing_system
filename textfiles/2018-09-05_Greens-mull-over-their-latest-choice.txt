Greens mull over their latest choice!


	



 

The Green party seniors for some time have been looking for an alternative candidate for the big poll in case their leader decides to step down.

 


The party’s deputy of Gam Udawa fame, Madduma from Uva and Willow Wielder Sanga have been among the most popular choices of the party’s rank and file so far. But they all have declined the honour. In fact, at least for one of them astrologically auspicious hour is yet to come.


Meanwhile, several seniors of the Green party’s highest decision-making body are said to have come up with a new name. Though the choice is new, the name, of course, is not new to the party for it is connected to an old Green family.


This character hailing from the upcountry is said to be having blood ties to occupants of several big chairs in the Diyawanna council, they say.
