Chris Gayle fined $10,000 by Melbourne Renegades, Big Bash League team apologises to Mel McLaughlin

 
Chris Gayle has been fined $10,000 by his Big Bash League team the Melbourne Renegades following his controversial interview with Channel Ten reporter Mel McLaughlin.
 
In doing so, the Renegades have extended a formal apology to Mel McLaughlin after Gayle made inappropriate comments during Monday night's Big Bash clash against the Hobart Hurricanes.
 
"Chris's comments were completely inappropriate and disrespectful and there is simply no place for these kind of comments at the Melbourne Renegades or the broader community across any sport," Renegades chief executive Stuart Coventry said in a statement.
 
"The club would like to extend a formal apology to Mel McLaughlin. Mel is an outstanding sports presenter. We think of her very highly and the club and the players will ensure we work with her in a professional and respectful manner in the future.
 
"We've had several discussions with Chris in the last 24 hours and he has acknowledged that his comments were out of line."
 
Gayle's fine will be donated to the McGrath Foundation.
 
"We didn't think the situation would require a ban," Coventry told the media gathering.
 
"We looked at the circumstances and we saw it as a one-off scenario.
 
"We looked at the circumstances and we think this is a one-off scenario.
 
"We looked at Chris's attitude over the last four or five weeks in the Big Bash games and it has been first class and outstanding."
 
Coventry said Gayle was surprised by the fine, but will play in the all-Melbourne clash against the Stars.
 
"He was quite surprised but he has accepted it in good faith and is looking forward to playing in the derby on Saturday."
 
Gayle caused a media storm after an interview with McLaughlin after smashing 41 runs off 15 balls for the Melbourne Renegades in their Big Bash clash with the Hobart Hurricanes.
 
McLaughlin asked Gayle about the aggression on display in the Renegades' innings during their win over the Hurricanes and the ex-West Indies Test captain took the interview in a completely different direction.
 
"I wanted to come and have an interview with you as well. That's the reason why I'm here, just to see your eyes for the first time," he said.
 
"Hopefully we can win this game and we can have a drink later. Don't blush, baby."
 
A visibly rattled McLaughlin responded by saying: "I'm not blushing."
 
Renegades deny Gayle has a track record
 
But Coventry and the Renegades have denied Gayle has a track record of poor behaviour towards female journalists despite others coming forward with stories similar to the incident with McLaughlin.
 
"I'm unfamiliar with what those journalists have said and the grounds and evidence behind that," Coventry said.
 
"We've done a fair bit of history and research today and we do think it is a one-off. As explained this morning we think it is more of a cultural indifference as to why he said and it was done in jest.
 
"But it is inappropriate and we have taken this course of action.
 
"We think that Chris's contribution is very positive around the group. He is a seasoned professional. He just said the wrong thing at the wrong time. He's copped that and he has copped the fine." (ABC News)
