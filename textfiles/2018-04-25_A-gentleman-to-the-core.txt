A gentleman to the core


	

FREDDIE ALLES 



It is almost three months since our dear friend Freddie left us. Freddie left a little too early, but his, was a life well lived. A chartered accountant by profession, he was more a man of automobiles than accounts. Freddie was a walking Encyclopaedia on automobiles be it vintage, classic, sports or modern exotic cars. His collection of cars included the rarest models of Rolls Royces, Hopmobile, Bogward Isabella, DKWs, Fiats, Alfa Romeo, MGs, Daimler, Mercedes, Opel Recard, Opel Kapitan, Citroen, Jaguars, Jowett Javelin and many more. 

His cars were not merely for show, for he used his cars regularly, for private running all over the country and also at the many Sunday Runs, which he almost never missed. Freddie used to talk fondly about how he started his collection with a Fiat 500, 4Sri 4080 for Rs. 5000/- whilst working at Hayleys and how he used to race his MG in his younger days.   

Pursuant to his death early this year, his friend Nimal Wimalasuriya wrote in the Motormaglanka.lk:   

‘In the month of February, the Classic/Vintage car community of Sri Lanka lost one of its ardent fans. One could describe Freddie Alles with a myriad of titles associated with Classic/Vintage cars such as a Collector, Historian, Enthusiast and even a Walking Encyclopaedia; but the most apt title that one could give him was “Gentleman” .. .’ Freddie was indeed that, a gentleman to the core. 

He was one of the founder members of the Mercedes Benz Club of Sri Lanka, founded in 1990 and was the President of the Club again in the year 2017 having being its President earlier too. He was one of the strongest pillars of the Mercedes Benz Club. He was also an active member of the Classic Car Club of Ceylon, a senior member of the Vintage Car Club of Ceylon, member of the Italian Car Enthusiasts Club and also in several international automobile clubs. Freddie was an asset to any club as he got involved in all aspects of club activities with absolute dedication and passion.   

I first met Freddie long years ago in the Mercedes Benz Club and we gradually became close friends. In the last couple of years, not a day passed by where we had not contacted each other, either by phone, email or Whatsapp and I just cannot bring myself to erase those records from my phone. We exchanged messages even as late as January this year, and all those messages are still intact in my phone.   

Freddie was always there for a friend and many a time when I had some little issue with an old car and phoned him to get his advice, he would be at my place sometimes within minutes to help me out. He made time for people and his knowledge of automobiles was amazing.   

Freddie was a warm, down to earth human being. He had a habit of coming up to the car to see you off and-even in his last days, suffering with acute pain he would still walk us to the car to say good bye. He helped car enthusiasts in every way possible, and some were barely known to him. He helped anyone who asked for help or had a problem. Freddie helped people and causes quietly. He was closely associated with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society and served in many capacities including that of its President.   
His love for his family was as intense and all encompassing as his love of cars. He would often send us photos of the frequent road trips he used to take with family, his visits to car museums and car shows from all over the world, of his beloved children and grand children, and pictures of him and Shanthi, his beloved wife or with his children taken when they were young or photos from his racing days. He thought the world of his family.   

The motoring fraternity lost a true motoring enthusiast. The family, a much loved husband, father, a grandfather, a brother, and we lost a true friend, a man with a golden heart.   

May God bless his soul!
