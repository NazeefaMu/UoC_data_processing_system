Committed to enhancing customer convenience, People’s Bank has embarked on an aggressive digitalization drive to deliver greater convenience and speed to customers. 


In a unique initiative to empower its customer base, People’s Bank has launched the ‘People’s Smart Phone Easy Payment Scheme’ in partnership with two leading telecom operators in the country, Dialog and Mobitel. 


This innovative scheme enables the bank’s 13 million customer base island wide to purchase smartphones - from either of the mobile service providers - at 0 percent interest with installment plans of up to 24 - months with the People’s Bank Voice banking app. 


This scheme will help People’s Bank customers to own their dream smart phone and will on the other hand help the bank build its relationship with the customer as well as to popularize digital banking. The ‘People’s Smart Phone Easy Payment Scheme’ promotion is valid upto 31st March 2017.
The People’s Bank Voice App, which empowers customers to check their account balance via their mobile phones by a simple voice command, will be the first of many apps that the bank is rolling out to its customers to enable seamless banking on their Android, Windows and iOSenabled smartphones. 
Customers interested in purchasing a smartphone through the ‘People’s Smartphone Easy Payment Scheme’ will need to have a sufficient balance in their Savings, FD or NRFC account. Customers balance will be held in their account and they will be eligible to purchase a smartphone for 95% of the value held in the account. Eligible customers will be issued a letter at their request to purchase a smart phone, which can be presented at any Dialog or Mobitel office to enable them to make use of the special price. Once the initial payment is made, the customer can then opt to pay a reasonable monthly installment to cover the remaining amount 
that is due.
