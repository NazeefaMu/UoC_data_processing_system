Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC’s, Daskam, a value-added children’s savings account, is the ideal gift for children joining preschool or Grade One this year.
Daskam children’s savings account aims to be a pillar of strength to a child when he/she enters adulthood and takes on life’s challenges such as higher education, marriage, etc. 
The account offers a ‘deposit for deposit’ feature that enables its balance to grow in greater proportions. Under this feature, every deposit made by the customer to the account will be rewarded by the bank with an additional deposit worth 10 percent of the customer deposit.
In addition, for faster growth of the account balance, Pan Asia Bank then pays an unbeatable annual interest of 8 percent (AER 8.33 percent) on the total balance. The interest is calculated on a daily basis and credited to the account at the end of each month. For example, if a customer deposits Rs.100, 000 to a Daskam children’s savings account, the bank will make an additional deposit of Rs.10,000 to that account immediately and begin to calculate interest at 8 percent (AER 8.33 percent) on the total balance of Rs.110,000. 
The benefit of receiving an additional 10 percent deposit from the bank is valid for any number of deposits until the child turns 12 years of age. 
At the core of Daskam children’s savings account is Pan Asia Bank’s ambition to provide a stable financial foundation for children when they turn 18, at which point they need to support for their higher education dreams, etc. 
Pan Asia Bank DGM Marketing and Card Products Nalaka Wijayawardana said, “With the introduction of Daskam children’s savings account, we have empowered parents to make a responsible choice for their children’s future that would help them face life’s challenges with confidence and reach their full potential.”
