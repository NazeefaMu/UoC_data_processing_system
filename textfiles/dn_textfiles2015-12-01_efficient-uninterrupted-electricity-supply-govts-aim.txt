'Efficient, uninterrupted electricity supply govt's aim'

The government's intention is to provide an efficient, uninterrupted and quality electricity supply to the consumers. The four percent Nation Building Tax levied by the Budget will never be passed on to the consumers, Power and Renewable Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister was addressing ministry staff when Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera assumed duties at his new office on November 30.
Siyambalapitiya said eventhough he and Deputy Minister Perera belonged to two different political parties they were following the same path with great mutual understanding as service to the people was their main objective and concern.
This united stand would ensure great progress to the ministry in the future.
Siyambalapitiya said their concern was to provide electricity supplies to two percent of the population which had been denied the facility. They would also work hard to provide job satisfaction to the 20,000 workforce attached to the ministry and institutions under its purview.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said it was a happy occasion as his ministry has received a new auditorium and a refurbished office.
Emphasising the need for leaders and members of all parties in the national unity government to shed party differences and affiliations and work in unity if they were to continue for the full term of five years. Perera said he and his minister had been able to subscribe to this view and work together to give effective leadership to find solutions to problems affecting the power sector by identifying and classifying them into short term and long term problems.
He said some people below the poverty line were suffering today due to lack of electricity. They would be provided an advance of Rs. 40,000 each to obtain electricity to their homes under a simple formula provided that the grama sevaka certified their residence even if they did not have ownership to their houses.
