Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath Bill in contravention with Constitution


The Supreme Court held that the Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath Bill was in contravention with the Constitution and required two –third majority in Parliament and a referendum to be enacted.
 
Earlier, a Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled "Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015" was taken up before the Supreme Court for argument.
 
This petition had been filed by Shasanika Secretary of the "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Ven. Biyagama Suseela Thera of the Sri Bodhi Vihara Pirivena in Udahamulla, Nugegoda.
 
In his petition, the petitioner sought a declaration that the Bill shall become law only trough a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum. Presenting submissions before the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Eva Wanasundara and Justice Sisira de Abrew, President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appearing for the petitioner informed Court that intervention by the State to impose punishment on bhikkus through the proposed Bill was not ethical.
 
He contended that through the provisions of the proposed Bill, the confidentiality of Kathikawath inquiry could be destroyed.
 
President's Counsel Silva further said criminal proceedings against Bhikkus would result in giving wide publicity to tarnish the Buddha Sasana.
 
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Sobhitha Rajakaruna appearing for the Attorney General submitted to Court that section 2 (2), (3) and (4) of the bill could be removed.
 
Further argument was fixed for today (27).
 
The petitioner stated that a Bill titled "Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015" was published by way of gazette on December 14, 2015 on the orders of the Minister of Buddha Sasana.
 
He stated that on January 12, 2016 the said Bill was placed on the Order Paper of Parliament.
 
The petitioner stated that clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are in violation of Articles 3, 4 (c) and (d), 9, 10, 11, 12 (1), 12 (2), 14(1)(b), 14(1)(c), 14(1)(e), 27 and 28 of the Constitution.
 
The petitioner said the Bill applies only to Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition and thereby draws a distinction between Bhikkus of the Mahayana tradition and the Theravada tradition, he further maintained that the Bill seeks to restrict the rights and freedoms of Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition in the exercise of their freedom of religion and their freedom of association whilst no such restriction is placed on any Bhikku of the Mahayana tradition or the clergy of the Christian or Catholic communities in Sri Lanka.
 
The petitioner is of the view that the Bill was seeking to restrict the rights of Bhikkus who do not belong to the Shyamopali, Ramannaya and Amarapura Maha Nikayas or Chapters established under any of the said Nikayas.
 
Accordingly, the rights of a Bhikku belonging to a Chapter or a Nikaya which is not recognized by or not part of any of the said Maha Nikayas are affected by the provisions of the said Bill.
 
The petitioner maintained that the distinction is drawn in violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners enshrined in Articles 12 (1) and 12 (2),
 
(1). Stipulating matters mandatory need to be included in a Kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Thought and Religion.
 
(2). Appointment of a panel to examine and decide the legality of a Kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
 
(3). Powers vested in the said panel is an exercise of Judicial Power.
 
(4). Compelling a Nikaya or Chapter to conduct an inquiry for every violation of the provisions of a registered kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
 
(5). Converting every violation of a decision of the Karaka Sanga Sabava of a chapter or religion to a criminal offence, is a violation of Equality before Law and Freedom of Religion.
 
(6). Empowering the Minister to frame registration with regard to matters hitherto exercised by the Sangha, is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
