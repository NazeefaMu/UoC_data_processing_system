A beacon of righteousness and officer par excellence
	
The sudden and unexpected demise of retired Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police Bodhi Liyanage has left a great void in our society, the Police Department and the Association of PoliceChiefs. The irreplaceable loss of this dynamic and vibrant personality will be felt far and wide and in many circles.

This tribute is in memory of a truly great human being who made an un-precedent contribution to the Police Department. It is no easy task to write a tribute to an eminent character of the likes of Bodhi Liyanage; however I shall strive to do justice to this remarkable personality.

For being a towering influence in my formative years in the Police Department and for the values he inculcated in me, I owe him an immeasurable debt of gratitude

I had the privilege of meeting him for the first time at the Colombo University where my brotherin-law was a very close friend of him and his batch mate. At university, acquitting him very well at a young age, he obtained a Degree in Economics and moved on after graduation to become a banker. Shortly after, the military beckoned him and he joined the Sri Lanka Army. However, it was the Police Department where his true calling lay and on August 1, 1974, he enrolled in the Police Department as a Probationary Assistant Superintendent, becoming the first in a batch of five after a competitive examination.
My second encounter with Bodhi Liyanage was in 1985 when he took over the Kandy Police Division as the Senior Superintendent of Police. I was then, only a novice Sub-Inspector in charge of a small police station under his purview. However, it so transpired that my daughter was a classmate of his eldest daughter Dinithi, fondly called Booni at Mahamaya Ladies College in Kandy, where they became firm friends. Partially owing to this fact amongst others, he always treated me well and always had a kind word for me. In 1988, the JVP insurrection broke out with all its chaos; my house in Kandy was partly burnt down and my eldest son kidnapped twice by the insurgents. It was when I contemplated leaving the service in fear of my familys security that my brother-in-law intervened and took me to Bodhi Liyanages residence in Kandy. His advice to me was, Do the justice you know and you shall learn to do the justice you need. With a telephone call to the DIG in charge of the province, he arranged a transfer to a safe location for me and my family. This move was truly a blessing as I received the opportunity to work under another great personality, Senior DIG Nimal Mediwake, who helped me and my family to overcome the agony we underwent in the years that followed. For this turn in my life, for being a towering influence in my formative years in the Police Department and for the values he inculcated in me, I owe him an immeasurable debt of gratitude. I met him once, quite recently, at the launch of his auto biography Anna Ekai Hari. This was attended by many senior officers, serving and retired, including the incumbent IGP Pujith Jayasundara, where he delivered an incisive speech for which he received a standing ovation. Spotting me in the crowd, he called me to hand over two books. He said, Gemunu, here are two autographed books for you and your wife with my compliments. 

Of Bodhi Liyanage it can be truly said, Titles of honour add not to his worth, who is himself an honour to his life

In 2008, after his retirement, I met him at a vehicle service station. Discussing many things, I asked him why he was deprived of what was surely a most deserving promotion as Inspector General of Police. His reply was that he being always conscious of the prestigious position he held, he preferred retirement, maintaining self-respect. Of Bodhi Liyanage it can be truly said, Titles of honour add not to his worth, who is himself an honour to his life. 
He and his family led a simple life, believing that happiness was not based on positions, power or wealth. He moved freely in the higher echelons of society and yet was accessible to all who wished to meet him. Amongst his many acts of humanity was helping the needy in their most miserable and needy times. Bodhi Liyanage hailed from a very respectable family in the South. A loving husband and devoted father, the greatest legacy he left his family was his unsullied title. Of him they can proudly proclaim, He was our father.  As a career Police Officer now retired, it is my belief that Bodhi Liyanages auto-biography be standard reading for junior and senior police officers alike, with police libraries islandwide preserving this book. Anna Ekai Hari (That is the right thing) should be standard credo in the police.
Poojatha Poojaniyanan  Respect those who deserve to be respected.
Bodhi Liyanage, a mentor and guru to countless many, a personality much larger than his life and a beacon of righteousness passed away peacefully after a sudden stroke on August 18 this year. May the blessings we pass on to you, prevent you from another untimely death in your sojourn in Sansara. May you come back to your wife, children and loved ones and into the void created by your loss.

around 90,000 Rohingya flee Myanmar violence
	

DAILY MAIL, 4 September, 2017- Nearly 90,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted in Myanmar in August, pressuring scarce resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar. The violence in Myanmar was set off by a coordinated attack on Aug. 25 on dozens of police posts and an army base by Rohingya insurgents. The ensuing clashes and a major military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people.Myanmar officials blamed the Rohingya militants for the burning of homes and civilian deaths but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to neighbouring Bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings by the Myanmar army aims to force them out. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmars roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution. 
The newest estimate, based on the calculations of United Nations aid workers in the Bangladeshi border district of Coxs Bazar, takes to nearly 150,000 the total number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October.

Cops provided with 90, 000 alcohol breathalyzer units
	
Traffic police officers countrywide are to intensify raids against drunken drivers in the coming days after they were provided with a consignment of 90, 000 blood alcohol sensing breathalyzers today yet fulfilling a dire need felt for months.
The Police Department today distributed a batch of 90, 000 brand new state-of-the-art blood alcohol sensing breathalyzers amongst its 42 Senior Superintendent Divisions around the country including that of the Colombo Traffic Police Headquarters, the Police Spokesman stated.
The dispatch of breathalyzer units were made following a severe shortage of such equipment for months making arrests related to drunk driving significantly minimal.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara in a communiqu disclosing the media yesterday that each and every police station will be provided with these units stated that the raids against drunken drivers will also be intensified in the coming days.
By intensifying such raids the police will also request from the judiciary to suspend the drivers license for a considerable period of those who get penalized over driving under the influence of liquor.
Speaking to Daily Mirror Deputy Inspector General in charge of Traffic Kamal Silva said the stock of modern handheld electronic breathalyzer units were imported from the UK on special tender board criteria.
He said the samples of the units were first referred to the Government Analyst Department from where the testing was done and the approval was granted for the procurement with the particular model.
According to the DIG, the police file 30,000 to 40,000 drunken driving cases in courts annually and testing a suspect through the breathalyzer is mandatory to determine whether he is under the influence or not for legal action.
However, a scarcity of these units in the recent months had crippled the duty of traffic police officers in performing their duty of apprehending a drunken driver, as in certain cases the culprits were daring to challenge the police officer demanding a scientific checkup prior to their arrest.
He said with the arrival of these new units the raids on drunken driving, which is a grave threat to the road safety, could be escalated in the near future and bring all those who disregard the law to book.
DIG Silva said a single unit of blood alcohol sensing breathalyzer unit is approximately cost around Rs.3,000 and that they could be used only once.
If the driver is under the influence beyond the registered measurement of consumption of alcohol, the green indictor will turn into red. Although the indication doesnt turn red or the driver was not found drunk, the unit cannot be used again, he said.
He warned all motorists to be aware the breathalyzers have been issued countrywide and policemen are compelled to take action if the driver is intoxicated while driving. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Gift elephants, legalise wild boar killing: Dy. Minister
	
Wild life laws should be amended and new laws should be implemented for common animal species that were considered threat to humans, Skills Development and Vocational Training Deputy Minister Karunarathne Paranawithana suggested while attending the Balangoda Coordination Committee yesterday.
The minister said most of the wild animals had some form of threat to humans and suitable measures should be taken to control the fast spreading animal species to minimise the conflict.
When it comes to human-elephant conflict, it had been a major problem in rural areas.
There are about 6,000 elephants in the country and its population is increasing rapidly. 6,000 elephants are too many for Sri Lankan forests to sustain. 4,000 elephants are more than enough, he said.
Im not recommending killing the elephants, but countrys animal rights and wild life laws should be amended. The laws should be amended to rear elephants as pets and surplus wild-elephants should be given to other countries to control the elephant population, Minister Paranawithana said.
Several participants made the Deputy Minister aware of the nuisance caused by other wild animals like wild boar and monkeys.
In response Deputy Minister Paranawithana stated that, if laws had been enforced legalising the killing of such animals, people should be allowed to sell their meat as well.
No one fuss about killing of mosquitoes. The social dialog regarding animal rights have become no more practical, he said.
He said that he would discuss the matter in the next parliament session. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: Happiness  is in your own backyard!

Happiness  is in your own backyard!
	
People seek happiness through various avenues. Many believe that they can be happy by accomplishing material things and dream of academic aspirations. 
Unfortunately the long process of observation and research is distressing. Even though they have acquisitions and amassed a lot of wealth, sadly they arent happy. 
Stress, distress, frustration, impatience, intolerance, depression, anxiety, disappointment, restlessness, anger, expectations, desires, greed, aspirations, an egocentric mentality, scars of psychological damages all add up and place barricades on our path to inner happiness. 
Most people never understand the fountain for inner happiness. They believe that it is external, but in reality it is the opposite of what they blindly believe in. 
From the beginning of their childhoods till the time they say goodbye to this world, they struggle to complete a list of achievements. While being in the process of collecting wealth and achieving desires, people realize that their loved ones and close associates are disturbed and tortured. Among them there are those who experience numerous miseries and tribulations. These achievers eventually miss the opportunity to experience happiness. When you comprehensively and intensely study this whole process, even though the purpose is achieving happiness, they havent been wise enough to maintain it. Despite the efforts happiness escapes them and their loved ones.They wickedly abuse and disgracefully bully innocent individuals when they harbour atrocious and vicious thoughts. I have seen that when people are frustrated, as a result of their own faults, they try to harass others. This is because they arent humble enough to admit that they are wrong. 
Twenty six centuries ago, the great son of India, the Gautama Buddha, introduced the Buddhism (Teachings of The Buddha) where Dhamma Vinaya is part of the teachings. 
The Essence of Lord Buddhas teaching and the core value of his message is The purification of the mind. Lack of mindfulness and attention will definitely lead to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. 

The great Master, Lord Buddha, incomparably enlightened people and opened their minds.This was the unprecedented revolution of human consciousness that occurred 2600 years ago. Lord Buddha clearly and openly emphasized that one is capable enlightenment. No other person can enlighten you. 
Once the Gautama Buddha advised his disciples thus: Bhikkhus (Monks), think that the Dhamma is an island and you are seeking refuge. Seek refuge only in the Dhamma. From what are sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair born How are they produced 
Sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure and despair should be abandoned. With their abandonment, one doesnt become agitated. When not being agitated, one dwells happily. A bhikkhu (monk) who dwells happily is said to be quenched in that respect. 
Ambition, determination, effort, and dedication are the driving forces to achieve both mundane and supramundane aspirations. 
When delivering his first and foremost discourse Lord Buddha set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma (Dhammachakka Pavattana Sutta). The Gautama Buddha descriptively elaborated that why people suffer and experience unhappiness. He also compassionately taught us the way towards the true path, which promises ultimate happiness. He kindly advised us to avoid the two extremes. The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasure and self-mortification are the two extremes that people are embroiled in and leads to chaos.
The enlightened one has vividly explained the four noble truths.What is being unhappy, what is the cause for being unhappy, the importance of inner happiness and the way to achieve ultimate happiness. This might seem a complicated process for someone, but it is pragmatic and practical. 
Some scholars have referred to it as The Buddhas Ancient Path. This Noble Eight fold Path has eight factors. They are utterly practical. When one diligently follows them one will experience inner peace and happiness in this very life.Unfortunately the majority of citizens concentrates on obtaining material things. Never for a moment do they turn their focus inward.   Peace and happiness arent in outer space. They are within us.

The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasure and self-mortification are the two extremes that people are embroiled in and leads to chaos
Even intellectuals, academics, scholars, professionals, experts in various domains and multitudes of erudite individuals are entangled and enmeshed with multifarious impurities such as anger, resentment, craving, hatred, temper, antagonism, animosity, enmity, ill will, lust, jealousy, covetousness, and many more mental toxins. Unfortunately they never contemplate taking a moment to reflect upon themselves. If they do so they can observe drastic erosion and dramatic deterioration of their own inner human qualities. One should be mindful to establish a wholesome spiritual domain. This is essential for the cultivation and development of spiritual faculties. It truly leads the individual towards inner happiness. When this is done, faith, mindfulness, effort, determination, concentration and wisdom moves to the next level.  
In this new millennium, people are inconceivably intoxicated with a consumerism based culture. Multinational gigantic companies and business magnates have created a commercial culture in the globe now. As a result the whole community has been jeopardized. They are catastrophically infatuated and exceedingly captivated with insatiable desires to accumulate incalculable revenue and profits. 

Most people never understand the fountain for inner happiness


Despite the efforts happiness escapes them and their loved ones


Peace and happiness arent in outer space. They are within us

Small and middle income earning individuals are unknowingly entrapped and unwittingly captured in the complexities of this fallacy. Simplicity, sharing, compassion, generosity, respect, giving, appreciation, loving kindness, moral conduct, magnanimity , nobility, selflessness and many more inner qualities are absent in their minds. Social coherence and the consistency of the general public have turned topsy-turvy. Its very rare that most Governments contemplate on peoples inner happiness. They have terribly and disgracefully encouraged people to obtain a high reading in Gross Domestic Product rather move up the list in the Gross National Happiness ratings.  With great respect and wholehearted appreciation I am humble enough to note that the king of Bhutan and his Government have established an incredible pragmatic interconnected structure for every single citizen in the Kingdom Bhutan to achieve the Gross National Happiness.
Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product is the paramount theme and the astounding policy of the Government of Bhutan. Happiness is the most important fact that the Bhutanese deeply believe in and highly value.  Mindfulness and careful attention are key factors that help us understand our own weaknesses and mistakes. Most importantly, mindfulness thoroughly helps us to understand our own mental impurities and hindrances that hugely and terribly obscure our minds. When one cleanses the mind by practicing meditation, one can experience ones own inner happiness.  A multitude of people in human society sadly experience stress, frustration, depression and many more psychological traumas. Therefore, they have distanced themselves from i
nner happiness. 
The profound core value of the Buddhas teaching is Letting go. 
If one is capable and wise enough to understand the reality of all material acquisitions and how short a lifespan we have to enjoy material wealth, one would definitely concentrate on the path of purifying the mind. Practice of letting go leads the way to create inner peace and innermost happiness. 
We must be individually mindful of this significant factor. We must wisely taste inner happiness rather than seek it through the realizing of our goals in life.

Japan concerned over exclusive use of SL Port by one country
	
In response to the leasing of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company, Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma said his country was against a particular country using a port exclusively in another country.
In an interview, at his office, to a select group of journalists from mainstream newspapers, the Ambassador said the Indian Ocean should remain open and free'.
For that purpose, he said all the ports should be operated in a transparent and open manner. Also, he said Japan was against a particular country using the ports of other countries for military purposes.
So, we hope that in future Sri Lanka ports will be controlled by the Sri Lankan government. We hope they will not be used militarily by another country and that all security matters and Customs operations will be handled by Sri Lanka, the Ambassador said.
He said Sri Lanka was strategically located in the Indian Ocean with access to East Asia, South-East Asia, the Middle East and East Africa.
In the south of Sri Lanka, there are some of the most important sea-lanes in the world. About 100,000 ships pass these sea lanes every year. So, Sri Lanka has deep ports like Colombo. Ships can come here for repairs, refueling, and transshipment. You can cover the entire South Indian Sea and the countries near the Bay of Bengal, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Iran, etc. Japan depends on sea trade for most of it oil, he said.
The Ambassador said Japan depended on transnational trade and therefore these sea lanes were important.
Sri Lanka is in the middle of it. That is why we keep saying that the Indian Ocean should be open and free, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

JO wants for SF a fate similar to Wijeyadasa
	
The joint opposition (JO) today urged the government to take a similar decision on Field Marshal and Minister, Sarath Fonseka as that taken when it removed Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his portfolio.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga said the Minister Fonseka's statement on (retired) General Jagath Jayasuriya was in stark contrast to the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena.
It is doubtful whether the minister was plotting to betray the soldiers by accepting money from the LTTE Diaspora. We feel that he made his statement with the awareness of the President and the Prime Minister. If Minister Fonseka was removed, people will realise that the government was not involved in this controversy, the MP told a news briefing.
He said the JO was contemplating whether it should submit a no-confidence motion against the minister with regard to the statements he made on Gen. Jayasuriya.
The MP said JO party leaders would meet tomorrow in Parliament and a final a decision on the no-confidence motion would be taken at the meeting.
We do not trust him. He contradicts the Presidents statements and attempts to betray the country, the MP said.
He said the minister should not discuss his personal matters in public and said if any soldier had committed a crime, the minister should have taken action against them at the time he was Army Commander. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who are expecting their third child were forced to tell the world early today because Kate has again been struck down with severe morning sickness. 

The Duchess, 35, who is believed to be between eight and 12 weeks pregnant, battled Hyperemesis Gravidarum during her first two pregnancies. 
Today she was forced to miss her planned engagement at the Hornsey Road Childrens Centre in London, and is being cared for at Kensington Palace. 
In July Kate hinted at a third child on a royal tour of Poland with her family. She was given a cuddly toy meant for a newborn and said to William, laughing: We will just have to have more babies.  A statement from Kensington palace said ...the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child. 
The Queen, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and other members of both families are delighted with the news, and the child will be born fifth in line to the throne.

Kim Jong-un is planning another ballistic missile test: S. Korea
	

S. Korea claimed this morning Kim Jong-un is plotting another ballistic test. The news broks after Seoul simulated its own missile raid on the North, in the wake of the dictators hydrogen bomb test. 
South Korea launched a spectacular rocket launch exercise hitting designated targets in the East Sea last night in response to Pyongyangs provocative detonation. 
The US warned it could launch a massive military response to any threats from North Korea after the rogue state announced it had carried out its most powerful nuclear test yet. 
Earlier, when asked if he planned to attack Pyongyang, Donald Trump replied, Well see, and said he was holding a meeting with his military leaders. Mr Trump also tweeted that talk of appeasement was pointless because North Korea only understand one thing, as the state promised further tests. 
His hard-line rhetoric was prompted by Pyongyangs announcement that it had successfully tested a weapon up to ten times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb that could kill millions of people. 
But this morning South Korea announced it had detected signs Kim Jong-un was preparing to carry out yet another launch -possibly of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Seoul and the US said this morning they would deploy more anti-missile defences despite a The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system already being installed in the South.

Man on borrowed time on vengeance trail
	
This high-up serving in an acting capacity in a state institution spinning money for the government is a political appointee of a former purohita.

Despite being lucky enough to continue in the high post under the new purohita as well, the man is said to be complaining that he has not been given sufficient powers to run the institution.
His main grouse is that he has not been given the authority to transfer some of the subordinates who had earlier protested against his appointment.
An official conference had been held last week to discuss the issue related to the sharp drop in the institutions income in recent times and at this conference this high-up had said: How can I function efficiently and deliver the goods when my hands and feet are bound I am not getting any co-operation from the Ministry
When the unhappy high-up made this complaint, one participant had told the one seated next to him in a low tone, The man has forgotten that he is only acting in the post on borrowed time!

The Road Development Authority (RDA) requested motorist using expressways to maintain an average speed of 60 kmph and switch on headlights due to heavy rains.
Director of Expressway Management and Maintenance, S. Opanayake urged motorist to take necessary precautions to avoid accidents.
He said the roads could be slippery due to the rains and driving at high speeds might cause motorists to lose control of the vehicle, even while breaking. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Opanayake said many of the accidents which occurred on expressways was due to motorists not keeping a sufficient distance between the other vehicle while overtaking. 
You cant overtake on an expressway as you do on normal roads because of the high speed the vehicles are travelling at. Motorists should keep a good distance when they overtake another vehicle to avoid accidents, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

In the wake of revelations made by PTL IT executive and its Chief Dealer that they had deleted More than 100 phone conversations from the PTL voice recording system, Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando who had been appearing for Perpetual Treasuries Ltd said yesterday he would quit from appearing for PTL hereafter. He said this after PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado concluded his testimony before the Commission yesterday.
Mr. Fernando was of the view that it was a matter of safeguarding his professional reputation because he had asked his client, PTL to provide all phone recordings with regard to the transactions.
Yesterday it was revealed that PTL had deleted certain phone recordings and had lied to the PCoI about its phone recording system.
ASG Dappula de Livera said Mr. Fernando took the undertaking earlier that he had provided all material and it was found now that the undertaking was faulty.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda also observed that if Mr. Fernando had instructed PTL to give all details then in that case he should come to the witness dock and give evidence regarding his instructions.
However, Mr. Fernando PC said he performed his duties in good faith as he had provided all the details requested by the PCoI from the beginning. Mr. Fernando said he was only dealing with the technical matters on behalf of PTL but not the criminal aspects that transpired during proceedings.

The Bhikkhu  and  the Sinhalese ruler
	

The sacred bond that has bound the monk and monarch ever since the great philosophy was introduced to the island nation, Thambapanni over twenty three centuries ago, is unique in
the world.
The beneficiary of that alliance as expected has always been the latter. And through him the country has witnessed unparalleled strides in spiritual development and material prosperity as borne out by the chronicles. Following is an account of a few fascinating encounters between the two, manifesting the profound and overwhelming influence the Dhamma had on the unshakeable faith, candour and piercing intellect of the ancient Sinhala ruler. 

When the Arahants body was placed in the casket the pyre rose to the sky and travelled five yojanas
Having had nothing to offer the preacher the following morning he made an offering of his entire kingdom
King Dutugemunu having lost the Chullangani War, retreated to the jungle mounted on a mare along with a minister named Tissa. When the king confessed that he was burning from acute hunger, Tissa pulled out a packet of rice he had brought, and was hidden, with him. When told to divide it into four, the king was reminded by the minister that there were only three of them. Said the king, Brother Tissa, from the day I can remember, I havent had a meal before offering the bhikkhus. There will be no difference today. When the minister complied with the kings wish, he was further ordered the customary invocation (kalagosha) to bhikkhus be made. 
The minister questioned as to how monastic monks could live in the woods. That is none of your concern. I will receive the Aryan saints if I am of adequate faith to receive them, therefore do as you are told. the king said. 
Tissa uttered the announcement thrice. It was heard by Maha Arhant Bodhimathumahatissa from his monastery with the divine ear. The Arhant told himself that the king has to be obliged and appeared in front of him by supernatural powers. See, Tissa said the king placing in the monks bowl two parts of rice and offered the bowl saying, Venerable Sir, may there be no want for sustenance ever. Tissa, unable to eat when the king went hungry, also put down his share in the bowl. Glancing at the mare close by, the king knew it too wished the same be done. 

The noble monk thought, what business do I have with the palace in my old age and started drawing lines on the floor with his finger while reclining on his couch

The Arahant returned to the monastery and was able to feed everyone, constricting the contents of the bowl into condensed fractions with his thaumaturgic faculties. Reading the kings mind and anticipating whatever would be left over, the Arahant threw the bowl in the air with adequate food in it. The bowl came to rest in the kings hand. Unable to return an empty bowl, he cleaned, put his upper shawl in and threw it upwards, which returned to the bhikkhu. Later when the illustrious king lay dying beside the half completed Maha Stupa, containing a one-eighth portion of Buddhas relics, bhikkhus commenced chanting the five Nikayas. The book of meritorious deeds written with his own hand was then got down by him and a reader began reading from the beginning. However none of what was read interested him. He directed the account on the Chullangani War be read and when reaching the end the king stopped the reader and inquired from the bhikkhus gathered which Deva World (Heaven)was most desirable. When told that Thusitha was the abode of all Bodhisaththas, he passed away and was born among Deva Puttas of Thusitha. Scripture cites the moving occurrence to signify the karmic effect of an act of enormous merit. 
King Dutugemunus brother was Saddhatissa (168 BC- 93 BC) who succeeded him to the throne. He made an earnest request from bhikkhus to name an Arahant whom he could worship. When they suggested the name of Maha Arahant Kujjatissa of Mangana, the king travelled a distance of five yojanas with a large entourage to greet the monk. When the Arahant enquired from other monks what the commotion outside was, he was informed of the kings arrival. The noble monk thought, what business do I have with the palace in my old age and started drawing lines on the floor with his finger while reclining on his couch. Arahants do no such silly things with their hands, this doubtless is a worldling said the king andturned back. 

A mystifying episode concerning the worshipper and worshipped in ancient Lanka was also based on the rationale of cleansing wisdom through absolute sila

When bhikkhus questioned Kujjatissa Thero why he confused the pious and respectful king in that manner, he said, Safeguarding the kings devotion is no task of yours, it is that of the old monk. Later, when the time had arrived for his parinirvana (), he told the bhikkhus to have an additional casket placed in the pyre next to his and determined that the pyre along with the caskets should rise in the air and reach the ground in the presence of the king. When the Arahants body was placed in the casket the pyre rose to the sky and travelled five yojanas to the accompaniment of a myriad miracles occurring in its path. The king was first skeptical when informed of the wondrous spectacle being witnessed. 
The pyre circled Thuparama Chetiya thrice and when it reached the granite stupa in Mihintale, the stupa rose from the ground along with its foundation and stood atop the pyre. Thousands beheld the incredulous sight and started raising loud cries in veneration. When the stupa returned to the ground the pyre began moving again. At that time Maha Arahant Mahavagga, an acquaintance of Kujjatissa Thero, was attending to disciplinary matters regarding some monks on the seventh floor of Loha Prasadaya- the copper roofed building with nine floors- when he heard the chant of onlookers. On making inquiries he was told of the strange happening and the passing away of his brother monk. Friends, we have to honour noble personages like him, he declared. He then excused himself from the monks, reached the second coffin within the pyre with his supernatural powers and passed into parinirvana, lying in it. When King Saddhatissa took with him fragrant flowers and perfumes to worship the pyre hovering above, it descended to the ground. The king then performed the funeral rites with boundless devotion and built a stupa enshrining relics of the Arahants , states the Anguttara nikaya attakatha. It is also wise king Saddhatissa who went incognito on a moonless night and stood at the end of the audience listening to Arahant Kalabuddharakkithas sermon on Kalakarama Sutta under the Kaluthimbiriya tree at Kaludiyapokuna throughout the whole night. Having had nothing to offer the marvelous preacher the following morning he made an offering of his entire kingdom, which was returned to the king with the advice of how to rule it in peace and in line with the Dhamma. Such was the magnitude of faith of ancient monarchs of the country. The natural cave named Raja Lena, where the king sojourned prior to his arrival for the sermon that night, is clearly visible and is situated at a great height on an imposing mountain to the left of Kaludiya Pokuna. 
As perhaps destiny would have had it, King Kavantissa, father of the two great kings Dutugemunu and Saddhatissa, too experienced a similar spell-binding experience involving miraculous powers of another Arahant named Pindapatiyatissa of Magampura in the south of ancient Lanka as recorded in the Chapter on Ekadhamma Pali 
The explanatory segment of Dhiganikaya stresses that whoever who possessed morality (sila), also has wisdom within. Here questions are raised regarding morality. Wisdom compliments morality and morality wisdom.  Monk, purify your morality, the first step of the path exhorted Buddha  Uththiya Thera. 
A mystifying episode concerning the hallowed liaison between might and sanctity, between the worshipper and worshipped in ancient Lanka is also based on the rationale of cleansing wisdom through absolute sila. If one could sustain ones unscarred morality in a life of sixty, eighty years, he would shatter all defilements through wisdom and attain Arahanthood at death, states the scripture. The case of Maha Sattiwassa Thero of Kanthaka Sala Monastery in the reign of King Vasabha stands apart on this score. 
The thero was in his deathbed when the great king arrived at the door of the hermitage and inquired of the sounds he heard. The sounds were those of the thero screaming in pain. Not mastered an iota of contemplation on pain, not worshipping him now muttered the king and walked away to pay homage to the Maha Bodhi. 
Venerable Sir, why are you shaming us in this manner. You placed the pious king in a predicament, said the assisting monk.   Because he heard you screaming ,. Give me a respite replied the noble bhikkhu, suppressing his pain. He reached the final state of sublimity and gestured towards the young monk, Go, friend, you may make the king worship me now, As instructed, he met the king and announced You may worship him now. The great king threw himself on the floor in front of the bhikkhu and exclaimed Venerable Sir, it is not your Arahanthood that I worship, but the stature of sila you reached from a mundane plane. 
It was such innate wisdom and sheer rectitude of the ancient ruler that went hand in hand with the sanctity of the superlative bhikkhu to establish a near perfect socio-religious culture on the hallowed land. Will it be unreasonable to expect a renaissance 
Whatever, the single permanent truth in the world being its impermanence, the golden era of a remarkable civilization has long disappeared from the face of the earth. Yet the spirit and ethos of the immaculate doctrine nurtured and secured by admirable Sangha will prevail upon the blessed country in the next twenty five centuries for the well-being of mankind as foreseen by the Great Sage. That, is the uniqueness of a rich nation and its proud heritage.

The man who was never fulfilled
	

The English have a wonderful dramatic tradition, the Americans a wonderful movie tradition. Both are more or less reflected in the styles of acting they popularise: the English with Shakespeare, Marlowe and Laurence Olivier, the Americans with Stella Adler, Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan. When an individual actor professes interest in either of these, he does so while rejecting the other, which is why the English are still averse to the Method and the Americans still covertly disdainful of Shakespeare.


One comes across this even in an individual film or play: Joseph Manciewiczs Julius Caesar (1953), for instance, has James Mason as Brutus, John Gielgud as Cassius, Greer Garson as Calpurnia, Deborah Kerr as Portia, and Marlon Brando as Mark Antony. The first four were British, while the fifth, as Pauline Kael once memorably described him, was the contemporary version of the free America. Cyril Wickremage, whom I met two years ago, and who was influenced by the Method, said he preferred Brando to Mason and Gielgud. Tony Ranasinghe, whom I met a month later, and who was influenced by the English theatre, said he preferred Mason and Gielgud to Brando (As if to justify his position, he added that, in his opinion, Brando deteriorated into an unnecessary parody of himself as the yearswent by).

Unfulfilled, rejected, dejected, and menacing, Tony Ranasinghes characters were hardly the romantic screen personalities his face and his looks would have made you believe him to be

The first great American actors came from the theatre  the Barrymores, Lillian Gish, Emil Jannings  as did the first great American directors  Griffith, Chaplin, right until Orson Welles  but in Sri Lanka, unlike even India, the actors continued for a long time to come from the stage (This is true of todays actors as well). In its first few years they all derived their emotional power from the Parsi theatre, the nadagama, and the morality plays of Sirisena Wimalaweera. Irangani Serasinghe, who predated Gamini Fonseka and Ranasinghe, proved to be an exception here: as the first Sri Lankan who graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, she rooted all her performances in the thespian tradition of fleshed out ordinary characters. Shakespeare was at his best in his tragedies  his comedies touch on tragedy, at least briefly  and tragedy had in Sri Lanka been the preserve of the Minerva Players. With Serasinghe and Ranasinghe, a new form of acting came out, more felt and genuine.
In the movies Ranasinghe was almost always the man who could never fulfil himself, obviously an extension of the roles that Sugathapala de Silva had got him to play with Ape Kattiya. He was never the hero, never the lover, never the husband he wanted so badly to be. As Nissanka Wijesinghe in Delovak Athara (1966), his real onscreen debut, he symbolised an entire generations frustration with their elders and peers, and like Deans Jim Stark (from Rebel Without a Cause), he clashed with them because he wanted to stay true to his conscience. Irangani had found her definitive, signature role with the mother. Ranasinghe had found his with the frustrated idealist, the sort who dreamt big and spoke loftily but who never was himself when he had to be.

In the movies Ranasinghe was almost always the man who could never fulfil himself

In Ran Salu, as the villain Cyril, for instance, he makes fun of his fiances sense of goodness because shes the exact opposite of who he is. Having abandoned her for a more sensual friend of hers, Sarojini (Anula Karunatilake), he proceeds to then abandon his second lover for a prettier, wealthier third, who urges him to throw Sarojini out (she bears him a child), marry her, and leave for England. Seeing you makes me realise how vulgar and common Sara was, he chortles. And yet, when he confronts Sara at the hospital, he dithers rather guiltily. Ive come to say goodbye, he says, looking down, I wont be seeing you again. Ever. Even as the villain, and a pretty daring one at that (Ran Salu was the first film here that depicted a couple in bed, naked; he was the man, Anula the woman), he can only
stutter awkwardly. And in becoming someone who wasnt true to himself, he spoke for all of us who wanted to be everyday heroes. Nissanka in Delovak Athara is as ordinary and common as the frustrated lover in Hanthane Kathawa, a role which its director, Sugathapala Senarath Yapa, had written with Tony Ranasinghe in mind. (It goes without saying, naturally, that no other actor could have symbolised the pain and suffering of denied love that he could and did there.) He had rejected the Method, while ironically embodying the one archetype that the Method, and Hollywood in general, perfected and marketed: the Everyman, or the ordinary Average Joe whos placed in an extraordinary, bewildering situation. He neednt have been a hero, and he actually isnt, but in terms of the range of experience and emotion he brings out, he was unparalleled by any hero or villain the mainstream cinema could conjure.

The problem with most teenagers is that they are always idealising themselves so much when their instincts get the better of them, theyre left grappling in the dark

The problem with most teenagers is that they are always idealising themselves so much when their instincts get the better of them, theyre left grappling in the dark. They can be lovers or fighters or cowards and still yearn to be more than they are. Right until Hanthane Kathawa, which signified an end of a decade and an era (it would be followed by the more politically turbulent seventies), these were the kinds of characters that Tony played. The problem with those youngsters as they mature and mellow, on the other hand, is that they are so ashamed of their past freewheeling idealisms that they want to repress, rationalise, and intellectualise. From the seventies to the early nineties, Tony hence revelled in playing out these mellowed youngsters: Suraweera in Duhulu Malak (1976), Bibile Aththo in Hulawali (1976), Sarath in Ahasin Polawata (1979). Earlier he had been conquered by instinct; now he was being conquered, slowly but inevitably, by cold, calculated,unemotional reason.
This was reflected well in his physique. Irangani Serasinghe, like Chaplin and the two Hepburns, had aged gracefully, so she could become kinder, gentler (with the exception of the eighties). Tony, on the other hand, like William Holden, was becoming gruffer, more careless, and more cynical: the messed up hair and the thick eyebrows on Bibile Aththo and Sarath and the father in Maya indicated that he was turning into older versions of the crooners and idealists he had been before.


Those idealists had been denied the privilege of realising themselves because of their idealism; now their older selves were being denied that same privilege because of their rationalism. They had been frustrated lovers; now they were frustrated husbands. Ultimately they all congealed into the same character: impotent, brooding, prone to fits of rage and passion, but never fulfilled. (In Parasathumal hes a wronged lover who, in one such fit, takes up a gun and walks right through a huge rubber estate to confront the man who stole the woman he loved; halfway through, hes so spent up by the long walk that he pants, sighs, and returns, bitterly acknowledging defeat).
With Yuganthaya, and as Simon Kabilana, Gamini Fonseka returned to the Sinhala cinema, the same cinema that had threatened to reject him, and in doing so he finally became himself. With Tony Ranasinghe, however, becoming oneself wasnt really an option, because he was scattered here and there, having played a great many characters and depicting a great many emotions, hopes, fears, sorrows. Despite the tentative comparisons one can draw between, say, the lover in Hanthane Kathawa and the husband in Ahasin Polawata, its rather difficult to reconcile his Fernando in Baddegama with the mafia leader in Saptha Kanya or the gentle, caring father in Janelaya. The second of these proved to be so uncharacteristic and atypical that people found it difficult to reconcile the performer to the performance: a feat which won him the Best Actor award from the Sarasavi, Swarna Sanka, OCIC and Presidential ceremonies. To become oneself, one had to be a Brando, a Richard Burton (another actor criticised by Ranasinghe as being deliberately undisciplined), and he was neither: he preferred plurality to singularity, right until his last few roles.
Unfulfilled, rejected, dejected, and menacing, Tony Ranasinghes characters were hardly the romantic screen personalities his face and his looks would have made you believe him to be. He subverted the rule that ones looks were an indicator of ones likeability in the movies. The truth was that the more he tried to be likeable, the more he was stifled and spurned, to his consternation. Almost always bewildered, and always impotently furious, the man never quite received what he hankered after.
He obviously tried, very hard, to get us to accept the men he wanted to be. When he failed there, he could only grope around in the dark. Marlon Brando was like that too, except that Brando always yelped about his inadequacies, while Tony, who preferred to bottle up, was more cautious. Its easier to be a hero, after all: easier to be a fighter, a soldier, a saviour. Brandos saying about being a bum instead of the champ he could have been might have easily applied to Tony. But Tony would never have said it. He would have shielded his insecurity, congealing into the opposite of who he aspired to become and thereby becoming less likeable, and
more complex.

Turkey should not become a member of the EU : Angela Merkel
	
While debating with her Social Democratic Party rival in elections being held later this month, Merkel said she will ask the EU to call off membership talks with Turkey 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she wants to end Turkeys application for European Union membership. 
She announced her plan to ask the EU to call off membership talks with Ankara during a televised pre-election debate on Sunday evening. 
While debating with her Social Democratic Party rival, Merkel said she did not ever see them joining, amid rising tensions between Berlin and Ankara.I dont see them ever joining and I had never believed that it would happen, she said during a televised debate, adding that she will speak with her EU counterparts to see if we can end these membership talks. 
She added: The fact is clear that Turkey should not become a member of the EU. 
Merkels tough stance came after Turkey arrested two more German citizens this past week for political reasons, infuriating Berlin. The plunge in relations began after Berlin sharply criticised Ankara over the crackdown that followed last years failed coup attempt.
