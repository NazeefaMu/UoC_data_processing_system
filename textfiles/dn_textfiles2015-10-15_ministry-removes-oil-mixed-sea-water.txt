Ministry removes oil mixed sea water

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has launched a special operation jointly with the Coast Conservation Department to remove sea water which was mixed with oil during the fire which erupted at the Kudawella Fisheries Harbour in Tangalle.
A special team attached to the Coast Conservation Department visited the Kudawella harbour and initiated the removal of oil mixed sea water and the control of the oil leakage with the assistance of the harbour staff. Following oil removing operation for nearly 12 hours, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi praised the services of the Coast Conservation Department for their attempts.
