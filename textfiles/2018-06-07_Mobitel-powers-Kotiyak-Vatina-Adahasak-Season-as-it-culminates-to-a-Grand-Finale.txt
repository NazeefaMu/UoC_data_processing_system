These innovative ideas have already been subjected to Investor Pitching and after due diligence someideas have been valued at up to Rs. 330 Million. The pitching process offered these entrepreneurs the opportunity to hone their marketing and presentation skills, instead of merely focusing on R&amp;D and Tech.

These participants have been mentored by professionals who have nurtured and added value to the
contestants’ ideas. The mentors are Nalin Karunasinghe, Senior Lecturer - University of Moratuwa; Vishaka Nanayakkara, Senior Lecturer - University of Moratuwa; Indika De Zoysa, Senior
Consultant - ICT Agency Sri Lanka; Faththi Mohamed, Co-Founder - Pick Me; Arjuna Senevirathne,
Senior Consultant - Strategic Enterprises Management Agency Sri Lanka; and Manju Gunawardane,
Inventor/Senior Research Scientist. Prabhath Gamage - General Manager, Enterprise Business, Mobitel said “In recent years, Sri Lanka has gained a lot of momentum in terms of technological innovation and a lot of innovators who have come up with brilliant technological solutions for common problems. Unfortunately, many of these talented individuals have given up on their dreams due to various constraints such as lack of financial assistance and inability to access experienced professionals who could mentor their concepts to fruition. Through Kotiyak Vatina Adahasak, Mobitel invites talented and skilled tech entrepreneurs to dream big and put their ideas into action. Mobitel collaborates with Sirasa TV on this initiative and is much appreciative to the media organization for its willingness to make a reality show on a topic, which is the first of its kind in Asia. Mobitel will continue such innovative initiatives to nurture entrepreneurship and technology amongst millennials.”

Ten applicants were shortlisted from hundreds of applications that poured in, of which the final four will battle it out for the crown at the reality show’s Season 2 Grand Finale.
