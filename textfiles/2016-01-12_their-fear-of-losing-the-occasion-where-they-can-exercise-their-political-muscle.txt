Their fear of losing the occasion where they can exercise their political muscle


	


Certain political parties representing the minorities are said to be unhappy over the move now afoot to introduce a new Constitution. 
The leader of the ‘tree party’ and his colleague who has gone ‘All Ceylon’ have now formed a common platform to oppose the proposed new Constitution, they say.
The collective opinion of all minority and minor political parties is that they draw much political sustenance from the decisive value of their support for whatever candidate at a Presidential poll and they would lose this invaluable political clout when the Presidential system is no more. Even the red comrades who too are in the same boat are said to be highly perturbed, but are biding their time, they say.
However, all these political parties are expected to take a definite stand on the proposed new Constitution next week.
