A legal officer in a State bank had been accused of sexually abusing two women employees in the same office, the Daily Mirror learned today.

The two victims have already lodged a complaint with the Mirihana Police, the Police said.

According to one of the victims the suspect had accused the victims of filing petitions to the management against him and threatened them.

“He came so close to me almost leaning against my body and abused me while scolding me with filth. This is despite me explaining to him that we have not filed any petitions against him,” one complaint said.

“We were compelled to lodge a complaint with the Police as he had been verbally abusing women employees at the Bank branch,” the complaint said. (Yohan Perera)
