Centre trying to resolve fishermen issue: MP Ganesan
	
Asserting that the BJP-led government at the Centre was taking serious steps to bring a lasting solution to the fishermen issue, Rajya Sabha member and senior party leader L. Ganesan said efforts were made to secure the release of the trawlers impounded by Sri Lanka, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to the island nation.
Mr. Ganesan told presspersons in Tamil Nadu on Saturday said the Prime Minister was scheduled to visit Sri Lankan very soon and talks were held with the Sri Lankan government to secure the release of more than 140 boats, ahead of his visit.
The Tamil Nadu government had offered to repair the damaged boats, he said.
The Sri Lankan authorities refused to release the boats, taking the stand that the fishermen would again trespass into their waters if they released the boats. However, talks are being held to secure the release of the boats, he said.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was keen on finding a solution to the issue at the earliest and her suggestion of weaning fishermen from deep-sea fishing to resolve the issue was well received by the fishermen delegation which met her in Delhi on March 21, Mr. Ganesan said.
One of the leaders in the delegation had even told him that it would be a golden period for fishermen if Ms. Swaraj worked out the solution.
Mr. Ganesan said there had been a marked change in the attitude of the Sri Lankan government towards Indian fishermen after the BJP came to power. (The Hindu)

Project manager Gu Feng said the company was seriously concerned about the safety of its 2,300 employees of whom 380 were Chinese. He said the employees had been attacked by villagers and underworld gangsters even on previous occasions. Mr. Feng said the gangsters often demanded fuel and those who ignored their demands were assaulted and that the guards from the private security firms were unable to deal with the gangsters.
The latest incident occurred about 4.00 am on Saturday when a 31-year old employee, Zhang Fei who heads the team of surveyors was suddenly woken up to find a stranger in his room. As there is hi tech survey equipment valued at more than Rs.3.5 million in his room he immediately grappled with the intruder. On hearing the commotion within the room his co-workers broke open the door and came to his assistance by which time the assailant had slashed Mr. Fei with a knife in a failed attempt to get away, Mr. Feng said. The man is suspected to have entered Mr. Feis room through a window.
He was admitted to the emergency ward of the District General Hospital, Matara and had been working on the project since its inception in 2013. The assailant was overpowered and handed over to the Matara Police who are conducting further inquiries. (Priyan de Silva)

India sends water, rice as SL faces severe drought
	
With Sri Lanka staring at one of the worst droughts in the last four decades, India has provided an emergency assistance of water and rice to the Island country.
The government has already handed over eight water bowsers to the Sri Lankan authorities and the consignment of rice would be delivered soon.
In response to a request from the Government of Sri Lanka for drought relief assistance, Government of India has announced the decision to provide 8 water bowsers and 100 metric tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka. The supply of these items is in the nature of emergency assistance to augment relief measures undertaken in the wake of severe drought faced by Sri Lanka, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament in a written reply.
The lorry-mounted water bowsers were given to the Government of Sri Lanka on March 21. India has always been among the first to respond to requests from the neighbouring countries in times of crisis. The current gifting of the water bowsers and rice is part of that policy, Swaraj added.
Sri Lanka is suffering from the worst drought in 40 years with over a million people facing acute water shortages. The Island country has experienced prolonged dry season with some districts having 60-70 percent less rainfall. The local wells and reservoirs are running dry.
The harvest of rice is going to be hit due to water shortage and the prospect of rice shortage later this year is looming large. The Sri Lankan government has also taken slew of measures to contain the fallout of the rice shortage. It has already waived off taxes on rice imports and is expected to increase rice imports to meet the demand at home.
Water shortage has also compounded problems for the energy sector of the country that depends on hydro-power.(Indian Express)

Mano: If Wimal can, so can Tamil political prisoners
	
The Tamil youth held under detention as political prisoners, could be given bail in the same way Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa was granted bail, Minister of National Co-Existence Mano Ganesan had urged President Maithripala Sirisena in a letter.
According to the letter that had been sent to Tamil media by the Ministry, Minister Ganesan had requested the President to make arrangements to grant bail to Tamil political prisoners and to rehabilitate them and release them into society.
The Attorney General did not object bailing out of MP Weerawansa. Therefore, I urge to consider about granting bail to Tamil political prisoners as well. There cannot be two separate laws in the country, one for Mr. Weerawansa and another for Tamil political prisoners, he said in the letter.
Everyone is equal before the law, he said.
He also questioned as to how the Government could bring about reconciliation and ethnic harmony, if these prisoners were continually kept in prison.
Approach the issue on humanitarian grounds, the Minister said in the letter, while highlighting that he would take up the issue at the next Cabinet meeting. (Yohan Perera)
