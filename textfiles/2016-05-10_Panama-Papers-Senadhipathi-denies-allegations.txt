Avant-Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi today denied holding funds in Panama as published and presented in the media and social media websites, his counsel Nishan Premathiratne said.

Mr. Premathiratne said his client's earnings from Avant-garde Maritime Services Pvt. Ltd were in foreign currency.

“My client informed me that if even a dollar was found in a Panama account held by him as represented by the media, he would gladly donate it to the founder,” he said.

Mr. Sendhipathi has said that the persons who have held public office should be specifically probed if they are alleged to have Panama accounts so as to verify the sources of the said earnings.

Mr. Premathiratne said his client was concerned as to why his name was highlighted and slandered when there were many other names mentioned in the Panama papers.

“He is surprised that most importantly the persons who should in fact be highlighted are the persons who have held public office and he is of the view that they are the ones who should be scrutinized and investigated,” Mr. Premathiratne said.

He said Mr. Senadhipathi had requested the media to be mindful when reporting information about him or his company claiming he has already been a victim of several frivolous and unsubstantiated allegations. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
