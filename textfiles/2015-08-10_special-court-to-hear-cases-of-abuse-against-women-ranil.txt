	The United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) will set up a special court to hear cases on harassment of women, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said at a weekend meeting at Morawaka.
	He said this was being done to expedite the process of bringing culprits to book.
	The Prime Minister said a UNFGG government would also enact a Women's Rights Bill to pave the way to the setting up of a National Woman's Rights Authority.
	He said the serial killings at Kahawatte had given rise to the need for such laws. The Prime Minister asked the people whether they remembered the bogey about grease yakkas who preyed on helpless women.
	He said he had given Matara district UNP candidate Sagala Ratnayake the opportunity to solve unemployment issues in the area. Sri Lankan cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya's mother and singers Rukantha Gunatilleke and Saman de Silva were also on the stage.
	An Iguana was seen crawling into the site of the UNFGG rally last morning.
	Mr. Wickremasinghe who spotted the reptile said it should not be harmed. " Let it go, that's Dallas Alahaperuma," he was heard saying in lighter vein.(Yohan Perera)
