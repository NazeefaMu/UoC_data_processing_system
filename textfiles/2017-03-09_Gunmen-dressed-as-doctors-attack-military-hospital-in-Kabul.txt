NDTV, 08th MARCH, 2017 - An explosion and gunfire rattled Kabul’s diplomatic district Wednesday as insurgents dressed as doctors attacked Afghanistan’s largest military hospital, officials said, as growing insecurity besets the war-battered country. 


No insurgent group immediately claimed responsibility for the ongoing assault on the Sardar Daud Khan hospital, but it comes as the Taliban ramp up attacks even before the start of their annual spring offensive.
