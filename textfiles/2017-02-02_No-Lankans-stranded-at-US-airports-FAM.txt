Sri Lankan Missions in the US have informed the Foreign Affairs Ministry that there were no confirmed cases of Sri Lankans being stranded at US airports because of President Trump’s ban on immigration.

However, Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said the Sri Lankan Missions there were keeping an eye on the situation and in touch with relevant US authorities on this matter.

"If there is any Sri Lankan stranded at a US airport and requiring assistance, please call Sri Lanka's Mission in New York 001 917 597 7009," she tweeted today.

Ms. Colonne also reiterated that Sri Lanka is not on the list of countries in the recent US Executive Order banning people from seven countries entering US for a period of three months.
