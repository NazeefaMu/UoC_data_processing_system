Ex Colombo JMO Prof. Ananda Samarasekera alleged that the present JMO had intimidated and pressurized doctors who conducted the first autopsy on the body of ruggerite Mohamed Waseem Thajudeen.
In a letter addressed to Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Pieris yesterday, Dr, Samarasekera said he could not expect an impartial second post mortem examination report from the present JMO on Thajudeen’s death.
Dr. Samarasekara also said he conducted the first postmortem examination with several other additional JMOs on March 17, 2012 on the body of Thajudeen and submitted a primary report and interim reports to court on his findings.
However consequent to the commencement of the second postmortem examination he was called to the CID to record his statement on the postmortem examination conducted by him on Thajudeen’s body.
During the inquiry the detectives asked several questions from him that should be answered after carefully and conceptually studying the examination reports.
Thus he requested the CID to give him a written questionnaire with copies to the Court which the CID had later rejected assuming they were needless.
Dr. Samarasekera in his letter further stated that at the time of his retirement from public service on June 03, 2013, he took away with him the original notes that he took down while examining the body of Thajudeen leaving the rest in his office
He also said the body of Thjajudeen was exhumed to perform a second postmortem examination by a panel of doctors headed by the present JMO.
Dr. Samarasekera said while the present JMO worked under him as a deputy there were constant disagreements on administrative matters between the JMO and Dr. Samarasekera.
Dr. Samarasekera stated that the present JMO had made false allegations against him to the Director of Health on several occasions which were refused by the Director. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
