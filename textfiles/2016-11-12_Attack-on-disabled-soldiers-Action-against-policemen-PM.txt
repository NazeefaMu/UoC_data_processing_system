Action will be taken against the police personnel who attacked the disabled soldiers during the recent protest in Colombo, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.

He was responding to a question asked by joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane.

The Prime Minister said investigations would also be carried out to find out who had manipulated or prompted disabled soldiers to act in the manner they did.

He said the disabled soldiers had continued their protest even after the Government had made arrangements to grant their demands and added that the participation of a Buddhist monk at the protest was also questionable. (Yohan Perera)
