Weligama Bay Marriott Resort and Spa, an iconic brand of Marriott International, proudly celebrates its first anniversary on July 20th this year. The highly anticipated resort officially opened its doors one year ago, steering in a new era of luxury travel, centered to capture, create and inspire life’s most memorable journeys. Located along the Southern coastal belt of Sri Lanka, the resort has become an icon that embodies a blend of warm service culture, quality facilities, spaces and experiences to delight today’s traveler.

Within just one year since its opening, the resort has undoubtedly proven to be the number one choice among local and foreign travelers alike, with its offering of modern global hospitality blended with the unique flavours of the Southern coast. The property offers 198 beautifully-designed expansive rooms and suites, right in the heart of Weligama Bay - a charming seaside fishing village famous for surfing.

Each unit of accommodation offers uncompromising views of the Indian Ocean and includes a King or Twin bed configuration, separate bath and shower, a 55 inch television, Wi-Fi and a balcony to enjoy the seascapes from. Thoughtful, star-class amenities combined with personalized comfort ensures each guest a private sanctuary.

Guests are spoilt for choice with five food and beverage outlets at the resort. The all-day dining restaurant, Weligama Kitchen, spreads across different zones, each serving a distinct cuisine, ranging from traditional Sri Lankan specialties, to Tuscan, Cantonese and Indian delicacies and an interactive live kitchen where all the action ensues. The Big Fish is a chef driven restaurant offering gourmet seafood in a casual upscale setting with thoughtful service. Tides is an integration of the Lobby and Lobby Lounge with a clearly defined bar that transitions from a coffee and pastry focus in the day to alcoholic beverages and snacks in the evening. Mirissa Baking Company provides freshly-baked desserts and snacks, accompanied by a selection of fine coffee, fresh juices and specialty drinks.  There’s also the pool bar Surf’s Up, which serves refreshing cocktails and simple Asian and Western nibbles.



The beach is seamless with no barricades and the landscaped gardens denote a sense of tranquility. The resort boasts of not just one, but three outdoor swimming pools, overlooking vistas of the seaside.

Adults can find refuge at the resort’s renowned Quan Spa which offers authentic Thai and Swedish therapies alongside modern techniques, to revitalize the body and restore clarity of mind. A well-equipped fitness center caters to those who desire physical activity.
