A team of experts with some sense of diplomatic relations should be sent to Russia which suspended the import of Sri Lankan tea, joint opposition member and Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardana said today.

He said Russia was the biggest importer of our tea and as such this matter must be solved as soon as possible and the issue was much more than the detection of an insect in the packaging of a consignment of tea.

“It goes without saying that Sri Lanka's international image has been tarnished by this,” the MP told a news conference. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
