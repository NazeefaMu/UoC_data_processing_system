Australia, (Daily Mail), 19 January 2018 - A snake has slithered its way into bed to snuggle up with a North Queensland couple before the husband caught it in a pillowcase.  


Adele Mallard, from Rangewood west of Townsville, was asleep on Tuesday morning when she rolled over onto the reptilian intruder.  


When she bumped into the serpent it tried to bite her in the hamstring area, she said, waking her up immediately. I was like “hon, there’s something in the bed, it just bit me” as I slid across to the other side,’ she told The Townsville Bulletin.  


‘My hubby caught him with a pillowcase.’   


Ms. Mallard asked local snake catchers for help identifying the reptile, and David Barwell obliged.’ It’s a harmless spotted python,’ he said.  


She said the snake has been rehomed, and although the couple struggled to get back to sleep afterwards due to the adrenaline rush, she is glad it was not a spider.  


‘My biggest fear is spiders actually, so I guess I tell myself it could be worse, it could have been a spider,’ she said.
