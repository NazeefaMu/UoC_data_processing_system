CTU Specialist doctors' strike continue

The trade union action initiated by over 90 specialist doctors attached to the Cardio Thoracic Unit (CTU) of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital continued for the third consecutive day, Hospital sources said.
According to the sources, another strike has been initiated by the nurses of the unit as well. Government Nursing Officers' Association Treasurer E. A. Jayasinghe stated that the second strike was initiated in protest against a verbal assault on nurses by the specialist doctors.
The doctors who are involved in trade union action refrained from engaging in the channeling service, ward rounds, etc. Only a few doctors carried out essential services. The main reason behind trade union action is not granting the new surgeons to carry out operations in theaters on Wednesday, the sources said.
The doctors launched the strike on Wednesday (September 30), claiming that a few doctors were misusing the hospital's operating theatres. Discussions they held with a group of high officials from the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry on October 1, had failed, the sources added.
