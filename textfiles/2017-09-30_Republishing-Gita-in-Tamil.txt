Republishing Gita in Tamil


	

The original Sanskrit text Bhagavad Gita translated into Tamil by Sir Ponnampalam Ramanathan, Bhagavad Gita Tamil Translation and Commentary, was first published in 1914. This was published in order that the Tamil speaking community will have access to this sacred text.


This book containing 532 pages is republished today after 103 years on the last day of Vijayathasami (Sarawathi Pooja) the day dedicated to commencement of learning, symbolising the victory in life through learning. 


The re-publication coincides with the 18 months remembrance of my mother Mangaiarkarasi Arunasalam, and the book is surrendered in dedication at the holy feet of my mother.  The Bhagavad Gita often referred to as the Gita, is a 700 verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Bhagavad Gita literally means ‘Song of the Lord’ is divided into 18 Chapters. The Gita combines many elements of Samkhya and Vedanta philosophy.


Gita is a narrative dialogue between Padava prince Arjuna and his charioteer Lord Krsna. Arjuna facing the duty of a warrior to fight the righteous war between the Pandavas, the good, and Kauravas, the evil, is counselled by Lord Krsna to fulfil his duty as a warrior and establish Dharma. The text begins with the word Dharma and ends with the word Mama. Mama means ‘my’ and Dharma, ‘Essential Being’. Together they mean ‘my essential Being’. It signifies the theme of the Gita, righteousness. The purpose of life is to realize one’s essential Being, discover the supreme Self within and attain spiritual Enlightenment.


The good follow the path of devotion, Bhakthi Yoga, as described in the Gita, and when Lord Krsna asked Arjuna do you want all these crores of warriors including your relatives, friends and revered teachers or ME, Arjuna immediately prostrated and said, you the Lord.


Arjuna who is filled with doubt as to what he should be doing is molded to overcome sorrow and fear and is thought to perform his duty, yoga of action, Karma Yoga and live as a Karma Yogi. Gita then describes the path to attainment of liberation, moksha through knowledge, Jnana Yoga.


The setting of the Gita in a battlefield has been interpreted as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of human life. The chariot, the highest form of vehicle is comparable to the human body, the vehicle used by human to live in this world. The four horses depict the four organs of action tongue, hands, legs and reproductive organ that must be controlled. Arjuna, the human being, Jeevathma, is getting the guidance of Lord Krsna to manage and direct his mind and reign the horses, action organs of the human body to perform his duty righteously.


The Gita deals essentially with the spiritual foundation of human existence. It is a call of action to meet the obligations and duties of life, yet keeping in view the spiritual nature and grander purpose of the universe. – Former Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.
