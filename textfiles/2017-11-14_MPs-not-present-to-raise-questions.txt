MPs not present to raise questions


	

A rare occurrence was witnessed in Parliament today where members who were due to pose questions under standing order 23 (2) were not present to raise those issues.

Both Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MP Douglas Devananda were not present to pose the two questions. Questions raised under standing order 23(2) are usually matters of public importance.

Meanwhile, another absentee at today's sessions was Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana who was to make a special announcement in the House. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
