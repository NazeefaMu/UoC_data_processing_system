A bid to buy luxury furnishings for an empty residence!


	



 

A tender calling for bids to supply some expensive items for the official residence of a provincial chief of a council already dissolved was rejected by the governing one when it was submitted to him for approval the other day, they say.

 


The governing one, pointing out that it was a crime to spend millions on luxury items for the official residence at a time the council was dissolved, had angrily torn up into pieces the documents submitted to him for approval.


The officials had decided to purchase new furnishings for the official residence as the outgoing Chief had taken away all items when leaving the place, they say.
