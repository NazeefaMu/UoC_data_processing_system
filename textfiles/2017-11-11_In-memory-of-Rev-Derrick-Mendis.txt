In memory of  Rev. Derrick Mendis


	

One year has passed since Rev. Derrick Mendis made his farewell. He certainly was one of a kind, rather a rare kind at that. He was a servant of the Lord, friend of the poor, fearless poet against the powers that be, and, most of all, a humble human being who enjoyed everything and never craved 
for anything.  


The best of us who pass on fade into memory as the years roll by. I write these few lines to trigger the minds of those who knew him to keep his memory alive.   


Fr. Derrick is for sure someone who is worthy of much remembrance.  


A mass was offered for him at 10 a.m. on Saturday the 4th of November at St. Joseph’s Church, Uyana, Moratuwa.
