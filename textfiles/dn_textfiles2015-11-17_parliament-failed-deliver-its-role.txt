PARLIAMENT: failed to deliver its role?

In Sri Lanka, it has been observed that employment in the public sector is considered to be a duty performed for the benefit of running a family – to keep the home fires burning. It is not considered as a duty towards the country to service the nation. Nevertheless, the Parliament is the most vital institution in our country. Will the staff of Parliament be able to perform their duties efficiently and effectively? Could they rise up to assist the elected representatives to live up to the expectations of the citizens?
The Parliament is a political institution – a complex one. Nevertheless, it is the place where conflicts are resolved and policies are framed through dialogue and compromise. The challenge facing our Parliament is one of continual evolution. Elected representatives should now respond strategically and effectively to meet the ever increasing demands in representation. Failure to meet these expectations effectively could undermine the faith in the parliamentary system.
The staff of Parliament therefore necessarily have an incredibly difficult task than ever before. They need to change their work culture to suit the challenges before them. They should primarily remember that the parliamentarians are also being pressurized heavily to be involved in evolving their role to suit the modern requirements. The staff should be aware that they should provide these services in a cost effective manner with efficiency and effectiveness. There has been severe criticism that both – Parliamentary officials and parliamentarians have ‘failed to deliver’. The diagnosis is that there is a perceived lack of creativity and innovation. Parliamentarians particularly should remember that they are publicly accountable for their actions.
Parliamentarians’ role
Parliamentarians’ role in my view is the only profession for which there is no job description. Effectiveness of parliamentarians therefore largely depend on the effectiveness of the Parliament Secretariat. Being good citizens they should learn to give strength to parliamentarians to build up a strong NATION.
In the case of Parliamentary Secretariat, it has links to a failure of leadership. Bad leaders do not produce results. They create bad successors too. Bad leaders do not know the ways to get jobs done. In addition, values such as honesty, discipline, integrity, dedication and accountability, had also not been inculcated in order to improve efficiency among the employees. Inefficiency, ineffectiveness and poor leadership had refrained the staff from being proactive. They do not like taking up responsibilities. This has potentially tarnished the good name of the institution.
In Parliament, the senior management is highly status conscious. They do not like to lose power they have over the others. They demand formality and respect. Subordinates are rigidly controlled. Decision making is one-sided and unilateral. They do not invest time and energy to prepare subordinates for participative decision making and leadership. When decision making is inappropriate, untimely and incomplete, things do not move well. If decisions are not made, problems crop up. Leadership is therefore crucial for taking the institution forward in a timely manner.
The seniors are mostly out of the country throughout the year. Are they so greedy? They should give these opportunities to juniors as well. They do not therefore have time to pay sufficient attention for improvements. Their overseas exposures have not been utilized to make necessary improvements. The secretariat is lagging far behind compared to other Parliaments. It needs a fundamental shift to instilling a focus on effectiveness, efficiency and innovation. A big spender. And has always been utterly wasteful. It is heavily overstaffed, distended, bureaucratic, and inefficient. There have been serious audit queries too raised by the Auditor-General.
The staff of Parliament should therefore undoubtedly set an example to the rest of the public sector employees as well for several reasons. They are paid far better than the average public servants. They enjoy matchless perks and benefits.
The senior management is simply blind to job performance and its outcomes. Human resource management practices in staffing and performance evaluation are not given due consideration. In Parliament Secretariat loyalty, obedience, favouritism and seniority (not meritocracy) play a more important role than job-related competencies.
As I had experienced ‘getting along is more important for getting ahead’. Absenteeism is a serious problem. The employees feel entitled to absent themselves frequently from work for family-related reasons etc. Work always gets less priority to all other matters.
Sectoral Committees
Steps have already been taken to increase the cadre (by 12 more parliamentary officers) stating they need additional staff for the proposed Sectoral Committees. What a falsehood! This is illogical, unwise, inappropriate and ineffective. Why is that the government not taking steps to find out initially whether there is an excess cadre? Ghost workers?
Is it that the government is unable to face the difficult task of reducing the size and improving efficiency as part of a general endeavour to increase economic growth and cut fiscal deficits? If so, they should begin downsizing in the first place in Parliament. If the government wants to take the country forward – the attempt should be to improve efficiency in Parliament Secretariat first. Thereafter, if needed, the extra personnel could be relocated more productively – a big saving.
The Parliament is a public sector institution with a specialized job which should ensure proper representation of citizens and free, open public spirited deliberations. It cannot be treated as just another public institution. An effective parliament shape policies and laws which respond to the needs of citizens, and support sustainable and equitable development. It is fortunate that the Speaker is ably assisted by no lesser person than Thilanga Sumathipala, the Deputy Speaker. A proven administrator. I could imagine he could do the change! It is no doubt the Deputy Speaker could face the big challenge to improve the parliamentary system not by providing more resources but by channeling constituency work by moving from:
* The specific to the strategic: finding policy solutions to common problems rather than dealing with each case on its own
* The individual to the collective: finding responses that benefit a number of people rather than individuals
* The local to the national: finding ways of bringing constituency expertise in to the parliamentary and policy process much more systematically
It has been found that democracy by itself – elections and representative institutions – does not produce good governance, rule of law and prosperity in a country. My past experience emphasizes the necessity for running the country’s Parliament with efficiency, particularly if the present government sincerely intend to achieve sustainable economic growth and development.
The fundamental issue in Parliament Secretariat, a bureaucratic organization, is to get the “things right”. It is imperative both Speaker and Deputy Speaker should do the needful to enhance careful supervision and proper guidance and attention. These requirements are seriously lacking.
This opportunity should not be slipped by the seniors who should now identify a process to increase performance to influence the thoughts, attitudes, and behaviours of the staff. Without proper leadership and guidance you cannot energize people towards an identified goal.
Action will have to be taken to influence the staff using necessary authority – to improve performance and create enthusiasm. The leadership will more often enhance creativity, which will make the lower ranks to follow the leader. Does this happen? We must not forget that effective leadership of parents enables children to grow strong and healthy and become productive adults. Without leadership, organizations move too slowly, stagnate and lose their way.
Skills of diplomacy and negotiation
I must say that the leaders should necessarily be consultative. Consultation is normally done to demonstrate that employees’ suggestions are valued. Employees always will be glad if they are consulted in decision making though the decision is finally taken by the management unilaterally. It is my experience having been involved in administration that preferred leadership qualities are charisma, participation and team integration. The proverbial saying “Be with them; but do not be one of them” is true in present context as well. This does not however happen in the Parliament Secretariat.
Managers should be able to negotiate the basis for authority and work with the reality of multiple viewpoints. This requires the skills of diplomacy and negotiation, which in turn rely on the ability of all the players to think in to the shoes of others and to understand what counts as success for them. It must be remembered delivering the desired services efficiently and effectively should be the goal of parliamentary staff. It is necessary to identify approaches to maintaining and developing the quality and standards of service through ‘quality and standards improvement’ strategies.
The failure of certain countries to grow undoubtedly relates to bad policy makers, inappropriate policy choices and due to poor policy implementation. These apply to institutions too. In addition, effective leadership and teamwork are key requirements for organizational success. It will be useful to find out in regard to the barriers to effective leadership, motivational techniques, teamwork, employee expectations and socio-cultural behaviours and attitudes prevalent in Parliament Secretariat.
Let me add that I love the Parliament so much. I had the good fortune to serve the supreme institution for over three decades. Let me also say that we Sri Lankans should firmly resolve that there is an obligation on our part as citizens to put the Parliament right so that we will be leaving a healthier, cleaner and better place for our children and future generations.
