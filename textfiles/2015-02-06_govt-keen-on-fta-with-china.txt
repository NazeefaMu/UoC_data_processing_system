Chinese Special Envoy Liu Jianchao, who is also the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, after meeting Sri Lankan leaders, said the new Sri Lankan Government was keen on entering into a the Free Trade Agreement( FTA) with China.
The new Government has decided to review all China-funded projects in Sri Lanka and continue with the previously initiated dialogue with China on the signing of the proposed FTA.
Addressing the media and Sri Lankan scholars at a function in the Chinese embassy, Mr. Jianchao said the new hopeful of signing the FTA with China. He said China appreciated the progress made in this regard.
"It will help Sri Lanka to achieve its target of increasing its export volume to US$20 billion by 2020," Mr. Jianchao said adding that the Government had agreed to proceed with all Chinese-funded projects subject to revaluation and reassessment in a manner that would not disrupt the “time tested and time honoured relationship” between the two countries.
He met President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
"I don’t see any obstacles. Sri Lanka is an all-weather friend of China. This friendship started with the Rubber-Rice Pact. It was an agreement important both in terms of economic and strategic interests," Mr. Jianchao said.
He said China-Sri Lanka relations had not been designed to target a third party and it was meant only to ensure peace and prosperity for the people. Asserting that both sides agreed to further strengthen the existing bilateral relations, Mr. Jianchao said China was happy about Sri Lanka having more friends both in the region and other parts of the world.
With regard to China-funded projects, he said all these projects were initiatives with the accepted procedures and regulations stipulated by the Sri Lankan Government.
When asked about India raising concerns about a Chinese submarine which docked in the Colombo Port, Mr. Jinchao said Chinese warships had continued to escort trading vessels through this shipping lane, and therefore it was nothing new. He said China would never use Sri Lanka against the security interest of another country.
