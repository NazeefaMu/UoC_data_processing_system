Seven people including two police officers were injured when a man wielding an axe went on the rampage at a train station in Dusseldorf.  


The suspected culprit has been arrested and German anti-terror police confirmed no other suspects were still at large.  


The 36-year-old man ran towards a nearby underground station and jumped from a bridge as he attempted to flee. But he was arrested after seriously injuring himself in his unsuccessful escape attempt and is now being treated in hospital.
