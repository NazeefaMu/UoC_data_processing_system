Dalada Maligawa declared worlds first Eco-Religious site
	
The Temple of the Tooth Relic knows as the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy had been named as the worlds first Green Religious Site, the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry said.
Accordingly, the entire temple premises will be made polythene/plastic-free zones.
The National programme to name the Temple of the Tooth as the worlds first green religious place of worship was held last Friday under the patronage Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
The Minister said the temple would provide recyclable vases at the entrance for devotees to offer flowers instead of the plastic vases that devotees bring inside the temple premises.
Only environmentally friendly waste bins would be used inside the temple premises under this programme, he said.
The Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government had allocated provisions to provide a special vehicle to dispose of flowers and food materials, he said.
Minister Musthapha said that his ministry intended to cover all the religious places in Sri Lanka under this programme.
The aim of this programme is to lessen the difficulties faced by devotees from environmental issues due to the garbage crisis, he said.

Involving Sanga, Mahela or me won't help Sri Lanka: Murali
	
With Sri Lankan Cricket team struggling at the moment, Muttiah Muralitharan said the experience of former greats like Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene or himself might come in handy and that the team will have to find solutions on its own, the Times of India reported.
"Since my retirement, I have not been involved in Sri Lankan cricket," he said. "It's been 5-6 years. I don't understand what's happening there. Without being aware of the situation, I don't think it will be right for me to comment. However, there is definitely a problem. The performance of the team has dipped and they will have to rectify it. Bringing in Sangakkara, Jayawardene or me won't be a solution because we are all busy with other commitments. Sangakkara is still playing cricket and Mahela is busy with coaching commitments just like me. So, they will have to look for a solution themselves," Murali, who has a colossal 800 Test wickets under his belt, added.
These are tough times for Sri Lankan cricket. The team recently lost a five-match one-day series against Zimbabwe, resulting in the resignation of skipper Angelo Mathews across all three formats. To make matters worse, they will be up against India - the No. 1 ranked side in Test cricket - next in a full-fledged tour that includes three Tests, five ODIs and one T20.
Even Sri Lankan great Muttiah Muralitharan gives them little chance as he expects the Indian spin duo of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to come up trumps. When India won the Test series in Sri Lanka in 2015, Ashwin was the Man of the Series with an astounding 21 wickets from three matches.
"Obviously, India will start as favourites. In Sri Lanka, I'm not too sure how the pitches will play. When India visit, they might get flat wickets. But Ashwin and Jadeja will do very well. The Sri Lankans are not playing well at the moment and both of them can capitalise on that advantage. Ashwin is now just going from strength to strength. He is a very smart cricketer and is bowling at his best right now," Muralitharan, who is has been named the mentor of VB Thiruvallur Veerans for the Tamil Nadu Premier League, said.
While Jadeja is the No. 1 Test bowler at the moment, he is closely followed by Ashwin at second spot. Asked whether they can continue their success, especially with tours outside the subcontinent coming up after Sri Lanka, Murali said: "In India, of course Ashwin and Jadeja will always be lethal. It all depends on the pitches. In South Africa and the other tours coming up, they will find it difficult as the wickets won't be favourable."
The 45-year-old Murali also opened up about Chennai Super Kings' (CSK) return to the IPL next year after the Supreme Court's two-year ban on the franchise came to an end on Friday. Murali enjoyed a hugely successful spell with CSK from 2008-10.

Med.Students parents to brief international community on IUSF arrests
	
The Parents Union of Medical Students (PUMS) said today that it would brief the international community through the embassies in Sri Lanka and UNHRC in Geneva over the violation of Human Rights by imprisoning university students without evidence of damaging state property.
PUMS vice president Dr. Sunimal Jayakody said the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Federation of Medical Teachers Association (FMTA) and Medical Faculty Students Union would also join in the campaign.
He said they would initially hand over a petition to the British High Commission today and added that they would not produce photographs and videos of the attack and human right violations as it would tarnish the image of the country but they would have to do so in the future if the students were not released.
He told a news conference that their repeated demands to release the five students who were remanded over the protest at Health Ministry had yielded no benefits as yet.
He said they condemned the attack on university students, who were protesting against the SAITM and added that the government should come up with a reasonable solution to the issue rather than trying to suppress the students struggle.
Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath said the government should abolish SAITM immediately and added that they would resort to a huge struggle if the Government was trying to suppress their struggle.
He said it was a huge lie to take over the Neville Fernando Teaching hospital (NFTH) and added that it was a misuse of State funds to do so. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Sri Lankan among 3 held for fake credit card scam in India
	
A Sri Lankan national and two Bengalureans have been arrested for defrauding bank customers in different countries of a staggering Indian Rs 100 crore by faking their credit cards in what is believed to be a massive online racket.
Divyan, a 30-year-old man from Jaffna, Sri Lanka, teamed up with Nawaz Shariff (22), a resident of Kanakanagar, and Nadeem Shariff (30), from HRBR Layout, to cheat credit card holders from Australia, Japan, Germany, Britain and other European countries. The gang targeted customers from these countries presuming that police would not come to India in search of them.
The suspects used an ingenious method to commit the fraud. First, they bought credit card data from shady websites. They then purchased magnetic swipe cards from e-commerce firms and used the secret data to clone credit cards. The next step was to contact businessmen from Haryana, Delhi, Mumbai and Puducherry who operate in Bengaluru and use point of sale (PoS) machines. They convinced these businessmen to allow them to swipe the credit cards at their PoS machines and promised them attractive commission on each transaction.
At this stage, the suspects acted cautiously. They always carried out transactions of low amounts so as to avoid scrutiny. Once the transactions were done, money would get transferred from the original card holders accounts in foreign banks to the businessmens bank accounts in India.
Foreign currency gets automatically converted into Indian rupees in case of credit card transactions. In these cases, credit cards were used and money was transferred without any sale taking place. Around 36 shopkeepers, some of the relatives of the suspects and bank officials were also part of the racket which had been going on for several years now and proved a money-spinner for all those involved.
The trios luck, however, ran out when they bought three LED television sets for Rs 1.1 lakh at Vishnupriya International, a home appliances store at Doddakallasandra, on June 21 and used a fake credit card to make the payment. The credit card turned out to be of a person from Bengaluru. The customer immediately blocked the card after receiving a message from the bank. The transaction was cancelled.
A team of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) happened to visit Canara Bank to investigate the increasing cases of online fraud. The bank staff informed the police about the illegal transaction at Vishnupriya International. The suspects had left a trail: they had given their phone number at the time of placing the order for the LED sets.
CCB sleuths started tracking them on the basis of the phones location and traced them to a three-bedroom flat at Prestige Collingwood in Jalahalli. During the raid, police found 144 fake credit cards, 16 fake driving licences, 36 card swipe machines, a card reader, a lamination machine, a card-printing machine and 270 plain cards.(Deccan Herald)

Taking over of NFTH will aggravate SAITM issue: Uni. heads
	
The Governments move to take over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) would aggravate the SAITM issue rather than resolving it, the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association (FFMTA) said today.
Prof. Mahinda Komalage of the Karapitiya Medical Faculty said that taking over of the NFTH was a proposal of Dr. Neville Fernando and added that it was only he who would be benefitted from the move.
Neither the GMOA, university students nor medical faculty heads requested the government to take over the NFTH. Only Dr. Fernando wanted the government to take it over as he could not maintain it due to high maintenance cost and lack of patients. It was a white elephant. He is the only person to feel happy over the decision to take it over, he said.
Prof. Komalage said another issue would arise if the Hospital was taken over with its staff including the doctors and nursing staff as most of the doctors are retired while the nurses are not registered with the Sri Lanka Nurses Council or Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). (Ajith Siriwardana)
