The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire


	

Nuwara Eliya, despite all the changes it has undergone over the years, remains the quintessential hill country retreat that the British envisaged over 150 years ago. While the masses flock to this scenic hideaway during April to seek refuge from the heat, crowding the streets and the few attractions it offers to the brim, Nuwara Eliya is a destination is best enjoyed at leisure, during the rest of the year; even during the rainy seasons.

The town itself is like many others, narrow roads packed with shops selling food, electronics, toys and even branded winter clothing at a steep discount from the high street retail prices.

Move away from the city and that is where its true beauty lies.

Perched on a hilltop off the road to World’s End, is The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, a quaint little cottage style boutique villa that embodies the hill country experience in every sense of the word. The property sits between a stunning vista of a lake and a mountain range to one side and farms and quaint little colorful homes on the other. 



The property itself keeps with the black and white exterior of old colonial buildings, with a twist of modernity. The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, has an immaculately landscaped garden space with flowering plants in bright hues dotting the garden. You walk inside to a completely different world than what you would expect, with plush carpeting, soft fabric finished Victorian style furniture and a reception featuring repurposed railway sleepers.  

The owner of the property had a vision of creating a cozy, well-appointed space with a touch of modernity, that gives you the privacy and luxury of experiencing the beauty and wonder of Nuwara Eliya at your pace which has materialized into this beautiful property which is worth a visit.   

Find your own nook 

A well-thought-out feature of the property are the cozy little nooks of seating spread throughout, each offering views of the wonderful vistas that surround you. Pick a place indoors or outdoors or even within some of the rooms itself, this is a fabulous way to curl up with a good book and hot cup of bright Nuwara Eliya tea. 

Cozy up in the Coal Room

Arguably the best feature at The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, apart from the scenery that is, is the Coal Room. The dark hues of red fabric, repurposed wood, wrought iron and stone blend seamlessly with the floor level seating and the fireplace complete with a weather-beaten buffalo skull and horns hanging over the mantel piece. Pages of an old telephone book have been put to good use as wallpaper, giving this space a nice vintage charm. Wooden and wrought iron wheels are a key design feature that is hard to miss and bring an old western flair along with the skull and horns on the mantel. This room is always warm and cozy, even without the fire place being lit. Square-paned windows offer a glimpse of a lush landscaped garden past the veranda with its recliners and table for two. 



Service with a smile 

The amiable manager of the property, Tuan Amanulla is also the chef. His culinary versatility is such that he can create a good Sri Lankan rice and curry and a delicious pasta dish without a moment’s hesitation. The property has an a la carte menu featuring a wide range of dishes to choose from, ask him and he is sure to guide you through the best picks that suit your whim and fancy. If you are the outdoorsy kind and want to enjoy a chilly evening under the stars they also have a BBQ and fire pit set up. The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, is more than just luxury comfort. The property is planning to create an organic vegetable garden from where guests can pick their own vegetables and get them prepared by the chef according to their liking.

5 things to do when you book your stay at The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire

Take a trip to Ambewela Farm. Even if you don’t fancy a visit to the farm to see the pretty cows grazing in the meadow or cute little bunnies in shades of black, white, grey and brown, do it for the breathtaking scenery en-route.
Tip: Check on feeding times if you are visiting the farm. It is not as cute was feeding baby elephants, but it’s still fun and totally instagram worthy. 

Pick strawberries on the way to Ambewela. There are quite a few strawberry farms along the way, including Jagro so don’t forget to stop by to pick your self some juicy bright red strawberries to take home with you.

Take a trip to World’s End. Not for away from the property, this gives you the perfect opportunity to take the journey of a life time. 

You can also visit Hakkgala Gardens, Horton Plains and the Seetha Amman Kovil during your visit. 
Take a scenic boat ride in the Kande Ella reservoir.

Tips: 

Take the train: The journey by train is arguably the best when visiting Nuwara Eliya, booking a first and second-class ticket on short notice is out of the question as seats are booked months in advance. 

On the road: If you are driving up to Nuwara Eliya, take your time, stop and enjoy the attractions on the way. Kithulgala is a great stop over. Both Wattawala and Mlesna have great rest houses, each with its own unique offerings. 

Take a rain coat or poncho. It’s much easier than lugging around an umbrella and can even act as a windbreaker.

The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire is located at 73/1, Dimuthugama Potato Farm, Meepilimanna, Nuwara Eliya.
