Delicious work of art!

Q: Tell me a bit about yourself?
A: I am Chandana Wijeratne. I live in Yakkala with my wife, two daughters and son. I've been in this profession for 25 years
Q: How long have you been at your present work place?
A: I've been with Ramada Colombo for 2 years on this current stint. I also worked here in late 2000 for two years.
Q: Why are you a chef?
A: I'm extremely passionate about what I do. To me I love the thought of creating something. It doesn't feel like just food, it feels like a work of art. I truly believe in soul cooking. It's about making a connection with my guests and serving them from the heart.
Q: What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen?
A: I feel it's what I was made to do. It doesn't really feel like work. I guess there is truth behind finding what you love to do and it will never seem like another day of work after.
Q: Who is your biggest critic?
A: Well, that would be my children!
Q: How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen?
A: Guests have very varied tastes. If dishes are rejected it means they may not meet the guests particular preferences. At such times it is very important to speak to the guest personally and understand what they wish for. Any dish can be customised and the guest expectations can be exceeded.
I would see this as an opportunity to open a dialogue and improve communication. In reality this is the best way to build loyalty in your guests. Often guests who have complained at one point have later become regular repeat guests and overtime my good friends.
Q: When at home...do you cook or do you let your partner take control?
A: At home, both my wife and I take turns in the kitchen. Of course when she was pregnant with our children it was most flattering that she only wanted to eat food that I cooked for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in between.
Q: If you were not a chef...what would you be today?
A: It's hard for me to think of being anything other than a chef.
Q: Demi: Of all the places you worked, what are your greatest memories?
A: In over the 20 years of experience, I have had the good fortune of meeting and serving world famous personalities. However one memory will forever remain in my heart - Chairman of Tata Sons, Ratan Tata on a brief visit to Sri Lanka stopped over at the hotel I then worked at.
Full of awe for this great man I expected his dinner order to be of a grand nature. I was humbled by Mr. Tata - his dinner request was for simple Sri Lankan hoppers with white curry. I made these items personally and served them myself. This incident has had a remarkable effect on my own life - I always use it to remind myself of the importance of being simple.
