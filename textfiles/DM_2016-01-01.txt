Air Force unlikely to buy Pakistan made JF-17s
	
The Sri Lankan Air Force (SLAF) is unlikely to buy the Pakistan-made and Chinese-designed JF-17, a third generation jet fighter, even if Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pushes for it during his sojourn in Colombo between January 4 and 6, a leading Lankan defense expert has told the Indian Express.
Reacting to a report by Anthony Davies in IHS Janes 360, dated December 29, saying that Sharif will press for its purchase, the Lankan expert who did not want to be identified said that two factors will prevent Colombo from going in for it: First, there is Indias opposition.
And second, there is the cost factor, with the fighters going at USD 35 million apiece. But the SLAF is eager to replace its aging Kfirs and MIG 27.
Official Indian sources denied any knowledge of Lankas intention to purchase the JF-17 from Pakistan or Indias counter offer to provide its Light Combat Aircraft Tejas. But the Lankan media has been talking about these for some time, briefed by none other than the Air Force Commander Air Marshal Gagan Bulathsinghala.
The Lankans are probably aware that the Tejas has a problem. While the JF-17 is a fully developed aircraft in operation since 2010, Tejas is still undergoing development following the discovery of some flaws by the Indian Air Force.
While Pakistan has to sell the JF-17 to justify the existence of a production facility, and may even offer credit, the Lankan defense expert quoted above wondered if Lanka will be able to afford the aircraft given the fact that it is in the doldrums financially with huge international debts to repay.
Additionally, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe may not approve of the SLAFs plans to buy fighter jets, given his interest in giving the island nation a Blue Water navy to safeguard its coastline more effectively, and also to play a meaningful role in international maritime security as desired by the US.
Finally, given the current bonhomie between Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seen in the unscheduled meeting at Lahore recently, many wonder if Sharif will ruffle Indias feathers now by pushing for the sale of the JF-17.

CB Chief says no dire need for emergency funding
	
The country has no need to raise emergency funds, though the government may decide to make a formal request to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for some sort of arrangement between Sri Lanka and the multilateral lender, Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran said.
The government at the moment is in informal consultation (with IMF). As part of that consultation, the government may decide to make a formal request for some sort of arrangement between the IMF and Sri Lanka. But it is at a very early stage, nothing has been decided so far, Mahendran said.
Sri Lanka is still a beneficiary of an IMF stand-by-facility obtained in 2009, and as a result, IMF sends teams twice a year. A team from IMF is due in February this year.
According to Governor Mahendran, the countrys foreign reserves are at comfortable levels4.5 months worth of importsthough he admitted that some of that were borrowed.
But the country is in no dire need of any emergency funding of any sort and therefore may be theres no need to speculate that the IMF is coming for the rescue of Sri Lanka.
Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said Sri Lanka total debt payments inclusive of interest and IMF payments in the next 12 months stand around US $ 2.3 billion.
He also said that there is US $ 2 billion worth of long term swap obligation which would be rolled over at current market rates as per the agreements.
Swaps are rolled over every year at current market rates, those moneys are not going out, he noted.
Governor Mahendran said one of the reasons Sri Lanka is talking to the IMF and the World Bank was to refinance these swaps, obtained through state banks such as the Bank of Ceylon, at concessional rates.
There is absolutely no cause for alarm, he asserted.
Sri Lankas economy grew 5.2 percent in the first 9 months of 2015 against 2.4 percent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
The fiscal deficit in the first 9 months is estimated at 5.1 percent up from 4.8 percent in the same period of the previous year. Sri Lanka targets a 5.9 percent budget deficit for 2015.

Fire engulfs Dubai's high-rise Address hotel
	
Firefighters battled a blaze that engulfed a luxury hotel in Dubai Thursday night while a spectacular New Year's fireworks display lit up the night sky nearby.
Orange tentacles of flames engulfed a large section of the high-rise Address Downtown Dubai hotel soon after the fire started around 9:30 p.m. (12:30 p.m. ET). Witnesses said they heard explosions as the fire raged.
Hours later, dark plumes of smoke billowed from the building as the fire still appeared to be searing several stories.
Bruce Szczepanski, who watched from the balcony of a nearby hotel, said he could still hear parts of the building crashing to the ground more than nine hours after the blaze began.
"There are huge flames, and you can hear the structure falling and the thuds," he said.

Bridge over Kandy Lake to ease traffic: Kiriella
	
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday steps would be taken to construct a bridge across the Kandy Lake to ease the movement of traffic in the Kandy City.
He conveyed this information to the media after accompanying President Maithripala Sirisena on a visit to the Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera on Thursday evening.
Responding to questions asked by journalists, the minister said the Government would implement a traffic plan to ease traffic just like he had successfully completed the surface carpeting of 60 roads in Kandy.
He said the Colombo-Kandy Expressway would begin from Kandy and that the development of Kandy was now receiving high priority. The minister said these programmes would begin this month and accused the previous regime of treating Kandy District in an off-handed manner. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

One dead in Dubai hotel fire
	
One person is dead and more than a dozen injured after the massive fire overtook the Address Downtown hotel in Dubai, just hours before a New Years Eve fireworks display went off nearby, the National Post reported. 
The fire erupted in the Downtown hotel, where thousands of people have gathered to watch the fireworks.
The 63-storey hotel and residence is close to the world-famous Burj Khalifa, the largest skyscraper in the world, where the fireworks displays were set to go off.
Officials initially said there were only minor injuries, but one person is now reported dead as a result of a heart attack or stroke suffered amid the chaos.
Officials also confirmed 14 minor injuries as a result of the blaze, as well as one moderate injury and the heart attack, but said all victims received medical attention.
They said the reported injuries were a result of overcrowding at the site and smoke. No children were hurt.

## Title: Political Settlement Based on  the Federal Idea in a New  Sri Lanka
## Section: DBS Jeyaraj Column

Political Settlement Based on  the Federal Idea in a New  Sri Lanka
	
By D.B.S.JeyarajThe new year has dawned on a note of hope and optimism for Sri Lanka. On January 9, 2016 President Maithripala Sirisena is scheduled to present a resolution in Parliament proposing that Parliament be converted into a Constitutional Assembly. The envisaged Constitutional Assembly is different to the Constituent Assembly which drafted the 1972 Republican Constitution. The political vision of the Sirisena Wickremesinghe Government is to enact a new Constitution differently. A Consensual approach would be adopted. A steering committee comprising representatives of all political parties would help guide the Constitutional Assembly in drafting a new Constitution. After it is approved by the Cabinet the draft would be presented in Parliament where it would have to be passed with a two-thirds majority before it is put to a countrywide referendum.
A key objective of the new Constitution will be ethnic amity and national reconciliation. A prerequisite in this regard would be inter-racial justice and equality. In that context a suitable power sharing arrangement on pluralistic and egalitarian lines needs to be established. More importantly this power sharing arrangement has to be endorsed by a vast majority cutting across race, religion and region.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasised the urgent need for a political solution to be found through the new Constitution when he delivered the 2015 Sita Jayawardena memorial oration. The Premier stated as follows, The Party Leaders in Parliament and a great majority of parliamentarians have agreed on the need for national reconciliation and a political solution to the longstanding ethnic and religious issues. We have agreed that a national government of the two main parties would provide the best possible mechanism for reconciliation.
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and I -- both of whom entered Parliament in 1977, are committed to an early political solution. President Maithripala Sirisena also campaigned on the promise of national reconciliation. We cannot and should not miss the opportunity this time. There will not be a next time.The emerging consensus is to work within the structure of the 13th Amendment to the 1977 Constitution -- a unitary structure with further devolution of powers.
There are those who also favour the inclusion of the devolution of power to the local authorities and even to grassroots levels through the proposed Grama Rajya Kendra. The impeding task is to identify the additional powers to be devolved to the Provincial Councils.
Ranil Wickremesinghe is not only the Prime Minister but also the leader of the United National Party (UNP) which is the chief constituent of the present Good Governance Govt. The PM saying that the emerging consensus is to work within a unitary structure with further devolution of powers could be seen therefore as the emerging Sinhala Consensus on power sharing. Though the Sinhala majority viewpoint is of crucial importance, it is not the solitary point of view in Sri Lanka. There are other viewpoints too. Contrary to the past where the majority thrust its opinion upon the minority ethnicities, it is necessary in the more enlightened present to forge a national consensus inclusive of other minority viewpoints too. The opinion of the Sri Lankan Tamils, who have campaigned relentlessly for an equitable power sharing arrangement is very important in this instance.A prerequisite in this regard would be inter-racial justice and equality. In that context a suitable power sharing arrangement on pluralistic and egalitarian lines needs to be established. More importantly this power sharing arrangement has to be endorsed by a vast majority cutting across race, religion and region.
The evolving Tamil viewpoint on power sharing  seems somewhat different to that of the political solution envisaged by the Prime Minister. The Tamil people aspire for greater autonomy in their areas of historic habitation. Recent political developments within the Tamil polity indicate that strong efforts would be made by accredited Tamil political representatives to seek a new political arrangement based on federal lines. Even if the word Federalism is not used explicitly the emphasis would be on maximum devolution amounting to quasi-federalism.Tamil National Alliance ManifestoThe premier political configuration of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) manifesto for the August 2015 election outlined its position on a political solution thus, The principles and specific constitutional provisions that the TNA considers to be paramount to the resolution of the national question relate mainly to the sharing of the powers of governance through a shared sovereignty among the peoples who inhabit this island. The following salient features of power sharing are fundamental to achieving genuine reconciliation, lasting peace and development for all the Peoples of Sri Lanka.
The TNA Manifesto stated that, Power sharing arrangements must continue to be established as they existed earlier in a unit of a merged Northern and Eastern Provinces based on a Federal structure. The Tamil-speaking Muslim historical inhabitants shall be entitled to be beneficiaries of all power-sharing arrangements in the North-East. This will in no way inflict any disability on any People.
It could be seen therefore that there was a divergence of opinion between the Government and the main Opposition TNA on the appropriate structure of power sharing. While the Government is for power sharing through maximum devolution within a unitary structure the TNA is for power sharing arrangements based on a federal structure. This variance is illustrative of the unitary-federal divide that has impeded the progress of a viable political settlement in the past. The silver lining in the current scenario is the inclusive approach of the present government and the excellent personal relations among TNA leader Sampanthan and the Maithripala  Ranil  Kumaratunga triumvirate. Whatever the postures adopted at present there are very good chances of a flexible approach by both sides during discussions and negotiations. The tunnel may be dark but unlike in the past there is certainly light at the end.
It is against this backdrop that this column wishes to focus attention to the concept of federalism  within both a national and international context. It is well-known that the words Federalism or Federal became dirty words in the Sri Lankan political milieu in the past. Sinhala hard-line opinion viewed federalism as an euphemism for secessionism or a stepping stone to a Separate State. On the other hand, hawkish Tamil opinion favouring Tamil Eelam rejected federalism as a betrayal or sell-out of the Tamil political struggle. Thus Federalism became the F-word in Sri Lankan politics. It is indeed a tragedy that the concept of federalism or the federal idea was so crudely and cruelly dismissed without any consideration of its merits or plus points.The Federal Idea Isnt Such a Bad Idea
It was perhaps the merit in what is called the federal idea which prompted former US president Bill Clinton to observe, Maybe the federal idea isnt such a bad idea after all . This was in 1999 when he was the most powerful man on earth. It was at the end of the conference on federalism at Mont Tremblant in Quebec that Clinton made this remark. Incidentally former cabinet minister G.L. Peiris also addressed this path-breaking conclave organized by the Forum of Federations based in Ottawa.
What then is this federal idea It is in one sense a concept that embodies various related things like federalism, federal systems, federations and federalist, etc. This is a world where the word federal has become almost the F  word in politics. Different countries and different entities for different reasons frown on this F  word. Therefore federal idea has become an indirect reference to this F  word. If a rose by any other name could smell as sweet then the word federalism too can be sanitised and discussed as the federal idea.
Let me quote Canadas Bob Rae, former Ontario premier, MP and ex-president of the forum of federations on this. In his foreword to the handbook of Federal Countries published by the forum, Rae has this to say  There has been a profound resurgence in interest in the federal idea in the last decade. I choose the phrase federal idea because the ism in federalism has a way of limiting debate and understanding.
In Spain the central government doesnt like to use the federal word as it seems to indicate erosion of sovereign authority. Ironically Catalonians in Spain also frown on this because in their perception federalism is not enough to articulate the unique Catalonian identity and right of self  government. In South Africa the earlier apartheid regime set up some federal structures to contain and diffuse pan-African yearning for freedom. So federalism became a dirty word to the blacks. When the African national congress attained power with its vision of one South Africa the ANC did not want to describe the new Constitution as federalist.
Sri Lankans are well aware of what Rae meant. In Lankas deeply polarised society federalism is certainly the F  word and worse. There is marked reluctance and trepidation on the part of many to espouse federalism openly. This is sad but quite understandable in a situation where federalism is seen as betrayal by both sides. One sees it as a conspiracy to break up the nation while the other views it as a ruse to stymie the quest for total independence. While Sri Lankans on both sides of the ethnic divide look on federalism with suspicion the rest of the world is in ferment over the federal idea. There was a time when federalism was seen as the ideal remedy for many of the worlds political maladies. It was perceived as the universal device to achieve unity in diversity. Experience has shown that this is not necessarily true in all situations. At the same time federal arrangements have certainly helped wield cohesiveness in many cases.40% Of World Humanity In 25 Federal Countries
Twenty Five Countries today have federal or quasi-federal structures. These range from the sole superpower USA to tiny St. Kitts and Nevis; from Canada in the North to Micronesia in the South; from India in the East to Switzerland in the West. The populations in these countries together amounts to more than 40% of the worlds total humanity. In addition there are some countries that are not federal but have special administrative arrangements amounting to de-facto quasi-federalism.
Let us proceed alphabetically. Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Comoros, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the federated states of Micronesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, Venezeula are Federal countries. While most are explicitly federal a few like Spain are not, but in actuality are federal in all but name. Incidentally, Ranil Wickremesinghe in his Sita Jayawardena oration spoke of Austria as a potential model for Sri Lankan power sharing.
Though federal none of these countries share exactly the same system. Each country has different administrative arrangements and internal structures. They also vary greatly in size. Russia has republics and many types of regions within; India has states and union territories; Switzerland has cantons while Germany and Austria have landers. Belgium has three regions and three cultural communities while Spain has autonomous regions; the USA has states, confederacies, local home rule territories, unincorporated territories and native American domestic dependent nations while Canada has provinces, territories and aboriginal organizations. Venezeula has states, territories, federal dependencies, federal district and many Islands.
Apart from federal and quasi-federal states there are also Countries having de-centralized unions with federal features. The United Kingdom comprising England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and five self-governing islands is the best known example of this kind. Italy with 15 ordinary and five autonomous regions is another; Netherlands has 11 provinces and one associated state; Japan has 47 prefectures; Fiji Islands is a consolidation of two ethnic communities; Colombia has 23 departments, four inter-dependencies and three commissaries. Ukraine has 24 oblasts, two metropolitan areas and the autonomous republic of Crimea; The peoples republic of China has 22 provinces,5 autonomous regions, four municipalities, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao.
Another phenomenon is that of Countries with federacies and associative states. Bhutan is an associative state of India. Nine and Cook Islands are associative states of New Zealand. Netherlands Antilles, San Marino, Liechenstein, Monaco are associative states of Netherlands, Italy. Switzerland and France respectively. Puerto Rico and Northern Marianas are federacies of the USA. Madeira and Azores Islands are Portuguese federates. Likewise Greenland and Faroe Islands are Danish federates. Britain has the federates of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Aaland Islands are a Federacy of Finland.Each Country Has Its Own Unique Arrangement
It could be seen therefore that the federal idea is not restricted to categorical federal or quasi-federal states alone. The federal idea is a free spirit permeating the body politic of many states. There is no mono-principle here. Each country has fashioned its own unique arrangement to suit its needs. Apart from the administrative convenience and the imperative to provide citizens with the best form of government these Countries have also taken into account diversity of peoples, regional variety and imbalances, historic and geographic necessity, etc as criteria to evolve systems of governance. There has been no rigorous dogma stifling aspirations of constituent peoples.
The federal idea has assumed a new importance and related vigour in recent times. There are a number of reasons for this. Ronald Watts of the Institute of Intergovernmental relations at the Queens university in Kingston, Canada is the author of Comparing federal systems.
An excerpt from it explains this global trend, Modern developments in transportation, social communications, technology, and industrial organization have produced pressures at one and the same time for larger political organizations and for smaller ones. The pressure for larger political units has been generated by the goals shared by most Western and non-Western societies today; a desire for progress, a rising standard of living, social justice and influence in the world arena and by a growing awareness of worldwide inter-dependence in an era whose advanced technology makes both mass destruction and mass-construction possible.
The desire for smaller self-governing political units has risen from the desire to make governments more responsive to the individual citizen and to give expression to primary group attachments-linguistic and cultural ties, religious connections, historical traditions and social practices-which provide the distinctive basis for a communitys sense of identity and yearning for self-determination. Given these dual pressures, more and more peoples have come to see some form of federalism, combining a shared government for specified common purposes with autonomous action by constituent units of government for purposes related to maintaining their regional distinctiveness as allowing the closest institutional approximation to the multi-national reality of the contemporary world.
Ronald Watts sums up the essence of the federal idea. On the one hand there is the tendency to form larger entities including supra-national bodies like the European union. On the other there is the need to accommodate different intra-national aspirations of an ethnic nature. So Belgium reverts to federalism to satisfy the Flemish and the Walloons while Brussels is the seat of the EU parliament. The Union Jack flag may have the crosses of St. George, St. St.Andrew, St. David and St. Patrick but merry England cannot hold the United Kingdom together without devolving power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Modern Ceylon is a British Creation
The Sri Lankan ethnic conflict has its genesis in colonialism. Modern Ceylon as Sri Lanka was known then is a British creation. The Island was unified administratively but the people were divided politically through representation on communal lines. What was united to exploit was divided to govern. In the absence of adequate and equitable forms of power-sharing the Island is wracked with post-Independence conflict within pre-Independence boundaries.
Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism has been primarily reactive in nature. The Tamils thought of themselves as being on par with the Sinhala people as co-founders of the modern nation of Ceylon. Universal franchise and territorial representation reduced them to a principal minority. The Tamils still thought of themselves as belonging to the Island in its entirety. So they wanted balanced representation and then adopted responsive cooperation as political strategies. When these failed came the Federal demand. Tamil self-perception now confined itself as a regional minority. Even here the political leaders were prepared to compromise far short of federalism and opted for alternatives like regional councils, district councils, etc. Finally came the desperate cry for separation and resultant armed struggle. Federalism if adopted at the appropriate time may have prevented the bloodshed and carnage that ensued after the ethnic conflict escalated.
Federalism was proposed even in 2002 as a possible solution. The greatest achievement of the Norway brokered peace process was the agreement in Oslo to explore federalism. Whatever its merits or deficiencies federalism cannot be imposed on any people. The element of consent and mutual cooperation is essential for any system to work. If Sri Lanka is to become federal or quasi-federal or even have devolved powers within appropriate units in a unitary system the various segments of this nation have to work and live together as one country. For this a better understanding of the federal idea is required.
The proponents of federalism argue that adopting it will strengthen unity and territorial integrity. Switzerland, India, Malaysia, Belgium, Germany, Spain, etc are cited as examples. But it cannot be denied that federalism has failed to prevent secession too. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are well-known examples. The Malaysia-Singapore and Pakistan-Bangladesh splits of the past as well as modern break-ups of Czec - Slovakia, Serbia and Montenegro are also lessons. In Canada, separatism flourished in Quebec despite federalism. Britain devolved power to Scotland and Wales but secessionism seems to have gained ground there. Nigerian federalism did not prevent the Biafran civil war.
There are however many nuances to take into account when analysing the countries in question. At one end of the spectrum are Belgium and Spain willingly opting for federalism as a solution to curb separatist tendencies. Yet Belgium and Spain continue to have issues. In Canada the equation is changing with the new leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois announcing that no referendum to facilitate secessionist sovereignty will be held in the near future. The main Quebec parties are now for greater autonomy and powers within a united Canada. Recent amendments in Germany have strengthened federalism. India through its co-operative federalism model is becoming more and more federal in practice. The reverse is visible in Australia and USA where increasing centralised authority is slowly eroding the concept of pure federalism.Issues of federal governence are at the centre of active political and legal discussions in every part of the globeNo One Size Fits All Type Of Solution
Federalism therefore provides no one size fits all type of solution. Each Country has to examine and adopt arrangements conducive and suitable for individual needs. Sri Lanka too needs to explore the federal idea intensively and fully before deciding whether to accept or reject it or adopt it with appropriate innovation. The federal idea is dynamic and constantly evolving. What we in Sri Lanka need to do is to explore the federal idea and have an informed debate about its pros and cons and also on deciding whether we adopt or reject it.
In spite of the heat generated in Sri Lanka by this F  word there is no denying that the Federal idea is catching on in a world of ferment. The Federal idea is impacting greatly on a world changing fast. In the words of Bob Rae, The resurgence of the federal idea has at its core many different causes. The vitality of the values of democracy, the revolutions in the politics of identity and human rights, the twin collapse of apartheid and bureaucratic communism, the impact of the technological revolution, the economic changes we associate with the word globalisation, all these have made their contributions.
This renewal is not at all confined to countries that have a federalist tradition. Countries have long had to struggle with the simple truth that geography is rarely synonymous with automatic homogeneity. Ethnic, linguistic, racial and religious conflicts have become the dominant issues facing the world order today.
Wars after 1945 have been as much within countries as between them, with disastrous consequences for peace and security. It is no longer soldiers dying in millions but civilians. From Rwanda to Cambodia, from the Balkans to East Timor the battleground was within countries that are unable to resolve the conflicts of what Michael Ignatieff has called, blood and belonging.
It is in this context that the federal idea is re-emerging. Indeed, issues of federal governence are at the centre of active political and legal discussions in every part of the globe, particularly in areas where conflict resolution is a critical necessity. National sovereignty is not dead and the age of the nation-state is not over. But the notion that these are exclusive or all defining is clearly outmoded. Governance practices within countries are inevitably subject to the scrunity of world political and economic opinion, and most important, to the rule of law itself.
The collapse of the one party state, the demands of identity, the urge to local empowerment, the insistence on greater openness and transparency in government, and the recognition that in a smaller and much more inter-dependent world sovereignty is no longer an absolute, has brought the federal idea to the fore again.
This then is what the federal idea is all about! Whatever the misgivings about the Federal Idea in Sri Lankan politics, dilly-dallying over a politically acceptable settlement is a luxury we cannot afford. The important point is to note that the military defeat of the LTTE has not and will not result in the Tamil national question being resolved automatically. The LTTE was only a virulent symptom of the malady. Getting rid of the LTTE is no durable remedy.Kolombata Kiri, Gamata Kekiri
What is required now is the creation of a just, egalitarian and plural society. There must be equitable power-sharing based on principles of devolution relating to the federal idea.Power must not be confined to Colombo alone but shared with the periphery. The saying Kolombata kiri, Gamata kekiri should lose its potency and validity.
Sri Lanka has to be re-invented as a country where all her children can live together in amity and fraternity. A new vision must be re-imagined in which no one will claim superior rights on the basis of belonging to the majority race or religion or claim exclusive rights to their historic habitat. Sri Lanka belongs to all its people from Paruthithurai to Devinuwara and Mannar to Mullaithivu. All people regardless of race, religion, caste or creed must have their say and a role to play in the brave new Lanka/Ilankai that beckons us all.D.B.S.

PRECIFAC receives 900 complaints: Two probes completed
	
PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille de Silva said today the commission was able to complete investigations into two complaints out of 25 major complaints received in 2015.
He said the commission had received 900 complaints in 2015 of which 300 were referred to its police investigation team.
Our commission has been able to complete investigating two major cases in five months since the setting up of the police team in July last year. Even though the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) was established in March last year, the investigations began only in August after the appointment of police personnel. Investigations into two other complaints would be completed in the next two months, Mr. Silva said.
He said complaints into misappropriation and financial irregularities in SriLankan airlines, Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd., the Coconut Development Authority, Lak Sathosa, the State- owned ITN and the National Housing Development Authority were among the major investigations that were being carried out by PRECIFAC.
Mr. Silva said in addition to the police personnel carrying out investigations, four High Court Judges and a former Auditor General have been appointed to assist the commission. (Ajith Siriwardana)

WPC JHU members to act independently
	
The three Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Western Provincial councillors would act independently in future, JHU National Organiser and Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said today.
Ven. Thembuwana Piyananda Thera, Mr. Warnasinghe and Nirosha Athukorala are the three JHU members in the WPC and they were elected from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance ticket.
The decision had been taken soon after WP Chief Minister Isura Devapriya took over the Health Ministry, which was earlier held by Mr. Warnasinghe, on Wednesday.
The Chief Minister took over the Health Ministry following the defeat of the ministrys financial expenditure on December 22 by a majority of 22 votes with 23 councillors voting in favour and 45 against.
However, when the financial statement of the Health Ministry was tabled in the council on Thursday, it was unanimously passed along with the financial statements of other ministries of the council. 
Former health minister Warnasinghe said the unanimous approval of the financial statements of all ministries proved the presence of a hidden agenda in the defeat of his former ministry's financial statement. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
