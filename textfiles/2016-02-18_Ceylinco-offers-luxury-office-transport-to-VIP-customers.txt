Adding yet another amazing benefit to its wide variety of value additions, Ceylinco General Insurance unveiled the Ceylinco VIP Express concept, enabling Ceylinco VIP On The Spot policyholders, living in suburban Colombo to have the luxury of travelling conveniently to and from office, for a nominal fee, on an exclusive, ultra-modern bus service, commencing shortly. 


‘Ceylinco VIP Express’ will provide a convenient, economical, state-of-the-art and safe service, which will no doubt, ease the burden of driving and other stressful elements related to traffic congestions.
The traffic congestion on the streets of Colombo and its suburbs is worsening by the day, while it is a highly stressful exercise to negotiate nightmarish traffic jams. In addition to the stress, vehicle users incur huge costs for fuel, ware and tare, as well as for repairs, due to the increasing number of accidents. Moreover, it has also become a huge economic loss for the country, as it is estimated that 1.5 percemt of GDP is lost due to traffic congestion annually.

Ceylinco General Insurance, the trendsetter in the insurance industry in Sri Lanka, has always introduced innovative solutions to alleviate the burning issues confronted by its customers.


Ajith Gunawardena, Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco General Insurance, commenting on the newest innovation, said: “The intention of ‘Ceylinco VIP Express’ is to provide a convenient, comfortable, economical and punctual office transport system, to and from Greater Colombo areas to the City of Colombo, at a reasonable price, ‘Ceylinco VIP Express’ will commence daily from Homagama, Panadura, Negombo, Kaduwela and Kadawatha towns, at 6.45am, and will reach Colombo and Fort by 8.10am. And, once again, at 5.30pm in the evening, will leave from Fort/Colombo  and will reach the same towns by 6.45pm.”


‘Ceylinco VIP Express’ will be the latest addition to the long list of benefits enjoyed by Ceylinco VIP On The Spot customers. In 2015, Ceylinco VIP added yet another unique benefit to its long list of value additions, offering an Accidental Health Insurance worth Rs.4 million absolutely free to all Ceylinco VIP On The Spot customers. Amongst the other benefits Ceylinco VIP offers are a similar replacement vehicle, in the event the accident repair exceeds four days, personal accident cover of up to Rs.200,000/- for each passenger, 24/7 emergency roadside assistance, with a 24/7 call centre, the insured value of  the vehicle increasing by 10 percent every year, the payment of lease instalments of up to two months in the event of a repair exceeding 30 days, a 10 year warranty for your vehicle against manufacturers defects, valid for the first 10 years from the year of manufacture etc.


Once again, Ceylinco General Insurance sets the benchmark high for the rest of the insurance industry to follow, thereby benefitting the millions of Sri Lankans.
