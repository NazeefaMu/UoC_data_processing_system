Prageeth Ekneligoda’s wife Sandya Eknelygoda was awarded the U.S. Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award for 2017, which was awarded for the exceptional courage and commitment of women who serve as advocates for human rights, justice, peace, and gender equality.

It was awarded each year by the U.S. Department of State and Ekneligoda joins twelve other women from across the globe to receive the award for 2017. First Lady Melania Trump and Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas A. Shannon presented the award to Mrs. Eknelygoda for her tireless pursuit of justice for her husband, and on behalf of missing families from across Sri Lanka’s diverse ethnic and religious communities.
