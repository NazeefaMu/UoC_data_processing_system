[APPRECIATIONS - (30-11-2015)]

Ven. Sobitha Thera:
He believed in non violence and realised truth of Buddha's noble middle path
The untimely passing away of Most Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera of the Naga Viharaya, Kotte on November 7, 2015 is an irreparable loss to all Buddhists worldwide and all Sri Lankans in particular.
His keen insight, hindsight, foresight and unselfish delivery of Buddhism related topics countrywide to educate the masses led to crucial political changes in the recent past, paving the way to a more peaceful, contented, and truly exceptional island, setting an example to all other countries with similar problems related to greed, corruption, immorality and ignorance mainly of those in power to rule.
My mother Leela who lived to be 100 and six months was a devout Buddhist who was very fortunate to be able to follow the footsteps of Ven. Sobitha and whom we all knew from the year of his ordination at age 11.
His sermons and discussions were of high calibre and were attracted by all citizens of all ages, young and old. His discourses whether they were in the form of conversation, debate, sermons, conference, or discussions taught us good will, loving kindness, sympathetic joy, and an unbiased attitude in our daily lives.
He did not praise those who should be criticised but did attribute lots of commendation and admiration to those rich or poor, who were on the right track and unselfish with a mindset geared to provide healthy actions or words of wisdom for the good of the people.
He believed in non violence and realised the truth of the Buddha's Noble middle path and always respected public opinion and sacrificed his own physical health for the sake of people's harmony and peaceful coexistence.
Let us all honour Ven. Sobitha Thera by following the middle path and always mindful of the footsteps laid by him during his lifetime, and devoid of irresponsible behaviour in all aspects of our lives that could otherwise ruin not only one's own life but also the lives of the kith and kin and neighbours and society in general.
May Ven. Sobitha Thera to attain Nirvana. Richard Dharmay
Kularathne Ganegoda:
A trustful friend
This tribute is not only from me but also from my whole family, the Samarakoon family of my wife of Walbolana as well as G. Athauada, an English Teacher, who is already retired now.
Kularathne Ganegoda became a friend of mine in the mid 1970s through my second elder brother Sarath Chandra Dissanayake of Kukulnape, Pallewela, when he was conducting English Classes for G.C.E. (O/L) students at Wickramasila Vidashna Pirivena at Walbolana, before my brother became a government English teacher in 1977.
Kule and his fiancée Ariyawathie (who he married later) also attended classes at that time. Since then, Kule became a good friend of mine until his untimely recent death. In August, 1978, I diverted my way of life doing a job joining to Port (Cargo) Corporation while Kule chose and succeeded his way of life becoming an English tuition master conducting English classes around Kandy, Kurunegala and Pallewela by becoming a famous English tuition master in this area after a few years.
His eternal contribution to the English education to the students of this area was exceptional. Some are now doing well abroad. Kule was very popular and well known and most of the young guys of Borukgomuwa village used to call him Loku Aiya all the time. All villagers respected him, because, he was always humble and generous to the people.
Kule you were a devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother, father in law and a trustful friend to the villagers of Borukgomuwa as well as the adjoining villagers of Borukgomuwa.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Dr. Asoka de Z Gunawardena J:
A man with a human touch
Eleven years have passed since the demise of one of the greatest legal luminaries of this country, Dr. Asoka de Zoysa Gunawardena J whose death anniversary fell on November 26.
He was a renowned academic, a versatile professional and above all a man with a human touch.
To his children he was a father who taught how to face many challenges of life and that is why both his daughter and son have been able to live up to his expectations and are doing well in life.
To his mother and father he was a great caring son. To all his close relations he was a source of inspiration. To all Sri Lankans he was a true achiever who had been elected to serve as judge to represent Sri Lanka at the International Criminal Tribunal for Ruwanda (ICTR) as well as the Joint Appeal Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) where former President Slobodan Milosevic stood trial.
Having enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court in 1967 he joined the Attorney General's Department in 1972. He was promoted as a Senior State Counsel and later as Deputy Solicitor General in 1988.
He was appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1988 and later served as its President. I still remember how sad we felt as close relations when his appointment to the Supreme Court was delayed. However my uncle very soon not only rose to become a Supreme Court Judge but went further bringing fame to his motherland.
As he very correctly said when he was elevated to the highest court of this country the guiding light of his life was his father Richmond De Zoysa Gunawardena JPUM, a renowned legal practitioner of his times.
Justice Gunawardena always dispensed justice in accordance with his conscience, as expected by his father.
Justice Gunawardena had his primary education at Revatha Vidyalaya, Balapitiya a school which had produced many eminent personalities.
Later he had a brilliant academic career at S.Thomas' College Mount Lavinia and Sri Lanka Law College where he became first in order of merit in a batch which consisted of several renowned legal personalities of this country. His academic achievements culminated in his doctorate in International Investment Law from the University of Sydney in 1983.
My uncle was devoted to his religion and was engaged in many meritorious activities throughout his life and certainly had reached the first stage of deliverance from Sansara as a Buddhist.
Gunawardena J was a classic example for the saying where there is a will there is a way. In his private life he was very humble no matter to what great heights he had reached in the official capacity.
I was fortunate to have passed out as a young attorney and law graduate while he was alive and to take my oath wearing the cloak that he gifted. He advised me to continue my studies and enhance my knowledge in law.
Dear uncle I have done that and I am proud to say that I have honoured you by passing the Master of Laws degree, though you are no longer with us to share that joy as was done in the past.
We will fondly remember you forever and follow your footsteps to serve our motherland.
Deshani Jayatilaka
