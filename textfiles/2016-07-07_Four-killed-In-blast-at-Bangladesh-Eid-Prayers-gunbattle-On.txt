Four killed In blast at Bangladesh Eid Prayers, gunbattle On


	

Four persons including a policeman were killed and seven were wounded on Thursday after a bomb blast and gun-battle near a mass Eid prayer gathering in Bangladesh's Kishoreganj district.

The attack - the first on Muslims during Eid in Bangladesh - took place 140 km from capital Dhaka, where seven terrorists attacked a popular cafe last Friday, killing 22 people.

A group of attackers reportedly threw homemade bombs at a police team at a school near a prayer ground where at least 200,000 people were gathered. Firing is still on between security forces and the attackers.

Some reports said the attack was targeted at a the imam or chief cleric of Kishoreganj, who is known for his liberal views. He had reportedly started a signature campaign to condemn terrorism in the name of Islam.

After the Dhaka cafe terror last weekend, the Islamic State terror group had issued a chilling video threatening more attacks. "What you witnessed in Bangladesh was a glimpse. This will repeat, repeat and repeat until you lose and we win and the sharia is established throughout the world," said a man identified as Bangladeshi fighter Abu Issa al-Bengali, in the video.
