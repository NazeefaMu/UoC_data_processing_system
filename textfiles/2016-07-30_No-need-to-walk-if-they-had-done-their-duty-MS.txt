If the former leaders had performed their duties and governed properly, there would not be a need for them to undertake long marches for political purposes, hurting their feet, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.

The President said so at a ceremony held at the auditorium of Mawanella Provincial Council to distribute computers to fifty Pirivenas and Churches in the Kegalle District.

“Though some people, greedy for power, walk through roads aimlessly, the Government is committed to build the country by working with consciousness and discipline,” the President said.

“Today, the country is suffering from a huge debt burden. The new Government has to face the challenge of an unbearable burden of debts, created by the former government,” he said.

“After being in office, I don’t want to take marathon walks seeking power again and I will execute my duties properly during the tenure of my office,” he said.

Ministers Kabir Hashim, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Rauff Hakeem, State Minister Champika Premadasa, former Minister Athauda Seneviratne and many others participated.
