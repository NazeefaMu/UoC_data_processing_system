President Maithripala Sirisena today said if the government banned all liquor licences and cigarettes putting an end to liquor sale and cigarettes, those who consume them could even topple the government.
“From the bottom of my heart, I’m ready to stop the selling of liquor and cigarettes. But the power of the people who consume liquor is extensive. If we are to stop it, we have to get ready for a change of government which means those who consume liquor can topple a government,” he said.
