Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake should resign without waiting for the No-Confidence Motion which would be brought against him for allegedly indulging the funds obtained from the Central Bank (CB) Bond Scam, the Joint Opposition said today.

JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said they were currently collecting documents as evidence to include in the No-Confidante motion.

“A previous No-Confidence motion has already been included in the Parliament agenda against the Minister for presenting false details to Parliament through the Budget as the Finance Minister.

“We hope to put forward the new No-Faith Motion during the next Parliament session for obtaining signatures,” he told a news briefing. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)
