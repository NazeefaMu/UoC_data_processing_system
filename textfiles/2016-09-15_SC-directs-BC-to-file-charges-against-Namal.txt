Over ruling the preliminary objection raised on the earlier occasion by the respondents, the Supreme Court today directed the Bribery Commission to file charge sheet on or before October 3 in court against former President's son and MP Namal Rajapaksa for disregarding Bribery Commission’s orders.

The action had been filed earlier by the Commissions' Director General under the 'Contempt of Commission’ provision.

Earlier In the complaint, the complainant, Director General of the Bribery Commission, Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe had mentioned the respondent as Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.

The Bribery Commission in the complaint alleged that the respondent was required to provide an affidavit on January 20, 2016 to the commission on a matter pertaining to a bribery inquiry, by sending a notice last December 14, 2015 by the Commission.

On January 19, 2016 the respondent requested further time until March 15 to provide the affidavit. The Commission said Mr. Rajapaksa however had failed to submit the affidavit on March 15.(Shehan Chamika Silva)
