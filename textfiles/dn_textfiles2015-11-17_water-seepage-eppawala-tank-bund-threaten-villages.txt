Water seepage from Eppawala tank bund threaten villages

A possible disaster situation has arisen following a seepage of water from the Eppawala tank bund which was under reconstruction and reinforcement, residents in the area said.
They said Mahaweli Development Authority officials reinforced the part of the bund which breached with sandbags as a temporary measure to preserve the water to ensure drinking water facilities to the people.
Now with the continuing rainfall experienced in the area and incessant water intake, the sand bags may give way to heavy water pressure.
When the tank bund breached on November 3, the Agriculture Minister promised to repair the bund and entrusted the work to the Civil Defence Force and Lanka Phosphate Ltd.
Accordingly, 100 members of the Civil Defence Force launched reconstruction work on the bund using Lanka Phosphate Ltd machinery under the supervision of the Mahaweli officials.
