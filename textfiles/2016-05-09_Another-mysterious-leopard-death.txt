Another leopard was found dead on Sunday at the Albion Estate in Agarapathana, the Wild Life Department said today.

Wildlife Director General Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya said the leopard was suspected to be poisoned.

“Officers have been deployed to investigate the area and we will conduct a post mortem to determine the cause of death,” he said.

At least 10 leopards were found dead inside tea estates in Hatton, Watawala, Agarapathana and Norwood areas during the last five months.

It was suspected that food left out to eat was poisoned as the leopards did not have any external injuries. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Ranjith Rajapaksa)
