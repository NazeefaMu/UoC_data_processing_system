While stating that the 16-member SLFP group will fully back the JO protest, former Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said if the government tries to sabotage the JO protest, the whole public sector will go on strike.

Addressing a news briefing, he said the public sector was at loggerheads with the Government due to its mismanagement in terms of economy.

Not only the public sector, the professionals, doctors and artists also are supporting this protest, the MP said.

Meanwhile, MP Dilan Perera added that they would use the JO protest as a helping tool to take the remaining Government supporting SLFP members out of the Government.

“Our ambition is to unite the SLFP as per the wish of President Maithripala Sirisena,” the MP said.

MP Susil Premajayantha claimed that a financial crisis was imminent because of the inefficiency of this Government. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
