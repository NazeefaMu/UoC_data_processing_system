A majority of those who were appointed to the Cabinet are corrupt, UPFA MP Shehan Semasinghe said yesterday.

Addressing a news briefing at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) head office at Battaramulla, he said the present Cabinet contained several wrongdoers who had a series of allegations levelled against them.“We can list the wrongs committed by these unscrupulous individuals in the Cabinet,” he added.

“What is pathetic here is that the President had approved the list of MPs that were sent to him for Cabinet appointments despite having first hand knowledged that most of them were corrupt,” Semasinghe said.

“They came in promising to do away with corruption, but how can the corruption be eliminated by those who are corrupt themselves?” Semasinghe inquired. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
