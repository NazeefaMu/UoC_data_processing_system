The All Ceylon Port General Workers’ Union has decided to stop work on Friday against the government's move to lease 70 per cent of the Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese firm, the union's, chief secretary Chandrasiri Mahagamage said yesterday.

"We have organized a protest today against the government’s decision. We will do our best to fight this treasonable act," he said.

Mr. Mahagamage said the Bill on leasing 70 per cent of the Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese firm was presented to Parliament yesterday and the debate was to be held on Friday and agreement to be signed on Saturday.

"I entreat the parliamentarians to raise their voice against the decision that is to be taken tomorrow in Parliament and come out with productive alternatives, without selling public resources to foreign countries," he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
