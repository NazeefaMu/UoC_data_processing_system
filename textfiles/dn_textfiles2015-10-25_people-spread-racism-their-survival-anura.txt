People spread racism for their survival - Anura

JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday that various people spread racism for their political survival in the past and the end result was that the country had to suffer from a 30-year long war.
We still do not know the number of people dead and the exact cost spent on the war. Finally, the innocent people had to pay the price, but not by those who spread racism.
Participating in the debate on the Geneva based UNHRC report, MP Dissanayake said it was compulsory to promote harmony among all communities if the country wished to move forward and to do so, we have to accept the fact that they too have equal rights. A solution to the ethnic problem may be impossible unless the fundamental needs of the people in the North and East are fulfilled.
TNA hoped that India would solves this problem. But it did not happen. They commenced a large number of projects in the North and East such as renovation of the Northern Railway track, but not a single job was given to the youth in those regions.
They have also exploited the fish of our innocent fishermen in the North and East. Not only India, but also many Western Nations, including the US had not genuinely helped us to solve our problems. This is only a part of their political agenda. Today Jaffna has turned into a den of India's “RAW” spy service. They attempt to create political instability in Jaffna. We should put a stop to it.
It is a right of every citizen to know what exactly happened during the post conflict period. If we do not expose them, the rulers would continue to repeat such mistakes. We wish to to know what really happened to those who had been abducted during the time of the war. Lalith and Kugan were abducted. We still do not known what had happened to them.
