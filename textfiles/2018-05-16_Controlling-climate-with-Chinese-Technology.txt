Sri Lanka is looking for the possibility of controlling droughts and floods through controlling clouds using Chinese Technology, it was revealed yesterday.

This was revealed at the signing of agreement for projects under the World Bank aided Agriculture Sector Modernization programme in Colombo last evening.

The report on a study carried out by the experts attached to Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences was handed over to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by Minister of Primary Industries and Social Welfare Daya Gamage after signing of agreements last evening.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe stressed the need for modernizing Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector in order to make it a stable industry. “Many countries such as USA and East Asian nations have modernized the agriculture industry though it had not been done in South Asia. Modernization of rural agriculture is essential as such a growth will help improve the rural economy. Rural economy development is essential for the country’s economic stability,” the Prime Minister said.

Minister Daya Gamage said agriculture sector in Sri Lanka could contribute to country’s overall economic growth to a great extent if it is able to stop droughts and floods just like it is done in China. He said the experts from Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences had already carried out a study on clouds above Sri Lanka and findings will be made known soon.

“Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector could be made more vibrant and diversified if it is modernized and disasters such as droughts and floods are avoided. “ Sri Lanka could earn more export revenue from crops such as cinnamon and ginger than tea if such new industries are developed,” the Minister said.
