KABUL AFP March2, 2018-A car bomb detonated near a passing Australian embassy convoy in eastern Kabul Friday, an embassy statement said, killing at least one child and wounding several people just days after Afghanistan unveiled plans for Taliban peace talks.   


Extensive damage to the facades of nearby houses could be seen with debris scattered on pavements as witnesses reported a 
strong explosion.   


Security forces rushed to the scene as passers-by helped move the wounded, with witnesses complaining to AFP that ambulances took around half an hour to arrive.   


The Australian embassy said on its website that the blast was “near Australian Embassy vehicles while they were travelling in Kabul”, adding that all staff were safe and extending its condolences to the victims of the attack. A security source confirmed the embassy’s account to AFP.   
No group has claimed the attack, which is the latest to hit Kabul.
