	Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) Secretary Lacille De Silva said its officials visited ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa's residence to obtain evidence over a matter concerning the ITN TV station.
	He said the PRECIFIC did not want to create any issue and wanted to complete the work entrusted to them quickly.
	Mr. De Silva said he did not see anything wrong to visit Mr. Rajapaksa's residence because he was a former head of state.
	“This is the first time where a head of the state was summoned to the PRECIFAIC. We have acted in a flexible and reasonable manner on this matter,” he said.
	Mr. De Silva responded to allegations that ex-president Rajapaksa had been treated in a special manner by visiting his residence by saying that only wanted to complete the inquiry without creating any issues.
	He said he had sought the PRECIFAC permission to fix the case with regard to the ITN issue for a public hearing immediately as evidence was recorded from most of those responsible for what had happened.
	Statements were recorded from former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and several other people including former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, Dallas Alahapperuma, former presidential secretary Lalith Weeratunga, former ITN chairman Anura Siriwardena and former Treasury Secretary P.B. Jayasundera.(Ajith Siriwardana)
