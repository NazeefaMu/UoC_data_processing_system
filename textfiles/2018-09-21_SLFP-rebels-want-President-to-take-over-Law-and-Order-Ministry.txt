SLFP rebels want President to take over Law and Order Ministry


	

Three SLFP rebel group frontliners, MPs S.B. Dissanayaka, Dilan Perera and Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to take over the Law and Order Ministry immediately under his wings and remove IGP Pujith Jayasundara from his post.

They alleged that there was a real threat to the lives of President Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa as exposed by Police informer Namal Kumara and added they believed that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was behind the conspiracy.

They said that the UNP and the 23 SLFP members in the government have taken the conspiracy lightly and not uttered a word on the seriousness of the attempt on the lives of the two despite the fact that it posed a threat to the national security and democratic rule of the country.

‘The UNP says that there was a conspiracy hatched by DIG Nalaka Silva to assassinate President Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa as exposed by Namal. This is a serious matter but it seems both the UNP and the SLFPers in the government are not concerned at all. Only Deputy Minister Sriyanai Wijewickrama talked about the seriousness of the attempt on the lives of President Sirisena and Rajapaksa and demanded a thorough investigation,” Mr. Perera said.
