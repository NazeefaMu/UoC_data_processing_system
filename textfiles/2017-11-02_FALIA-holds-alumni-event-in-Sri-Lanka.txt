The Foundation for the Advancement of Life & Insurance Around the world (FALIA) Japan, recently hosted the alumni get together in Sri Lanka, at which the title of ‘Grandmaster’ was conferred on Ceylinco Life’s Managing Director R. Renganathan.


The FALIA get-together was attended by past attendees of FALIA seminars, three dignitaries from Japan, Messrs Toru Nagashima, Managing Director FALIA, Takashi Matsumoto, a former President of FALIA and President of the Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations and Yoshitaka Masai, Director of FALIA, and Indrani Sugathadasa, Chairperson of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL).


The life time honorific of Grandmaster recognises three decades of leadership in the development and growth of the life insurance industry in Sri Lanka during which Renganathan set up and steered Ceylinco Life, taking the company to market leadership in 2004, a position it has retained to date.
“Over the past 47 years, FALIA has contributed very significantly to the development of life insurance in Asia,” Renganathan said. “It has helped build the knowledge base of the industry through seminars and training. Ceylinco Life has implemented many learnings from these seminars and I am honoured to be appointed Grandmaster.”


As the first and only FALIA Grandmaster in Sri Lanka, Renganathan will liaise with FALIA Japan and the local insurance industry and promote the principles and activities of the Foundation.


A Fellow of CA Sri Lanka and a Fellow of the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka, Renganathan has functioned as Managing Director/CEO of Ceylinco Life since the company’s inception in January 1988.


FALIA was established in March 1970, byDai-ichi Life to further promote the mission of contributing to the development of Asia’s insurance industry and in doing so to reciprocate some of the generosity received from Europe and the United States after World War II. In April 2012, FALIA was officially certified as a public interest incorporated foundation.
