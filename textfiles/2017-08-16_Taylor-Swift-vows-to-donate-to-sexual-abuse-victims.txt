DAILY MAIL, 15 August, 2017  - An eight-member jury has sided with Taylor Swift in her counter suit against a fired radio DJ in Denver who is now forced to pay the singer a symbolic $1 after groping her four years ago.   


The pop singer accused former radio host David Mueller of groping her during a meet-and-greet photo session in June 2013 at the Pepsi Center.   After nearly four hours of deliberating, the jury, comprised of six women and two men, ruled in favor of Swift.   


Mueller will be required to pay $1 in damages to the 27-year-old songstress.   


The verdict came after the 27-year-old singer cried in court on Monday as Mueller’s lawyer claimed in his closing argument that a photo proved the former DJ wouldn’t have been able to put his hand under her skirt.
