Court refuses to issue arrest warrant on Udayanga


	

The Colombo Fort Magistrate today refused to issue a warrant, through Interpol, for the arrest of a one-time Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga and directed that summons be forwarded through the Foreign Ministry to his address in Ukraine.

Earlier, he was noticed to provide statements on an investigation being carried out by the FCID.

On July 15, the FCID requested Court to issue a warrant for his arrest as he had absented himself from Court on charges of having caused a financial loss of US$14 million to the Government in connection with the purchase of four Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft in 2006.

The Magistrate said that though the prosecution had taken appropriate steps to serve summons to Mr. Weeratunga, the police had been unable to hand it over to him. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
