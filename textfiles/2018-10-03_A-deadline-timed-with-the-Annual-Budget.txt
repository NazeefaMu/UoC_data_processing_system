The Green party burly one sulking over the loss of the prestigious portfolio, made calculated moves one after another from time to time to make a comeback to the former glory without success.

 


Undeterred, never lacking the ‘never say die’ spirit, the burly one has over the time won the loyalty of a group of backbenchers and is now set to deal a fatal blow to Yahapalanaya itself, they say.


Issuing an ultimatum to those who matter, he has given time till the first week of next December to decide to ‘do or die’.


The threat he has held out, they say, is closely connected to a big event in the Yahapalanaya calendar: the unveiling of the decisive annual Budget for 2019.
