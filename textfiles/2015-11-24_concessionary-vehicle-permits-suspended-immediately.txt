Finance Ministry announced that vehicle permits under the concessionary terms will be suspended immediately, effectively from November 21, 2015, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement today.
 
Those who have permits and have not yet opened letters of credit for importation of vehicles and those permit holders who intend to purchase locally assembled vehicles, should enter into agreement before the December 31 2015.
The concessionary terms for issuing vehicle permits has become highly politicized and have been misused, resulting in the government incurring an annual loss of Rs. 40 billion, as stated by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake during his budget speech.
