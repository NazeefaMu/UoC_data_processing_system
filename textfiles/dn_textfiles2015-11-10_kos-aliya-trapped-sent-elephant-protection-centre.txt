'Kos Aliya' trapped, sent to Elephant Protection Centre

The notorious wild elephant nicknamed 'Kos Aliya' which terrorised residents in Belagamwewa and its environs for some time, was trapped by wildlife officials and taken to the Elephant Protection Centre at Horowpathana on November 8 after a trying operation.
The 45-year-old nine foot pachyderm which had several gun shot wounds had harassed residents including schoolchildren for several months.
It had obstructed vehicular traffic on the Girandurukotte - Dambulla Road many a time and destroyed crops in the area.
