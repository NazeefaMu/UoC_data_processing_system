S. Africa to discuss Truth and Reconciliation Commission experience with Lanka

While there are deliberations taking place between the governments of Sri Lanka and South Africa to share the latter's experience in working for national reconciliation in the country, the Foreign Affairs Ministry is on the path to deepening their understanding of the range of the South African-style Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Foreign Affairs Ministry sources said yesterday .
Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said they have had many deliberations, consultations and programmes with the South African government for sharing their experience in working out an effective truth and reconciliation mechanism in Sri Lanka.
Asked if a Sri Lankan delegation is set to leave for South Africa to further study the latter's Truth and Reconciliation process, Colonne said, " Since the end of the Geneva sessions, there has not been any such delegation approved by the ministry for the purpose of conducting deliberations with regard to the subject."
Colonne said, "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet approved any delegation to leave for South Africa."
"If there was such decision, it had to be taken by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera," she said.
"There was no decision taken yet with regard to a visit to South Africa. The dates have not been finalized yet," she said.
"However," she said, " there will be deliberations with the government of South Africa for sharing their experience in the aspect of reconciliation in the future as it stands to offer invaluable guidance."
Meanwhile, measures are being planned to restructure the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
Colonne said, "the plans are being discussed, but nothing has been finalized."
