“There is only a pro LTTE mindset among the people in the area and that will be got rid of sooner or later. It will not be easy but we will do it. We will not allow the LTTE come back again,” the Deputy Minister added

“Intelligence units are on alert. Terrorism prevention units are active in the North,” he also said.
