Four suspects including Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second son Yoshitha Rajapaksa, who were remanded over alleged financial irregularities at the CSN, had declined the food provided by the Welikada Prison, Prisons Spokesman Thushara Upuldeniya said.

He said that permission was given for Yoshitha and four others to get all three meals from their home from yesterday morning.

“Declining food provided by the Prisons Department and bringing them from outside is a privilege for any prisoner. As such, the approval was given to bring food from outside for Yoshitha and four others since yesterday morning,” he said.

However, he said first they had agreed to consume food provided by the Prison on the first day and later they had declined the food. (Piyumi Fonseka)
