Season to be silly and ‘Santa- mentally’ merry

 
It is the season to be silly and ‘Santa-mentally’ merry. And there isn’t any reason why we all must be permitted to display a bit of asinine over-indulgence. Yes Christmas and the New Year may have bypassed us but the jolly seasonal spirit lingers on.
Those of us who celebrated both major events would have probably been knee-deep in wrapping paper. The best of all gifts around any Christmas tree is the presence of a happy family all wrapped up in one another. Very unlike those folks who get all wrapped up in themselves, who sure do make insignificant packages.
Besides, on the subject of wrapping you have got to hand it to the ladies. Anyone who believes that men are the equal of women has never seen a man trying to wrap a seasonal present. Christmas, I say is an occasion that divides itself in two parts. The one is the divine part and other, the wine part. However, the real spirit and fun solely depends on what you fancy more.
As for me it seemed all rather conducive for a bit of annual meditative thinking. I was contemplating philosophically about the four stages of man during the holiday season. My truth-seeking mission and sedate mind conjured it all up with brilliant perception, even if I say so myself. There are of course some clauses attached to my theory of the successive ages of mankind which logically goes like this: (1) You believe in Santa Claus. (2) You don’t believe in Santa Claus. (3) You look like Santa Claus. (4). You are Santa Claus.
Even so it seems as if I have had a hard day at the office every time the holiday season comes round. I do all the durable work and start giving with all the altruism I can muster. But for what earthly reason may I ask?
Because the mythical fat slob with the ridiculous hot red suit, the red extended beanie -style hat, with pom -poms gets all the credit. The holiday season is a time of rich meals and decadent treats, and the continuous seasonal music that assails you wherever you go. And every Christmas without fail my friend Boyd sings this twisted parody of “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year’ to the hilarious ‘It’s the Most Fattening Time of the Year’.
People can be so unfair at times even during the season of good cheer. The cops especially have no sense of fair play or humour either. If you are singing Christmas songs on your neighbour’s lawn at night with your church group, it’s called ‘carol singing.’ But if you’re doing it alone on the street wearing a Santa outfit, or no outfit at all, it’s called ‘drunk and disorderly’ or ‘indecent exposure’.
And they have the temerity to say that Santa has gone nuts. And that he is displaying naked aggression.
That he’s hallucinating. They call it the ‘Santa Insanity Clause’. So they frog-march you to the cop-shop while you switch to ‘baila’ with the popular local hit ‘Ralahamy Mung polisiyay, Ralahama Mung’. Ok I will admit that the cops do throw a blanket or a rain-cape around you when you are nabbed in an unclothed state in public.
But they don’t actually do so through compassion or to keep you warm from the cold snap of the Christmas breezes either. I suspect they do it because they don’t want to suffer an inferiority complex for the rest of the season.
Personally speaking, I have found that the holiday season is a time when everybody I know wants his past forgotten and his present remembered. Every time during the season to be silly, a good many usually sedate people are transformed into supreme swingers whose excesses transcend a lifestyle wilder than those enjoyed by decadent rock stars all set for a raucous roll.
For instance for the last 40-years on the day before Christmas my friend Joy wakes up with a monumental hangover and annoys his buxom wife Eve with the exasperating greeting: “It’s Christmas..... Eve!” And the same Joy at the Christmas lunch never fails to talk turkey. He makes this public plea to Father Christmas: “Dear Santa, please can I have a really fat bank balance and a slim woman. Please don’t mix these two up just like you did last Christmas.”
In Christmas past, during my teenage years, I recollect that a cheeky girl wrote on a balloon, “Will you propose to me?” I immediately popped the balloon and question with a single flourish of my lighted cigarette. Bang! Sorted!
Christmas makes me happy no matter what time of year it comes around. Now that is the true spirit of Christmas. But on Christmas Eve I had presents all beautifully gift-wrapped, even for people I need to get even with this season. Last year I gave one to my exasperating bald-headed colleague Eustace. It was a comb. He opened his gift and didn’t even flinch. All he said was: “Thanks! I’ll never part with it!”
And there was my bachelor friend Paulie who stood at the main entrance and asked a woman doctor he has fancied for several years: “What would it take to make you kiss me under the mistletoe?” She brushed past him adroitly with the cutting scalpel-like answer: “An anaesthetic!”
In my estimation there is nothing as mean as giving a little child something useful for Christmas. I mean who needs educational toys unless they are fun to boot. Gifts such as clothing are not considered gifts, they are basic parental obligations.
Now you might ask what the Dickens I’m talking about. Let me enlighten you that it’s about those modern day Scrooges, the selfish tightwad misers in our society. Our kids have a notoriously famous granduncle named Kulasinghe.
“They have nicknamed him ‘Kunu-singhe’ and with good reason. He once bought them a set of batteries for Christmas with a note on it explaining: “Toys not included!”
Remember, if Christmas isn’t found in your heart, you won’t find it under a tree. To all you readers out there let’s get a tad nonsensical! I’m still under the mistletoe wearing a reindeer Rudolf head-dress. So kiss me on the flaming nose! A Merry extended Christmas and New Year everybody!
