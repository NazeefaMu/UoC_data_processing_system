Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that he was against the law that only allows those above 35 years to drive a three wheeler

“I asked for this to be reduced to 25. We have to give the freedom for a person to do the job of his choice” he said at an event in Matara.

Earlier, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said his ministry had decided to impose a minimum age limit of 35 on three-wheeler drivers when issuing driving licenses for passenger transport.
