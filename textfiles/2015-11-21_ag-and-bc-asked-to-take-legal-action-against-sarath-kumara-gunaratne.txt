The PRECIFAC has requested the Bribery Commission (BC) and the Attorney General’s Department (AG) to take legal action against former Deputy Minister of Fisheries Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and two others with regard to misusing of Fisheries Corporation funds, an official of the commission said.
A senior official of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) told Daily Mirror that the commission had received a complaint against Mr. Gunaratne with regard to misusing of Fisheries Corporation funds.
 Mr. Gunaratne was earlier summoned by the Commission on a complaint that he had obtained funds from the Fisheries Corporation for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s election campaign during the last presidential election.(Ajith Siriwardana)
