Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Northern, North-Central, Eastern and Uva Provinces and at several places elsewhere after 2.00 p.m today, because the low pressure area in the South-East Bay of Bengal is located some 800 km away from the country, the Meteorology Department said.

Met Department Director General K.H.M.S. Premalal said it was likely to develop into a depression by tomorrow but would not create a large impact on the land area.

Fairly heavy showers of about 75mm are being expected in the Eastern, Northern, North-central and Uva provinces while gusty winds up to 50 kmph are expected in the Northern, Eastern, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

The Met. Department said there could be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers and the people are requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damage caused by lightning.

Meanwhile, it said the sea areas 200 km off the North-Eastern, Eastern and South-Eastern coasts, and in Central Bay of Bengal could be very rough because the wind speeds were likely to increase up to 100 kmph.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the sea areas off the coast extending from Potuvil to Kankesanturai via Trincomalee.

Winds will be north-easterly to northerly in direction in the sea area around the island with wind speeds of up to 40 kmph.

The shallow sea area off the coast extending from Potuvil to Kankesanturai via Trincomalee and Colombo to Matara via Galle and Hambantota could be temporarily rough, as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 kmph.

Temporarily strong winds (up to 80 kmph) and the seas are likely to be rough during the thundershowers.

The warning issued to the naval and fishing communities were further extended.

The low pressure area which is to be turned into a depression, would later turn into a deep depression, and is believed to be entering India by Friday. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
