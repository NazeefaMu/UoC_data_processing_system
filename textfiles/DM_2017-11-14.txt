Age-old excuse riled him
	
This purohita once held high office. He had the other day tried to phone a colleague in the top team for an urgent matter and had abused in choice Sinhala the colleagues aide when the latter had given the stock reply: Sir is at a conference! every time he called.

An exasperated purohita had demanded: Umbalage amathiya sakachchakarana ekamada karanne, yako and proceeded to harangue him with a stream of filth.
The colleague who wanted to make amends had rung up the purohita soon afterwards, but the purohita still simmering with anger had scolded him too and hung up saying: I dont want any help from you!

Amending Acts to suit foreign companies: JVP
	
Although the government is hoping to liberalise the economy by amending various Acts and Ordinances as proposed in the Budget, amending of these acts will result in the country being caught up in a debt trap, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
MP Bimal Rathnayake said these Acts and Ordinance were archaic and the government was attempting to amend them according to the needs of foreign multinational companies.
He said in the recent past, the countrys exports had been gradually reduced while imports doubled, but successive governments still followed the failed economic methods to strengthen the economy. The MP said one tenth of the entire cost of imports was spent on peoples food and it would therefore have been advantageous if the government focussed on reviving the local agricultural and industrial sector.
He accused the government of altering or abolishing outdated Acts to permit the sale of the country's resources to foreign companies and that it was amending the Shop and Office Employees Act of 1954 by violating employees rights to overtime after an 8-hour shift.
By amending the Act the government is attempting to decrease the age limit for child labour from 18 to 16 or 14. Those things cannot be permitted and the JVP wont allow it to happen, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Appointment as MP delayed due to interference in judiciary: Piyasena Gamage
	
MP Piyasena Gamage said today that the Court verdict confirming his appointment as an MP was delayed, because some people attempted to interfere with the judiciary.
"There are some who try to influence the judiciary, though the government has a whole does not do so. A case such as mine would have been resolved within a short period, but in Sri Lanka, it is a time consuming affair. The verdict on my case would have been given much earlier if not for the influence by some," he said.
Speaking during the budget debate the MP said the funds allocated for the judiciary should be used to change their mindset and stressed the need to focus on human resources development and make Sri Lankan youth employable. The opposition should not criticize the Budget for the sake of criticizing but should support the government to resolve important issues," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Charity begins at home
	
This is a well-known case of nepotism in the public sector. Tenders worth billions for construction projects are often called. Many apply. But every tender is awarded at the end of the day to a relative of a very high political authority!
The relative has his own heavy vehicles, machinery and building materials to complete the jobs he undertakes in double quick time. But his constructions woefully lacking in quality and standards are not normally long lasting. They crack up or collapse. Complaints are being made to the authorities concerned. But no high-up would dare investigate for fear of reprisals! 
The relative rolling on money happily carries on!

Children left behind as death faces square and sure when family members reach 33


A curse
In this line of haunted family men and women die when they reach 32 and 33, it seems.
After the deaths of their husbands in 2016, two widows, eerily aged 32 and 33 respectively are living in fear, with their six children. If the death strikes them as well, altogether six children would become destitute.
But it looks like the man with the scythe would not go away from the doorstep.
The story of a family, whose members all die between the ages of 30 to 33 for various reasons is now holding the Hewanatenna village in Panliyadda Melsiripura petrified.
The villagers or the family members do not know, why their family members die exactly when they reach 32 and 33. Somehow they die. Illness or accidents, death squarely stares at their faces as they reach that age.
In the latest reported incident the sudden deaths of two members belonging to two generations of the same family at the ages of 30 and 33, had pushed the children and the grandchildren into destitution.
Villagers only started noticing the pattern with the recent deaths of a husband and wife in a motor vehicle accident, which left and three small children destitute.
The story is traced to two sisters in this village who had three children.
When the two sisters reached the ages of 32 and 33 respectively they died of an unidentified sickness, when their children were very young.
It is also noted that the husbands of these two sisters had also died at the ages of 32 and 33.
At the time of deaths of the parents of both families, their children were of ages 10, 08, and 07.
The orphans were later adopted by relatives.

His sister, while on her way with her husband to bring back the children from school met with an accident and succumbed to injuries leaving their three children orphans.
The husband of the daughter of another sister died at the age of 33 from an unidentified sickness. She is now left with three children to look after.
A group of journalists recently visited the house where the deaths of both parents were reported and were terribly moved with the plight of the family clustered inside a dilapidated small house belonging to an elderly relative.
D.M. Dissanayake Bandara (34) and his wife H.A.S.A. Nilanika Gayani (32) died in a motor vehicle accident on Friday, October 13.
Their three children, ten-year-old Nilanka Deshapriya, seven-year-old Devmi Samalka and two-and-half year-old Nethuli Shania are now orphans.
The elderly relative stated that if there was a house where she could live with the children it would help her to bring them up.
These children were seen sobbing while displaying the photos of their parents.
Just across this house is the daub and wattle house of the uncle of these children who too died in an accident.
This family has also become destitute.
Sanjeewa Prasanna Kumara (33) died in an accident on August 4, 2016. His wife Ira Kumari (32) and three daughters Sakuni Chethana (14) Lihini Vihanga (7) and Mihindi Kumari (2 ) are now faced with severe difficulties without a proper shelter and support.

An elder brother and an elder sister of theirs lend a helping hand to their well being.
The remaining family members are living in fear that the fate that struck some of them would befall them too sooner or later.
With severe economic setbacks having no regular income these families are at the mercy of their relatives or the villagers.
Samanthika Kumari, a relative lamented at the plight of the widows and the children.
They live in constant fear that they may also become victims of the mysterious death that has befallen their husbands.
From her expressions, it is very clear that these families need assistance urgently.
They have no proper place to live and always are at the mercy of someone, who would provide them with food.
She urged for assistance in this regard, at least a place to stay.

Fortunaglobal introduces Affluence Soft Token to enhance digital security for banking
	
Colombo-based Fortunaglobal (Pvt.) Ltd, a leader in omni-channel banking software solutions for Sri Lankas Fintech sector has started rolling out its software token solution to local banks.
Offering up a higher level of security that is time based, this solution is a better option when compared to the more expensive hardware tokens.
Part of Fortunaglobals Affluence omni-channel banking and financial services platform, which is widely recognized as being the benchmark for Sri Lankas Fintech sector, the Affluence Soft Token is a software-based security token that generates an One Time Password (OTP).
For banks and financial institutions that are looking to introduce additional layers of security, especially for overseas clients who significantly benefit from a short-lived OTP via SMS, this solution offers a great relief from a major pain point. Further, easy integration, via standard APIs, with any third party solution is an added advantage. Importantly, the solution works seamlessly with any banks existing Internet Banking or Mobile Banking solution.
A replacement for hardware tokens, this solution provides a distinct OTP for each activity, from a shared secret key that is unique to the mobile application installed on ones smart device. Affluence Soft Tokens add even greater levels of security to Affluence-based banking transactions since, even if an users traditional password is stolen or compromised, attackers cannot gain access without the OTP, which changes after a set period of time.
The benefits of the Affluence Soft Token also include its flexibility and ease of use, while also being very cost effective in comparison to the more expensive hardware tokens. An OTP can also be generated offline, without the requirement of any sort of network coverage.
Further, the Affluence Soft Token also offers numerous other features, from secure transactions with two factor authentications, to allowing end-users to securely generate the OTP from their desired mobile device, as well as giving them the option to revoke and re-activate Soft Tokens using the same simple activation process. It even provides enhanced compatibility with a wide range of mobile devices.
Commenting on the launch, Fortunaglobal CEO Suren Kohombange said: Not only is our Affluence Soft Token solution cost effective compared to more expensive hardware tokens, it also offers greater security. At the same time, it continues to be flexible and simple to use. All the hallmarks of a revolutionary product that can help banks and financial service companies immeasurably.
Fortunaglobals Affluence suite of B2B and B2C digital banking solutions currently provides next generation services via an omni-channel platform that fast tracks and evolves the delivery of banking and financial services, while at the same time simplifying them for banking staff and
end-consumers.

Grand Hyatt case EPF funds misused in hotel project
	
Forensic audit report had highlighted the alleged fraudulent methodology followed when acquiring three properties; Ranmuthu Hotels Ltd, No: 112, Galle Road, J.C. Ramanayake of 108, Galle Road and Ceylinco Insurance PLC of 134, Galle Road for the expansion of Grand Hyatt Regency in 2013.

Ranmuthu Hotels
According to the report, 62.77 perches has been acquired fromRanmuthu Hotels and although the Government Chief Valuer in his report dated June 13, 2013 had valued the land at Rs. 303.2 million and the building therein for Rs. 196.8 million where the total reaches Rs. 500 million, once again the property had been valued on July 30, 2013. In the second valuation report, the land value had risen to Rs. 483.2 million and the building therein remained at the same value with the total valuation being Rs. 680 million. However, the property had been purchased for Rs. 689.071 million without giving any reasons

Ceylon Insuarance PLC
Sino Lanka had acquired 20.1 perches from Ceylon Insurance PLC and the first valuation had been carried out on January 9, 2013 with the valuation for the land being Rs. 100 million and the valuation for the building being Rs. 91.5 million. The total valuation was Rs. 191.5 million. Again on October 22, 2013, the second valuation had been carried out and the value for the land and building value was stated as Rs.252 million. During the third valuation, the land valuation had increased up to Rs.168.5 million and the value of the building therein was the same as the first valuation coming into a total of Rs.260 million. However the final payment had been made to the tune of Rs.270 million

J.C. Ramanayake property
The J.C. Ramanayake property was 15 perches in extent and only one valuation had been carried out on August 23, 2013. The valuation for the land was Rs.105 million while the land therein had been valued for Rs.15 million with the total being Rs.120 million. However, Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa had paid Rs. 130 million for the property
	The report states how the procurement of steel for the Grand Hyatt project had been carried out violating Government procurement guidelines. The tender had been awarded to the second lowest bidder which was a loss of Rs.16.426 million to the state
It has now surfaced how Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Chief of Staff together with two others were allegedly involved in a misappropriation connected with tax payers hard earned money, regarding which the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) has filed a case (B 788/ 15) in the Colombo Magistrate Court under the Public Property Act No:
12 of 1982.
According to the two B reports filed before the Colombo Magistrate Court, Gamini Sedera Senerath, Piyadasa Kudabalage and H.K.D.W.M. Neil Bandara Hapuhinna are suspected for transferring a staggering Rs.4 billion to Helanco Hotels and Spa (Pvt) Ltd fraudulently in 2014 from Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, a fully state-owned enterprise, without Board approval.
Canwill Holdings was registered with the Registrar of Companies on December 22, 2011 while Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt) Ltd made its registration with the Registrar of Companies the same day as a subsidiary of Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt) Ltd was incorporated to revive the defunct Grand Hyatt projectin Colombo 3.
Helanco Hotels and Spa is a private company registered under PV 83263 with the Registrar of Companies on December 21, 2011. This company had been incorporated to construct a five star luxury hotel project in Hambantota.

Grand Hyatt Project
In order to review the stalled Grand Hyatt project of the Ceylinco Leisure Properties Limited, a Cabinet Memorandum (No: MOFE/ST/CM/2012) dated March 12, 2012, was submitted by the Ministry of Finance and Planning to obtain cabinet approval to take over the property, under the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized Asset Act No: 43 of 2011.
Approval was granted on March 14, 2012 and as per the cabinet approval, the Ceylinco property was vested with the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to facilitate expeditious revival of this underperforming and underutilized property as a fully fledged multifaceted hotel complex with a group of private and state investors.
In 2003, Ceylinco Insurance PLC had obtained this land from the UDA on a 99-year lease and the Grand Hyatt project was to be completed by them in 2008. Since the project was defunct at the time the present Government assumed power, after the acquisition the property was given back on a 99-year lease to the new developer  Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt) Ltd by the UDA.
Gamini Sedera Senerath, Piyadasa Kudabalage and Neil Hapuhinna were the Chairman, Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer and Director respectively at Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa from December 21, 2011 up to January 8, 2015. They were also in the Board of Canwill Holdings and Helanco Hotels and Spa from December 22, 2011 till January 8, 2015. Mohan de Alwis too was in the said boards from the beginning, but had resigned from his post after serving for a few years. 
R. Semasinghe and Deepa Nayanakanthi Seneviratne respectively represented the Treasury and EPF Department in the Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa Board.
Shareholders of Canwill Holdings were, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation having 45.94% shares to the value of Rs.8.5 billion, Employees Provident Fund (EPF) obtaining 27.03% shares to the value of Rs.5 billion and Litro Gas Lanka (Pvt) Ltd with 27.03% shares to the value of Rs.5 billion.
Although the Board of Directors of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and its subsidiary Litro Gas Lanka had given approval to invest on Canwill Holdings, the EPF which was established under the EPF Act No: 15 of 1958 and is under the custody of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, sought the Attorney Generals opinion to invest with Canwill Holdings.

Severe Pressure
In order to obtain the Attorney Generals opinion, the Monetary Board by letter dated July 13, 2012 sought an opinion from the Attorney General as to whether the ownership of the Ceylinco property that was acquired by the state had been legally transferred to Sino Lanka, the subsidiary of Canwill Holdings. Approvals were also sought to invest with Canwill Holdings to which the approval was granted on conditions that Canwill Holdings will not invest money to start any new hotel projects including the Helanco Hotels and Spa until the Grand Hyatt Regency project is completed 
Hence,the EPF Board of Directors at the Board Meeting No: 1/2013 on January 3, 2013 decided to invest Rs.5 billion and delegated the authority to the Superintendent of EPF to sign the shareholders agreement subject to the conditions before the investment was made.

Violating Conditions
Some of the conditions laid down were- Shareholders of Canwill Holdings should agree not to exit from their investments until the Grand Hyatt Regency project is completed and commissioned and until the shares are listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Monetary Board of the Central Bank so that the appoint of a Director can be made to both companies to look after the direct and indirect interests of EPF.
We were puzzled as to why the EPF was forced to invest Rs.5 billion on a project that didnt guarantee a return even after the commencement of its operation, but guarantees a return only after it is listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange. The date of listing this entity with the Colombo Stock Exchange was unknown. Instead of investing the excess funds in proper securities enabling the EPF contributors to receive more benefits, by investing with a project where returns were not expected for years, was a loss for the EPF as a whole, sources from the EPF said.
Meanwhile a forensic audit report carried out by a reputed Charted Accountancy Firm in Colombo, in its report had highlighted the alleged fraudulent methodology Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt) Ltd has followed when acquiring the adjoining three properties for the expansion of Grand Hyatt Regency in 2013.
Three adjoining lands  Ranmuthu Hotels Ltd, No: 112, Galle Road Colombo 3, J.C. Ramanayake of 108, Galle Road, Colombo 3 and Ceylinco Insurance PLC of 134, Galle Road Colombo 3 had been acquired between July and November 2013.

By the time this Rs.500 million had been transferred to the Helanco bank account, approval had not been granted for the transaction. Meanwhile the report further states how another Rs.3.5 billion had been transferred to the same account on December 26, 2014, three days before the second board approval was obtained
According to the report, 62.77 perches has been acquired from Ranmuthu Hotels and although the Government Chief Valuer in his report dated June 13, 2013 had valued the land at Rs. 303.2 million and the building therein for Rs. 196.8 million where the total reaches Rs. 500 million, once again the property had been valued on July 30, 2013. In the second valuation report, the land value had risen to Rs. 483.2 million and the building therein remained at the same value with the total valuation being Rs. 680 million. However, the property had been purchased for Rs. 689.071 million without giving any reasons.
As per the forensic audit report, Sino Lanka had acquired 20.1 perches from Ceylon Insurance PLC and the first valuation had been carried out on January 9, 2013 with the valuation for the land being Rs. 100 million and the valuation for the building being Rs. 91.5 million. The total valuation was Rs. 191.5 million. Again on October 22, 2013, the second valuation had been carried out and the value for the land and building value was stated as Rs.252 million. During the third valuation which was done on November 22, 2013, the land valuation had increased up to Rs.168.5 million and the value of the building therein was the same as the first valuation coming into a total of Rs.260 million. However the final payment had been made to the tune of Rs.270 million.

Suspicions of Fraud
The J.C. Ramanayake property was 15 perches in extent and only one valuation had been carried out on August 23, 2013. The valuation for the land was Rs.105 million while the land therein had been valued for Rs.15 million with the total being Rs.120 million. However, Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa had paid Rs. 130 million for the property.
When the payment vouchers were checked, these payments have been made to the respective vendors, but still we believe there was a fraud regarding this. If the Government Chief Valuer had made the Government valuation what made Sino Lanka receive a higher valuation report and get paid more than what the valuer recommended 
Despite of the conditions laid down by the Attorney General in 2012 that Canwill Holdings cant invest in other hotel projects including Helanco Hotels,on February 24, 2014, the Board of Directors of Canwill Holdings had taken a board approval to transfer Rs.500 million to Helanco Hotels and Spa (Pvt) Ltd. and once again another board approval had been made to transfer Rs.3.5 billion to the same account on December 29, 2014, few days before the Presidential elections.

Although the two approvals had been granted by Canwill Board of Directors on February 24, 2014 and December 29, 2014 respectively, the FCID B report states how Rs.50 million had been transferred to the Helanco account at Bank of Ceylon Corporate Branch (Account No: 72783012) on February 11, 2014 and another Rs.450 million on February 19, 2014. By the time this Rs.500 million had been transferred to the Helanco bank account, approval had not been granted for the transaction.
Meanwhile the report further states how another Rs.3.5 billion had been transferred to the same account on December 26, 2014, three days before the second board approval was obtained.Meanwhile the report further states how the procurement of steel for the Grand Hyatt project had been carried out violating Government procurement guidelines. The tender had been awarded to the second lowest bidder which was a loss of Rs.16.426 million to the state.
Melwire Rolling (Pvt) Ltd had quoted the lowest price which was Rs.110, 160 per ton while another company alleged to have links with a powerful politician of the then regime had quoted the second lowest which was Rs.114, 897 per ton. The report states that the bidders had not been invited at the opening and later Kudabalage had sent an acceptance letter to the second lowest bidder on March 21, 2013.
Meanwhile it is also reported how over Rs.9 million had been paid to the constructor to construct a perimeter fence in the Hambantota project, but during the audit, this company had denied carrying out any work at the Hambantota project site nor had it obtained the said money.
Labour Commissioner General A. Wimalaweera was overseas and when contacted Additional Commissioner General of Labour, C.N. Withanachchi declined to comment. Chairman Canwill Holdings/ Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Hemaka Amarasuriya when contacted wanted this paper to call him in an hour, but all attempts taken thereafter to obtain a comment failed as he was not reachable via phone.

Immigration officials nexus aid human smuggling: Sagala
	
Human smugglers were able to send their clients abroad without any restrain because of the nexus between corrupt migration officials in Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said today.
Addressing the commencement of thethe second phase of the Project RELAY facilitated by Interpol, Minister said the need for strengthening the country's legal framework to counter human smuggling.
The project was launched by Interpol to deliver training to law enforcement officers, investigators and front-line border units against smuggling.
He said migrants continue their travel without fear of being apprehended, because of the absence or inadequacy of legislation to address the issue.
He said documents such as passports or birth certificates, can be produced by bribing Government officials in this part of the world  particularly in South Asia.
There have been instances where it was reported that the officers of the Sri Lankan law enforcement system accepted bribes from agents in exchange for allowing their vessels to cross maritime borders.
We, as a Government, have adopted various measures to counter migrant smuggling in Sri Lanka. While strengthening our defence apparatus and the law enforcement system, we also work closely with our international partners on finding ways to counter this problem in a sustainable manner, the Minister said.
He said that Sri Lanka had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Australia to counter human smuggling, enabling even closer cooperation between the two countries in this regard.
The MoU is aimed at facilitating the return to Sri Lanka of people who entered Australia illegally. It also paves the way for enhanced information sharing on methods of tracking, intercepting and investigating people smugglers.
We are in the process of introducing necessary revisions and changes, having understood the gravity and the social impact of the problem, the Minister said.

Not Medamulana tax but bond scam tax: JO
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today the excessive taxes imposed on the people through the 2018 Budget should be described as bond scam taxes' instead of Medamulana taxes'.
JO member G.L. Peiris said though the government had reduced prices of essential items, it had in return hoped to obtain a colossal revenue by way of indirect taxes.
The government will have to spend Rs.18 billion next year to provide the price reductions on essential items. However, indirect taxes will help it earn Rs.649 billion. These are not Medamulana taxes but bond scam taxes. Even Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane had admitted that the government had lost as much as Rs.1 trillion because of the bond scam, he told a news briefing.
Prof. Peiris said everyone was looking forward to see Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe giving evidence at the bond commission and what he has to say about the scam.
He said the JO would not join the SLFP faction led by President Maithripala Sirisena as long as it continued to be a part of the UNP government.
Prof. Peiris said the 2018 Budget had plenty of loopholes because it had been prepared with the primary intention of providing benefits to foreign nationals and not to Sri Lankans.
Rs.10 million had been allocated for people to obtain loans to refurbish houses to promote tourism. Only 10 householders can upgrade their houses from this amount. Another proposal was made to allocate Rs.25 million for entrepreneurs. Given that one person can apply for a loan of Rs.1.5 million, only 16 entrepreneurs can obtain this loan. The reduction of excise duty tax on brand new electric vehicles was also a hoax as parent companies wont send brand new vehicles to Sri Lanka, he said.
Prof. Peiris said removing restrictions for foreign nationals to purchase apartments and other properties would increase the prices of apartments, lands and property in the country, making it difficult for locals to purchase them. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Revisiting Sagara Jalaya
	
Some movies cant be analysed. Sagara Jalaya was like that. It was made to be felt. Not dissected.

Not a review. Not a retelling. Rather, a memory.
The movies have inspired. They have taught us how to cry and how to laugh. They have lifted, saddened, reassured, and humbled. They have also chastened, confused, and angered. Speaking for myself, they have made my life easier to bear.
They have lit dark corners, given me hope when there was anything but, and taught me how to see others as I see myself. Consequently, they have (I believe) unearthed the human in me. This is a rough sketch, a memory in fact, of the first real movie that transformed me on that count, and how it remains ignored by our critical establishment.
Simon Nawagaththegama wrote Suddilage Kathawa in 1978. Seven years earlier, he wrote a collection of short stories titled Sagara Jalaya Madi Handuva Oba Sanda. Four years after Dharmasiri Bandaranayake filmed Suddi, Sumitra Peries adapted the most poignant story from that collection, Ohu Mala Da Pasu.
When Sumitra filmed Nawagaththegamas story, she was consciously or unconsciously moving away from her previous movies. Gehenu Lamayi, Ganga Addara, and Yahalu Yeheli were adaptations of puerile novels, with the first and third authored by Karunasena Jayalath.
Sumitra went beyond any other director here in depicting the joys, sorrows, and defeats of our women, though she raised some flak for observing without commenting on their plights. Like the neo-realists of Italy, in other words, she was accused of depicting without dissecting.
In Ohu Mala Da Pasu she found her first serious source text to trounce her critics. Unlike Jayalath and the author of Ganga Addara, Leticia Boteju, Nawagaththegama was voluptuous in his literary tastes: his library was filled with the best of the East and West, from Joyce to Tagore to Yeats to Hesse.
He was in the least an eclectic. His prose was spare, almost verbal. There are those who believe that the short story was a preparatory exercise for Suddilage Kathawa. There arguably are parallels between the two, parallels which found their cinematic equivalent in the choice of both Sumitra and Dharmasiri Bandaranayake to cast Swarna Mallawarachchi as the protagonist.
At its most essential level, Sagara Jalaya is about the woman as a bereaved mother. With Gehenu Lamayi and Ganga Addara, Sumitra featured the thwarted daughter, played in both by Vasanthi Chathurani in two different social milieus.
In Yahalu Yeheli, she let go of that daughter: Mudithalatha (Nadeeka Gunasekara) refuses to let her familys status decide her fate. So she rebels. But because of her ideological predilections, Sumitra couldnt depict the woman as a rebel without manipulating reality. The ending of Yahalu Yeheli, therefore, seemed to almost preach to the choir.
She returned to her forte with Sagara Jalaya. Three movies in another context would have sufficed for a landmark, but Sumitra had by then mastered the cinema to give out more than a landmark. Several months back, on a Friday night, a TV channel telecast it (The first time in 15 years). Heres what I remember and what came to my mind.
Even on a first viewing, Sagara Jalaya remains fascinatingly refreshing. It opens up (after the titles) with Swarna Mallawarachchi, visibly worried. The son enters the frame, casually remarks hes going out to play with his cousin, is asked by the mother to come back quickly, and runs off to the road like any 10-year-old would.

I have wept at three movies in my life so far. The first was Spielbergs ET, the third Mizoguchis Sanshothe Bailiff. The ET was the kind of childhood fantasy that Hollywood could manufacture. Sansho was more uncompromising in its sense of tragedy. Between these two stands the more rhythmic and composed Sagara Jalaya. I have cried at its ending, just as I have with the other two. I am not ashamed.
Amaradevas music enlivens the sequence; its the last time well see the mother and boy interact that way again. The boys father (H. A. Perera) has died. The entire village is in grief, but that grief is not enough for Heen Kella, the mother. Like most mothers caught in such a predicament, she wants help, not charity or sympathy. She gets the son to ask her sister (Sunethra Sarachchandra) to come visit her. She does so only after a while, which infuriates Heen Kella so much that she lambasts her away. Because the rest of her community is unable to think beyond charity and sympathy, she does the predictable: spurn them all and in turn get spurned by them.
Its difficult to say how one movie can strike us with so much power. Perhaps its the acting. Or the music, by Amaradeva. Or the editing, by Lal Piyasena. More than anything else, though, its the gentleness. Even at breaking point, that gentleness never breaks apart: the boundaries set down by the village are intensely tight.
The second encounter between Swarna and Sunethra comes quite close to disturbing those boundaries, but that doesnt happen. Sunethra taunts Swarna, Swarna returns those taunts, and with a snide remark aimed at Sunethras husband (Ravindra Randeniya) she gets her to leave without a word. Even by the standards of Sumitras other movies, this is deceptively calm. So calm, in fact, that not even the director or the scriptwriter (Lester James Peries) could have ended it without resorting to pathos.
Sagara Jalaya opens with our little protagonist on a dry, parched field.
We return to that field in the final sequence, where he remembers how he used to play with his cousin (who has become angry with him). Earlier they had joked with each other (children can be profoundly innocent, I thought to myself, as I heard them recount what their mothers had to say about them). Now even they have grown distant.
As he smiles bitterly, he remembers a letter sent from his uncle: that uncle, who never came for his brothers funeral, wants the boy to help him carry on his shop. The mother had refused, so had the son, but then he hears his cousin ask him whether hell ever go with that uncle. We dont hear his reply, but we observe him write a letter on the sand. What he writes, we dont see. We hear. It remains the most insanely poignant voiceover I have come across in any movie, Sinhala or English:
udukafha" ux Wn tlal hkav leu;shs' hd ;ry fj,d yskaod ux oeka udlrUj;a lvkakg hkafka kE' Wn tkl,a n,df.k bkakjd' wud hkav tmd lSfjd;a ux wv,d y tkjd' ud;a tlal hkav fkdjrojdu jfrka' g wdorh x'
I was about that boys age when I first watched this film. I didnt know how to react or whether to react at all. Where was the happy ending It took a good many more movies to convince me that the cinema, as with the arts or for that matter even life, didnt always subsist on happily-ever-afters. That night I started to mature. I saw the movies in a different light thereafter. It was the same kind of response that de Sicas Shoeshine compelled from Pauline Kael: Shoeshine was not conceived in the patterns of romance or melodrama; it is one of those rare works of art which seem to emerge from the welter of human experience without smoothing away the raw edges, or losing what most movies lose  the sense of confusion and accident in human affairs. Almost word to word, the same point could have been made of this film.
Sagara Jalaya swept every major film awards ceremony in the country that year (1988).
It clinched for Swarna Mallawarachchi her third Sarasavi Best Actress Award and for Sumitra Peries her third Best Director Award. The critics were unanimous in their praise. Reggie Siriwardena loved it, at a time when to have your movie even remotely liked by Reggie meant that it was good. It became Sumitras best, never to be equalled or surpassed. And yet, it remains virtually forgotten today. Why, I cant tell.
In any case, it does not matter. I called Sumitra the day after they telecast it. She had watched it, so I asked for a comment. Heres what she said:
When I see it today, I am taken aback by its mise-en-scne and pacing. That I did all that speaks volumes about how well knit my crew were: Amaradeva, Lal Piyasena, Donald Karunaratne, my husband, and of course Swarna and that little boy and the rest of the cast. I directed it, yes, but seeing it again, I can say that it has gained a life of its own.
I have wept at three movies in my life so far. The first was Spielbergs ET, the third Mizoguchis Sanshothe Bailiff. The ET was the kind of childhood fantasy that Hollywood could manufacture. Sansho was more uncompromising in its sense of tragedy. Between these two stands the more rhythmic and composed Sagara Jalaya. I have cried at its ending, just as I have with the other two. I am not ashamed.
Some movies cant be analysed. I just let them move me. Sagara Jalaya was like that. It was made to be felt. Not dissected. Like the best works of art, one can add.

## Title: SL family in NZ faces deportation after 8 years

SL family in NZ faces deportation after 8 years
	
After eight years of living and working in New Zealand, the Wijerathne family face returning to Sri Lanka after their work visas were cancelled.
Living in a one-bedroom former camping ground cabin in Queenstown are three brothers, their mother and father.
From left: Binath, 10, mother Dinesha Amarasinghe, Senath, 8, Sam and Subath, 11.
There's not much space but the family's priorities are clear. On the walls are maps and mathematics charts. Desks and chairs cluttered with books and papers sit in a line under the window. Cricket bats and guitars are piled in between.
The Wijerathne boys  aged 11, 10 and 8  attend Queenstown Primary School, where they are regarded as excellent students. Two made it to the recent finals of the Otago-Southland spelling bee. They were invited to sit Australian academic exams. They are swimmers and cricketers, playing for the Queenstown Club where dad Sam coaches. They go to church every Sunday.
It isn't an easy life. Their Sri Lanka-born parents have worked long hours as a chef and a taxi driver in one of the most expensive places in the country to support them and their mother has developed health issues. But it is better than the life they left behind eight years ago.
However, that is set to change. The family have been told they have to leave New Zealand on November 21.
The boys' mother, Dinesha Amarasinghe, tells her story through the tears that flow through her day, every day, since her latest application for a temporary working visa was declined.
She says the boys are angry with her. Her eldest son, Subath, wants to know why he can't join his friends at the new Wakatipu High School, which opens next year. Eight-year-old Senath wants to go to school camp. He was a year old when the family left Sri Lanka. New Zealand is his home.
"I blame myself all the time," Dinseha says. "They're very good kids at sports and studies. We are not doing any wrong things. We are helping at the school . . . everywhere. My kids, they can't go back there [Sri Lanka]."
Looking for a better life for their children and with Sri Lanka undergoing civil war for 25 years, Dinesha applied to come to New Zealand as a hospitality student in 2010. She had 10 years of industry experience and started working as a cook in Auckland in 2011, under Immigration New Zealand's skilled migrant category.
Late in 2011, the family moved to Queenstown, where she worked as commis chef at the popular Lone Star restaurant. Based on Dinesha's visa, Sam was granted an open work permit and worked at New World supermarket, the Hilton and as a taxi driver.
In 2014, Dinseha slipped on the floor while working and was later diagnosed with a lumbar sprain. Despite the pain in her leg, she continued to work while awaiting treatment but in January 2015, continuing problems forced her onto ACC. In May 2015, she had a brain scan and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).
In October this year, because Dinesha was unable to work, her skilled worker temporary visa was declined. Without it, Sam can no longer work and the family have to leave the country by November 21.
The family have an application for residency sitting with Immigration NZ. They applied in April 2013. Their lawyer, Shane Robinson, was not involved with their case then but says that for the application not to be resolved to date is unusual.
Immigration NZ area manager Marcelle Foley said it usually took between six and 12 months to process a residency application. However, it was not unusual for longer processing times in complex cases "as is the case in the situation".
The processing of their residence visa has now been suspended as they have been unlawful in New Zealand since July, she said
Robinson said a large part of the delay was because Sam overstayed a working visa in Japan in 2006 and was deported. Despite that, he was given a visa in New Zealand as a special direction in 2012 but a dispute over the facts was continuing and was unresolved. However, Dinesha's health has now taken over as the key issue.
Confusing the family though is the fact that Dinesha was granted a new temporary work visa in 2016, despite her MS diagnosis. Robinson says Immigration NZ's operational instructions state MS disqualifies someone from getting a temporary work visa but Immigration NZ allowed it in this case partly because it was unclear what degree of her health issues were caused by the 2014 fall and there was the ability to grant a waiver in the case of a residence visa (which was still in progress).
"In hindsight, it may have been fairer on the family for INZ to decline the applications then and not give them false hope."
Foley said the organisation was aware in 2016 that Dinesha had MS. However, it was not until this year they became aware she had had a prolonged absence from work and she acknowledged that she would be unable to work in full-time employment for some time.
Dinesha was advised she was likely to impose significant costs or demands on New Zealand's health services or special education services, Foley said.
"All non-New Zealanders coming to New Zealand must have an acceptable standard of health so as not to impose undue costs or demands on New Zealand's public health system," Foley said.
Still, when the family's application to renew the visa was declined in October, they were taken by surprise and plunged into the desperate situation they are now in. Dinesha cannot work to the extent that is required. Sam can work but was declined for a work visa-partner and doesn't fit the "skilled employment" category.
Robinson said a request was being made for visas to be granted as a "special case" but the chances of that succeeding were low.
"We have also been instructed to file an appeal on humanitarian grounds . . . If both of those options fail, then the family's only hope is intervention by the minister of immigration."
The family dread the prospect of returning to Sri Lanka. Last year they visited for the first time since they have been in New Zealand. Subath, 11, has sad eyes and speaks quietly of the trip. "I don't like to go back to Sri Lanka," he says. "I don't like the mosquitos and we have don't have many friends there."
His parents are even more desperate to stay. "I'm not thinking about my future as a rich man but I'm thinking about education for my children another few years. We are asking for a chance," Sam says.
Life is hard in New Zealand but if they return to Sri Lanka they will have no money  it has all been spent on immigration and lawyers. Dinesha will not have access to the medicine she needs. Pay rates are low  not enough for Sam to support his children and wife  and the children, who are having great success at school now, will struggle with the native Sinhalese language and likely be finished school at 14 and become fodder for the gangs that are rampant in poorer communities.
"I'm not asking anyone for money. I've brought money from Sri Lanka to live here . . . now everything is gone but [in Sri Lanka] I have no house. I don't know where to start. Our parents are old, we can't ask them for help. They don't have money  we need to help them."
They are proud people but with Sam no longer permitted to work and with rent to pay, the $2500-a-month cost of Dinesha's medication and mounting legal costs, they have become reliant on charities, friends and the kindness of others.
"I can manage everything if they give me a chance," says Sam. "That's why we don't ask anyone for a hand. But with both not working it's really hard."
Dinesha questions why after years of working and paying taxes in New Zealand, the family should be treated this way.
"I came to New Zealand along with my family holding heaps of hopes and ambitions."- Stuff

Streamline duty on brand new, reconditioned e-vehicles: Importers
	
The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka yesterday expressed optimism that the Finance Ministry would streamline the two separate import excise duties on brand new and reconditioned electric vehicles such as Nissan Leaf.
Association President Ranjan Peiris commended the budget proposal to reduce excise duty on brand new Nissan Leaf vehicles by Rs. 1 million and said this duty should be given to reconditioned vehicles as well.
Even the Finance Minister had admitted that this should be rectified and all vehicles of this kind, regardless of being brand new or reconditioned, should be given the same excise duty relief of Rs. 1 million, he told a news briefing.
He said more policy decisions should be put in place to allow the flowing in of e-vehicles into the country. However, he said more measures need to be taken to prepare basic infrastructure required for e-vehicles in the country.
Mr. Peiris commended the move to establish 100 e-vehicle charging points across the country and said it was best to use solar power to power up these charging points without burdening the main grid.
Meanwhile, he said the Rs. 750,000 increment in excise duty on hybrid vehicles such as Toyota Axio, Aqua, Honda Vezel, Grace and Fit would create a negative impact on traders of such vehicles.
It would have been better if the excise tax for these vehicles remained uncharged, he said.
He welcomed the budget proposals to make compulsory the importation of vehicles which had airbags and anti locking brake systems and the importation of vehicles of Euro 4 standard.
We already import vehicles that are up to Euro 6 standard. We commend the green-budget concept of Minister Mangala Samaraweera to make Sri Lanka a country with environment friendly vehicles, he said.
Commenting on the Letter of Credits (LCs) opened by government workers on the permits, Mr. Peiris said the government should ensure that these government workers wont be affected by the budget proposals and that they enjoy the benefit of them.
With the reduction of import excise duty, he said a Suzuki Alto (Japanese) could be valued at around Rs.2.5 million while Toyota Pixis and Suzuki Wagon-R at Rs. 3 million. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Once the Build-it fixed deposit is opened, customers can build on their investment monthly through a standing order instruction to grow their investment consistently. These customers are entitled to a higher interest rate in comparison to normal savings account. They are also entitled to compounding interest on their Build-it deposit. The customer can either access their money at the end of the one month period or allow it to roll over for another term.
