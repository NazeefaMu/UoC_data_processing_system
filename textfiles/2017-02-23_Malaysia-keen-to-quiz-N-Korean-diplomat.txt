Malaysian investigators want to question a North Korean diplomat over the assassination of Kim Jong-Un’s half-brother in Kuala Lumpur, national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said on Wednesday.   

Police have put five North Koreans in the frame for last week’s killing of Kim Jong-Nam at the city’s international airport and have said they were seeking three more for questioning.  Among the wanted are the second secretary at Pyongyang’s embassy in Kuala Lumpur and a North Korean airline employee, Khalid told reporters.    “We have written to the ambassador to allow us to interview both of them. We hope that the Korean embassy will cooperate with us and allow us to interview them quickly. If not, we will compel them to come to us,” he said.  Khalid said police believed five North Koreans were “heavily involved” in the murder. Four of the men fled the country on the day of the killing while one remains in custody in Malaysia.  The police chief said two women also arrested over the murder were aware they were taking part in a poison attack, after reports they believed it was a prank.
