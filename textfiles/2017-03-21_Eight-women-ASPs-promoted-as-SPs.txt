Eight women Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) have been promoted to the rank of Superintendent of Police (SP) with effect from February 20 by the National Police Commission (NPC), Police said today.

Police spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said IGP Pujitha Jayasundara had recommended the promotions based on their service period and skills.

Accordingly, State Intelligence Service ASP A.G.N.D. Senevirathne, Fraud Investigation Bureau ASP S.A.R. Jayasundara, Bribery and Corruption ASP W.J. Padmini and Criminal Investigations Department ASP R.A.D. Kumari were promoted to the rank of SP.

NPC Secretary, Ariyadasa Cooray, said the women ASP officers were promoted to the rank of SP following the establishment of a combined carder of ASP’s and SP’s. He said previously there were only two SP positions for women.

Earlier, the NPC said there were 11,000 women employed in the force but they could only legally appoint two to the positions of SP.( Darshana Sanjeewa)
