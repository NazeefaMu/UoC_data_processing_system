Now he has to contend with comrades turning rebels


	



 

The party led by Prince Panchaudha is fast cracking up mainly because of his arbitrary actions as party leader, they say.

 


The Prince has come in for severe flak from the inner circle of the party for staging the recent fast-unto-death without consulting the party.  He has also incurred their wrath for making it a habit to act against the decisions taken by the party hierarchy. 


The talkative leader is also being blamed for the ‘unwise’ decision to function in the council as an independent group within the opposition. This decision has given rise to a legal challenge to the status of the party’s council members.


Meanwhile, the party’s long standing stalwart from Rajarata holding a seat in the Diyawanna council is said to have met Number One at his ‘palace’ which has given a hint about the trouble brewing within the party, they say.  


Comrades Muza and Wije who once represented the party in the council too have fallen out with Prince Panchaudha.


Meanwhile, some have already begun fishing in troubled waters, they say.
