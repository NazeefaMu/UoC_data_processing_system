American Music Awards 2015 winners

The 2015 American Music Awards held on Sunday night at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. Wearing a bejewelled, tribal printed bodysuit she pulled off some incredible moves to some of the year's greatest hits, including Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk", Drake's "Hotline Bling" and Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda". She encouraged her feverish fans to "find their voice".
One Direction, who performed "Perfect", won favorite duo or group - pop/rock.
Though 1D earned loud applause the night was about girl power.
To present the award for Best New Artist to country singer Sam Hunt, Jlo flashed her beige bra in a black sheer lace outfit and cinched her waist with silver belt.
Lopez and Diddy dated from 1991 to 2001; she was with the 46-year-old rapper and businessman when he was arrested on weapons violations charges outside the Times Square Club in NY in 1999. She also impressively sang in nearly a cappella form.
The singer's comeback album, "Purpose", is likely to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart - though it's in a close race with One Direction's "Made In the A.M". She is the leading nominee with six including song and collaboration of the year for "Bad Blood" with Kendrick Lamar, favorite female artist - pop/rock, favorite album - pop/rock for "1989" and favorite artist - adult contemporary.
Bieber's performance wasn't the only well-received one: Celine Dion paid tribute to the victims of the recent Paris attacks by singing Edith Piaf's "Hymne à L'Amour" in French as some audience members cried.
If there's anything people look forward to at award shows - aside from the much-hyped superstar performances and actual awards - it's what the stars are wearing.
