The Ministry of Wildlife should manage human animal conflicts while safeguarding species, Deputy Minister of Environment Ajith Mannapperuma said today.

He was referring to the attempt made by Minister of Wildlife and Regional Development Sarath Fonseka to relocate the only remaining two wild elephants of Sinharaja Forest elsewhere.

“The two elephants that are used to live in the wet zone are to be sent to the dry zone. Behaviour of elephants in wet zones is different to those in the dry zone. The two elephants, if sent to the dry zone, would get harmed by the other elephants in the dry zone,” the Deputy Minister said. (Yohan Perera)
