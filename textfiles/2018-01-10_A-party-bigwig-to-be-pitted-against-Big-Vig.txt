The leadership of the main alliance of the North has got their hands full with the task of holding together in one piece the shaky alliance that has now begun cracking up, they say. 

 


According to the latest reports, the alliance has decided to give party nomination to Senadhi to contest the upcoming provincial polls, sidelining Big Vig who has been looking down his nose at the party leadership ever since being elected the Northern Chief. 


In the event of Big Vig being denied nomination, chances are that he will contest on the ticket of the new party he has founded in which case the contest in the North will be one mainly between Big Vig and Senadhi, they say.
