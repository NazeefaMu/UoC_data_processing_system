Shores of Puttalam and neighbouring region in Sri Lanka have been getting deposited in the last three days with thousands of expired medicines, bottles, polythene packages and injection syringe.

All these expired medicines have seals and manufacturing stamps from India, the India Today reported.

With the sea turbulent, Puttalam fisheries officials suspect that the medical waste is coming from the Indian side and that it was disposed off in the sea in a hazardous manner.

The fishermen in the region fear that this will affect the fish in the sea and in turn their livelihood.

Officials in the region will begin a probe on how the medical waste is reaching the Sri Lankan waters.
