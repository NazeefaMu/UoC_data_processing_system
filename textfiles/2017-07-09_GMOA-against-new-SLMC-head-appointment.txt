The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) warned stern trade union action tomorrow onwards if Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne appoints Prof. Colvin Gunaratne as the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman violating the Medical Ordinance.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told the Daily Mirror that the GMOA would resort to an indefinite strike without prior notice if the minister assigns the Prof. Gunaratne without considering GMOA recommendations.
