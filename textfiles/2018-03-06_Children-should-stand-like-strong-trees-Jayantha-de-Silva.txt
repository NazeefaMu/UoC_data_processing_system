Children should stand like strong trees: Jayantha de Silva


	



 

Children should act with self-determination and unstinted courage and stand like strong trees without depending on others like creepers, said Jayantha de Silva, Western Provincial Councillor and founder of the Pragna Pradeepa concept.    


Addressing the divesting ceremony of Prefects of Borella Sri Dharmashrama Sri Saddhatissa Dhamma School, he said life does not continue in one style or pattern but undergoes trials and tribulations, slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes and many a challenge and that one must have a strong personality formed with learning and discipline to take up arms against the challenges. 


“My dear children, I advise you to be strong trees and not creepers. When a creeper entangling a tree is cut off by the people, it is very seldom that they cut down a tree bearing fruits. The tree felled will be used for timber. If you are well educated and disciplined to lead yourself along the right path, you will be able to face challenges in the complex society and guard yourself against any external force that attempts to puncture your career. Dhamma  School is the nurture ground of one’s personality where one would be inculcated with discipline and wisdom to lead one’s life along the right path to success and to cushion the impact of adverse external forces to a great extent. Nowadays, many a man who excels in his abilities and scholarly pursuits and stands as an exponent of education is not well cultured or disciplined. Such men often end up in failures and come to grief.

“A specialist doctor knew to charge much higher channeling fees when compared to other doctors. But he is a casino-goer who wastes his substance in gambling. It is a clear indication that he is not disciplined and inculcated with the prerequisites of a decent lifestyle, although he has risen to the highest echelons of the society, to command recognition as a medical specialist and is fortunate to earn wealth and means. Therefore, candid opinion is that every child should continue Dhamma School education and I advise them to do so. 


“However, it is sad that many parents among us do not take an interest in sending their children to Dhamma Schools as in the case of providing private tuition. Children should be inculcated with a lifestyle cast in the mould of Dhamma and social values during their formative years or else the parents will be destined to end up in homes for the aged. The parents must send their children to the Dhamma School to lead them along the right path and to prevent them from being criminals who end up in prison,” he said.
