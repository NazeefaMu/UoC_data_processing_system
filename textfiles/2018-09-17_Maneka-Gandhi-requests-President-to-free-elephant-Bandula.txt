Indian Minister and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi has written to Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to free elephant ‘Bandula’ from Dehiwala Zoo, the NDTV reported on Monday.

In her letter, Ms.Gandhi said many in Sri Lanka have reached out to her about the "plight of Bandula" who is in chains for last 67 years.

There were reports about bleeding wounds on Bandula's limbs, due to heavy chains for years.

“Sri Lanka is such a gentle and beautiful island. It seems out of character to treat the elephant this way. Send the elephant to the Ridiyagama National Park to live free,” Ms.Gandhi said.

The minister cited examples in India about how elephants are banned in zoos and the elephants look stressed when chained as they have the same sensitivities as humans.
