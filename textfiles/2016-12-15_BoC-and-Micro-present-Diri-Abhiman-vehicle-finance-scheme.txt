Two of Sri Lanka’s most patriotic organizations came together to provide their customers with a special package to make the dream of owning a vehicle a reality. 


An official Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two companies on the 23rd of November at the BoC Towers in Colombo Fort under the auspices of the Deputy Chairman of Micro Holdings, Sabri Wahid and the Deputy General Manager of BoC C. Amarasinghe
BoC - Micro ‘Diri Abhiman’ is a special loan scheme under which, customers of Micro cars will be given a special interest rate that is 0.5 percent lesser than the one offered to others. They will also be provided with a speedier service while the Micro Panda and Panda Cross would be offered at a discounted price. 


The Panda which sells at Rs. 1,895,000 would be subject to a discount of Rs. 20,000 for BoC customers while a special discount of Rs. 25,000 would be offered to employees of BoC. Any customer that would purchase a Panda Cross currently priced at Rs. 2,400,000 would be offered a discount of Rs. 50,000 under this loan scheme.
Both organizations expect this loan scheme to become a massive hit, as it makes the dream of owning a vehicle more realistic with the attractive discounts and rate reductions offered.
