They say it’s a deal that stinks


	


A certain political authority is said to be hell-bent on clearing the way for launching a mega hotel project on a CTB depot property on the outskirts of the city. 
During the previous regime a leading corporate body had sought to acquire a part of this land to site a multi-storey hotel complex. However, the proposed deal fell through as the political authority in charge of Transport at that time insisted that the Ministry be given a stake in the company on a par with the estimated value of the land to be acquired for the project. 
The new political authority has not stipulated such a condition this time round. In fact, he has already presented a paper to the highest decision-making body proposing the alienation of the land in question for the proposed hotel project. 
The eagle-eyed trade union activists who are highly concerned about the proposed deal say that they can smell its stink from a mile away!
