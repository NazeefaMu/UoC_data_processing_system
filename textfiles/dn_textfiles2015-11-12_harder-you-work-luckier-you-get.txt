[Young Voices]
The harder you work, the luckier you get!

Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anuradha Jayaratne is a man of the people. His story is the story of a man who wanted to live for the people. That was his calling and politics was the path set before him. "Young Voices from Diyawanna" features this young parliamentarian who yearns for change and fate has answered him.
Early life
Jayaratne started his education at Trinity College up until Grade 5 in 1995. After moving to Colombo, from 1995- 2004 until his A/L he studied at Royal College. For his LLB degree he went to the UK to the University of Buckinghamshire. Subsequently he came back to Sri Lanka and did his Attorneys and took oaths in 2010. In 2010 his father D.M. Jayaratne was appointed as the Prime Minister and Jayaratne worked as a private secretary to him. And then in 2013 he contested for the provincial council.
Happy days
"Most of my friends are from Colombo. School time was a very fun time because we had a big clique called the 'Outcasts'! We had about 25 students in the gang. We left college in 2004 so now it has been like 11 years. Last year we had a special tent for the batch and we all came together at the Royal- Thomian big match," said Jayaratne.
Studying in the UK, he worked part time at MacDonald's taking only funds for tuition fees from his parents. The first year and second years he did that, but for the final year he had to take some cash as one had to do full time studies.
Jayaratne has played cricket for NCC and hockey for the Royal College team.
Dreams
"Honestly speaking at the beginning I did not want to be a politician. I thought that by being a lawyer I would be able to do some community work. My dad was working for the society so I saw him helping people. I thought if it came to legal cases I would be able to help them.
I told my mother that I wanted to be a lawyer. So she sent me to the UK to do the degree. When I started working as a private secretary to my dad, he was very busy as he was a Prime Minister. So I was the one who took care of the entire electorate and not only the electorate but also Kandy. I honestly don't know how I got into politics. But whatever you do, you have to make sacrifices and if you do it to the maximum you will achieve it. I had the intention of doing some community work. Eventually I got into the path of politics. Being a politician is not sort of my career. In my career I am a lawyer. But this is something I do for the society and community."
Challenges
"Being a politician there are a lot of challenges. Many thought I would not get into politics. Once you get into politics they see you as a different person. They see you as a challenge, specially, when it comes to an election.
The main thing was I contested for the Provincial Council. I got the highest votes and I became number from the Kandy district. Soon after the election there was a lot of blame. Some individuals just want to destroy a man's career. The best way to destroy a man is to destroy his reputation. So this was going on very badly from 2013 until I contested for the Parliament. I love doing community work and social work. Maintaining my reputation is the main challenge. But the more they blamed me, I went more to the people."
Message to the youth
"I have seen quite a lot of our people who have gone abroad. And they work very hard. When I was in the UK, there were some Sri Lankan engineers who worked part time at MacDonald's or Tesco to get an hourly rate. They worked so hard. What I personally feel is if they put that energy in our country they would have done more. From the day we are born there is a tendency to get everything for free - we are born in a government hospital, we get an education at a government school and that is free, we get a higher education in a government university and we get that free.
Then when the youth come up in society they expect the government to give the job as well. This is something that will not work. So, especially the youth will have to work hard. If they work hard I am pretty sure we will be able to overcome the challenges."
Going back in history
"I would go back not very long, four or five years back and there was a time where the minorities were hurt. If we could change that simple thing that happened it would be ideal for the country. The country would have moved forwards very fast.
In God's shoes for one day
"I would change this language issue honestly. This is a huge barrier for everyone. If people and everybody would speak in one language that would have been ideal. Recently I came back from China. We tried to interact more with them, but it was a nightmare!"
Life out of Parliament
"Mostly I read legal books. I read Richard Branson and Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. I like the way how they have come up. Now I also read political books.
Soon after my A/L I started law so you have to read those books on law.
When it comes to music I listen to Rukantha and my favorite song is 'Sanda Pinidiya' and I also listen to Western R&B music. I also listen to Akon and Westlife. I love flying. I have a Student Pilot License. I did some flying and that is something I love."
Love at first sight
"I am married and my wife's name is Dilini. I was 20 years old and she was 19. We were both in the UK at that time. She was studying in the University of Sheffield. I was at Buckinghamshire and we had to come to London for a conference. That was when I met her and it was a long relationship and now it has been four years since I got married. Our relationship was seven years and it was love at first sight!
Living life all over again and being anyone you want
"I would be like my dad."
Wish for the world
"I wish Peace, without creating different sorts of mechanisms to control countries and societies. That is what they do now. They call it peace but if you see it properly that is only a system of controlling developing countries. But that is not the exact peace. If you could have the proper peace that we expect as a human being that is my wish. Now there are many organizations that have been created in order to create peace but they have different expectations."
An event in life that moved him emotionally
"In 2013 my dad was very ill and he was taken to the states."
Exemplary historical figures
"It would be Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is one character that I admire. He is the one who changed the country. I was born in 1985. From the day we are born we have seen war. He ended it in 2009.
"Also whatever said and done the massive development we have today is due to him. From 2009 - 2014 there was development."
