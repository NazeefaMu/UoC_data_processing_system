Wawrinka gets ready for Australian Open in India's Chennai

 
CHENNAI, SUNDAY: French Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka is looking to give himself the best possible preparation for the first Grand Slam of 2016 in Melbourne later this month by winning the ATP Chennai Open, which starts on Tuesday.
The Swiss is bidding for his third consecutive Chennai Open title and hopes a victory in India will help propel him to another major win, just as it did in 2014 and 2015.
Two years ago Wawrinka clinched his first Slam when he won the Australian Open just weeks after triumphing in southern India. Last year, Wawrinka followed up victory in Chennai by taking home the trophy at Roland Garros in June.
"I've always enjoyed coming to Chennai. The tournament is a nice way to start the season, the fans are great and I like the atmosphere in the stadium," the 30-year-old said in comments released by organisers.
"2015 has been an amazing year and 2016 is already around the corner. I want to continue to do well, win tournaments, and go deep at the Slams. And hopefully I get a great start into the season in Chennai again," he added.
Wawrinka, ranked fourth in the world, also won in Chennai in 2011 and is the top seed in the $480,000 tournament.
His closest challenger is likely to be number two seed Kevin Anderson. The big-serving South African has a 4-4 record against Wawrinka but says he's not thinking too much about his opponents.
"I typically try to focus on my own game and I know if I do that and execute, I can beat anyone," said the world number 12.
The final of the Chennai Open takes place on Sunday.
The Australian Open in Melbourne runs from January 18 to 31.
