The Kingsbury places Colombo on Global Hospitality Map

The evening can be described as "The Oscars" of the hotel industry and key global players met at the glorious Harbour Grand - Hong Kong to be bestowed their rightful place on the global hospitality map. The World Luxury Hotel Awards aim is to provide luxury hotels with recognition for their world-class facilities, service excellence provided to guests. Thereby giving guests a voice, fuelling the growth and raising service standards within the luxury hotel industry.
World Luxury Hotel Awards honoured The Kingsbury for the second time and this time with the prestigious title of 'Best Luxury Business Hotel' in the Indian Ocean, Continent. This speaks volumes for the commercial hub Colombo has become to attract discerning business travellers; expecting high standards and designer quality in a central location. The Kingsbury's opulence encased in timeless elegance is a rare find in tropical setting. From Bvlgari amenities to bath & bed products to cutlery & crockery - all have a similar luxurious touch, as do the 450 Red Roses that greet all every day.
Awards are presented to luxury hotels in the categories of country, continent and global basis. The awards judging criteria are based upon facilities and service excellence provided by hotels. Size of a property is not taken into consideration during the nomination or voting phases.
"We're in a phase where tourism is making the world a smaller and a more familiar place. The boundaries are only a state of mind to a seasoned traveller. The tourism product on a global scale is developing in leaps and bounds to accommodate further segmentation. The business traveller is one such segment that's setting the pace in this race and this is truly an honour to Sri Lanka and to all of us at The Kingsbury to have won the best luxury business hotel award for 2015", The Kingsbury Canadian General Manager Scott Mawhinney elated.
The Kingsbury Managing Director and Executive Director Lalin Samarawickremaa member of the Institute of Hospitality UK (formerly HCIMA) and the Royal Society of Health in London, having handed over the reins to Scott in October this year, attributed the award to the hotel team, as their performance has been remarkable year on year. Last year, they made such handsome profits to be able to pay dividends to shareholders in the second year of operation. Lalin, a veteran hotelier with immense international experience said "if you get the basics right, it's not rocket-science, its genuine hospitality that comes from the heart".
The discerning patrons of The Kingsbury are provided with some of the world's best amenities such as "Sealy" mattresses for a blissful night's sleep, Italian "Frette" bed & bath linen for a heavenly in-room experience. The dining experience too is complimented with some of the world's best brands such as German Villeroy & Boch, Spiegelau, Schott Zwiesel and Sambonet from Italy for fine cutlery and crockery. Taking this luxurious experience one notch higher is its bath amenities from the designer Italian brand - Bvlgari. The Kingsbury at present is the only hotel in Colombo to provide such super luxury brands in their rooms. Naturally, at The Kingsbury the experience will be forever timeless!
The Kingsbury Manager Corporate Communications & PR Dinithi Somaratne represented the hotel at the gala dinner ceremony at Harbour Grand in Hong Kong and went on to say, "The distinctive brand positioning and strategic marketing efforts have set us apart from the clutter to be able to compete and win at an international level".
