UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said Arjuna Mahendran, the main suspect of the Central Bank bond scam, would be brought back to Sri Lanka through the Interpol.

Addressing a gathering held at Weeraketiya yesterday, he said “the mastermind of the bond scam has left the country. Regardless of the country he is in, he would be brought back and produced before our courts,”

He said the people were disappointed with the government for robbing public properties.

“No matter who does it, looting public properties is unacceptable. Therefore, the President is taking measures to eliminate fraud and corruption,” he said. (Chandrasena Gamage)
