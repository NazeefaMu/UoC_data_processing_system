Two Lankan men were today arrested at the Katunayake airport by the Customs Narcotics Division with foreign currency amounting to around Rs.35 million while they were attempting to smuggle them out to Singapore.

Katunayake Airport Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said the suspects from Colombo were aged between 35 and 49.

“The suspects were arrested at 1.10 this morning after their behaviour was found to be suspicious. During investigations the currency was found concealed inside clay ornaments packed in their luggage,” he said.

Among the foreign currency were Saudi Riyals, Swiss Francs and Euros, Mr. Basnayaka said.

The raid was conducted under the direction of customs director J.R. Uduwawala and Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake while investigations are being carried out by the Assistant Customs Superintendents Nuwan Abeynayaka, Hasantha Guruge, Udaya Gamini and Samantha Kaluaggala.(Chaturanga Pradeep and Ranjith Ferdinandus)
