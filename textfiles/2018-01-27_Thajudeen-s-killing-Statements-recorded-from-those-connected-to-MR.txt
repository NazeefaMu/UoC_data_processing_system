The CID yesterday informed Colombo Chief Magistrate Darshika Wimalasiri that it had recorded statements from several people having close connections to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s family in connection with the killing of former rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen.

It also informed Court that it was investigating two Navy vehicles which had been used under suspicious circumstances between May 1, 2012 and May 30, 2012.

Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake informed Court that the CID needed more time to investigate the suspicious phone calls, which had originated from the presidential secretariat, the president’s house and Temple Trees at about the time the killing had taken place.

The Magistrate fixed the next hearing for May 3. (Yoshitha Perera)
