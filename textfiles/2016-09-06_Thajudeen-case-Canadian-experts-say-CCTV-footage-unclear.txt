The Forensic Video and Surveillance Technology Laboratory - British Columbia Laboratory in Canada has informed the Colombo Magistrate Court that the CCTV footage in connection with the murder of rugger player Mohammed Thajudeen were not clear and as such its experts are unable to come to a conclusion in connection with the murder.

According to the report submitted to Court, the Canadian institute had stated that because of low resolution and unclear of images (pixels) in the CCTV footage, they were not in a position to reach any conclusion.

The CID had sent ten copies of the CDs containing the CCTV footage and 36 questions with regard to the Thajudeen murder. An ASP and a Sub Inspector attached to the CID visited the Canadian lab between August 22 to 31 with the CDs.  (Nirangi Abeywickreme)
