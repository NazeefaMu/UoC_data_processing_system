Pushing it under the carpet?


	

A powerful purohita from Rajarata has made a financial crime allegation against another colleague – a big-mouthed one hailing from the same province. 

According to the allegation, the big-mouthed one had caused a financial loss of about Rs.400 million by selling off a large stock of paddy at a price much lower than the buying price trotting out the excuse that he had to empty the clogged paddy board’s warehouses to take in new stocks from 
the farmers.


Some charge that the paddy stocks were sold out for the manufacture of ethanol following a secret understanding reached with the businessmen involved. The purohita concerned vehemently denies this charge.  Meanwhile, some sources say that no investigation into this charge is likely to carried out as the two purohitas are from the two main constituents of the yahapalanaya government.
