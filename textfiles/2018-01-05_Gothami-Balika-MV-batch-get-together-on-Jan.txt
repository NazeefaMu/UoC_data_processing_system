Gothami Balika MV ‘95’ batch get together on Jan 7


	



It was just an ordinary day in 1987 and about 100 little girls from various backgrounds and various locations, arrived at the road with their parents and loved ones with just one goal; to be educated. Gothami Balika MV was an extra ordinary place for ordinary girls, a Government girls’ school which is well-recognised for grooming young females. Temple road, temple flowers, four famous temples were things associated with this first Government Buddhist girls’ school. There was a  prominent Buddhist culture at Gothami yet everyone recognised and respected other religions and cultures. They efforts of the teachers have contributed, in some way, toward the producing of doctors, engineers and lawyers, over the years. Members in this batch grew up together, but their destinies were decided in 1995. Some were very successful and realised their childhood dreams. But destiny took some of them on different paths. Becoming women who can lead the world was the priceless lesson they learned at Gothami.   


Today they come from all parts of the world for this get together which is titled ‘Avarjana 95’. 22 years later, on the 7th of January, they are united again, stepping into the holy turf of Gothami, walking down the same lane, smelling the familiar temple flowers as grown up women, despite each of them now having different careers.   


The goal at this event is to pay respect and tribute to their teachers and to honour and celebrate their lives. They will also not forget those teachers and friends who have departed



The goal at this event is to pay respect and tribute to their teachers and to honour and celebrate their lives. They will also not forget those teachers and friends who have departed. This is a rare, but unique opportunity for many reasons. The last 6 months were a testament to their strong planning, organising and execution skills. Old relationships were renewed, old friends reunited, high speed communication channels were established among all over the world and the organisers worked 24x7. They worked hand in hand with special bonds and everyone was determined to do a good job, even if things weren’t easy; sometimes impossible.   


As such the effort of these old Gothamians didn’t stop there. They donated Rs 200,000 worth of educational items to their school including lecture/theatre chairs, new FM microphes and funds for a  project that is aimed at improving the subject knowledge of students sitting for the O/L Exam this year.   


“We did what we planned to achieve. Every single detail of this project was well planned and carefully executed. I am delighted and proud to organise such a remarkable event,” stated Hansamala Ritigahapola, Senior Lecturer of University of Sri Jayawardhanapura Kotte who is the Chief Organiser of the event.   


“I am very happy that my fellow batch mates are reuniting, coming from all parts of the world. They are going to give back something to their school and the teachers as good global citizens. They are all great women who serve the world in many different capacities,” stated Shiromi Warnakula, a former school captain.   



Once again, they proved it, Pranna Lokasmin Pajjotho – Wisdom Enlightens the World.
