The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said yesterday that it would support the government to implement the proposals of the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.

TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said the resolution clearly states how to implement the proposals and opinions should be expressed only when the mechanisms are being created to implement these proposals.

“There are different opinions expressed with affect to the reconciliation mechanism and there is no point us making more comments in this regard at this level. We should only make comments when the plans are being made,” he told the journalists outside the US Ambassador’s Official Residence in Colombo 7.

A group of TNA MPs led by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan held discussions with visiting US Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Tom Malinowski and Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Desai Biswal at the Ambassador’s Residence.

The MP said the new Constitution of the Government, UNHRC resolutions and the actions taken in this regard were discussed during the discussions held with the two US diplomats.

“The US assured that it would always assist Sri Lanka in its measures to find solutions to the national question by bringing in all ethnic groups and with the consultation of all stakeholders in the mechanism of reconciliation,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
