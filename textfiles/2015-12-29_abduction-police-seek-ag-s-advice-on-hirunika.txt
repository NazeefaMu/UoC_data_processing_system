	Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said today the Attorney General’s advice would be sought on the action to be taken in connection with UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra’s involvement in the incident where a man was said to have been abducted and assaulted by some of her supporters.
	He said they would send the extracts of the investigation report on this matter.
	The man, who was abducted in his complaint to the police, said he was forcibly taken away in a Defender vehicle belonging to Ms. Premachandra.
	ASP Gunasekara said the police have also obtained a Court order directing mobile phone service providers to handover the records of the suspects’ telephone conversations to check whether they were in contact with Ms. Premachandra during the time of the alleged abduction.
