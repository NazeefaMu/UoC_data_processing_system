Muslim Ministers and MPs would be compelled to vote in favour of a No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in the event such a motion was brought if the Government was unable to control violence against Muslims in Kandy, Deputy Minister H. M. M. Harees told Parliament today.

"We will be compelled to vote in favour of a No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister-if such a motion is brought to Parliament- if he failed to visit the affected areas and resolve issues faced by the people in the troubled areas," the Deputy Minister said.

He questioned as to why the Government was unable to control unrest in one small area.

"Assaults and arson that is taking place in Kandy should be stopped forthwith," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
