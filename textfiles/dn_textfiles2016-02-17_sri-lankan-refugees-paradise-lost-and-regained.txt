For Sri Lankan refugees: Paradise lost and regained

“For the past 26 have years I lived as a refugee. Today I am a Citizen of Sri Lanka,” exclaims N. Sasirupan his eyes lighting up with joy.
Sasirupan who left his country along with his parents at the tender age of 06, remembers very little of the life he had lived before turning refugee.
According to him, the sense of belonging to one particular country, was important.
“I was happy when we left India. My parents brought us up with a feeling that we should return to our Motherland one day. I am so glad that I am here today.”
Despite being weary and hungry waiting for hours till their documents were processed by the UNHCR inside the airport, the refugees were excited to finally reach ‘home.’ For decades, they had lived as refugees in a foreign land and had finally managed to returned to their motherland. Sasirupan is one among the 40 Indian refugees who returned to Sri Lanka on February 9, with fresh hopes of leading a peaceful life in post-war Sir Lanka.
Awaiting clearance
More than 100,000 Tamil civilians fled to the sub-continent to escape fighting between government forces and the now defeated Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who had been fighting for an independent Tamil homeland since 1983.
Sasirupan grew up in India, pursuing his studies with the hope of becoming an IT Engineer. He gave up a job in a private company in India to return home, he says.
“I wanted to live my life with dignity. We were allowed to work, but priority was always given to Indians,” he said.
New beginnings with old roots
T. Nagaraja fled the country in 1990 fearing for his life. He has vivid memories of his life in the war torn island before he left. But he had been informed that the situation in Sri Lanka was much different at present.
“My relatives told me that I would witness a totally different Jaffna and I was so excited as it had been 26 years since I left the country,” he added.
He said that all who fled the country lived as refugees. “We were not given Indian citizenship and were branded as ‘refugees.’ We were not mistreated, but not recognised.”
“We were looked after by the Indian government. Children attended government schools. Freedom was limited, while restrictions were stern. The responsibilities of the caretakers were to provide us with food, water and shelter. However, we were able to find employment to manage family requirements,” Nagaraja said, explaining their life in Indian camps.
His family left the country to save their lives and Nagaraja wanted to protect his children, he said.
“We left the country leaving all our worldly possessions, but that feeling was different. We escaped from a death trap and now we are back with the hope of rebuilding our lives,” he emphasized.
Nagaraja had returned to the country with only one of his children, he says. “I will arrange every possible means and bring the rest of the family back to to Sri Lanka.”
He had no idea as to what happened to his house and his land, but is determined to push forward regardless of the obstacles, he said.
“This is my country and I will manage whatever comes my way. I always told my children when we were in India that this was not our country, when things are better we should leave and I am happy to be back today.”
Those who were left behind
Not all Sri Lankans living in India as refugees are confident as Nagaraja.
The children of K. Ramasamy from Mullaitivu, who are currently living in refugee camps are still not convinced that it would be safe for them to return.
Ramaswami’s daughter returned to the country two years ago, but he is still unable to convince his other children to return home. Instead, he decided to come back and spend the rest of his days with his daughter and his son-in-law.
“I am not in a stable position to convince them to live the rest of their lives in their own land. My daughter is married and she is living with her husband in Mannar. She returned 2 years ago. I will live the rest of my life with my daughter in my Motherland,” he said.
Gone blind due to a work related accident while working in a quarry in India, his intentions were to come back to live with his daughter.
According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) one of the main concerns for potential returnees is livelihood options in the home country.
“Many individuals are returning to their places of origin after 20+ years in refuge and their communities could be under developed. Access to adequate housing, water and sanitation, education, health and other facilities and services, in addition to viable options to earn a living, are some of the key deciding factors guiding the voluntary return of Sri Lakan refugees residing elsewhere”, explained a spokesperson for UNHCR.
Rebuilding their lives
“Will I get a government job here?” asked B. Selvarupan a Jaffna Tamil, returning to Sri Lanka for the first time in 26 years. He has a degree in Commerce from an Indian University, is now worried if he would get a job in Sri Lanka.
“I have not seen any of my relatives. I have no big expectations, I need a job so that I can build my own house and start a happy life in my own country” added Selvarupan.
An Engineer by profession, Y. Nisha is also looking for job opportunities as Selvarupan and Sasirupan with the hope that Sri Lanka would provide them with more opportunities.
Nisha had arrived with her brother to stay with her relatives in Mailaddy in Jaffna. She said that her parents would arrive in another 3 month's time after her sister’s College convocation.
“We did not lead a fearful life in India. They supported us during our education which we value the most. Life in India was not distressful, yet we missed our country very much. Though I had a rather bare knowledge of Sri Lanka since I left at the tender age of 6 years, I always felt that there was no better country like my own,” she uttered.
When the Sri Lankans living as refugees in India wanted to enter the job market after completing their studies, preference was always given to Indian students, while the Sri Lankan refugees were recruited for for jobs with a lower salary, Nisha claimed.
A father of three children, B. Madhivanan, suffered an added worry concerning school admission for his children.
Like a number of others, he returned to the country without even obtaining the leaving certificate from an Indian school in which the children were studying.
As the school demanded for the full annual fee to provide the leaving certificate, Madhivan was unable to pay such large sums and did not obtain the school leaving certificate, he says.
He is also aware that the country had undergone many changes after he left, yet he is longing to know whether his children would be accommodated to government schools.
He is at present worried that this would stand in the way of his children being admitted to Sri Lankan schools.
Yet, there is little regret in his voice. Happy that he had shed the refugee tag and exited that he would soon visit his native land, Madhivan is looking forward to a brighter future for him and his family.
“My children were born in Indian refugee camps, but still they belong to Sri Lanka.
“It was not very difficult living in India, yet my children need an identity of their own. Though life is only temporary, I do not wish my children to face the same fate that I did, ” he said.
UNHCR helped SL refugees return from South India since 2011
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) began assisting Sri Lankan refugees to return from Southern India since 2011. According to UNHCR, all refugee returnees who arrive in Sri Lanka through the UNHCR voluntary repatriation programme were assisted by facilitation of opening bank accounts via the Bank of Ceylon and providing them with a reintegration grant and monetized NFI assistance for the purchasing of household goods, seeds, or repairing damaged housing.
All returning refugees are also provided with a transport grant to help them make their own arrangements to travel from the Airport to their native place. Once they reach their homes, they are advised to meet with the UNHCR field staff, who would then register them for monitoring and referral purposes.
“Our field staff would assist them by making appropriate references to government and non-governmental organizations, enabling them to obtain various services, such as: civil documentation, health and education services and livelihood assistance in the places of return,” a spokesperson for UNHCR said. The UNHCR has been supporting the government of Sri Lanka with voluntary return of refugees since 1987.
UNHCR reiterates the return decision as one of voluntary nature and should be based on the most accurate and updated information concerning the conditions in the country of origin. UNHCR advocates for sustainable/durable solutions for all refugee and IDP returnees, they said. Stating that one of the main concerns of those returning to Sri Lanka is stated to be their options of livelihood further, said many individuals are returning to their places of origin after 20+ years in refugee camps and their communities could be under developed.
“Access to adequate housing, water and sanitation, education, health and other facilities and services, in addition to viable options to earn a living, are some of the key deciding factors guiding the voluntary return of Sri Lakan refugees residing elsewhere. UNHCR advocates on behalf of refugees and highlights challenges they face upon return to all related government bodies. Likewise, UNHCR shares information, survey findings and reports with relevant development partners and donors to enable reintegration of refugee return to happen in a sustainable manner.”
Asked whether UNHCR had taken measures to facilitate and expedite refugees return, they responded that UNHCR does not encourage or “promote” the return of refugees to Sri Lanka.
“Our current task is to ensure that Sri Lankan refugees abroad have up to date information about the situation of their areas of origin and to help them come home if and when they decide on a voluntary basis.
We call this “facilitated” voluntary repatriation. Some Sri Lankan refugees will choose not to repatriate now and their decisions should be respected,” they said.
