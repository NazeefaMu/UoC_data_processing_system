Govt. docs to update the Mahasangha Sabha on ETCA


	

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday it would update the Mahasangha Sabha of the Ramanna Nikaya on the proposed Indo-Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperation (ETCA) on an invitation to do so.

It said the Chief Incumbent of the Atamasthana would also have a discussion with the GMOA on matters connected to ETCA.

The GMOA told a media conference said they would conduct an awareness programme on the ‘cheap attempt’ being made by the government to sign the ETCA in October while concealing the true facts.

With President Maithripala Sirisena assuring he will to comply with the advice of the Mahasangha in governing the country and making nationally important decisions, the GMOA said it expected to urge the President through the Mahasangha on matters concerning ETCA.

The main issue which irks the GMOA is the government's approach towards ETCA in the absence of formulating a national policy on international trade pacts.

GMOA Media Spokesman Samantha Ananda said those who have been appointed to formulate a national policy were not following the standard procedure and trying to complete the task carelessly by the given deadline.

‘We have informed the President regarding the futile attempts made by a few officers to formulate the national policy for ETCA without a national policy. The officers have been identified as pro-Indians,’ Dr. Ananda said.(Piyumi Fonseka)
