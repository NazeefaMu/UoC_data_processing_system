	All-rounder Thisara Perera has retired from Test cricket after been constantly overlooked for the longer version but will continue to play limited over cricket.
	He had informed his employer, Sri Lanka Cricket in this regard in December, 2015.
	“I’ve retired from Test since December 2015,” Perera said. “I have been waiting for an opportunity for the last four years to don the white jersey for my country again, but I have been ignored constantly. So I thought it is best that I give up the longer version and concentrate on limited over cricket,” the 26-year-old cricketer said.
	Perera who made his Test debut against England in 2011, played his last Test match four years ago in 2012 against Pakistan in Pallekele. In his last match he scored 75 runs and picked up four wickets.  
	“On the other hand I am also nursing with a knee injury for a while and I do not think I can commit myself to bowl longer spells. So I thought this is the best time to give it up officially,” he added
	Perera said his retirement from Test cricket would give hope to other cricketers waiting in the queue. (CF)
