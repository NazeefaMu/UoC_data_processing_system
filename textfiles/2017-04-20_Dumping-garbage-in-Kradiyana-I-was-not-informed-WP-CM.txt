Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday said that he was not informed about the decision to temporarily dump garbage collected in Colombo at Karadiyana, after a section of Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed recently.

Chief Minister Devapriya told a media briefing that he was not able to withdraw the decision since it has been already approved and added that the Colombo Municipal Council was only permitted to dump garbage just for few days at Karadiyana.

“I was not informed of this decision by any related-party. But I am not concerned about it at this crucial juncture. It was reported that the residents of Karadiyana have also staged a protest yesterday against this move,” he said.

He said that the decision to dump garbage collected in Colombo at Karadinaya was a temporarily decision and added that the residents should not get tensed about it. He also said that the dumping of garbage at Karadiyana would be immediately halted in the coming days.

“This issue will not last for a long time. Each and every problem in this country will be solved exactly within two and half years,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said that the Municipal Councils should be provided with the ability to reject garbage which has not been separated by the people to recycle. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
