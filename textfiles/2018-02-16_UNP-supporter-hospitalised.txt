A supporter of the United National Party (UNP) has been hospitalised after he was injured during a clash allegedly taken place between the supporters of the UNP and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in Biyagama today.

Four supporters of the SLPP had been taken into custody by the Police in connection with the clash.

However, a newly elected member of a local government authority had reportedly forcibly taken away the four arrested SLPP supporters from the Police custody.

It was reported that two of the four SLPP supporters, who were released forcibly, had been arrested again by the Police following a demonstration held by the villagers against the clash demanding the immediate arrest of those supporters.

Meanwhile, Police said the clash had taken place in Sapugaskanda this evening and one person was hospitalised whereas two individuals were arrested over the incident.

“The residents of the area have gathered against the delay in the arrest of the parties to the incident and this incident is politically involved,” they said.
