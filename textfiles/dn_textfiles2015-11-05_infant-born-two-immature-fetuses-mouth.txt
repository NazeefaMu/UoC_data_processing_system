Infant born with two immature fetuses in mouth

Doctors attached to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital saved the life of an infant born with two immature fetuses in her mouth, hospital sources said.
According to the sources, the doctors had performed the surgery on the third day following her birth. She was born at Mahamodara Hospital. Her mother gave birth through cesarean section. The doctors made arrangements to feed her with milk with the assistance of a tube inserted to her stomach before performing the operation.
After conducting medical tests, the Medical Research Institute (MRI) scientists found that there are two immature fetuses inside the suspected tumor removed from the mouth of the infant, the sources said.
The doctors said the infant sucks milk without any problem and is in good health following the surgery.
