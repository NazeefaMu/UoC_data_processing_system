The students of South Asia’s biggest State Nautical Engineering University, the ‘Ocean University’ (OCU) have started boycotting lectures demanding recognition by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

Even though the Ocean University in Mattakkuliya does not have the UGC recognition it has claimed in its website and advertisements that it was a UGC recognized University, Daily Mirror learns.

The Ocean University formally known as the National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering (NIFNE) was established as a University in 2014 under Parliament Act No 31 of 2014 and had applied to UGC recognition last year. However, UGC has not granted the recognition as yet.

According to the web site of the OCU, it offers four degree programmes and a range of diplomas and certificate level courses and mobile programmes claiming that the university has the UGC approval.

“Ocean University has been recognized as a degree awarding university by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Sri Lanka and it has been given the authority to offer four degree programmes in the fields of Marine Science and Nautical Engineering,” the website said.

The University which is under the purview of the Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry is reportedly running with insufficient basic academic requirements and infrastructure facilities. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
