In the aftermath of the floods in Colombo, the Government has decided to relocate the families living in shanties, which are often found to obstruct canals in places such as Kolonnawa, Wellampitiya and Kotte in the Colombo District, officials said today.

The Land Reclamation Development Board (LRDB) has been tasked with the job of handling the relocation.

LRDB Chairman Asela Iddawela told Daily Mirror the decision was taken at a meeting with the stakeholders on Monday. He said 48 families living in Kolonnawa had to be relocated while steps were being taken to relocate the other families.

“It has been decided to prohibit all forms of land reclamation in the affected areas while permission granted to reclaim some of the lands will be cancelled,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Western Region Development and Megapolis Ministry is expected to submit a Cabinet paper to establish a mechanism to coordinate the work of the institutions in responding to natural disasters in future.(Kelum Bandara)
