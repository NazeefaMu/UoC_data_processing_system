Wish Upon a Butterfly

 
Ever wondered how you could tell someone in the best way possible about the magnificent, ethereal feeling that is bubbling in your heart which can be summed up into one simple word - love! Wonder no more. Go out into your garden, pack your love with care and send it to your beloved - on the wings of a butterfly.
If you can find one, though. For, scientists say butterflies are in grave danger of disappearing from planet earth if we do not take the necessary steps to give them the habitat they need to survive.
Imagine a world without butterflies. They are surely the epitome of natural beauty, their wings probably sprinkled with rainbow dust are the place where love and awe and inspiration meet. Not surprisingly, the ancient Greek name for butterflies was the same as their word for soul - 'psyche'. Yet, this could not have been just a chance association: the adult butterfly is, after all, a creature that transforms from lowly larval 'worm' into one of the most beautiful of all life forms.
The good news is it is quite easy to create a haven for these lovely winged creatures right in your garden. You may even find that you already grow the flowers that attract butterflies. With just a little more effort you could transfer your garden into a magical fairyland when the sun teases open the petals of flowers in the early morning and the butterflies flit from one newly opened flower, to another, whispering sweet secrets...
To get down to earth from these lofty thoughts, when deciding where to locate your butterfly garden, experts say it is best to choose a spot that is not isolated from other plants. Butterflies will be more likely to find your garden if there are other flowers nearby to lead them to your mini paradise. But if your butterfly garden is the only patch of flowers in a vast sea of grass, butterflies won't have much reason to be in the area. If you have a border of flowering shrubs and other butterfly-enticing plants are scattered around your yard, the butterflies are much more likely to spend time in your garden.

Even though beginning a butterfly garden can be as simple as choosing flowering plants that will invite adult butterflies to your garden to feed, if you want to create a garden that will act as a sanctuary, attracting a wide variety of butterflies while also providing a place where butterflies can grow and multiply, you will first need some simple planning. By considering which plants to grow and evaluating your garden site, you can plant a garden that will help with the creation processes of butterflies too.
The hitch here is, even though many flowering plants will attract butterflies to your location, not all flowers look attractive to the eyes of a butterfly. Still, selecting plants that will feed butterflies while also encouraging them to stick around for a while, laying eggs and creating a new generation of butterflies, can easily be done. To do this, you will need to choose plants that fall into two groups: nectar plants that will provide adult butterflies with energy and caterpillar food plants that will feed caterpillars. With careful selection from these two groups, your garden will provide for the entire life cycle of butterflies.
As most lepidopterists say, the relationship, however, between butterflies, caterpillars and the plants they use for food is not a casual one. It is a relationship created over thousands of years as flowering plants developed alongside insects. As a result of this long development, caterpillars will use only certain plants for food. At the same time, butterflies are equally picky about what plants they will select to lay their eggs on. In order to encourage caterpillars in the garden, butterfly gardeners need only select the plants that are preferred by caterpillars in their location. Nature and chemistry will take care of the rest.
According to Douglas B Ranasinghe, Former President, Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, "To establish butterfly gardens you should have a few Host plants, Nectar plants and land space. At the inception, it is recommended to plant 'Adana Hiriya' 'Wara' 'Aththora' 'Akkapana'',Kiri Aguna wel', as Host plants and 'Balunakuta', Shoe flower, Trdex, Zeeniyas, Ixora as Nectar Plants. A used earthen curd milk pot with mud, sunk to floor level and a container to hold some ripe fruits will be sufficient for a small garden."
Other plants you could grow to attract butterflies include Dehi , Bowitiya, Edaru, Kahabiliya, Mussenda, Eraminiya, as well as trees like guava, Ugurassa, Siyabala, mango, Karapincha and Kathurumurunga.
In addition to providing food for butterflies, your butterfly garden should also provide a resting place for your visitors. Include flat rocks in your garden where the butterflies can sun themselves. It is even better if the rocks have shallow depressions where water will puddle and provide a place for butterflies to gather for a drink.
Another important point to remember is not to use insecticides in your garden. Believe it or not, having many insects in your garden, is a good thing. About 97 percent of the insect world is beneficial to your garden. The good guys usually take care of the bad guys if you give them a chance, and don't just eradicate them because they are ugly. Always remember when you see a scary bug, it is not necessary to kill him. He may be a good guy who could get rid of a lot of bad guys!
Finally, when your garden is in order, remember to install a comfortable bench placed where you can sit and admire your beautiful surreal guests.
That's it for this week.
Let me leave you with this Irish Blessing. "May the wings of the butterfly kiss the sun/And find your shoulder to light on. To bring you luck, happiness and riches. Today, tomorrow and beyond."
