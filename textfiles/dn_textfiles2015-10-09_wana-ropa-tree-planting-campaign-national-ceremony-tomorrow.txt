Wana Ropa tree planting campaign national ceremony tomorrow

The national ceremony marking the Wana Ropa tree planting campaign launched this month, will be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Nava Devata reserve beside the Mahaweli Ganaga at Kothmale on October 11 at 10.00 a.m.
The five acre model forest established at this venue, will also be vested in the public on this day, stated a press release issued by the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry.
The release added that the contribution made by the tree planting programme to counter climate change, soil erosion and drought, had prompted it to launch the Wana Ropa tree planting campaign.
A series of workshops, soil conservation activities and other activities related to environment conservation, would also be held on provincial, district and divisional level with the participation of all ministries, Provincial Councils, departments, private sector and NGOs during this year's Wana Ropa programme.
