Voting rights urged for migrant workers

Members of the Ethera Api Organisation of the JVP urged the government to set up a mechanism to protect the rights of foreign employees including the voting right at elections. They handed over a set of proposals to the Speaker in relation to foreign employment, JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti said.
He was addressing media at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday.
Handunnetti added that there should be a mechanism for Sri Lankan expatriates including migrant workers to vote at national elections.
"Even though foreign employees bring the highest amount of foreign exchange to the country they are unable to vote at elections. Apart from giving voting right, the foreign employees should be given other benefits too," he said.
The JVP forwarded suggestions to the Speaker. The Speaker will appoint a select committee in this regard to look in to the issues and suggestions forwarded by the JVP, Handunnetti said.
He said around four million Sri Lankans are employed in foreign countries while another significant number of people leave the country for foreign employment annually.
"Therefore, the government should formulate a mechanism similar to postal voting to grant voting right to foreign employees."
He added that the Ethera Api Organisation requests the government to offer duty free vehicle permits to migrant workers or let them bring the vehicles used by them in those countries.
Handunnethi pointed out that foreign employees face difficulties when admitting their children to National and privileged schools since the parents are required to have their names in the voters register and to certify the place of residence.
"Since they are away from the country they do not have a chance to vote and fail to get their children qualify for admission to Grade One ," he said.
Handunnethi added that it is better to have a pension scheme for foreign employees, who have been serving long periods.
It has been reported that there are certain persons who have been working abroad for two to three decades, he said.
The MP said that certain countries maintain Social Benefit Funds similar to the Employees' Trust Fund here. However, these migrant workers are unable to get the benefit of the Social Benefit Fund since the government has not entered into an agreement with those countries, which maintains the Social Benefit Fund.
"For instance Cyprus is maintaining a Social Benefit Fund but Sri Lankan employees are unable to get the benefit of it since the government has not entered into an agreement.
Therefore, it is an urgent need to enter into this agreement with such countries jointly by the Foreign Employment Ministry and Foreign Affairs Ministry" he said. He added that the Sri Lankan government should introduce a minimum salary for each sector of foreign employment.
This will answer the problem of labour exploitation.
