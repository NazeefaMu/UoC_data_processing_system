Burning of Kenyan Elephant Tusks (Ivory) at Galle Face Green

It is with due respect and honour, I as a peace loving citizen of Sri Lanka presently living temporarily in Bremen City, Germany make an appeal to immediately stop the proposed burning of Kenyan elephant tusks by Sri Lanka Customs Department on 29.1.2016.
The reasons I place before you are as follows:
1. Sri Lanka is a country with majority Buddhist population who highly respect the elephants and Ivory in religious and national ceremony.
2. It is by burning tons of elephant tusks in a Bon Fire we are not achieving anything expect an air pollution and a curse to the nation.
3. Sri Lanka is proud of Kandyan Esala Perahera where good number of elephants take part to make the festival colourful and tourist attraction from foreigners.
4. Even the "Sacred Tooth Relic" is carried by the famous Tusker the so called "Rajah" - elephant to make the Esala Perahera most fascinating and glorious.
5. Elephants are well honoured animals for religious purposes and the burning of the tusks might bring an outbreak of elephant infectious diseases and many elephants might die in a country where the Ivory is treated as a waste product.
6. Usually customs banned contraband articles are sold in auction except drugs. Here in this case above mentioned tusks could be sold in international auction and lot of Foreign Exchange could be earned, a certain percentage could be given to customs as an incentive and the rest could be utilized for the Department of Wild Life, Dehiwela Zoological Gardens, Kandy Esala Perahera and on elephants welfare in Temples, Viharas and Dagobas.
7. Even the Supreme Deity "Ganadeviyo" is depicted as a symbol of elephant with tusk may abstain from offering the blessing to the nation.
I am unable to imagine as to how could be this suggestion came to the minds of Customs authorities. This idea would have been given by negative thinkers I suppose.
The same advice is given in Dhammapada as follows:
"Asevavanacha Bhalanang
Pandithanachcha Sevenang
Poojacha Poojaneyaanang
Ettam Mangala Uththanang"
