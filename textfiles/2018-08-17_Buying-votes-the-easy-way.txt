Buying votes, the easy way!


	



 

A certain State body taking a hand in providing shelter for the homeless has now embarked on a programme to distribute housing assistance to the peasants, who have fallen victim to the Chronic Kidney Disease.

 


The deserving people have already been asked to apply for the monetary assistance by perfecting a specific printed form, copies of which are to be obtained from the Divisional Secretariat of the area.
However, a Yahapalanaya heavyweight from the District is said to have taken over the bundle of application forms intended for the ‘Kandiya’ Division and distributing them even among his constituents, who are not affected by the disease with an eye on their votes, they say.


By the way, this politico said to be nursing a grudge against the female white-collar high for the ‘Kandiya’ Division had once kicked her office chair to give vent to his anger at her refusal to bend the rules to meet his unreasonable and unlawful demands, they say.
