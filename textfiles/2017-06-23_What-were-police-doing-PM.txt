Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has informed the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development to report back to him just how university students were able to climb four storeys into the Ministry of Health building without the police being able to stop them.

This came about after he was informed by several ministers that the police did nothing to stop the students protesting against SAITM from getting into the Health Ministry building and causing so much damage to equipment and vehicles belonging to the ministry thereafter.

The PM had also asked the authorities to send him a report on the total cost of the destruction caused as a result of this invasion into the Health Ministry by the protesting students. (Anjula Mahika Weeraratna)
