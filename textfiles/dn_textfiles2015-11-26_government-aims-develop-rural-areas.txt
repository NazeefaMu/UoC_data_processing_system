Government aims to develop rural areas

The aim of the new government is to develop rural areas, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare said.
He was speaking at the inauguration of a village development programme 'Sodurugamak-Navaugayak'.
The infrastructure of all villages in the district will be developed, with the necessary financial allocations to be provided in time, he said.
The minister said that development would result in the rural economy being both protected and promoted.
He drew attention to certain villages in Matale engaged in traditional methods of livelihood, and said the government would support them in preserving their tradition.
"Farmers are the backbone of the country," he said, "pioneers of the national food programme, and for that reason every possible development of agricultural production will occur". He also said the government planned to promote education in rural areas and would facilitate that soon.
"The government has launched a vast development program in the country", he said, drawing attention to the fact that it was the first time in history that the United National Party had collaborated with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to form a national government.
"It is a significant event," he said.
