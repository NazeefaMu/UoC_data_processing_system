How often have you opened a Fixed Deposit with a Bank or Financial Institution, while wondering if there is a better rate or more benefits being offered by other companies? Well, you don’t have to wonder anymore.

Fipbox is a website that provides all the collected information about Fixed Deposit rates, returns, and various benefits offered on the Fixed Deposit investments, by Banks and Financial Institutions in Sri Lanka. All the updated, current information is presented to you in an easy-to-understand format and you can decide where to open your Fixed Deposit after having seen all the information.

Fipbox is the online information portal, where you can find information and get in touch with the Banks and Financial Companies offering the Fixed Deposits, so that you can avoid filling in individual application forms. But your Fixed Deposit is made directly with – and processed by and held by – the Bank or Financial Company you select to make your deposit with.

With Fipbox (www.fipbox.com) on your desktop, you can make fast, efficient and informed decisions about where to open your Fixed Deposit within the range of Fixed Deposit investment options available. Fipbox is a centralized digital market that allows Financial Institutions to list their rates and Investors to easily access these potential Fixed Deposit options. 

This eliminates time wasted on phone calls and inquiries, where usually an investor needs to individually contact various Banks and financial institutions to obtain Fixed Deposit rates on offer at a given time. Often, individual investors don’t have the time to spend on gathering comprehensive information from all Banks and financial companies, and make their Fixed Deposit decision based on only the details they have found. But with Fipbox, now they can shop around for the best rates and deals for their Fixed Deposit.

By bringing everyone to a single marketplace, Fipbox has broadened the scope for both Financial Institutions and Investors. Fipbox allows Fixed Deposit issuers to reach out to more investors and the investors – whether corporate or individual investors - enjoy a hassle-free and larger pool of potential investment opportunities.

Fipbox also removes all the tedious paper work and form-filling that has to be done with each fixed deposit. With Fipbox, you only need to provide your complete information once, and that information is stored securely and used with every investment option you make through Fipbox. As a registered investor, you can also track yourFixed Deposits from end-to-end including maturities, re-investments and other aspects of your investment.

The Fipbox platform was created and launched in February 2018 by Fipbox (Pvt) Ltd, a financial technology company that is committed to creating technology tools to develop and enhance financial services. Fipbox is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Capital Alliance Group, a leading financial services company in Sri Lanka.
