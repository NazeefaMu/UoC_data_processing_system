Parliament has set aside October 20 and 21 to debate the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution and the report on alleged violation of human rights in Sri Lanka.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government would also table the Reports of the Udulagama and Paranagama Commissions at the beginning of the debate.
He admitted to a delay in printing the Sinhala and Tamil copies of the reports but assured these would be ready by next week. (Yohan Perera)
