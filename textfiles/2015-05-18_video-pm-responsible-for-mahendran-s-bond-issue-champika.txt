Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe must take the responsibility for the controversial sale of Central Bank Bonds as long as Arjuna Mahendran holds the post of CB Governor, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said the Anti-Corruption Committee headed by the Prime Minister was biased when it came to several incidents including the Bond sales, the floating armoury, Avant Garde and RADA.
“The ministers including me and Minister Rajitha Senaratne opposed the appointment of Mr. Mahendran but the Prime Minister said it was one of his decisions and he will handle it,” the minister said.
He said the United National Party (UNP) alone could not have helped President Maithripala Sirisena to win the presidency if not for the support of the JHU.
“But today the UNP behaves as if this is a UNP government,” he said. (LSP)
