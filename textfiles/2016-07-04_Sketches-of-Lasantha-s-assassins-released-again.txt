The Police Headquarters today released sketches of two suspects in connection with the murder of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunga. This was the second time that the police released sketches of the suspects over the murder and sought public help to nab the suspects.

Accordingly, one suspect was a stockily-built man of about 35 years, 5.8' tall with wide brown eyes. The second suspect was about 45 years old, 5,10' with a dark complexion. Police said the sketches were dawn by a sketch artist based on descriptions given by eyewitnesses at the scene of the crime. Information on the suspects could be given to 0718 591 753, 0718 591 770 or faxed to 0112 440158, 0112 380 380.

Wickremetunga was shot in the head at Attidiya, Dehiwala on January 8, 2009, by two gunmen who came in a motorcycle.

On February 18, this year the Police department requested the public assistance to trace the suspects.
