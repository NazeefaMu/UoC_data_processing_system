Minister for Law and Order John Amarathunga in reply to a question posed by a journalist at a media briefing  held today at the BMICH said Kumar Gunarathnam is  holding an expired visa and continuing to remain in Sri Lanka in hiding, therefore it is better for him to leave the country, and return back lawfully.
Mr. Amarathunga said, “ We placed Kumar Gunerathnam’s matter  before the Controller.  A report had also been submitted after an investigation.  According to this report they had stated that they are unable to adhere to the demands made by Gunerathnam. There are issues despite Gunarathanam  holding several Passports”.
“If these issues are resolved by him, we are ready to do something. We have no personal grudge against him”, he said. (Sanath Desmond)
