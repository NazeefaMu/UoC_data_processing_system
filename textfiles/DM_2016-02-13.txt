Claims by MR on UNHRC baseless: Ruwan
	
State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene refuted claims made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that the UNHRC resolution would make provision to arrest Sri Lankan military forces personnel and that the government was also assisting the UNHRC to achieve this.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and members of the joint opposition say we are assisting the UNHRC to arrest our armed forces personnel, which is a complete lie. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein also said there wont be such moves and Sri Lanka has the total responsibility to take action, the State Minister told the media in Biyagama.
He said both the President and the Prime Minister have pledged to protect armed forces personnel and not to allow National Security to be compromised. We will keep that promise. We dont need to create issues for solders and jail them, he said.
He said the government wanted to ensure the National Security and develop the country. The Minister said the joint opposition has no future and was creating fabrications when it cant find any fault of the government.

IMF audit on MR projects
	
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will visit Sri Lanka next week for a joint Forensic Audit with the Central Bank to check on the rationale behind the development projects worth US$250 billion launched by the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime just before the 2015 presidential elections, a senior cabinet minister said yesterday.
Minister Sarath Amunugama told the media the consensual government was in a dilemma as to how capital investment could be raised for those development projects because the previous regime had started these projects without a single rupee being allocated either from the Treasury or the Budget.
The entire programme amounting to billions of rupees just before the presidential election was a gimmick to hoodwink voters. The consensual government is trying hard to find investors for those massive development projects and it will take a minimum of five years to complete the job, he said.
The minister warned of an economic crisis in the West especially in the EU countries consequent to the Middle East crisis. It will affect Sri Lanka badly and we must adjust our economic fundamentals to meet this threat. That is why we will have to apply for a standby arrangement on one billion US$ from the IMF.
This is the first time, the consensual government is seeking financial assistance from a global lending agency. The last SBA was approved by the IMF on July 24, 2009 for US$ 2.56 billion or 400 per cent of Sri Lankas quota. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

SL willing for int'l probe on war crimes: Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday made it clear that his government was not averse to international participation in investigating the alleged war crimes in his country, but said "final judgment will be made by the internal judicial system."
Wickremesinghe who was in Guruvayur to offer prayers at the famous Sree Krishna Temple made these observations while talking to reporters.
The Sri Lankan prime minister said representatives of the neighbouring countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan as well as that of the US and human rights organisations can participate in the discussions on the war crimes in Sri Lanka.
He said Sri Lanka wanted to ensure that those responsible to the death of the civilians whether they were military personnel or the organizations like the LTTE, adding, a UN investigation had earlier said it was possible up to 40,000 people had been killed in the final five months alone.
"It was not clear how many of them were killed by the (Lankan) army or whether the LTTE had moved the people to the war zones which led to the death of some of them. We may not have the full expertise to identify the exact factors that led to those casualties. So international participation is welcome for determining such causes," the Sri Lankan prime minister said.
"But the right to make the final judgment that was responsible for the deaths and on the nature of punishment should rest with the judicial system of Sri Lanka. The judicial system in Sri Lanka was in shambles earlier, but now it is returning to normal. The sovereignty of each country must be respected in such issues," he added.
Replying to questions, he said civil war-ravaged economy of Sri Lanka is limping back to normal. But the economic crisis being faced by several countries in the backdrop of the falling oil process is affecting Sri Lanka as well.
Wickremesinghe was accompanied by his wife Maitree Wickremasinghe. They also offered prayers at the neighbouring Mammiyur temple as well.
Elaborate security arrangements were been made in connection with his visit. About 1,000 policemen have been deployed for providing security cover to the visiting VIP.
He is expected to fly back to Sri Lanka from Cochin by about 4pm on Friday.(Times of India)

SL working with local and international stakeholders:Envoy
	
Ambassador for Sri Lanka to United States Prasad Kariyawasam said the Government was working with all stakeholders in the country and the international community to establish mechanisms for truth-seeking, justice, and reparations to give solace to all those who suffered during the armed conflict.
Mr. Kariyawasam addressing a gathering at the East-West Center in Hawaii said the new unity Government comprising of the two main political parties in the country, led by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was promoting rehabilitation and reconstruction in areas affected by the recent conflict.
Sri Lanka has bolstered its age-old democracy by firmly re-establishing the independence of the judiciary, combating corruption, and allowing a free and vibrant media to flourish, he said.
The Ambassador Kariyawasam said the government would soon embark on drafting a new constitution which would address the requirements of a modern, progressive nation with provisions aimed at addressing the grievances of all communities living in the Island and promote social justice.
He said these initiatives had progressed remarkably well and in fact, after 43 years, a US State Secretary visited Sri Lanka last May.
