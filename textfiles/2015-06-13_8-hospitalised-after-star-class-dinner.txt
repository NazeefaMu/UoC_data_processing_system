At least eight people were hospitalised last night after they fell ill following a dinner party held in the Oak room at Cinnamon Grand Hotel in Colombo organised by the Sri Lanka UK society to celebrate British Queen’s birth day, informed sources said.
The sources said they had obtained beverages, liquor and starters from outside and that a mushroom starter may have lead to a food poisoning.
When contacted Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, he said they were admitted to two private Hospitals and were out of danger and that some of them had left the hospital after treatment.
ASP Gunasekara said food samples and samples of liquor used in the function were taken by the Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) to be sent to the Government Annalist.
He said police together with the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) were investigating into the incident.
