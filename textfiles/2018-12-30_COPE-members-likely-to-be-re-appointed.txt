The existing members of Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) are likely to be re-appointed with JVP parliamentarian Sunil Handunetty as its Chairman, informed sources said.

Also it was reported that there could be a few changes to Committee on Public Accounts (COPA).

It was reported earlier that both COPE , COPA and Petitions’ Committee would have to be re-appointed after the prorogation of Parliament in October this year. The House was reconvened on November 14 this year.
