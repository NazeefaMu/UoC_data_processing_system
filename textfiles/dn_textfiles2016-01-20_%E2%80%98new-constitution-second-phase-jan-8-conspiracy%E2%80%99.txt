‘New constitution, second phase of Jan. 8 conspiracy’

The enactment of a new constitution is the second phase of the January 8 conspiracy of the present government, Federation of National Organisation (FNO) chairman Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera said yesterday.
Addressing a media conference at Abhayaramaya in Narahenpita, Dr. Amarasekara said the enactment of a new constitution is not an urgent need of the country, but the present government is trying to fulfill the needs of the west.
He said the anti-Sri Lankan west do not want to change the country’s electoral system or to abolish the executive presidency. “It only wants to form a separate state in the North and East,” Dr. Amarasekera said.
FNO Co-chairman Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera said the prevailing constitution is a very powerful constitution which consists all requirements of the country except the 13th amendment. The present government is trying to make the 13th amendment more powerful and remove the 6th amendment to the constitution which is very important to the country, he said.
“By enacting a new constitution, the government is trying to fulfill the requirements of USA, UK, UN and the UNHRC,” the thera said FNO General Secretary Wasantha Bandara also spoke.
