He put his foot into mouth again!


	



 

There are still one or two guys from the Group 16 now downsized to 15, maintaining a shuttle-liaison between the Pohottuwa and the Maithri-faction, they say.

 


Of these two-timers, the most conspicuous one is the gabby one from central hills who was called a ‘vote machine’ in his heyday, but now at Diyawanna thanks to the charity list.


He recently stirred a hornets’ nest by submitting a proposal to the Blue party central committee that the incumbent Number One be nominated as the party candidate at the coming big poll with the explicit understanding that the former strongman would be his Number Two.


Several JO stalwarts who had reacted with anger to this proposal had lashed out at the gabby one from hills and warned him to stop playing the double game.


The gabby one who got highly disconcerted by the unexpected angry reaction from the JO faction had increased his courtesy calls on the former strongman by way of making amends, they say.


He had even invited the former boss to a public function in his constituency as a damage control measure.
