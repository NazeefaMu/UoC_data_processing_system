Heavy showers above 75mm could be expected in some places, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts, Meteorology Department said today.

It said the low level atmospheric disturbance was now located to the South of Sri Lanka, and as a result, showers or thundershowers would occur over most provinces of the island after 2.00 p.m.

According to Weather Forecast Report issued at 4pm, showers or thundershowers will occur in the Southern, Eastern and Uva provinces in the morning as well.

“Cloudy skies could be expected in the Southern half of the island while misty conditions could be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces during the morning,” it said.

It also said that there could be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers, hence,  the public was requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightnings. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
