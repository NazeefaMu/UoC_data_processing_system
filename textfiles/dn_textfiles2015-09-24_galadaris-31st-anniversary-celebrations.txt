Galadari's 31st Anniversary celebrations

The Galadari Hotel is readying to celebrate its 31st anniversary in grand style on October 6. Backed by over 3 decades of expertise in the hospitality industry the Galadari brand name has become well known locally as well as internationally.

The hotel stands out for its friendly hospitality and high quality food and service which have become its key strengths over the years. Known among many for its attention to detail and flexibility the Galadari Hotel stands tall as a force to be reckoned within the industry.
The month of October therefore has high significance to the hotel and to commemorate its anniversary a special multi-religious service will be held for the staff on October 6. The hotel also has many anniversary inspired promotions taking place which include the special Anniversary Cake being offered at the Café 64, the Anniversary Countdown Dinner taking place at the Coffee Shop from October 1 to the 5, the Anniversary High Tea at the Lobby Bar on the 4, Anniversary Lunch & Dinner at the Coffee Shop on the 6 and the Anniversary Dinner Set Menu at the California Grill.
The hotel invites all to come and join its anniversary cheer in style and be a part of this very special celebration.
