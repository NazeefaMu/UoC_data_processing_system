Being liberal with the public purse!


	



 

There is the main city council that runs a monthly bill of over Rs. 1 million for outsourcing air-conditioning its assembly hall as well as providing audio amplifiers and chairs for it on the occasion of its monthly sittings, they say.

 


These services have been outsourced to a company having close ties to a very high political authority.


Meanwhile, a move to hire amplifiers for the sittings of the council’s 20 Standing Committees at a cost of Rs. 40,000 a day has been called off following strong protests made by some members. The contract for this purpose too had been awarded to a close kinsman of a high political authority.
