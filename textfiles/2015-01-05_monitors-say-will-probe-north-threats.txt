The Team Leader of the monitors from AAEA Dr. Shahabuddin Yaquoob told the briefing that they have received several complaints on the North but they will have to determine the accuracy once they visit the area. “We will have to take action based on our observances when we visit the North,” Dr. Yaquoob said responding to a question raised by the journalists.
