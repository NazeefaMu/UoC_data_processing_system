Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s wife Shiranthi has been asked to report to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PRECIFAC) tomorrow to obtain a statement on an order made by her to the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) directing it to allocate a house to one of her media officers at a valuation far below the market value.

The estimated value of the house in Kahathuduwa is Rs.5.5 million but it had been grossly undervalued at Rs.500, 000.
