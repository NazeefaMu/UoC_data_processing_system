Motorcyclists requested to wear black arm-bands to protest minimum penalty


	

The Ceylon Motorcyclists’ Association yesterday requested all motorcyclists to wear a black arm-band from tomorrow to protest against the minimum penalty of Rs.2,500 for traffic offences as proposed in the 2017 Budget.

While criticizing the budget proposal, the association said that the move will badly effect the low-income earners who are forced to ride motorcycles to their work-places and pointed out that the fine itself is higher than the monthly petrol expenses of some motorcycle riders.

It also said the move to increase fines would encourage motorists to offer bribes to the traffic police and thereby defeat the purpose it was meant for.

Therefore, the association requested the government to re-consider the implementation of the minimum penalty of Rs.2,500 for traffic offences.
