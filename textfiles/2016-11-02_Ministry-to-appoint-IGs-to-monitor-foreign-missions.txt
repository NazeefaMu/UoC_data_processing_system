The Foreign Affairs Ministry has sought to appoint Inspectors' General (IGs) to monitor the work of Sri Lanka’s missions abroad and report on the progress.

Minister Mangala Samaraweera, in his Cabinet paper on this matter, says a committee to study and report on the rationalization of Sri Lanka’s diplomatic and consular representations abroad has been appointed.

According to recommendations of this committee, a decision has been taken to appoint Inspectors' General.

Three retired Foreign Service officers – C.D. Casie Chetty. G. Wijesiri and Geetha de Silva -- are to be appointed to the new posts. There will be no additional financial commitments such as salaries and allowances other than the payment of travelling expenses on the rates applicable to foreign travel of government officers.
