FR against UPFA national list fixed for support

A Fundamental Rights violation petition filed by former Parliamentarian Somaweera Chandrasiri challenging the UPFA National List appointments to Parliament was yesterday fixed for support by the Supreme Court. The petition is to be taken up again on October 16.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Chandra Ekanayake, Priyantha Jayawardena and Upali Abeyratne, the counsel who appeared for a respondent in the petition moved for a date citing that his senior counsel was not present before Court.
The petitioner Somaweera Chandrasiri who is also functioning as Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Vice Chairman cited Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, UPFA General Secretary Prof. Vishwa Warnapala, its former General Secretary Susil Premajantha, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
The petitioner states that the UPFA is an alliance of five political parties (MEP, DVJP, SLMP, SLFP and EPDP) and that the very inception the said Alliance was functioning in a transparent and democratic manner and all the decisions were taken and all appointments were made with the consensus of all constituent parties.
The petitioner stated that Susil Premajayantha in his capacity as the Secretary of the said Alliance submitted a list of names including the petitioner's for the national list.
He alleged that Prof. Warnapala was subsequently appointed as the UPFA General Secretary by the incumbent President without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
Chandrasiri said Prof. Warnapala later submitted another set of names for the National List with some persons who were defeated at the elections and thereby constitutionally rejected and refused by the people as unqualified to be Members of Parliament.
He is seeking for a declaration that he is entitled to be nominated as qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament submitted according to the first list.
He is also seeking the Court to cancel and or quash the declaration made by the Elections Commissioner to the effect that persons in the second list are qualified to be elected as Members of Parliament.
