An early disappointment for a crossover


	


	
	This one is a great pal of the new Minister in charge of high flying activity at the ‘state’ level.

The other day this pal called at the head office of an institution coming under the Ministry and made it known to all and sundry that he would be shortly taking up duties as their new boss.
The would-be new boss soon after was deluged with congratulatory messages from friends and well-wishers.  
Two days later another person – a respected leading figure in the corporate sector – appointed by the Minister at the Cabinet level in charge of the same subject assumed duties as the head of this establishment.  
Greatly chagrined by this unexpected move by the one above him, the Minister at the ‘State’ level had sent in his resignation. But it has not been accepted, they say.
