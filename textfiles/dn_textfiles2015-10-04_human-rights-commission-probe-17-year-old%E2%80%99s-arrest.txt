Human Rights Commission to probe 17-year-old’s arrest

The Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) will commence an investigation pertaining to the arrest of the 17-year-old student over the murder of Seya Sadewmi in Kotadeniyawa.
Sources said the boy is likely to appear before the SLHRC today to make a complaint on the alleged assault by the Police after he was arrested.
The All Ceylon Teachers’ Union also lodged a complaint at the Commission last week over the arrest of the schoolboy without proper evidence.
Speaking to the Daily News, Attorney-at-Law and former Human Rights Commissioner Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said the boy could lodge a complaint at the Commission if he had been subjected to torture while in Police custody.
He said once the application is submitted by the boy or his parent, the Commission would see whether the fundamental rights of the boy had been violated in this instance.
“Articles 10-14 in Chapter 3 of the Constitution apply to this matter. The Commission will then decide to call both parties and conduct an investigation if there is sufficient evidence. The boy was in hospital till Saturday and he can use his medical reports when lodging the complaint,” Mahanamahewa said.The Inspector General of Police had also instructed to carry out an extensive investigation into the alleged assault by the Police on the boy and another arrested over the murder of the girl.
The duo were admitted to the Gampaha General Hospital following their release last week.

The IGP instructed Kotadeniyawa Police to prove whether there had been sufficient evidence to arrest the 17-year-old boy and the other individual in connection with the murder of a five-year-old girl in Kotadeniyawa.
The two individuals who were recently arrested were allegedly subjected to various harassment by Police.
The Police had recorded statements from about 25 persons including the main suspect’s brother in connection with the crime.
However no one was arrested. The IGP had asked for explanations as to why the two individuals were taken in to police custody.
The IGP had also instructed Kotadeniyawa Police to send a reply in this connection within the next two days and submit the final report by October 7.
