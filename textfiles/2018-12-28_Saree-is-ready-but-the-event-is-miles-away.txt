Saree is ready, but the event is miles away


	



 

The better half of a former purohita is said to have raised merry hell at home when she received a wrong saree instead of the designer saree of her choice ordered from an online supply service the other day.

 


The fair one had ordered the special saree to wear to the ceremony where her husband was to be sworn in again as a purohita.


The lady had later given the saree which was not to her liking to her house maid and purchased an expensive one locally to wear on the special occasion. 


However, despite the wife being ready with an elegant saree, the husband is yet to receive an invitation to the swearing-in they are looking forward to, they say.
