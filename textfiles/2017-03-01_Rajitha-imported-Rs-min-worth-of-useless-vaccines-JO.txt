Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has committed a crime by importing Rs.1, 500 million worth of vaccinations which are detrimental to cancer patients putting their lives at risk, the joint opposition said today.

It said the vaccinations had been imported by violating tender procedures.
The JO said the vaccine Taxacad known as Hearticad in Sri Lanka was a product of Russian-based BIOCAD Biotechnology Company and that the vaccinations had rejected by the Sri Lanka College of Oncologists (SLCO).

“This product has been rejected as it is not in common use in other countries and known to be detrimental to cancer patients. This medicine has only been introduced recently and needs more tests to be carried out before being released to the market,” JO MP Ranjith de Zoysa told a news briefing.

After the news briefing, the JO lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission against the Health Minister over the alleged misappropriation.

This was the ninth complaint made by the JO under its ‘Top Ten Yahapalana Mega thieves’ investigation programme. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
