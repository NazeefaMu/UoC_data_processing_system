The government will focus on reviving the local film industry from its present state, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.

Speaking at a function held to mark the 97th birthday of popular film personality Dr. Lester James Peiris at his residence, the Prime Minister said what had become of the local film industry today is an issue that should be looked into.

“ Dr Peiris pioneered the development of the local film industry through his great work such as Rekava and Gam Peraliya but the issue today is to determine what had become of the local film industry,” the Prime Minister said while assuring that the government will work towards reviving the industry.

“ I still remember my mother advising me to go and see Rekawa which was shown at the Regal Cinema in Colombo in order to look at my aunty Ms. Irangani Serasinghe’s acting. Today she has stopped acting and I am continuing it,” he said in a lighter vein.

Paying a glowing tribute to Dr. Peiris he said the latter had rendered a yeomen service to the local arts just like number of others such as Ediriweera Sarathchandra and George Keyt and many others.
He said the film Rekawa completes 60 years since its screening this year and a grand function will be held to mark the event.

Dr. Peiris in his very brief address thanked everyone who wished him well.

A book titled Lester Sri Lanka and Cinema written by Ajith Gallapaththi was launched to mark the occasion. (Yohan Perera)
