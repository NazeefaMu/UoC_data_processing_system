There may be strong winds and heavy rains during the next few days because of an atmospheric disturbance developing in the Bay of Bengal, the Disaster Mangement Centre (DMC) said today.

It said that seas stretching from the Bay of Bengal to the North-East of the Island would be very rough at times with the wind speeds increasing up to 70 to 80 kmph.

“Strong gusty winds can be expected over the country particularly in the Central hills, Northern, North-Central, Eastern & North-Western Provinces, the Hambantota district and the surrounding sea areas. Several spells of showers will occur in Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa, North-Western Provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts. A few showers may also occur in Anuradhapura, Jaffna and Mannar districts,” the DMC said.

It said risks of landslide still remained in the Ratnapura district and that some 300 people belonging to 90 families have been evacuated from disaster prone areas. (Yohan Perera)
