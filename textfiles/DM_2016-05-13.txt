The National Freedom Front (NFF) said yesterday that FCIDs arrest of former Minister Basil Rajapaksa was a planned action of the government and the JVP which supported it indirectly.
NFF leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said in a statement that the unofficial website of the JVP carried a news item beforehand saying that a member of the Rajapaksa family was to be arrested.
Mr. Weerawansa said the arrest was made to divert the peoples mounting protest against the government because of its anti-people actions.
A huge protest is directed towards the government for its anti-peoples actions such as illegal increase of the Vat and NBT, governments alleged plan to release LTTE terrorists who were under arrest by removing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and continuous postponement of the Local Government Elections. We believe that Mr. Rajapaksa was arrested to divert mounting protests against the government, Mr. Weerawansa said in the statement.
He said they strongly condemned the suppression of the government by using the FCID, the governments hunting device to hunt down opposition politicians. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Indias help sought to tackle drugs problem in Jaffna
	
In a recent meeting with a former Indian diplomat, leaders of fishermen from Jaffna raised the issue of the easy availability of drugs in the region, and sought Indias help to tackle the problem.
Attributing the availability of illicit substances to the growing instances of crime, Jaffna District Fishermens Federations president Naganathy Ponnambalam said drug trafficking, especially the smuggling of Kerala ganja, a prohibited substance, had gone up in recent times. Not just some, the entire quantity of banned substances comes from India.
The Jaffna youth, many of whom are now unemployed, have became easy victims of the drugs which are available in plenty, he said. Alcoholism too is rampant.
The meeting was indented to be a back channel communication effort between India and leaders of fishermen societies in the Northern Province. Residents of Vavuniya, another important town in the North, complained that ganja is being sold even in micro retail shops and minor children are engaged in selling such substance.
If the problem has to be tackled effectively, the cooperation of the Indian government is a must. This was what I conveyed to the former diplomat G. Parthasarathy, said Mr. Ponnambalam, seeking a joint patrolling by the two countries Navies or Coast Guards.
Mr. Ponnambalam acknowledged that the former diplomats visit was in his private capacity even though Mr. Parthasarathy, also a director of the India-Sri Lanka Foundation, told him and others that he would try to convey their problems to the Indian authorities.
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray has also emphasised the need for enlisting the support of the Indian government.
Explaining reasons for the trend, Mr. Cooray said that apart from the livelihood dimension, another factor was that the youth can get money easily as many of them are dependent on inward remittances.
Mr. Cooray is also of the view that after Maithripala Sirisena became President in January last year, freedom, democracy and openness, all of which are in full flow, are enabling various social issues of the North to get highlighted in the media.
However, Noor Mohamed Alam, president of the Mannar District Fishermens Cooperative Society Union, says India alone is not to be blamed. The primary responsibility lies on us, he feels. (The Hindu)

JO calls for interim budget from Govt.
	
The joint opposition yesterday urged the government to present an interim budget in the Parliament as the original budget proposals approved by the House earlier have been now negated after the tax revision.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition leader MP Dinesh Gunewardena said they had sent a written request to the President and the Prime Minister by including particulars on the 2016 budget and the recent Value Added Tax (VAT) increment due to the conditions implemented by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The government has requested for a loan from the IMF without the approval of the House. The public have been burdened with unbearable taxes with the loan taken from the IMF. Especially the minor and medium staged business entrepreneurs have been burdened with these taxes. The government has still not represented the agreement with the IMF to the house, he added.
MP Gunawardena said such misuse of parliamentary powers was a violation of the Constitution. He also said the Prime Minister had once stated that there would be a need of an interim budget during the preliminary discussions.
The government implements taxes on people which have not been approved by the House and which were not mentioned in the budget. There are also many alterations in the budget which affected many sectors of this country, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

No bathroom breaks: US factory workers wear diapers
	
Poultry workers in the US are routinely denied bathroom breaks to the point of being forced to wear diapers while on the production line, AFP reported.
The vast majority of 250,000 workers in the sector are mocked, ignored or threatened with being fired when they ask to go to the bathroom, Oxfam America said in the study.
Workers struggle to cope with this denial of a basic human need. They urinate and defecate while standing on the line; they wear diapers to work, said the report, released this week.
The US arm of the global anti-poverty charity added that workers would take on dangerously low levels of liquids, enduring pain and discomfort while risking serious health problems.
The group quoted anonymous workers at Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Pilgrims Pride and Sanderson Farms, which between them have 100,000 workers and account for 60 percent of the sector.
Tyson, one of the biggest poultry firms in the world, said in a statement it would not tolerate the denial of requests to use the bathroom in its factories.
Were concerned about these anonymous claims and while we currently have no evidence theyre true, are checking to make sure our position on restroom breaks is being followed, it said.
Oxfam cites a survey of 266 workers in Alabama conducted by the anti-discrimination Southern Poverty Law Center which said nearly 80 percent said they are not allowed to take bathroom breaks when needed.
A recent survey in Minnesota revealed that 86 percent of workers interviewed said they get fewer than two bathroom breaks in a week, Oxfam added.
The charity added that the few employees who say they are allowed to relieve themselves whenever they wish work in plants that are unionised, around one third of the total.
Supervisors deny workers permission to leave the production line because they are under intense pressure to keep up with production or meet daily quotas, the report said.
Workers were waiting an hour or more and then racing across vast, often slippery workshop floors to accomplish the task quickly enough to avoid being disciplined, Oxfam added.
While the poultry industry today enjoys record profits and pumps out billions of chickens, the reality of life inside the processing plant remains grim and dangerous, the report went on.
Workers earn low wages, suffer elevated rates of injury and illness, toil in difficult conditions, and have little voice in the workplace.
Oxfam called on the companies to deploy floating workers to step in temporarily when employees needed to leave the line, ensuring production would not be halted.
Tyson Foods says it has met with Oxfam and has already complied with the request. Perdue, Sanderson and Pilgrims were not immediately available for comment.

UK moves to speed up assets recovery for Sri Lanka, others
	
The Global Forum for Asset Recovery will bring together governments and law enforcement agencies to discuss returning assets to Nigeria, Ukraine, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, the BBC reported on Thursday.
The meeting will be held in the US next year, co-hosted with the UK, and supported by the UN and the World Bank.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron made the announcement at a global anti-corruption summit in London on Thursday.
It was being hailed as the first of its kind, bringing together governments, business and other organisations.
There has been concern recently that the UK, particularly London, had become a place where rich foreigners could buy properties but hide their true ownership.
Mr. Cameron said that to stop that, foreign firms which own property in the UK must declare their assets in a public register.
Downing Street said Mr. Cameron's plans would include those who already owned UK property as well as those seeking to buy it.
It said the register would mean "corrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London's property market, and will not benefit from our public funds".
It said foreign companies owned about 100,000 properties in England and Wales and that more than 44,000 of these were in London.
Five other countries including France, Kenya, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Afghanistan have also pledged to launch public registers of true company ownership. Australia, New Zealand, Jordan, Indonesia, Ireland and Georgia announced initial steps towards similar arrangements.
