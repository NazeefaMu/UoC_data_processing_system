In a bid to ensure army personnel were following regulations relating to the use of social media, the Army Commander appointed a team to monitor Army personnel on their social media platforms, the Army said.

They said the Army Commander appointed members from the Signal Corps for the team which will monitor social media platforms. Disciplinary action is to be taken against soldiers who have violated the guidelines set out by the military.

Army personnel had been previously given regulations to follow when using social media platforms over the years.

Regulations introduced over the years, state that information relating to national security, remarks and opinions about politicians and public officials, anything which could create racial or religious disharmony and commenting on such posts, revealing military ranks and identification information, photos in uniforms and military armaments in the background cannot be posted on media platforms.  

“Since it was noted that some army personnel are not following the regulations, I decided to appoint the committee,” Army Commander Lieutenant Mahesh Senanayake said.
