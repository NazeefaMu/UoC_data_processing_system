Late Mr. Kandiah Pathmanathan Easwaranathan hails from Karainagar Jaffna. He did his schooling at Royal College, Colombo. Having completed his schooling at Colombo Royal his ambition was to join the banking industry.   


He was very keen on joining Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC and he applied to Commercial Bank and did well in the interviews. Without any influence he joined the Bank in December 1982.   


His first appointment was at the Head Office where he gained experience in all sectors of banking during his initial tenure of 6 years from 1982 to 1988.   


In 1988 he was transferred to the Wellawatte branch. There were only two State Banks and two Private Banks at Wellawatte, when he assumed duties. 

 


During his tenure of 11 years at Wellawatte from 1988 to 1999, he was able to work efficiently in all areas with the experience he gained at the Head Office. 
He was very cordial and friendly with the customers and guided the junior staff whenever they needed help 


 


However now there are 18 banks alone as well as other finance companies, foreign currency exchange offices, pawning centres, etc. amounting to 20 outlets, thus totaling 38 units. 

 
During his tenure of 11 years at Wellawatte from 1988 to 1999, he was able to work efficiently in all areas with the experience he gained at the Head Office. He was very cordial and friendly with the customers and guided the junior staff whenever they needed help.   


Then in 1999 he was transferred back from Welawatte branch to Corporate Branch of Commercial Bank. There he was able to gain more experience in areas he had not worked earlier and he also worked as Manager in some Divisions in the Corporate Branch. 


He worked there from 1999 to 2011 again for another 11 years and then he was transferred back to Wellawatte Branch in the capacity of Senior Manager in 2011.   
When he took office as Senior Manager at Commercial Bank, Wellawatte, the customers and the staff were very happy with his return and the business flourished. He was the only person as a Senior Manager amongst the other Senior Managers who held office, to have this special rapport with both customers as well as staff and it was during his period that the new 7 storey building of Commercial Bank was opened in Wellawatte in December 2016 having extended working hours till 8.00 pm and housing three Regional offices, Digital banking, Development credit banking and other facilities.   


He was also very close with the board of directors and helped in achieving the target for the branch until his retirement in mid March 2017. 


His retirement came voluntarily backed by the intention of giving opportunities to the younger generation to grow further.   


His father, Mr. Kandiah Pathmanathan, was also a retired state banker.   


On 25th July 2018, he went to Commercial Bank Head Office to wish Mr. Jegan Durairatnam, who was retiring as MD/CEO and to congratulate Mr. Renganathan who was taking over that position and participated in the events of the day. The same evening he suffered a heart attack and passed away.   
May his soul rest in peace.
