IGP Pujith Jayasundara yesterday said the Police were unable to come a conclusion regarding the suicide note allegedly written by the retired army officer who claimed responsibility for the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.

Speaking to the media after attending an event in Vauvniya, he said the CID had carried out a separate investigation into the alleged suicide of the army officer who was found hanging.

The IGP also said the reason behind the suicide note should be investigated.

“There are certain facts that should be considered before declaring the note is genuine. We should first find out why he made such a claim and whether it was a personal or job related issue. Things that prompted him not only to make such a claim but also pushed him to take his own life should be thoroughly investigated. Investigations should verify whether his suicide was a result of mental pressure or any threats leveled on him,” IGP Jayasundara said. (Romesh Madushanka)
