Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday dis-associated itself from the government’s decision to increase water bills by 30 per cent.

Party’s Research and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha told Daily Mirror this proposal had been introduced outside the budget.

“We have to discuss this matter. We were in the dark about it,” he said.

When asked about the SLFP proposals incorporated in the budget, the minister said some of them had been incorporated with modifications.

“We are agreeable to that,” he said and added that the proposal to provide electronic tablets free of charge to schoolchildren would not serve the intended purpose in the wake of the government deciding to increase internet-usage charges.

“Along with progressive proposals, there are some meaningless ones as well,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
