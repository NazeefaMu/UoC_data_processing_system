A team of experts, including CID officers, arrived at the lab premises of the SAITM a short while ago, sources said.

The CID today obtained a search warrant from Court to inspect the laboratory of the SAITM over alleged missing body parts during the first autopsy of the late Wasim Thajudeen.

The CID sought the permission based on the information revealed during investigations that former JMO Ananda Samarasekara had dispatched a few body parts of Mr. Thajudeen to SAITM lab.

Colombo Additional Magistrate, acceding the prosecution’s request, directed the Forensic Faculty, Judicial Medical Institute and Lady Ridgeway Hospital to assist the CID by sending a team of experts to the search at SAITM. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
