Australian style Uni for Police and Criminal Justice
	
The Government is to set up an Australian style University of Police and Criminal Justice, shortly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Saturday.
This university will be different. It will not be a traditional British and Sri Lankan style university. It is going to be a university based on the model of Deakin University Australia, he said speaking at a seminar organised by the University of Sri Jayawardenepura over the weekend.
The Prime Minister who stressed the need for a change in the university system said universities will be put under administrative boards which comprise representatives of the academic staff, past students, the government, constitutional councils and non academic personnel.
Past students, academic staff, non academics, government and the constitutional council will be given the right to administer the universities. In such a system a university will be given wide responsibilities. It will also be possible to obtain financial assistance from the past pupils. The University of Colombo could be easily changed to such a system. We need to think of such systems, he said.
He also said, it is essential to focus on the education of academic staff. It is also possible to set up a special institution to train the academic staff especially on languages.
The Prime Minister proposed further changes and suggested that students should be allowed to choose the subjects they want to study in universities. It is appropriate to have a system where students will have a right to choose university courses of their choice rather than having 'Z' score systems. In this country it is not possible for a student to select a combination such as mathematics and history. This should be changed.
Also the student entertainment is essential. If not we will see a situation where the university students suing the authorities for violating their rights, he added.
He said this is an ideal time to think about changing the university system as the country is ruled by a national government.
Government will go for talks with Federation of University Teacher Associations (FUTA) by end of this month when the discussions on changing the schools system is completed, the Prime Minister added. (Yohan Perera)

I can even be the first in charge: Gota
	
Claiming that people were asking him to be the second in charge, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa today said he can be even the first in charge.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he would join hands with anyone who would come forward to stand for the countrys unitary character and to safeguard the soldiers of the country.
People are asking me now whether I will be the second in charge. I can be the second in charge or even the first in charge, he said addressing the Wiruwani, oba surekeemata apa sudanam peoples movement launched by the National Movement to Protect Soldiers (NMPS).
He was referring to a statement made by Labour and Trade Union Relation Minister and Senior Deputy Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) W.D.J. Seneviratne, who had said that measures were now underway for the appointment of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to the post of second leader of the SLFP.
Speaking further Mr. Rajapaksa said the government, unfortunately, believes that the admiration of soldiers is a hindrance to the process of reconciliation.
Addressing the Wiruwani, oba surekeemata apa sudanam peoples movement launched by the National Movement to Protect Soldiers (NMPS), Mr. Rajapaksa said the former government has followed a process of improving the mentality of the soldier starting from the very beginning.
However, Mr. Rajapaksa said there were incidents where soldiers mentally broke down even in the past.
We have built up the soldiers mind to a level that they have battled to save the country and won the war. Even after the war, we took steps to keep up the mental balance of the soldiers. These soldiers had created a peaceful situation in the country so that the people could live without fear, he added.
Mr. Rajapaksa also said the former government had taken many actions to establish reconciliation throughout the country than the current government, during the post war period.
We were able to remove all the explosives from the war victimized areas after the war during a short span of 2  years. We were also able to re-settle the displaced who were in the war zone within only 2  years, he added.
He also said the former government has rehabilitated the LTTE cadres who were surrendered to the Tri-forces and said this could be the best example which reflect the reconciliation among nations during the former governments term. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

We'll support no-faith motion against Ravi: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it would support the no-confidence motion to be moved against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath told a news conference that the motion would be moved by a loyalist of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said the countrys debt burden had registered a phenomenal increase over the years and the situation took a turn for the worse because of the graft and nepotism under the previous regime.
He said the present government had also given several promises such as cars for youths having bicycles, but when it came to deeds it was the exact opposite.
"The price of three-wheelers has increased leaps and bounds, Mr. Herath said.
He said the current government had displayed a total incompetence in handling vital issues faced by the country, and it was not only the Finance Minister but the entire government that should be held responsible for this debacle.
In part this motion attempts to whitewash the Rajapaksa government. We do not agree fully with the contents of this no-confidence motion, but we will vote for it. Our vote is against the entire economic policy of this government, he said.
