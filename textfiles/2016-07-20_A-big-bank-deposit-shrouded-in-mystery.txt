A story has gone viral that a sum of Rs.12.5 million has mysteriously gone into the bank account of the head of a certain state establishment in the country.

The fact that this large amount of money has fattened the bank account of the bigwig soon after he okayed 26 projects related to his establishment has led some people in the know of it to add two and two together.


A member of a profession with close ties to the administration of justice, this bigwig is far from being in financial difficulties. And this big lump sum has gone into his account while there was already a steady flow of money which kept swelling his bank accounts, they say.
