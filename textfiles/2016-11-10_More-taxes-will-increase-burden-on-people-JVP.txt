Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader, MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the government had now decided to put taxes on goods and services that were exempted in the past and the new taxes such as  the carbon tax will increase the burden on the people.

The 2017 budget proposals this year indicate that the budget is merely a worthless piece of paper and not a document which outlines the economic plans of the State, he said.
