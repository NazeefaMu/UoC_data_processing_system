A foretaste of what is to come


	



 

Given several polls round the corner, this senior Green party purohita recently visited his electorate to say howdy to his voters, but he got an unexpected hostile reception from them, they say. 

 


On hearing that the purohita was on his way to the home turf to meet them, a sizable crowd had gathered to meet him. 


Highly elated on seeing the large gathering, the purohita all smiles greeted them and told them. “I know you all are facing lots of problems like the high living costs these days. But I know you are all with me and I am always with you!”


However, it was derisive laughter that greeted his statement.


“We know that voting for you is not the answer to our problems,” said one man in the gathering.
“Your sweet words don’t fill our empty stomachs,” another man said. 


Taken aback by this unexpected reaction, the purohita said: “I too am very unhappy that prices of essentials are going up. But I am quite helpless,” the senior purohita said.  And this reply drew a chorus of angry epithets from the crowd. 


Finding that the crowd was getting increasingly restive, the purohita turned back for home without further ado, abandoning the painstakingly planned day’s programme in the electorate, they say.
