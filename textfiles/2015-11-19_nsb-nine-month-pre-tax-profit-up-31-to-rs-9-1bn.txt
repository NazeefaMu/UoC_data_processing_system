As the interest income of the bank grew by 7 percent to reach Rs.58.4 billion, while the interest expenses recorded a decrease of 5 percent - mainly due to re-pricing impact of fixed deposits and increase in normal savings base during the period under review. The profit-after tax was reported at Rs.5.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30. These profits were recorded amidst the personal cost reflecting a revision of salaries as per the three-year collective agreement and prudent provisioning for adverse impact in declining gold market prices.
