More hurdles for the reconciliatory spadework

The resolution of Sri Lanka's issues at the Geneva based United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has not been as smooth as originally envisaged after all, leading to concerns at the highest levels of the government in Colombo as to how best the matter should be handled.
When the annual sessions of the UNHRC began earlier this month, there was an optimistic expectation that the United States, which had earlier sponsored resolutions against Sri Lanka on successive years, would categorically endorse a domestic inquiry into alleged war crimes during the final phase of the Eelam war.
That was because a significant amount of diplomatic spadework was done by the newly installed Maithripala Sirisena - Ranil Wickremesinghe government to restore relations with the global superpower which had soured during the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa administration. This even resulted in US Secretary of State John Kerry visiting the country and the US announcing publicly that it would support a domestic mechanism to probe alleged atrocities during the last stages of the war.
Last week however, Geneva was sending out different signals. United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner Zeid Al Hussein, in announcing the UNHRC report on Sri Lanka, was to launch a scathing attack on the integrity of the Sri Lankan judicial system. Most notably, Hussein called for a 'hybrid' court of inquiry incorporating "international judges, prosecutors and investigators" while lamenting the lack of impartiality of a domestic probe, a reference that was to raise concerns in the corridors of power in Colombo.
Domestic inquiry
The government now finds itself in a difficult situation. Initially, being confident of enlisting US support for a purely domestic inquiry, it had publicly voiced its intention to co-operate with the UNHRC, as opposed to the strategy of non-cooperation adopted by the Rajapaksa regime. Then it suddenly found itself being told by High Commissioner Zeid Al Hussein to brace itself for a 'hybrid' inquiry.
It is understood that several countries of the European Union - which votes as one bloc at the UNHRC- are pushing to include an 'international' element to the inquiry. They are being actively canvassed by the pro-Eelam lobby which is actively campaigning in Geneva.
The government too is engaged in intense backroom lobbying to try and preserve what they see as the status quo. Colombo has assured it will co-operate with the UNHRC on all aspects of the probe provided it is within the framework of a domestic inquiry and free of international interference which it fears will be dominated by those with a pro-Eelam agenda.
Publicly, President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera continue to maintain that the outcome in Geneva has been positive so far. Public expectation is that the country will be able to resolve issues at the UNHRC with dignity, instead of being dictated to by the Council and the western bloc of nations. If the government fails to achieve that, it will be a major setback to the fledgling Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration, which is still in the process of establishing its credentials.
Much remains to be done to ensure that international interference in any inquiry is thwarted. This will depend on the wording of the final resolution that is expected to be moved by the United States in concurrence with Sri Lanka. Colombo's representative in Geneva, Ravinatha Aryasinha, has already suggested revisions to the first draft of the resolution presented by the US, suggesting that the negotiations over the next few days would be critical.
Coalition of two major parties
The government has raised several issues during the negotiations in Geneva. It has been noted that while it is newly elected and therefore still enjoys the confidence of the public, its victory was by no means an overwhelming mandate because no single party enjoys an absolute majority in the new Parliament.
The strength of the government is derived from the fact that it is a coalition of the two major parties with the Executive being from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the legislature being dominated by the United National Party (UNP). The coalition of the two major parties confers a greater degree of stability to the government. Even so, a faction of the SLFP is opposed to this concept of 'cohabitation' government and plan to sit as an opposition group in Parliament. This group comprises of Rajapaksa loyalists, but does not enjoy much public support as of now, in the post-election phase where alleged irregularities committed during the Rajapaksa era are slowly but steadily coming to light.
If a 'hybrid' inquiry into alleged war crimes is launched, this allows the pro-Rajapaksa factions to emerge as defenders of the nation once more. They have already commenced their rhetoric for this purpose accusing the new government of a 'sell out' and of betraying troops who fought the war to a finish. Rajapaksa himself issued a statement on Tuesday calling on the government to reject the UNHRC inquiry. If this campaign gathers momentum, there could be more SLFP parliamentarians joining the pro-Rajapaksa camp, weakening the government and thereby stalling the momentum of the entire reconciliation process.
Colombo has also noted that Sri Lankan law as it stands at present has no provision for the type of 'hybrid' inquiry that has been called for by High Commissioner Hussein. Thus it would require tinkering with the Constitution which in turn requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
UNHRC sessions and TNA
While the UNP-SLFP combine, together with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) does enjoy a two-thirds majority, there is a possibility that the support of the SLFP, where Rajapaksa still wields considerable influence, will dwindle if a constitutional amendment facilitating an international inquiry is the issue at stake. In such a scenario, not only will a two thirds majority be doubtful, it could also be a stepping stone for Rajapaksa, who is biding his time in the opposition benches, to reclaim the leadership of the parliamentary group of the SLFP. Colombo is likely to appraise the US of all these potential outcomes in their consultations in Geneva.
It is also noteworthy that the TNA has maintained a relatively low profile during this year's UNHRC sessions. In previous years, faced with the hard-line attitude of the Rajapaksa government, the TNA used the Geneva sessions as a forum to ventilate their frustrations and routinely called for international intervention. This year however, it has been more moderate in its pronouncements although some elements (most notably, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran) have aired similar grievances, at times against the wishes of the leadership of the TNA.
In many ways, the Geneva sessions of the UNHRC will be the first major test for the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government.
If it can come way far from Geneva with an entirely domestic process to deal with alleged war crime allegations, it would have convinced the international community of its bona-fides and set Sri Lanka well on the path to reconciliation and lasting peace.
On the domestic front, it would also be negating the influence of former President Rajapaksa and strengthening the new political culture that has been the hallmark of this government. Therefore, the eventual outcome in Geneva will have a noteworthy impact not only on the resolution of outstanding ethnic issues in the country but also on the shape and form of the domestic political landscape in the next few years to come.
