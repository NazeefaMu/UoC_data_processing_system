Tom Cruise Hasn’t Seen Suri For ‘More Than Two Years’

It has been reported that Hollywood actor, Tom Cruise, hasn’t seen his nine-year-old daughter, Suri, for more than two years.
It is believed that the star’s involvement with the controversial Scientology religion has prevented him from seeing his child with ex-wife Katie Holmes for “800 days”.
Speaking to The National Enquirer, a source explained: “He doesn’t seem interested in being part of Suri’s day-to-day life. Katie does her best to be a hands-on mum but there’s no replacing her father.
“He hasn’t been seen in public with his daughter in over two long years – that’s a fifth of her lifetime.”

A former member of Scientology, Marc Headley, also confirmed that this is not unusual behaviour for a member of the church, as Tom might have concerns that his former in-laws have been bad-mouthing his religion.
He told the publication: “It’s possible Tom won’t see Suri because he thinks Katie and her family are speaking negatively about him and Scientology.”
It is also thought that the actor is too busy with his work commitments to make the time for Suri, with Tom working on several movies back-to-back in recent years. Meanwhile, the Church of Scientology has come under scrutiny over the last few weeks thanks to a sensational book released by former member, Leah Remini. In the piece, Leah claims to expose secrets about Tom and the religious group, alleging that Tom and Katie had left Suri to cry on the bathroom floor when she was just a baby, and also maintaining that it’d be tough for Tom to keep in contact with his daughter.
She said during a TV appearance: “The policy with the church is you can’t be connected to someone who has committed a suppressive act - which I have, Katie has.” So far, the church has denied all of Leah’s claims in her book, telling E! Online: “It comes as no surprise that someone as self-absorbed as Leah Remini with an insatiable craving for attention would exploit her former faith as a publicity stunt by rewriting her history with it, including omitting that she was participating in a programme to remain a Scientologist by her own choice, as she was on the verge of being expelled for her ethical lapses.”
After divorcing Tom in 2012, Katie Holmes left the Church of Scientology because she wanedt “to protect her daughter”.
Tom has not yet commented on any of the claims.
