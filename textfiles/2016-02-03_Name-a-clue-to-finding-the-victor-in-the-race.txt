There is another vacant main chair awaiting an occupant in another key department involved with law enforcement at Aluthkade.

 


It was a given from the start, that the incumbent second in command in the department would not get this office. There was a rumour that two outsiders were in the running for the chair. A story was also afloat that moves were being made to appoint a onetime insider who once disappeared with a file containing vital documents.


Meanwhile, voices raised in the august assembly insisted that whoever to be appointed to this key post should be a person of integrity with impeccable credentials. 


There also had been a suggestion that a well-qualified officer ranking third or the fourth in the seniority order in the department be raised to this high office after promoting his seniors to suitable positions in the judicial service. 


Meanwhile, the Constitutional Council has decided not to extend the acting period of the officer currently covering up the duties of the head of this legal department. 


By the way, according to the latest reports, an insider with a name suggestive of victory is going to be declared the victor in the race.
