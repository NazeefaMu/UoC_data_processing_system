Anuja Ranaweera A bank loses a bright spark


	

Last 16th of August I stepped into the Pelawatta branch of Sampath Bank to do a transaction. As I entered the bank I noticed a white flag hoisted above the main entrance.When I made inquiries, I was told something that was astounding and shocking. I was informed that the second officer of the Pelawatta branch had passed away suddenly.How could fate be so cruel to such a gracious young woman?   


During the past five years I had developed close ties with her as a customer of the the bank. She was always helpful and gave sound advice whenever I sought her assistance. During a crisis she always had solutions at her fingertips. Once I witnessed how an agitated customer was helped and pacified and how he left the bank with a broad smile after his problem was solved by her.   


 She discharged a very unreservedly effective service to the organisation that employed her. She understood the importance of working tirelessly to make the bank shine among other such organisations.   


As a bright product of Matara Sujatha Vidyalaya she excelled in her studies and after joining Sampath Bank, she worked diligently to make it a formidable organisation.   


We express our sincere condolences to her grieving husband and two little kids.   


 ‘May she attain nibbana’
