Implementation of Geneva Resolution must be opposed - Dr. Amarasekara

The Common opposition and the entire country should oppose the implementation of the Geneva Resolution and also the MPs taking part in the so called All Party Conference. English newspapers in Sri Lanka reveal what is going on in the country when it comes to TNA MPs’ activities, but vernacular newspapers avoid informing such news to the public, Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that the Government should not hold an All Party Conference now, as the show was now over.
The Government should have done it before bringing in the Geneva Resolution. What the Government should do now is to reveal as to how the resolution would be implemented in Sri Lanka. But the Government is not doing so, but lead the public astray, by publicising ‘other shows’ such as Avant Garde, diabetics, corruption, ‘fight against drugs,’ etc. Dr. Amarasekara said that one third of the country was disabled due to the hartal organized by the TNA and it is not a single event or something done instantly. The TNA planned it in 2010 and announced it in the same year.
They showed that they were above the law of the country. They are heading towards active terrorism through ‘Ahinsa’. One TNA MP toured Australia in order to discuss Australia’s participation in domestic mechanism. How did it become a domestic mechanism when foreign judges take part in it, he questioned.
Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera said that although the Sri Lankan Prime Minister always rejected the claims made by media, etc., on holding discussions on the CEPA Agreement with India, the Indian authorities, especially India’s Transport Minister admitted the fact. India is fully funding the bridge to be built between Mannar and Dhanuskody.
This is because of the advantages India would get through this bridge. India has already applied for 5.2 billion US$ loan from the Asian Development Bank for this project. The feasibility study had already been done. This is not due to India’s love for Sri Lanka. China sacrificed many lives to build the Great Wall to protect the country, but here in Sri Lanka, Sri Lankans betray their own motherland.
Ven. Thera said that Sri Lanka would be destroyed if the bridge was built between Mannar and Dhanuskody. Sri Lanka would lose its natural protection, the sea. Unemployed Indians would flood in Sri Lanka and do odd jobs for food and other benefits.
At the moment, a Sri Lankan labourer charges Rs.1,000 per day. They would turn into Sri Lankans by obtaining the relevant legal documents easily, as their complexion and language is similar to Sri Lankan Tamils. Indian professionals would also flood in Sri Lanka seeking employment opportunities. It would leave all Sri Lankan professionals jobless. LTTE tigers are children of our motherland, but they should be punished for the crimes committed and they should be rehabilitated.
