A dark lining in a silver cloud!


	


The new strongman left for the UN to attend the 70th sessions of the UNGA on September 24. By the way, his predecessor used to attend the UN sessions in his day with a jumbo retinue. However, the new strongman had restricted his entourage to about 30, less than one third the number that usually accompanied the former strongman. 
None of the delegates who accompanied the new strongman this time round was allowed accommodation in high end hotels like Astoria. The entire delegation including the new strongman had checked in to Hotel Hyatt known for its moderate charges. 
Expensive limousines were not hired either as on previous occasions for the delegates to go about on duty. Instead, five Subaru jeeps hired had met all transport needs of the delegates, they say.  Separate vehicles had been made available for the use of the new strongman and the Ministerial ones. But they all had made it to the UN headquarters by foot. In fact, it was only a five minutes’ walk from the hotel where they were staying, they say.  
Nevertheless, certain matters related to our official delegation to the UN have drawn flak from some quarters. For instance, some have questioned the rationale behind the inclusion of certain persons sans any official status in the delegation. 
Meanwhile, the choice of yahapalanaya representatives to be present at the KIA to welcome the new strongman on his return home from the UN has raised eye brows in high echelons of the government. A source close to the yahapalanaya top brass observed that certain close friends of the new strongman were conspicuous by their absence at the airport reception for the obvious reason that they had been ignored when sending out invitations.
