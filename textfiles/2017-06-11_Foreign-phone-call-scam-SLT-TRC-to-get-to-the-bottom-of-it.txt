Many mobile users complained that they had received overseas phone calls which were cut before they could answer them. Some users said no one had answered when they called back. However those who returned the call had been charged an exorbitant amount of money for making the call to that number. Some mobile phone users said they had received calls from the US while others said theirs had come from the West Indies.
