Channa and Upuli deny charging Rs. 15m
	
Popular artistes Channa and Upuli Wijewardena, the owners of Channa-Upuli Dance Academy today rejected reports that they had been given over 15 million rupees for their dancing performances at the opening ceremony of phase one of the Hambantota Harbour.
Issuing a media statement, they said they had been given Rs. 6. 8 million for their contribution at the opening ceremony.
"We have provided all the relevant documents in this regard before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), to prove we had been given only Rs. 6.8 million," the statement said.
The statement said the Academy had to recruit about 200 dancers for the performances and stay in Hambantota for two months prior to the opening ceremony. It also said they had to provide accommodation facilities for 250 artistes during the same period.
The two artistes appeared before PRECIFAC on Thursday to give a statement on the amount of money they had received as fees for performing at the opening ceremony.
The statement further said the reports that they had charged Rs. 15 million rupees had attempted to portray them as wrongdoers.

Feasibility study on road to Talaimannar soon-India
	
The Indian government will soon carry out a feasibility study on establishing a road link between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Talaimannar in Sri Lanka, said Union Minister of State for Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon. Radhakrishnan said.
India is keen on implementing the project. It needs the consent of both countries. The project needs to be discussed at various levels, he told reporters here on Saturday.
Stating that the Centre had begun consultations to carry out a feasibility study on various aspects, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the sea bridge was aimed at ensuring seamless traffic between the two nations.
To a question, he said the Centre had studied different alignments to implement the Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project (SSCP). It would be implemented by adopting a new alignment without affecting the sentiments of the people and the ecology of Gulf of Mannar. The government would expedite the project once the Supreme Court disposed a case pending before it.
The BJP shared the sentiments of fishermen and the Centre had already initiated diplomatic talks with Sri Lanka to secure the release of the fishermen who were arrested recently.(The Hindu)

Guatemalan comedian favored to win presidency
	
A former TV comedian with no experience in government is poised to win Guatemala's presidential election on Sunday after a corruption scandal toppled the country's last leader and fueled voter outrage with the political establishment.
Playing up his outsider status and promising clean government, 46-year-old Jimmy Morales has surged in polls since a probe into a multi-million dollar customs racket led to the resignation and arrest of President Otto Perez.
Voter surveys show Morales is primed to easily beat former first lady Sandra Torres, who also vows to tackle corruption but is seen by many voters as part of the old political order.
"If I have to pick, it will be Jimmy Morales," said Nelson Lemus, a 37-year-old driving instructor, offering rather faint praise for the self-proclaimed centrist. "At least we don't have anything that speaks against him yet." (REUTERS)

Video: Many dangerous operative paragraphs in resolution-MR
	
Claiming that there are many dangerous operative paragraphs in theGeneva resolution on Sri Lanka, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said that all Sri Lankans should be vigilant about what some powerful forces are trying to achieve by jailing thewar heroes, sacking through an administrative process those who cannot be jailed, and breaking the back of the nation.
Issuing a statement during a press conference at the Abhayaramaya, Narahenpita, the former President said that according to operative paragraph 6 of the Geneva resolution the government has agreed to establish a judicial mechanism to try war crimes. They have also agreed to the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers in that judicial mechanism. What this means in effect is the setting up of an entirely new parallel criminal justice system in this country outside the existing system.
According to operative paragraph 4 of the Geneva resolution, the Sri Lankan government has already agreed to allow these mechanisms that are to be set up to deal with the past to obtain financial assistance from foreign countries. What this means is that the mechanisms that will be set up to look into allegations of war crimes and other matters will be paid for and maintained by the Western powers.
If the Geneva resolution is implemented, the countries that sponsored resolutions against Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council, will be the same countries that provide funding for the judicial mechanisms set up under that resolution and who provide the judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers to man those mechanisms. These will also be the same countries that tried their level best to stop the final phase of the war and failed. By what stretch of the imagination are we to believe that the cause of justice will be served by such an arrangement

The government has been putting forward various arguments to justify their decision to implement the Geneva resolution. The appointment by Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike of an Egyptian judge to the Commission of Inquiry to probe the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike assassination is taken as an example of a foreign judge participating in the Sri Lankan judicial system.

However Mrs Bandaranaike appointed that Egyptian judge to a Commission of Inquiry appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act and not to a court of law. The criminal case relating to the Bandaranaike assassination was heard in the ordinary courts of the country. Similarly the instance of the Commission of Inquiry into Missing Persons (Maxwell Paranagama Commission) appointed by me, being allowed to seek the legal opinions of several foreign experts in the law of armed conflict is also mentioned as a precedent for the participation of foreign legal experts in a Sri Lankan legal process. 

My government did make arrangements for the Maxwell Paranagama Commission to obtain written legal opinions from several foreign experts on a written request made by the Chairman of that Commission. Sir Desmond de Silva QC, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, Professor David Crane, Professor Michael Newton and Rodney Dixon  all experts in the law of armed conflict  and Major General John Holmes formerly of the British SAS provided some very valuable written opinions to the Paranagama Commission. It should be borne in mind that we are referring here not to the Maxwell Paranagama Commission Report which was tabled in parliament recently, but to the legal opinions provided to it by the foreign experts. The government should have circulated the written opinions of these international experts to the members of the UN Human Rights Council. There was plenty of time to do so before the UNHRC sessions but the government deliberately refrained from doing so.
Various views were expressed about the report of the Maxwell Paranagama Commission appointed to look into Complaints of Missing Persons during the recent debate in parliament. I heard this commission being referred to as Rajapaksas Commission. I saw some politicians trying to justify their own plans by saying that Rajapaksas own commission had made such and such recommendation. I appointed the Paranagama Commission to look into Complaints of Missing Persons in August 2013. After January this year it has functioned under the present government. It is now a commission of the present government. From January this year the incumbent President had the power to make any changes he wanted in the functions of this Commission. So it is not correct to say that was a Rajapaksa commission. In any event what is of importance to us here are the implications of the Geneva resolution.
The involvement of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers implies the creation of a new criminal justice system parallel to the existing one. I am totally opposed to any such arrangement. I regard that very suggestion to be an insult to our courts system, legal profession, Attorney Generals Department and investigative bodies.

Through operative paragraph 8 of the Geneva resolution, the government has already agreed to remove from office members of the armed suspected of having committed human rights violations through an administrative process even if there is no evidence against him that can be placed before a court of law. Some ministers claimed in parliament that there is no such recommendation in the Geneva resolution. I state with the utmost responsibility that operative paragraph 4 of the resolution requires exactly that and nothing else.
However, one of the most sacrosanct principles of criminal law is that a deed that was not a crime when it was committed should not be declared a crime through new legislation and punishment meted out retroactively. Even though the constitution allows retroactive legislation, this is never resorted to except in the most extreme circumstances.

The last time retroactive legislation was passed in was in the 1980s when SepalaEkanayake hijacked an Alitalia plane. At that time hijacking a plane was not an offence in our law. So the government at that time had to bring in retroactive legislation to make hijacking a crime and to punish Ekanayake. But there is no such issue here. If any member of the armed forces has committed murder there are laws against that in our country. Likewise if there are allegations, of torture, assault, rape or threatening of people against any member of the armed forces, all those crimes can be dealt with under our law.

If any of these crimes can be punished in our law, many would be left wondering why new criminal laws would be necessary at all. If new laws are introduced, that will be for only one purpose  to water down the evidentiary requirements and to enable the expeditious jailing of our war heroes. This is similar to wanting to remove from office through an administrative process even those members of the armed forces against whom there is no evidence, but are suspected of having violated human rights. The evidentiary rules in international war crimes tribunals have a lower benchmark than in our courts and the national legal systems of most countries. Life sentences can be handed down on little evidence.
This is one of the main reasons why the United States of America has prohibited international war crimes tribunals from ever trying any of its citizens. In 2002 the American government passed the American Servicemens Protection Act which empowers the American president to use force if necessary to obtain the release of any American citizen taken before an international war crimes tribunal. That is how the Americans protect their war veterans and other citizens. But what we see here are politicians falling over one another in their eagerness to betray our war heroes. One of the main reasons why the Americans are against any of its citizens being taken before these international war crimes tribunals is because of the glaring shortcomings in the international law relating to war crimes and the procedures of the war crimes tribunals. 

The present attempt being made in this country is to introduce these faulty laws and procedures to Sri Lanka and to jail our war heroes expeditiously. No self-respecting citizen should allow this to happen. If any member of the armed forces has done anything wrong, he should be tried according to our law and only in our courts.
It is my belief that we as a nation are now faced with the most perilous moment since independence in 1948. We are all duty bound to come forward on behalf of the nation at a time like this. Full statement as follows;
I address you thus, at a time of great peril to our nation. Various views have been expressed about the resolution passed against Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council in Geneva. There was a debate in parliament about it as well. Some contentious points have been raised with regard to this resolution and as the former President and Commander in Chief I am duty bound to explain to the public my views on this resolution. The people of this country should be aware of the challenge confronting the country as a result of the government co-sponsoring the Geneva resolution against Sri Lanka.

I must first draw your attention to the operative paragraphs in the Geneva resolution which will have the most serious implications for this country. There are many dangerous operative paragraphs in this resolution. I wish to draw your attention to three of the most serious and unacceptable recommendations.

According to operative paragraph 6 of the Geneva resolution the government has agreed to establish a judicial mechanism to try war crimes. They have also agreed to the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers in that judicial mechanism. What this means in effect is the setting up of an entirely new parallel criminal justice system in this country outside the existing system.
According to operative paragraph 4 of the Geneva resolution, the Sri Lankan government has already agreed to allow these mechanisms that are to be set up to deal with the past to obtain financial assistance from foreign countries. What this means is that the mechanisms that will be set up to look into allegations of war crimes and other matters will be paid for and maintained by the Western powers.
If the Geneva resolution is implemented, the countries that sponsored resolutions against Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council, will be the same countries that provide funding for the judicial mechanisms set up under that resolution and who provide the judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers to man those mechanisms. These will also be the same countries that tried their level best to stop the final phase of the war and failed. By what stretch of the imagination are we to believe that the cause of justice will be served by such an arrangement

It should be borne in mind that we are referring here not to the Maxwell Paranagama Commission Report which was tabled in parliament recently, but to the legal opinions provided to it by the foreign experts. The government should have circulated the written opinions of these international experts to the members of the UN Human Rights Council. There was plenty of time to do so before the UNHRC sessions but the government deliberately refrained from doing so.

The Island web edition published all these legal opinions in full some months ago. If the contents of those well-argued legal opinions had been taken into account the war crimes project against Sri Lanka orchestrated by some western countries would have come to an end before it even got off the ground.

The Commission on Missing Persons is also a commission appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act and not a court of law. Furthermore the legal experts I mentioned earlier, only provided written legal opinions in an advisory capacity to this commission. All these opinions were very favourable to Sri Lanka. The difference between obtaining advisory opinions about the arguments that can be made in our favour from foreign experts and appointing foreign judges to hear court cases against our war heroes should be clear to everybody.

Various views were expressed about the report of the Maxwell Paranagama Commission appointed to look into Complaints of Missing Persons during the recent debate in parliament. I heard this commission being referred to as Rajapaksas Commission. I saw some politicians trying to justify their own plans by saying that Rajapaksas own commission had made such and such recommendation.

Some ministers claimed in parliament that there is no such recommendation in the Geneva resolution. I state with the utmost responsibility that operative paragraph 4 of the resolution requires exactly that and nothing else.

When the Human Rights Commissioner addressed the UNHRC on 30 September the matter on which he placed the most emphasis was the need to remove from office through an administrative process member of the armed forces suspected of having violated human rights. The government has agreed even to implement this patently unfair recommendation. If there is insufficient evidence to place before a court of law, no one can be declared a wrongdoer according to our legal system. On what principle of justice are such individuals to be removed from office through an administrative process This is nothing but a project to persecute our war heroes.
There is another ethical issue here. This war was fought in Sri Lanka. If our war heroes are to be punished for war crimes, many things that were not crimes according to our law during the time of the war will have to be entered into our laws as crimes and given effect retroactively. Our constitution does permit retroactive legislation especially to give effect to international law in this country. 

However, one of the most sacrosanct principles of criminal law is that a deed that was not a crime when it was committed should not be declared a crime through new legislation and punishment meted out retroactively. Even though the constitution allows retroactive legislation, this is never resorted to except in the most extreme circumstances.

The last time retroactive legislation was passed in was in the 1980s when SepalaEkanayake hijacked an Alitalia plane. At that time hijacking a plane was not an offence in our law.

The present attempt being made in this country is to introduce these faulty laws and procedures to Sri Lanka and to jail our war heroes expeditiously. No self-respecting citizen should allow this to happen. If any member of the armed forces has done anything wrong, he should be tried according to our law and only in our courts.

In ruling a country governments do come under pressure from overseas. The government of the day has to find ways and means of dealing with that. There is no need for a government if we are going to agree to everything said by other countries.

The government has co-sponsored the Geneva resolution without considering its implications and without informing parliament and appraising the people about it. If a separate criminal justice apparatus is to be set up with foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators, our ordinary law as well as the constitution itself will have to be amended. Last week in an interview with The Straits Times in Singapore, the Prime Minister had said that foreign judges will in fact be involved in war crimes trials here.

The laws will be changed in this manner for the sole purpose of punishing our war heroes. Changing the constitution itself to punish the war heroes who brought an end to terrorism which had been stalking this land for forty years and which embroiled the country in a raging internal war for 30 years is a dastardly act. People belonging to all communities are now able to live in peace in this country because of the sacrifices made by our war heroes.

If we change the law to enable foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators to serve in our legal system, what happens after they finish jailing our war heroes If the amendments to the law continues to remain even after jailing the war heroes, foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and especially lawyers will continue to work in Sri Lanka and that may pose a major problem for the legal profession. There are many lawyers in parliament. I too am a lawyer.

One of the matters under discussion in this country with regard to the CEPA agreement with India was the provision made for Indian professionals of all categories including lawyers to work in Sri Lanka. If the laws are amended as envisaged to punish our war heroes, one of the unintended consequences of that will be the opening up of the Sri Lankan legal profession to foreigners even without CEPA.
If however, the law is changed only to punish our war heroes and after all the war heroes are jailed the laws are amended once again to restore the status quo ante, then it will become obvious to the people that this government amended the law only to punish our war heroes. That is not an acceptable situation at all.

The government has been engaged in an attempt to justify the position they have taken. One argument they have brought forward is that everything that is happening now had been agreed to in the joint statement made by the UN Secretary General and myself on May 23, 2009. They have been misquoting the final paragraph of that joint statement to find justification for their own actions. That final paragraph went as follows:
Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lankas international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances.
Joint statements contain the ideas of both parties signing it. The positions taken by Sri Lanka and the UN Secretary General are clearly stated. Sri Lanka has accepted that she is committed to upholding human rights to an international standard and we are doing that. We have a whole chapter on fundamental rights in our constitution. The UN Secretary General speaks about the need for an accountability process. We never accepted that. All that we did was to look into any grievances in that regard.
We never undertook to set up war crimes tribunals or to man them with foreign judges and prosecutors or to sack members of the armed forces who have not been proven guilty of any wrongdoing through an administrative process. As per the pledge we made we appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission to look into Complaints of Missing Persons.

These plans that are being made to persecute members of our armed forces cannot be implemented without amending the law. Parliament has the power to thwart all these plans being made to victimise our war heroes who sacrificed so much in the war against terror. I appeal to all Members of Parliament regardless of party affiliation, not to allow the passage of any legislation aimed at persecuting members of our armed forces. This is a matter that goes beyond politics and is about our country, our nation, our sovereignty and our self-respect.

The people should be vigilant about what these powerful forces are trying to achieve by jailing our war heroes, sacking through an administrative process those who cannot be jailed, and breaking the back of this nation. It is my belief that we as a nation are now faced with the most perilous moment since independence in 1948. We are all duty bound to come forward on behalf of the nation at a time like this.

Modi has let down Sri Lankan Tamils: Narayanasamy
	
	AICC general secretary and former Union Minister for State V. Narayanasamy has charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with indulging in doublespeak in pressing the Sri Lankan government for an international probe into the alleged war crimes and human rights violations during the civil war in 2009.
	Talking to reporters here on Saturday, Mr. Narayanasamy said the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, had constantly insisted that an international probe should be conducted into the war crimes.
	However, the then Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had declined to accept the demand. The current President, Maithripala Sirisena, has also taken a stand against the demand for an international probe triggering strong protests from political parties in Tamil Nadu.
	Mr. Narayanasamy said that Mr. Modi had visited Sri Lanka and signed several pacts.
	However, he failed to persuade the Sri Lankan government for an international inquiry and had ignored the pleas of various political parties in Tamil Nadu.
	Mr. Modi had been indulging in doublespeak and let down the Tamils in the island nation. The Sri Lankan government had also covered up the crux of the report and not taken any action.
	Mr. Narayanasamy also wanted the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre to take immediate steps to secure the release of 54 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Karaikal who were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.(The Hindu)

Thirty five new MPs have requested semi-automatic pistols (instead of revolvers) of the type issued to ministers and senior MPs -- in a letter sent to the Parliament authorities.
These MPs, including 2 women, have signed a letter to say they should be provided with same type of 9mm pistols that are given to senior parliamentarians and the ministers, as .38 revolvers are obsolete.
35 (of the 61) first time MPs have sent applications for firearms under parliament members' privileges to the Ministry of Defence through the Parliament authorities.
The Defence Ministry had approved the issue of .38 revolvers to them and informed them of it through the Secretary General of Parliament
A two day training course, on October26 and 27, in the use of firearms, at the Police Special Task Force Training School in Kalutara had also been arranged for these MPs.
The Defence Ministry's letter had also asked them to collect the assigned revolvers from Police Field Force Headquarters prior to the training.
Parliamentary sources said the authorities had arranged to send the letter signed by the new MPs requesting for semi-automatic pistols to the Defence Ministry. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)

New railway line from Maradana to Battaramulla
	
A feasibility study on establishing a 10 km railway land line from Maradana to Battaramulla via Dematagoda would be started today (26), Sri Lanka Railways said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Railway Department Superintendent Vijaya Samarasinghe said the plan of the proposed 10 km railway line would be finalised this week.
The Ministry of Transport had proposed the new railway line from Maradana to Battaramulla to ease traffic congestion. After a steering committee comprising officials from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and Transport Ministry met, final decisions and recommendations on the estimated cost of the railway line and other important issues will be finalised, he said.
Buildings and houses, which would be found on the railway line would be removed, he said.
Among the buildings which will be found in the railway line, will have to be removed only if we could negotiate with the owners on compensation. Otherwise, the railway line will have to be built over the buildings. Further, we are able to use electric trains too. But, it is up to the Transport Ministry to make a final decision with regard to this, Mr. Samarasinghe said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that his government had to build a safety bunker under Presidents House in Fort to shield VIPs from potential LTTE air strikes.
