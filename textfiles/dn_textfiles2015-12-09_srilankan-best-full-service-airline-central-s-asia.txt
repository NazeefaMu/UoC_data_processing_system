SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ajith Dias said the new management of SriLankan Airlines has embarked upon a journey to turn the airline's fortunes around with a total commitment to delighting customers, both in the air and on the ground.
SriLankan was among just five full service airlines which received awards at this event. The other winners in the Full Service Airline category included Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand and Qatar Airways.
SriLankan's CEO Capt. Suren Ratwatte said the award is a clear indication that Sri Lanka's national carrier has raised its levels of service to a world class standard, to complement the comforts on board the sophisticated fleet of aircraft. The FTE Asia Awards recognize Asia's most customer-centric airlines and airports, with winners being chosen by a panel of experts from the airline industry. Full service airlines were judged on an extensive range of criteria in their products and service, including business class, economy and other classes, long-haul flights, short-haul flights, in-flight entertainment systems, cabin crew service, comfort, food and beverage, consistency of service, and overall passenger experience. SriLankan competed in a vast region of more than 15 countries extending from Bangladesh in the east to Belarus and Armenia in the west.
