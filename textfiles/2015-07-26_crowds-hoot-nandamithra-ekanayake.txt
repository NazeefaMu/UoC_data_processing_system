Arts and Cultural Affairs Minister Nandimithra Ekanayake was humiliated at an election rally of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in Na-ula today when the crowd started hooting him.
The rally was attended by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who is the UPFA's prime ministerial candidate.
Mr. Ekanayake left the UPFA before the Presidential Election, and supported Maitripala Sirisena against Rajapaksa. However, he is now a UPFA candidate for the Matale District.
Despite being hooted by the UPFA supporters, Mr. Ekanayake began to speak. Mr. Rajapaksa, and former minister Janaka Bandara Tennakoon signed the people to stop hooting but they continued. (Ariyaratne Ranabahu)
