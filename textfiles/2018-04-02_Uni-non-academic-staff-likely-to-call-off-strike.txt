The university non-academic staff had agreed to call off their month-long work stoppage following a discussion with Higher Education and Highways Minister Kabir Hashim.

University Trade Union Joint Committee Chairman Edward Malwattage told a news briefing the minister agreed to increase the lieu leave allowance by ten percent.

However, he said the strike would continue until they receive the circular issued by the ministry confirming the agreement tomorrow.

Mr. Malwattage said the minister had also agreed to appoint a separate committee to look into the other concerns of the non-academic staff.

He said the union had also demanded for a language allowance which had been submitted to the Cabinet for approval. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
