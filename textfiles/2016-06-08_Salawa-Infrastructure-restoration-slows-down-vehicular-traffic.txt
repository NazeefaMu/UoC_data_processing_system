Vehicle movement on the Awissawella-Colombo main road could be interrupted at times as the erecting of light posts and laying of water lines are taking place in the area, Military Spokesman Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera said.

He said heavy machinery is being used to restore infrastructure in the area causing slight traffic congestion.

“However, the road remains opened. Resident’s vehicles, buses and ambulances can use the road,” he said.

The road was re-opened for vehicular traffic last night.
