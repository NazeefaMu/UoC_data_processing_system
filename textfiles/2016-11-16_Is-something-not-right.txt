Is something not right?


	



 

A party was held at a 5-star hotel in the city recently to bid farewell to a diplomat from a neighbouring country.

 


Political and media bigwigs of the country had been invited to this function. 


The big boss of yahapalanaya breezed in when the party was underway. Several top team members who were awaiting his arrival moved over to the table where their boss sat. The former madam who arrived soon after took a seat at the same table. They all expected the Big Two to get into an animated conversation and were keen to hear what they were to discuss. But hardly a word was exchanged among them for about 45 minutes.


At long last, the former madam broke the ice by making a reference to a flower-bud political party.
Some people who observed the scene agreed later that something had gone awry.
