The meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa would only be limited to party level discussions and would be held without damaging the trust vested in the President by 6.3 million people, the President’s Media Division said today.
“Meetings of this nature are not strange to the President because he is also the Chairman of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The objective of this meeting is to strengthen the SLFP and no issue related to the actions of the government will be discussed during it,” it said.
The meeting is scheduled to be held today at the President’s Office in the Parliament at 1.30 p.m.
