NSB, Sri Lanka’s savings giant, has joined hands with Mobitel, the national mobile service provider, to create a new digital environment of convenience and flexibility in saving money.


A customer would now be able to save money via 16000+ Mobitel mCash retailers spread across the country anytime with a message received instantly to one’s mobile phone. This NSB i Saver product was successfully launched recently at a ceremony held at NSB’s head office graced by President Maithripala Sirisena as the chief guest, along with several other distinguished guests.


NSB i Saver is a digital innovation, which is expected to provide customer convenience through Mobitel standalone and all franchisee outlets at any time during the day. This innovative service is expected to further inculcate the habit of savings amongst Sri Lanka’s populace, thus resulting in wealth creation and mobility of funds for investment.


NSB has achieved AAA Fitch rating (Ika) for 15 consecutive years and is the only bank where its deposits and interest are guaranteed by the Government of Sri Lanka, thus the safest place for all deposits. Mobitel’s mCash operating platform has witnessed a rapid growth in usage with a digital payment eco-system supporting transactions via mobile devices and through retail counters. The 16000+ customer touchpoints include Mobitel branches, SLT Teleshops, Singer Mega outlets, supermarkets and 300+ Pay & Go kiosks situated across the country.


NSB i Saver is the latest addition to the mCash portfolio approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for broader customer engagement in pursuance of enhanced opportunity to save money.
