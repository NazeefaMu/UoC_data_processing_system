Buddha statue presented by President placed at Dharmarama Temple
Significant outcome of President's visit to Thailand

The Buddha statue presented by President Maithripala Sirisena as a special gift to the people of Thailand has been placed in the historic Dharmarama Temple in Ayutthaya city or Ajodhya of Thailand where Ven. Upali Mahathera who brought higher ordination (Upasampada) to Sri Lanka from Siam (then Thailand) in 1735 had lived.
Stating this as a significant outcome of the President's recently concluded state visit to Thailand, Foreign Affairs Ministry's East Asia and Pacific Acting Director General O.L.Ameer Ajwad yesterday said: "President Sirisena presented the Buddha statue as a gift from Sri Lanka to the people and the government of Thailand during his state visit to the Kingdom of Thailand from November 1 to 4, 2015.
"The government of Thailand has taken steps to enshrine it in the temple where Ven Upali Mahathera had lived before he brought higher ordination to Sri Lanka from Siam."
Ajwad was summarising the outcome of the President's official visit to Thailand at a press conference at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. He said President Sirisena undertook a state visit to Thailand at the invitation of Thailand's Prime Minister to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Thailand - Sri Lanka diplomatic relations.
The President inaugurated the exposition of the Buddha's Sacred Relics from the Mahiyangana Rajamaha Vihara at Buddhamanthan in Thailand.
Thailand's Prime Minister General Prayut Chan -o- cha participated in this ceremony. Sixty Sri Lankan Buddhist monks chanted pirith at the inauguration.
Ajwad said: "President Sirisena had bilateral discussions with the President and the Prime Minister of Thailand on a wide range of matters covering economic, cultural, religious and and political cooperation. "During high level discussions it was agreed to hold the joint commission between the two countries in Bangkok in the first quarter of 2016. The last meeting of the commission was held in Colombo. The leaders agreed to hold the meeting to enhance cooperation between the two countries in the areas of economic cooperation including technical cooperation, agriculture, security, fisheries and tourism sectors." Ajwad said the President also held discussions with representatives of top business companies and industries in Thailand. "The talks were to lead business participation in tourism, hospitality, food processing, manufacturing of electric and electronic appliances, auto spare parts among other things. The heads of leading business companies in Thailand voiced their keen interest to invest
in Sri Lanka in view of the current favourable business environment in the country," he said.
"President Sirisena asked them to arrange a programme to implement their business initiatives in Sri Lanka with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and other agencies," he said.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand agreed to pay a visit to Sri Lanka particularly to observe religious places of historic significance in the country early next year with a view to promote tourism between the two countries. He will be here with a media team to ensure coverage of places of worship in Sri Lanka to educate the public in Thailand about them.
The government of Thailand also agreed to increase the number of scholarships provided by them to Sri Lanka, especially in the areas of agriculture, public health, renewable energy and rural energy.
The discussions also saw a proposal to establish a hospital dedicated to the Maha Sangha in Sri Lanka with the assistance of Thai government. On the sidelines of this visit, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera met his Thailand counterpart.
