Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya requested all the contesting candidates to refrain from campaigning through telephone networks without the consent of the subscribers.
He said such propaganda activities during the 48 hour period before the polls would be treated as contravention of election laws.
Mr. Deshapriya said complaints had been received about organized activities of sending short messages to telephone subscribers for promoting political parties and candidates.
