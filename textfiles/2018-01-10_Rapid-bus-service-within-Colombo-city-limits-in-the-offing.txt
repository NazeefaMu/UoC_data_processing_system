The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry is planning to introduce a rapid bus service within the Colombo city limits in line with its new initiative the light railway service.

Minister Champika Ranawaka said the ministry will commence the project before end of this year.

While launching the priority bus lane from Borella to Maradana today, the minister said ministry had identified new measures of strengthening the public transportation as there were no other way to overcome the heavy traffic in the city limits.

Therefore the minister added that public passenger transports including buses and trains would be modernized in the near future.

He also said along with the public transport the private transport sector also should be modernized.

In a separate note minister said priority bus lane at Battaramulla was put on hold for two weeks until the construction of the Rajagiriya Flyover was completed and the ministry is hoping that it would resume soon.

The priority bus lane from Borella to Maradana came into force last morning, from 6 am to 9 am for buses on route numbers 176 and 103.

The newest initiative is believed to ease the traffic congestion along P. De S Kularatne road (Maradana Road). (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
