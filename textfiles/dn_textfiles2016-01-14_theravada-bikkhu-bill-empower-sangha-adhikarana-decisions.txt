'Theravada Bikkhu Bill to empower Sangha Adhikarana decisions'

The new draft Bill introduced in Parliament to promote Theravadha Bikkhu dialogue is envisaged to empower Adhikarana Sangha Sabhas, Chief Incumbent of Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya temple Most Ven Prof Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayaka Thera stated yesterday.
The Bill was introduced with the knowledge of the Maha Nayaka Theras belonging to the Three Chapters. The Bill was moved in Parliament by Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatillake.
"At present, there is no situation as such where laymen or law enforcement authorities would be empowered to dictate terms on members of the Maha Sangha or that they would be entitled to monitor their discipline," said Ven Prof Wimalarathana Thera. "The normal law would take its course on Buddhist monks as it would be on others," he said. "The Bill seeks to empower the Adhikarana Sangha Sabhas or the disciplinary councils of the Maha Sangha, so as to enable them with legal powers to carry out its decisions with regard to the conduct of bikkhus," the Nayaka Thera explained. Asked if the Nayaka Theras approved that bikkhus should not obtain driving licenses which could be described as a violation of a fundamental right, the thera said, "There is a consensus among the community of the Buddhist clergy and laymen that monks should not be drivers. There is immense respect attached to it," he said.
"If we permitted monks to obtain driving licenses and drive motor cars, you would soon see monks on the driving seat carrying laymen in their cars. It is the laymen who attend on monks. It has been a cultural aspect and one born out of respect for monks," he said.
Commenting on the situation that some monks are running occult service establishments, the Nayaka Thera said, "There was a case recently in Avissawella, where a lay family had been affected by some activities of a so called guru haamuduruwo at an astrology office. We just cannot afford such instances to manifest."
"These are things we have discussed with those who had presented this Bill.
However, I must get a copy of the draft Bill, as I have not seen it yet," he added.
