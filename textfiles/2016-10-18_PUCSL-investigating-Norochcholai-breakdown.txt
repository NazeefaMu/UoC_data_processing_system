PUCSL investigating Norochcholai breakdown


	

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) said today it was carrying out an investigation into the breakdown at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant.

PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said the country had experienced several blackouts earlier this year after the power plant broke down at various times.

“The country is not experiencing blackouts because the CEB implemented our recommendations after what happened earlier this year,” he said and added that even though the power plant had broken down the country was not in the dark.

The NCCP supplies 900 megawatts to the national grid. All three power plants came to a standstill last Saturday as a result of a breakdown which led to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) imposing a 90-minute power cut countrywide except in the Colombo City, industrial areas and hospitals.
