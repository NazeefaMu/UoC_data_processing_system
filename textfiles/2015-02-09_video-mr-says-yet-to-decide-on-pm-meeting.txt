Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today paid a visit to former Health Minister Tissa Attanayake, who was remanded on charges of forgery at the Welikada Prison Hospital.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he also visited a Navy soldier named Amaraweera in the prison.
“I was hoping to visit (Premalal) Jayasekara too but he has been taken to Kuruvita,” he told journalists outside the prison.  
When asked whether he was invited to the public forum to be held on February 18 in Nugegoda on fielding him as United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Prime Ministerial candidate, Mr. Rajapaksa said he has not been invited.
“I just came from the home town. I haven’t received any information about such a meeting,” he said.Video by Sanath Desmond
