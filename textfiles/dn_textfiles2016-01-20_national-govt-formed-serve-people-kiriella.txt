National Govt. formed to serve people - Kiriella

President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did not form this National Government to distribute Ministries, but, to solve the country's problems," said Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
The minister was speaking at a tree planting ceremony organized by the Road Development Authority to yesterday celebrate President Maithripala Sirisena's completion of one year in office.
The minister said it was exactly one year ago that Maithripala Sirisena became President by ridding the country of a dictatorship. Today, we celebrate the completion of one year since that historic moment. "The President and Prime Minister promised to form a National Government. Today, the two main parties, the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party have got together and formed a National Government. This National Government wasn't formed to distribute Ministries among the parties.It was formed to provide permanent solutions to the problems facing the country. Therefore, we must protect this government like protecting the environment," Minister Kiriella said.
"If our environment is destroyed, the world will be destroyed. Even though Sri Lanka is a small country, we give priority to environment protection. Sri Lanka has signed many international agreements towards the protection of the environment, when even some developed countries have failed to do so. The developed countries are the main cause for environmental pollution, and have understood the importance of protecting the environment."he said.
"When new projects are initiated, they provide job opportunities and bring profits etc. But, on the other hand the environment gets polluted. We have to find ways of balancing development with environment protection.Sri Lanka has given pride of place to environment protection from ancient times. Epigraphs of King Pandukabhaya stand as proof to this,"Minister Kiriella added.
State Minister of Highways Dilan Perera, Charmaine Kiriella, Private Secretary to Higher Education and Highways Minister Chamindrani Kiriella, Road Development Authority and Higher Education and Highways Ministry officials were also present on the occasion.
