A mid-night visitor at house warming party


	

This fair one once in politics moved into a mansion built in the Madiwela area the other day and a grand party was held to mark the house-warming.




The guests including a number of popular film stars were having a gala time when they were surprised by a mid-night visitor.  


The visitor, a onetime leading politician in the country had been a long standing mentor of the fair host. 


The politician, they say, had used his influence to help the lady in many ways and she had obtained massive bank loans when he was in power. And he had protected her even when she was about to be blacklisted for defaulting on loan repayments.
