As a parent, there are a number of vital things that you plan for when your child is young. Things like where they’ll attend school, what sports you’ll encourage them to play and even what musical instrument they’ll learn. 


“The cost of raising a child has gone up significantly in recent years for Sri Lankans, spurred on by rising costs associated with every facet of our lives, from food, to transport, to tuition fees which means your savings may not be able to keep up with the rise in costs,” said NDB Wealth Financial Planner Christina Wesley. 


Yet, there’s another big decision that if made when your child is young, can really get them off on the right foot.


Setting up a savings account for your child and teaching them good financial habits early, are the simplest and easiest ways to ensure that your child is on track for a bright financial future. However, sometimes it can be difficult to know where to begin. 
To help you secure your child’s future, expert financial planner NDB Wealth offers a real-world solution for children’s savings, which far exceeds the minimal returns offered by traditional children’s savings accounts.  Wesley was also quick to point out that savings plans offered by NDB Wealth puts rupees earned straight back into your child’s account and not into the price of a ‘free’ toy or trip as promoted by traditional children’s savings accounts.


The ‘Kids Saver’ account from NDB Wealth is unique because it is designed to give you and your child what you truly need from a hardworking savings account. Comparatively higher rates of interest earn significant returns while your money can be withdrawn in emergencies without having to pay penalties.
