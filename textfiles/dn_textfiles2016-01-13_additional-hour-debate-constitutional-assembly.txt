Additional hour for debate on Constitutional Assembly

The debate on the resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly was extended by an hour yesterday.
The debate which was to be ended at 1.30 pm was extended up to 2.30pm following a request made by the joint Opposition.
Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardane requested for more time stating that ample time had not been allocated for the joint opposition.
"We have been given only 12 minutes to speak. This is like suppressing the opposition MPs," he said. Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said depriving the time by the members of the joint Opposition is a kind of bulldozing the voice of the Opposition.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said more than 50 minutes out of the total of 75 minutes has been given to the UPFA.
He said the UPFA members are on both government and opposition benches and this was not fair.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella proposed to extend the session by an hour which was unanimously approved.
