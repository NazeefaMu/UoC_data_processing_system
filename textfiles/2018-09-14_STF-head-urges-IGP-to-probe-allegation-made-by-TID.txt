Police Special Task Force (STF) Commandant Senior DIG M. R. Latheef said he would discuss with IGP Pujith Jayasundara regarding the investigation into the allegations levelled against the DIG in charge of the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID).

During a media briefing in Kandy on Wednesday, Anti Corruption Force Director Namal Kumara revealed that DIG in charge of TID Nalaka de Silva had allegedly tried to use him to frame STF Commandant Senior DIG M. R. Latheef.

The Commandant said yesterday that he was in discussion with the Police Headquarters to take further action as his name was mentioned in the conversation.

He said he would have a discussion with the IGP on the possibility of handing over the investigation to the CID, instead of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). (Darshana Sanjeewa)
