	Police arrested a former militant of the proscribed LTTE and seized 75 cyanide capsules, 300 gm of cyanide, four Global Positioning System sets and seven mobile phones at coastal Uchipulli, near Rameswaram on Monday.
	The seizure of the suicide pills carried by the LTTE militants tied around their necks triggered speculation that the LTTE was trying to revive the movement after it was defeated by the Lankan forces in the civil war, which ended in 2009. The police also seized seven mobile phones, Rs. 46,200 in Indian currency, Rs. 19,300 in Sri Lankan currency, Indian and Sri Lankan driving licences from the Lankan Tamil, identified as K Krishnakumar (39), who had served in the LTTE in the 1990s and came to Tamil Nadu in 2009.
	Acting on a tip-off, a Special Branch team, led by Inspector of police Vellaiyappan arrested the Sri Lankan Tamil along with two local Tamils R Sasikumar (25) and N Rajendran (44), who reportedly brought him from Madurai bus stand in a car to Uchipulli, police said.
	After registering with K K Nagar police station in Tiruchi, he was staying outside the refugee camp, Q branch sources told The Hindu. The duo brought him to arrange for his clandestine return to Jaffna by sea route, the sources said.
