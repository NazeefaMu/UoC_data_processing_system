	Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera today sounded a warning to the government over an ISIS attack on this country within a year.
	He said this while addressing a media briefing at Kirulapona yesterday.“Several bomb blasts will rock Sri Lanka within a year. We make this prediction with responsibility. As predicted by us earlier, a Sri Lankan Muslim from Galewela was killed while fighting for ISIS in Syria recently. Every prediction we have made have become reality,” the Thera said.
	The Yahapalana Government has destabilised the local intelligence service, therefore, international terrorist organizations such as ISIS can easily engage in carrying out their hidden agenda inside the country, the prelate charged.
	Due to lax VISA regulations, Sri Lanka is fast becoming a hotspot for terrorist activities for them to spread fear among our people.“Three State Intelligence Service officers were detained under a detention order and they were imprisoned for three months without any bail conditions being set. No one is bothered about their release. If the Yahapalana government and the NGO’s are contemplating the release of ex-LTTE cadres - who had been remanded for serious war crimes - why can’t the government take some initiative to release these intelligence officers?” he questioned.
	“The previous government was more concerned about national security. They were planning to build a military headquarters, but the present rulers have terminated the process and are trying to push the country into a dangerous situation. The construction site of the military headquarters was later converted into a shopping complex by this government,” he further said.
	“The present regime is pushing the country’s development process backwards due to many projects that were halted by them,” The Thera added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
