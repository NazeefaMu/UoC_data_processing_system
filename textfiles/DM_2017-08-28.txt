A depressing journey with a dementia patient
	


Isnt it heart breaking to see your mother getting entrapped in the shadow of forgetfullness, little by little Its frustrating when you feel that theres nothing you can do about it. Often she cant remember who you are. She doesnt even know who she is and why she is living in your home with the rest of the family members, who might now be total strangers for her. Today our Q & A session on this timely topic, Dementia, is with Dr. Sajeewana Amarasinghe, the consultant psychiatrist at the Awissawella Base Hospital. Amarasinghe said that early identification of dementia is important as treatment can help delay its progression. Unfortunately in many the disease remains undetected until it becomes very advanced, Dr. Amarasinghe said.


Definition
Dementia causes gradual atrophy of the brain cells. This condition results in impaired memory, language and thinking ability and the patient wont be able attend to daily activities. As the disease progresses there will be personality and behavioural changes. Dementia isnt normal ageing. We all know that there will be some impairment of memory as people reach an advanced age. But dementia is much worse and is gradually progressive. 
Around 5-7% of the worlds population over 60 years of age are affected by this condition. 
The increased life expectancy and reduced birth rates have resulted in a proportionate increase in the elderly population. This has made dementia an increasingly important public health issue. 
The types
Alzheimers disease is the commonest type of dementia. It causes a gradually worsening of memory loss. 
There are two main types. 
1. The pre-senile (early onset) type occurs in patients under the age of 65 and is mainly caused by genetic factors. 
2. The senile type (late onset) occurs in the over 65 age group. 
Vascular Dementia is due to multiple cerebral infarctions. It occurs in an older age group (late sixties and seventies) and the symptoms progress in a step-wise manner. The main risk factors for vascular dementia are obesity, high cholesterol levels, smoking and hypertension. 
There are other less common types of dementia like Lewy body dementia, Fronto Temporal Dementia, Parkinsons disease and HIV. 
According to Dr. Amarasinghe, most types of dementia arent curable and treatment can only slow down the progress of the illness. But there are some rare types of dementia that can be cured. Therefore its important that every patient undergoes the initial investigations to find out the underlying cause of the disease. 

How to identify a patient
0aspect when it comes to Dementia Dr. Amarasinghe stated. One needs to be vigilant and identify patients in the initial stage when the only symptom is lack of memory regarding recent events.For an example, they will fail to recall where they kept the car keys or wallet. They will keep forgetting dates and appointments. They may ask the same question repeatedly because they forget the answer. 
According to Dr. Amarasinghe, these early features of Dementia may go unnoticed as family members may consider it a part of normal ageing. This is specially because long-term memory remains intact at this early stage and the patient may quite easily recall his or her younger days. 
Untreated Dementia slowly progresses into a stage where the patients long-term memory as well as language and reasoning powers become impaired. They may develop personality as well as behavioural changes. Unfortunately many people seek medical attention only at this stage. 

Gradually progressing memory loss
They may get lost in familiar surroundings. They may forget that they have taken their meals and repeatedly ask for food.This leads to the inability of recognizing close associates, including family members. They may even forget their personal information. Eventually they may even neglect their personal hygiene and will need full time care. 

Language difficulties
Patients may have difficulties in naming objects. They also find it difficult to find the right words when speaking. They may start making uncharacteristic writing and spelling errors. 

Cognitive functions
Patients will lose their ability to plan and organize things. They have poor judgment and may not be able to make rational decisions.They have poor understanding of safety. 

Visuospatial impairment
Initially they may not be able to find their way in unfamiliar surroundings but later on they may even get lost in familiar neighbourhoods. 
They will also develop difficulties in doing familiar tasks like dressing and cooking. 

Personality and behavioural changes
Patients may develop changes in their personality. Generally there will be an exaggeration in existing personality traits. 
They may become suspicious and wrongly believe that family members are stealing their belongings. This may lead to argumentsand fights. 
They may also start hearing voices or seeing things that dont exist. This phenomenon is called hallucinations. This might make them angry and agitated. 
Their moods might fluctuate frequently. Some may become depressed while others may be predominantly irritable or anxious. 
In severe dementia patients may develop socially inappropriate behaviors like passing urine in public. This will make the carers tasks more difficult. 

Confirmation
Cognitive testing can be done toconfirm dementia. 
They are also useful in tracking the progression of the illness. In addition certain tests may be needed to find out the cause of dementia. This includes blood tests as well as brain imaging, explained Dr. Amarasinghe 
Do other illnessesshare similarities
Yes. A predominant feature in elderly people is memory loss. Depression is a disorder characterized by symptoms like persistent low mood, lack of interest and lack of pleasure. This is very much a treatable illness. 
This is another reason that one should seek early medical attention. The memory loss will disappear when the depression is treated. 

Treatment
Unfortunately, there is no cure for most forms of Dementia. This includes the commonest types like Alzheimers Dementia and Vascular Dementia.But there are medications that help to slow down the progression of the disease. 

Managing the patient
These symptoms are a huge challenge and cause a great deal of stress to the family
and carers. 
There are medications as well as psychological and behavioral therapies that help. Some therapies help to reduce mood fluctuations. While others help to cope with with memory loss. Stimulating therapies like music and art are helpful. 

Help
We should help patients to live an independent life as much as possible while minimizing risks. Care givers need to ensure that patients have a good balanced diet and help them maintain
personal hygiene. 
Some form of exercise as well as social interaction is very helpful. The family can help a patient by reminiscing about the past. Photographs are helpful in this regard. Many find it relaxing as they are more comfortable talking about the past. This is because those memories are intact until the dementia becomes advanced,said Dr. Amarasinghe.

Minimizing risk
You may need to make some modifications to the home. Installing hand rails on the walls and improving lighting will help prevent falls. Supervision plus the use of electric equipment may be needed to avoid accidents. The doors can be locked to prevent the patient from wandering about and getting lost. Memory aids like displaying emergency telephone numbers will be helpful to the patient,he said.

Prevention
Keeping active both physically and mentally is essential. It is also important to maintain a healthy balanced diet which can help prevent the onset of dementia. 

Preparing for the future
Patients with dementia may deteriorate to a level where they can no longer attend to their financial transactions or write a will. Therefore it is wise to take early legal measures like completing their wills, opening joint bank accounts and giving the power of attorney to a trusted person, concluded
Dr. Amarasinghe.

## Title: Appendicitis Miles of trouble originating from a centimetre

Appendicitis Miles of trouble originating from a centimetre
	


Appendix is a tube shaped organ believed to be a remnant from a time that our ancestors relied on plants as their main source of energy. To aid them in digestion, they had a large cecum, a part of the large intestine. In those glory days, we had the ability to digest cellulose, or fibers as the story goes. But with the expansion of our diet, our need to digest fibers for energy dwindled and so did the organ. This resulted in the shrinkage of the appendix over several generations to the size that it is today. This organ is said to act as a store for good bacteria, though the subject is controversial. The appendix is situated at the junction where ileum or the terminal part of the small intestine meets the cecum of the large intestine. Its usually 7.5-10 mm long. The beginning usually lies in a fixed point below the navel called the McBurnys point) though its length and the lie of the blind end can vary. 

Definition
However insignificant functional wise, this little troublemaker still manages to make its presence known to us in the form of appendicitis or the inflammation of the appendix. Its usually believed to be caused by the obstruction of the lumen by various means such as mass of digested food and other material, by a tumour and on rare occasions is caused when intestinal worms block the tube. Therefore the secretions inside the now enclosed surface get collected. This condition then locks the venous supply to the appendix that removes the excess tissue fluid which provides the ideal environment for bacteria to grow.
If not treated at the appropriate time, the lack of blood supply may cause the appendix to necrose, thus releasing the bacteria into the abdominal cavity.
This condition is more common in children and young adults.


  2.Symptoms

Lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting accompanied by fever and right lower abdominal pain are the usual signs. The duration of the abdominal pain is interesting. In most cases, the pain initially appearing is dull and is experienced around the navel area and later moves to the McBurnys point in the form of a sharp severe pain.
The patient may have tenderness over that area and he may be reluctant to move, preferring to lie still in a curled up position. 
But the saying Nothing is set in stone is especially true when it comes to medicine. Therefore even though the textbooks describe the above as the common presentation, there are many other ways that an appendicitis patient can describe his condition. For an example, they can complain about the left side or of apoorly localized abdominal pain. 
Diagnosis is mainly clinical, with investigations done to further confirm the diagnosis.

 3. Treatment 
Surgery is recommended in almost all cases. Appendectomy is one of the commonest abdominal surgeries where the inflamed appendix is removed through a small incision in the abdomen. 

 4. Ruptures 
If treatment is delayed by more than two days, there is a risk of the inflamed and oedematous appendix bursting. This will then release infectious material to the outside of bowel loop. Even though our gastrointestinal system contains plenty of micro organisms, all of them are contained inside the bowel tubes. In case of a ruptured appendix, the infectious material is released in to the sterile abdominal cavity. Imagine a sewage pipe bursting and releasing its content into a sterile room. 
This in turn gives rise to another, more serious condition called peritonitis. Peritonitis needs immediate aggressive antibiotic therapy to be cured. Even then this condition might lead to future complications like bowel obstruction. 

 5. Differential diagnosis
When a person enters the Emergency Room at the onset and complains of sudden severe persistent abdominal pain, it is called acute abdomen. This may be due to various pathophysiologies of which one of the commonest is appendicitis. 
When a patient is presented with suspected appendicitis, its important to exclude other serious conditions that need immediate intervention. In females of childbearing age, a pregnancy is always excluded because a tubal ectopic pregnancy-which also causes similar symptoms to those of appendicitis-may be fatal if ruptured. In adolescent males, testicular torsion can present as appendicitis and if not reversed back to its previous position within a few hours, it may result in removal of that testicle. 

 6. Advice


Dont panic if you or your child complains of abdominal pain. Its likely due to a simple cause like acute gastroenteritis. But always be alert and seek immediate medical attention if there are suspicions. In the case of suspected appendicitis, dont give the patient anything to eat or drink until you seek a doctors advice. This is because he may have to undergo immediate surgery. Giving him food or water may be a cause to delay surgery. 

In case there is abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention if:

The pain is severe,
	Pain lasts for more than six hours 
	Pain is aggravated by movements 
	Abdominal pain that starts centrally later moves to a distinct area in the right (rarely does this pain shifts to the left lower abdomen)

Attempts to damage unity among communities: A big blow to national integration
	
Former parliamentarian M. M. Zuhair PC delivering the Zahira College, Colombo 125th anniversary Founders Day Oration at the College Gaffoor Hall on Monday, August 21, 2017 said that Muslims of Sri Lanka have to be mindful of current developments. Left under the carpet, some of these issues can cause serious harm to the community. 
He said, During the past 8 years - following the end of the war, several issues concerning our community have been raised by extremist groups in the country. These groups are a small minority. The issues raised are based on false fears, unfounded utterances, fanciful fabrications and mind-boggling myths. But some of these issues require the careful consideration of the community. Principal of Zahira College Mr. Trizvy Marikkar presided. 
Speaking further Mr. Zuhair said Muslims need to recognize two important factors. Firstly, lies and untruths repeatedly uttered by those making the allegations have created a spectrum of prejudices against us, among a wider section of the people. We need to understand the feelings of this wider section, some of whom genuinely believe the allegations to be true. There is a need to address this group differently from those who spread lies and deception. We need for instance, calm and convincing responses. Some responses in the social media are counter-productive and often abusive. 
"Appropriate steps must be taken to ensure that the trust and confidence in our loyalty and patriotism to our motherland, meticulously built by our fore-fathers over the past 12 centuries, are not damaged or dented"

Secondly, he said that we need to understand that highly respected members of the Buddhist clergy have, since July 20th that is about a month ago, raised in a dignified manner, some issues that relate to our community as well. Regretfully, sections of the media have reported their views in an anti-minority perspective. We need to be mindful of the genuine concerns of the Buddhist clergy, even though most of them are based on false fears and past prejudices. The issues raised need careful understanding by the Muslim community. Appropriate steps must be taken to ensure that the trust and confidence in our loyalty and patriotism to our motherland, meticulously built by our fore-fathers over the past 12 centuries, are not damaged or dented. There are attempts to damage this bond of friendship and unity with the other communities. Such attempts will be a big blow to national integration and reconciliation. These are originating from vested interests outside our borders. Such attempts must be defeated.  There is an eerie feeling of insecurity, Zuhair said further, within the community since the end of the war in May 2009. The initial post-war euphoria shared by all communities, began to evaporate within months of the end of the war. Muslims contributions to the success of the Sri Lankan war on terrorism were soon overlooked. This war was certainly not against any community. It was against terrorism. It was against the division of our country. 
The entire country needs to be repeatedly reminded of the patriotic role of the Muslims in firstly not supporting the division of the country, secondly that because the Muslims did not support the division of the country, Muslims of the North and the East had to pay a heavy price, being evicted from the North, murdered in mosques in the East and causing extensive destruction of properties and livelihood; thirdly that Muslims particularly in the intelligence units of the armed forces such as Major Muthalif, Col. Lafir, Col. Nizam and hundreds of others played key roles in the war fronts and fourthly that Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Iran and Libya assisted substantially the government in its war efforts. None can forget these contributions
to the country. 
The point is, this war was never won by any single man. We as a community will never allow our patriotism to our country to be ever questioned. Amity is the foundation upon which national reconciliation and integration with respect for diversity could be built, he said. 
Principal Trizvy Marikkar, Vice Principals As-Shaikh A M Mihlar, M T A Rauff also addressed the well-attended gathering.

Beleaguered Theresa May to quit as Prime Minister on August 30, 2019
	
Theresa May is said to have revealed the date she will quit as Prime Minister - giving herself two years to see Brexit through first. 
She has chosen Friday August 30th 2019 as the day she will step down from 10 Downing Street, it has been reported. 
It comes amid a major charm offensive by Mrs. May in a bid to win the support of her MPs and avoid an awkward leadership challenge. 
The Prime Minister has been inviting groups of 15 Tories to her official Chequers country residence - handing them prosecco and homemade chocolates at the door as they arrive, according to the Mirror. 
Already more than a dozen Conservative politicians are said to have pledged to sign a letter calling for Mrs May to step down - although that falls far short of the 48 signatures needed to trigger a new leadership vote.  One Tory MP said: Its clear she wont lead us into another election and will be gone by September 2019. 
She invited MPs to Chequers to ensure there isnt a leadership contest in the meantime. But Downing Street has poured cold water on the reports, telling MailOnline: We have hit peak silly season.

Bus drives off a pier in southern Russia, killing 17 workers
	

DAILY MAIL, 27 August, 2017-- A bus carrying construction workers drove off a pier in southern Russia on Friday, killing at least 17 people, officials said. 
The bus was carrying workers who were building a pier for an oil company on the Black Sea coast not far from Crimea, the Investigative Committee said. Several oil companies are drilling for oil off the Russian Black Sea coast. 
Official accounts of how many workers were on the bus that plunged into the sea changed several times Friday morning. In the early afternoon, the Emergency Situations Ministry said 50 people had been on the bus - the 17 people found dead in the water in addition to 33 others who were rescued by divers. 
Eight people were hospitalized, five of them in serious condition, emergency officials said. 
Investigators didnt immediately say why the bus drove off the pier, but local officials pointed to faulty brakes. The Tass news agency quoted the town hall of the Temryuk district as saying that the bus drove along the pier for nearly a quarter of a mile before the brakes failed.

Conjugal happiness and a successful marriage
	

In countries in the orient like Sri Lanka and India marriage is considered as something sacrosanct  an inviolable sacred bond. People attach so much importance to marriage, they look ones success in marriage as ones success in life.
Therefore, even young couples in love, when it comes to the question of marriage, would want to find out whether their horoscopes are matching. They would want an astrologer to match the porondamas or the Kutas  astrological determinants of conjugal compatibility to ascertain whether their marriage would be a success. Matching of porondamas which people refer to as porondam gelapeema in Sinhala, is a widespread practice prevalent in our society. However, there are several astrological factors that enable a quick and accurate appraisal of the compatibility of horoscopes of a couple seeking matrimony.
Following are some of the astrological factors that serve as determinants of conjugal compatibility:
Natives of Taurus, Scorpio and Aquarius would make ideal partners for Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn natives
Gemini, Libra and Aquarius natives would be compatible partners for natives of fiery signs Aries, Leo and Sagittarius.
Natives of watery signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces would make good partners of natives of the earthy signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn.
Those born into fiery signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are not compatible with those born into watery signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces.
A couple seeking matrimony would be an ideal match if they have been born into the same Lagna or if one persons 5th sign happens to be the others 9th sign or if the 3rd sign is the other persons 11th sign.
If the sign Sun occupies in one horoscope is the sign where Moon occupies in the horoscope of the other, their marriage would be a great success.
If the sign in which Mars occupies in one horoscope is the same where Venus is posited in the other horoscope, their marriage would be a strong bond.
Venus occupying a sign owned by Mars in one horoscope while Mars occupying a sign owned by Venus in the other horoscope is a favourable position signifying a successful marriage. In fact, two young people, a boy and a girl with such a planetary position in their horoscopes would fall in love at first sight, say astrologers. Closer the Sun and the Moon to Jupiter or Venus better the position. It is more favourable if they are posited in trines to each other. If the Sun in one horoscope is posited in conjunction with Mars in the same sign as in the others horoscope their union would be a success.
The most important thing to ascertain in matching two horoscopes is whether the couple would remain devoted to each other until the death puts them asunder. The other important factor that should be determined is whether couple is mentally and physically fit to enjoy conjugal happiness. Another important factor is whether marriage would result in the birth of fortunate children.

PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the newly appointed Justice Minister should immediately reveal whether she had agreed to influence these independent authorities as a precondition for her appointment.
Former justice minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said he was removed because he didnt influence the Judiciary. Therefore, not only me but the whole nation has a doubt whether his successor agreed to do what he refused to do, he told a news briefing.
Meanwhile, the MP said the Attorney General, who met the Prime Minister and the footnote gang at Temple Trees, should reveal the rationale behind their meeting.
He said the former justice minister had said the AG was summoned and ridiculed during the said meeting though the AG says he was not summoned and that he requested for the meeting.
People believe that the Prime Minister and the footnote gang should be next summoned to the Bond Commission. Why did the AG want a meeting with the 'footnote' gang This will breach the people's confidence in the Bond Commission. Therefore, the AG must reveal what prompted him to meet the 'footnote gang', the MP said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Do not behave like Indian spectators: Arjuna
	
World Cup-winning cricket captain and Minister Arjuna Ranatunga today requested Sri Lankan Cricket lovers to stop behaving like Indian spectators at the end of cricket matches.
Addressing the media at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Head Office yesterday he said an incident had been reported as spectators had thrown plastic bottles into the ground during the third one day international cricket match between Sri Lanka and India at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele on Sunday.
Such incidents should not be repeated. Sri Lankans love cricket and they feel sad when we lose a match. We have made lots of sacrifices for cricket and those sacrifices had been made while loosing lots of things. Every cricketer in out team are mentally depressed, he said.
Therefore, I request our cricket lovers not to behave like Indian spectators. We have a very good history and culture. Such misbehaviour is not accepted in our culture and history, Mr. Ranatunga said.
"Several cricketers had been summoned before the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and I informed about it to President Maithripala Sirisena who promised to look into the matter", he said.
The outspoken Minister also said an interim committee has to be appointed to probe frauds and irregularities at Sri Lanka Cricket, alleging that cricket was now being virtually run by gamblers who have put cricket at stake. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Here comes the Osteoarthritis patient creaking,  limping and grinding!
	


There are different kinds of programs conducted to prevent non-communicable diseases in
Sri Lanka as well as around the world. But the majority of elders suffer from osteoarthritis of the knee joint worldwide. Your knee is the largest joint in the body. It is also one of the most complicated joints. It needs to be strong enough to carry our weight and must lock into position for us to stand upright. But it also has to act as a hinge, so we can walk. And it must withstand extreme stresses, twists and turns, actions common when we run or play sports. When your knee has osteoarthritis its surfaces become damaged and it doesnt move as well as it should do. Evidence shows that being overweight increases the strain on the joints  especially the knees. Being overweight not only increases your risk of developing osteoarthritis, but also makes it more likely that your arthritis will worsen over time. Because of the way your joints work, the force put on your knees when you walk- especially on stairs and slopes- can be several times your actual body weight. Losing even a small amount of weight can make a big difference to the strain placed on your weight-bearing joints. Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Sujeewa Weerasinghe, National Organizer of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, to educate readers on how to manage aknee that gives trouble. 

How the joint is damaged
The cartilage becomes rough and thin. This condition can develop on the main surface of your knee joint and in the cartilage underneath your kneecap. The bone underneath the cartilage reacts by growing thicker and becoming broader. All the tissues in your joint become more active than normal, as if your body is trying to repair the damage. The bone at the edge of your joint grows outwards, forming bony spurs called osteophytes. The synovium may swell and produce extra fluid, causing the joint to swell  this is called an effusion or sometimes water in the knee. The capsule and ligaments slowly thicken and contract. 

These changes in and around your joint are partly the result of the inflammatory process and partly an attempt by your body to repair the damage. In many cases the repairs that the body initiates within are quite successful. The changes inside your joint wont cause much pain or, if there is pain, itll be mild and may come and go. However, in other cases the repair doesnt work as well and your knee is damaged. This leads to instability and more weight being put onto other parts of the joint. This can cause symptoms to gradually worsen and be more persistent over time.The main symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee are:

Pain (particularly when youre moving your knees or at the end of the day  this usually gets better when you rest) 

Stiffness (especially after rest  this usually eases after a minute or so as you get moving) 
Crepitus, a creaking, crunching, grinding sensation when you move the joint. 
Hard swellings (caused by osteophytes) 
Soft swellings (caused by extra fluid in the joint). 
Other symptoms can include: 
Your knee giving way because your muscles have become weak or the joint structure is less stable
Your knee not moving as freely or as far as normal 
Your knees becoming bent and bowed 

The muscles around your joint looking thin or wasted. Its unusual, but some people have pain in their knee that wakes them up at night. This generally only happens with severe osteoarthritis. 

Youll probably find that your pain will vary and that you have good days and bad days, sometimes depending on how active youve been, but sometimes for no clear reason. 

Some people find that changes in the weather (especially damp weather and low pressure) make their pain and stiffness worse. This may be because nerve fibers in the capsule of their knee are sensitive to changes in atmospheric pressure. 

Many factors can increase your risk of osteoarthritis of the knee. Its most common if: 
Youre in your late 40s or older  this might be because your muscles have become weaker, your body is less able to heal itself or your joints have gradually worn out over time 
Youre a woman  osteoarthritis is more common and more severe in women 
Youre overweight  this increases the chances of developing osteoarthritis and of it becoming
gradually worse 

Your parents or siblings have had osteoarthritis 
Youve had a knee injury, for example a torn meniscus 
Youve had an operation on your knee, for example a meniscectomy (to remove damaged cartilage) or repairs to your cruciate ligaments 

You do a hard, repetitive activity or a physically demanding job, for example farming or mining 
You have another type of joint disease which has damaged your joints, for example rheumatoid arthritis or gout. 

Arthritis Research UK has recently awarded a grant to investigate the use of new drugs to treat early-onset osteoarthritis, caused by injury. 

Theres no cure for osteoarthritis as yet, but theres a lot that you can do to improve your symptoms and reduce the chances of your arthritis becoming worse 

Its very important to keep your joints moving. You need to find the right balance between rest and exercise  little and often is usually the best approach. 

There are two types of exercise that you need to do:
A physiotherapist can advise you on the best exercises, but youll need to build them into your daily routine to get the maximum benefit from them. You can also talk to your GP about the Exercise on Prescription scheme thats available in some areas. Swimming is very good for people with osteoarthritis because the water supports your weight. In this form of exercise you wont put a undue strain on the joints. Hydrotherapy (exercises in a warm water) can help get muscles and joints working, and it can be very relaxing. 

If you know youre going to be more active than usual, try taking a painkiller before you start to avoid increased pain later. 

Apart from watching your weight, there are a number of other ways you can reduce the strain on your joints: 

Pace your activities through the day  dont tackle all the physical jobs at once. Break up the harder jobs and do something gentler in between. A chart can help you plan your daily activities and monitor them when they cause extreme tiredness (fatigue) or affect your symptoms. 
	Wear low-heeled shoes with soft, thick soles (trainers are ideal). Thicker soles will act as shock absorbers for your feet, knees, hips and back. High heels will alter the angle of your hips, knees and big toe joints and put extra strain on them. Use a walking stick to reduce the weight and stress placed on a painful hip or knee. A therapist or doctor can advise you on the correct length and the best way to use the stick. 
	Use the handrail for support when climbing stairs. Go upstairs one step at a time with your good leg first. 
	Dont keep your knee still in a bent position for too long as this will affect your muscles. 
	Think about modifying your home, car or workplace to reduce unnecessary strain on your joints. An occupational therapist can offer advise on how to protect the joints and feed you with information regarding special equipment or gadgets that will make your daily tasks easier. 
	Learn to relax your muscles and release tension from your body. A physiotherapist or occupational therapist can advise you on relaxation techniques. 
	Use heat/ice packs to help ease pain and stiffness. Heat lamps are popular, but a hot-water bottle or repeatable pad are just as good. A pack of frozen peas can be used as an ice pack. They can be helpful if you have a flare-up of pain when youve done a bit too much. Dont apply ice or heat packs directly to your skin! 
More evidence to support the use of knee braces for osteoarthritis is becoming available. Several types of braces can help to stabilize your kneecap and make it move correctly. You can buy knee braces from sports shops and chemists, but you should speak to your doctor or physiotherapist first. They may also be able to provide braces or recommend the best ones for you.

Hold Local Polls Now, Says JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday urged the Government to hold the Local Government elections immediately stating that there were no barriers preventing the poll now with the passing of Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill in Parliament last week.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news briefing that the Local Government elections could be held without further delays as the shortcomings of the Local Government Elections Bill, which was passed in 2012 had been corrected by the amendment.
The Speaker should endorse the Bill immediately while Local Government Minister should do the rest so that elections could be held within 70 days as assured by the Chairman of the Elections Commission, Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said the shortcomings, which were in the Local Government Election Bill originally passed in 2012, had been rectified.
The Amended Bill has ensured that the true will of the people is reflected by selecting 60 percent of the members through First Past the Post (FPP) system and 40 percent on Proportional Representation (PR) basis.
Only the two main parties could get their members elected under the original legislation as only 30 percent of the members are to elected on proportional representation basis, he said.
He said the reduction of deposit payment was another positive factor in the new legislation.
The Bill he said when taken as a whole was a victory for democracy.
Meanwhile, the JVP urged the Government to bring in the National Audit Bill so that Independent Audit Commission could carry out its work effectively.
Though an Independent Audit Commission is set up under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, its duties and powers are not determined effectively. These duties and power could only be determined by the Audit Bill, Mr. Dissanayake said.
In the meantime Mr. Dissanayake, who responded to a question raised by journalists on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, said his party would have to study the proposals.
We have to study the real aspirations of the Government in bringing this piece of legislation though we are favourable towards holding the elections of all Provincial Councils on the same day. However we cannot endorse postponing of elections on certain councils, he said. (Yohan Perera)

The problems evolved from the tense situation that occurred at the Kataragama Devalaya was solved after the discussions held with the chief Kapu Mahattaya, Somipala Ratnayake and five other Kapu Mahattayas, Buddhist Affairs Commissioner Nimal Kotuwegedara today said.
Speaking to journalists, he said that the shortcomings which were prevailing with regard to the possession of the keys had ended up with proper solutions; in addition to that, he said the problem was aggravated with the interference of Kataragama Maha Devalaya Basnayake Nilame D. P. Kumarage on August 22.
Although the Basnayake Nilame could not participate in the discussions, we will let him know the outcome of the meeting and hope he would agree with the decisions taken at the meeting, he added.
Meanwhile, the chief Kapu Mahattaya, Somipala Ratnayake admitted that the issue had been concluded with pertinent solutions and adding that they did not bother the absence of the Basnayake Nilame at the meeting.
We are happy that the crisis has been successfully resolved but still we insist that the Devalaya Basnayake Nilame should resign following his misbehavior at the Devalaya premises and the misuse of the Devalaya money and possessions he said.
However, the Basnayake Nilame D. P. Kumarage refuted the allegations made by Chief Kapu Mahattaya and said that he had accomplished his duties fairly well without grabbing anything from the Devalaya.
I am happy about the decisions taken at the meeting with the head of Buddhist Affairs Commissioner and I determine to render my service with the possible way I can without corruption, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Missing you Victoreen
	
It is nine years since God called Victoreen to eternal rest. Victoreen passed away peacefully on the 25th August 2008.Gods fingers touched her and took her last breath, closed her eyes and slipped her away to the land of no more pain. Victoreen was loving, caring and was the greatest blessing in my life. She gave life to our children and when I needed hope and inspiration she was strong. We loved each other dearly and it broke my heart to lose her.
Vicky, the day I first held you and kissed your sweet face are precious memories time cannot erase. Youre gone so far away and left me alone, my days and nights are turned so lonely dear since youve been gone. I recall your tender smile and the lovely things you said when you and I were partners in life. I still remember what Victoreen told me when we decided to get married.
What Victoreen told me was Kamil marriages are made in heaven and if God wants our marriage to take place, no one can stop our marriage even if anyone tries, and that would be the day God unites us and we
will be one. 
With Gods blessings we got married and spent almost forty long happy years together and then God gave her rest. What we shared together will not be forgotten and it lives in my heart. Although I am in sadness that Victoreen is no longer here, her influence still guides me every minute, every hour, and every day. I still feel she is beside me caring and guiding me.  We thanked our lucky stars we found each other. Hand in hand we faced tomorrow with no fears. Now I face each day with hope and happy memories we
shared together. 


It broke my heart to walk beside you on that fateful day, the day you were laid to rest. You gave me years of happiness then came sorrow and tears. You left me with beautiful memories we shared through the years. 
For long as my love and my memories live my sadness goes on, as in my heart you are still living as every passing day goes by. You have gone from my sight but not from my heart. The memories of you will remain forever. No words I write can ever say how much I think of you every day. I pray for you in silence every day and hold you close in my heart. You were my ever loving wife and your memory will always be with me.
Vicky, all I have are memories and your photo in a frame. For all you gave through the years, your time, your love, your prayers and your patience, caring and sharing and for all this and more I still love you.You gave me something time can never take from me, a light to guide me when it gets dark andI can see.

"These special memories of you always bring a smile to me. You will never be forgotten as long as I am living, as I carry you safely tucked within my heart and your light will alwaysshine forever "

These special memories of you always bring a smile to me. You will never be forgotten as long as I am living, as I carry you safely tucked within my heart and your light will always
shine forever. 
Finally, thank you Victoreen for the wonderful and generous sacrifices you made for me, our children, and all the loving care and affection you showered on us. I remember not what I did for you, but I was for you, and what you were to me. Thank you for loving me and being what you were. 
Darling Vicky, our special years will not return. When you were with me together, but love within our hearts you will walk with me together. 
Till we meet again, Sadly missed by your loving husband

MYTH: Eating pineapple and unripe papaw can cause a pregnant woman to miscarry. 
BUSTED: This hasnt been proved although most of our women believe in it. It was something said in the past and was a traditional belief, but its not true. Foods that should be avoided are those that are not fresh, food that has decayed, food that have been contained for a long time in preservatives, unhygienic food which is contaminated with bacteria and fecal matter, food that hasnt been tested, uncommonly eaten food. Food and drinks that contain a lot of sugar and alcohol should be avoided. Also if you dont know the composition of the food, it is better to not eat it. In addition to this the foods that contain trans fatty acids and deep fried food should be avoided. This is because it can be a problem to both the mother and the baby. Another food that should be avoided is the food that contains heavy metals such as deep sea fish, which contain a high level of mercury. Half boiled eggs also should be avoided, said Dr. U.D.P Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital

Numerical values and vibrations-  key to discover your potential
	


Numerology or Swar Shastra, the ancient science based on numbers and resonance value attributed to them, says that you are born with a set of numerical values that represent vibrational frequencies that go a long way in shaping your life and destiny. It is your date of birth that gives you first a set of numerical values. Another set of numerical value is created by the name you are given.

Numerical value of name and date of birth
The overall numerical value of name and the date of birth forms a design and a blueprint that can reveal ones potentialities.
Some people have two or more names. And now the question arises as to whether all names or one of them should be taken into account in determining the numerical value.

Identifying name carrying numerical value
According to both Western and Hindu numerologists the name that should be considered for determining the numerical value is the name that is commonly used to identify a person.
It is said that the Hindu works on Numerology have prescribed an experiment to determine the name that is commonly used to identify a person.
The experiment is as follows: You enter a room or a hall where about twenty to thirty people are fast asleep. You softly call out the commonly used name of a person among them. The person who wakes up in response to the call, when all other are still fast asleep really owns the name and it is that name that should be taken into account in determining the numerical value.
According to Western numerologists the Christian name or the surname whichever is commonly used should be taken into account in determining the numerical value.

The formula widely accepted as most effective
There are several formulas giving numerical value to the sounds or syllables reduced to the letters of the English alphabet. However, we wish to give a mix of two formulas, the Sumerian and the Pythagorean which great numerologists have found to be yielding the most satisfactory results. 
1 = A, I, J, Q, Y
2 = B, K, R
3 = C, G, L, S
4 = D, M, T
5 = E, H, N, S
6 = U, V, W
7 = O, Z
8= F, P
You will note that the Sumerian formula does not take 9 for reckoning the numerical value.
Accordingly, numerical value of the name SIRISENA is follows:
S = 3
I = 1
R = 2
I = 1
S = 3
E = 5
N = 5
A = 1
    -
   21
   = 
Life Path Number
The total numerical value of the name is arrived at by adding the numerical values of the letters, may not be in harmony with the Destiny Number derived from the numerical value of the birth of date.
Some numerologists describe the number representing the total numerical value of ones name as the Life Path Number.
If the Life Path Number is not identical with a number signifying a favourable effect, the person concerned can suitably change the name in such manner as to obtain a favourable numerical value.

## Title: Rat racing begins from Grade One

Rat racing begins from Grade One
	
School is to learn, the rest of the day belongs to you. You have a life to live chaps.
It is common knowledge that the term rat race better described as a rat marathon describes a frustrating financial lifestyle that is becoming harder and harder to beat. It is also seen as a marathon of satisfying a never- ending flow of transient wants. Excepting a handful of people who have not lost their heads, many others running the rat marathon have lost theirs. Perhaps only some indigenous people in an outback of nowhere have escaped it.

How the marathon works
The rat marathon is invariably connected to full-time occupations usually Monday to Friday. Some extend to Saturdays, Sundays, part-time and night shifts that have become part and parcel of the run. Desperate ones who think they are lagging behind in the race resort to moonlighting. Today, it is common to see the man of the house being unable to keep home fires smoldering let alone burning a situation that obliges the lady of the house to join the marathon. In addition to filling stomachs, many people who do not own houses live in rented ones while those who own houses keep paying never-ending mortgages. It also means whatever you do for a living you are saddled with paying bills and more bills regularly. A rainbow of other liabilities such as a mind-blowing hospital bill, another for a car repair or to replace the kitchen roof that took off in a Mach One gale also pop up unexpectedly. So man or woman from A-Z is in a never-ending rat race in meeting dues while aiming for and acquiring more while running the rat marathon. Just imagine walking on a treadmill; it describes you going nowhere.
Ill conceived
Rat marathoners suffer from a common malady; the impression that if they earn more and become well-heeled or appear to be so, they would be recognized in society. They do not notice that the more they earn the more they spend resulting in financial shortfalls. Yet, they are adept at declaring, money does not interest me, honest.
If that is so why are they practically killing themselves running the rat marathon No-one accepts the truth. Rat racing is due to a combination of factors; lack of choice and opportunity, inability to prioritise, not keeping things simple, unwilling to make changes, afraid of not having enough, short-sighted spending and matching the Joneses. They do not see the rat marathon as a type of social madness but keep loping along to reach a satisfying goal of all round goodness. But, no-one seems to reach that Utopia of sorts. Worse, even when they think they got there, it slips away.
How many stop to ask Why in the world am I running this never-ending marathon Is it worth itCant I slow down Not finding the right answers, runners keep pounding the track hoping that someday the running would end; but it does not unless you make a change in your lifestyle.
Starting young
Young people enter the job market after a university degree, a technical diploma, a professional qualification, soon after O Levels or A levels, through natural skills or through influence.
Presume you are one who got off the starting block in employment with potential for progress. You discard the bike you bought second hand to acquire a car, get married, build a house through a bank loan and stuff it with things. When the kids began to come; more things fill the house. Needs kept growing but money keeps falling short. The burn rate does not keep pace with the money made. You are in the rat marathon.
Many people declare they cannot say when they entered the rat marathon, but for most it began from the time they were admitted to school.
Remember the time you admitted your son to a Grade 1 class of a popular school, St Christophers College (not real name) where the competition was terrific. The interview that came after an aptitude test was an affair of searching thrusts and parries using blunt sabers to arrive at the size of the donation. To cut the story short junior was admitted to St Christophers to face the starters gun in a rat marathon similar to the one you began to run years ago in which you are still running.
The marathon for junior begins around 5.30 every day of school. Mother gets him into his running kit, rushes to pack a mid-morning snack and make certain every book in the Grade 1 booklist goes into juniors school bag. The idea was to be prepared like a Boys Scout because you never know which teacher would make a no-show and which teacher would use that time to take his own subject. But carrying a load of books to meet contingencies in the school time table is a job for a natambaya not a school kid. Complaints have been pouring in from parents, medical specialists and educational experts about the issue.
Unsurprisingly nothing has been done by the authorities. So parents and students have devised a way; dragging the book load in a travel bag with wheels; not to fly away but to go to school.
From Grade 1 to university there is no need to comment on the academic components of the rat marathon. It is a favourite subject of ridicule that remains untouched and unattended by the attendants making people wonder whether they have their heads screwed on right. The educational mess continues from Grade 1 right up to GCE A levels and creep into universities ingloriously.
After around 6 hours in school, junior gets home around 3 pm to have his first square meal for the day. But he is too tired to eat. Usually he sleeps; his bio-clock is not keeping pace with marathon running.
When mother and father get home after an 8 hour grind to relax in front of the TV, junior is ready for homework; tons of it. And he needs help because the nature and volume of assignments are such an adult hand is patently needed for junior to get through the tasks. In fact studies that should have been done in school have been surreptitiously palmed off as homework. The ultimate result is that junior runs an 8 hour plus rat race every day.
Pleasing others 
School time that should be an enjoyable period of learning has become a soul bruising period of stress and trauma. While junior keeps growing to be a senior, the workload becomes heavier and so does the competition. There is also pressure from parents, elder siblings even family members to do better and face charges of you are not doing enough how is it that Bevan is doing better than you At this rate youll end as a grave digger The school that wants its students to shine as beacons in the rat marathon poke in too. Consequently, after examination results it is not surprising to hear teachers and school heads tut-tutting at students progress reflected in exam marks. Expectations to perform and keep performing better make juniors life a misery. It is not a case of what the school can do for a student but what a student can do to enhance the prestige of the school and its marketability as an institution that produces successful citizens.
The rat marathon is not confined to classrooms. It slides into sports too. Disgustingly the lobbying of coaches by fathers and mothers is common in schools. There are rumours of money changing hands for special consideration for selection to school teams and that some mothers flirt with coaches and games masters to secure special privileges for their children. Not done is an apt label for the practice, but then it is part of the rat marathon syndrome.

	They do not see the rat marathon as a type of social madness
	
	
	How many stop to ask Why in the world am I running this never-ending marathon
	
	
	Many began to run the rat marathon from the time they were admitted to school
	
	
	The rat marathon is not confined to classrooms. It slides into sports too
	
	
	Students have been deprived from the pleasure in learning and later working making them slaves of a system
	

An Oxford attitude
In contrast to the modern-day rat marathon students run, I learnt a lesson during my own school days that helped me cultivate an important principle in striking a balance between working and living. 
Oh you two silly asses at the back there, what are you doing The whole class looked towards two characters who had been tittering over something at the back of the classroom. Addressing two reddening faces, Sinna as we called the master affectionately, went on, Why dont you chaps be attentive in class What I teach is more than enough for you to enter university. Surely you have other things to do after school hours Dont you want to lead a life of your own Sinna, an Oxford graduate was a great teacher; he did all the teaching in the classroom. He scoffed at home work. School is to learn, the rest of the day belongs to you. You have a life to live chaps.
I never forgot Sinnas question: dont you want to lead a life of your own
No teacher looks at education the old school way that produced great results. It is sad to see students of today being denied by such an approach in learning.
Who is to blame
Who is to blame for this situation Parents to begin with; they use bribery, criticism and create a sense of guilt in their children. I have done everything I possibly can for you; is this what you give in return
Teachers are also insensitive by saying that students are not responding enough to their efforts in teaching them. They may hint at laziness, not doing home work and complain that students are ungrateful. Society is also responsible and so are schools that prepare students leading to professional qualifications. In reality they are cram- and- pass exam factories. But, such successes satisfy parents and boost the image of the school.
A sense of mission, direction and vocation has not been imposed on the young.  They have been deprived from the pleasure in both learning and later working making them slaves of a system of our own makingthe great rat marathon
There is no doubt the rat marathon begins in schools where students are pressurised to compete and get ahead. Students are not in control of their lives because outside forces push them along with no pauses to catch their breath all to an unknown end.
It means that students lives hinge on living up to the expectations of others; not their own. 
So what is the answer to stressed out, harshly driven, ill-guided students overloaded with work running the rat marathon The powers that be have been fighting shy of moderating or placing clamps on marathon running in schools that matures unceremoniously to adulthood. But, they are still yawning and stretching in their armchairs. Get up and hurry sirs, the alarm that went off decades ago is still resonating. And remember the rat marathon begins at a tender age of six and the number of new runners is exploding.

September 1st to be declared National Insurance Day
	
In 2015, the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) began a journey to gain national recognition to increase thespread of awareness about the value of Insurance.
With the support of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL), the Marketing and Sales Forum ( MSF ) and the IASL sought the Governments approval to declare the 1st of September National Insurance Day.
Over the past two years the IASL has recognized and celebrated the month of September as, Insurance Awareness Month. Activation programs, media promotions, competitions etc. are organized and launched throughout the entire month in order to ensure the spread of Life and General Insurance awareness throughout the island.
However, this year will see the entire industry celebrate a day officially dedicated to Insurance in Sri Lanka. The 1st of September 2017 will see leading members of the insurance industry gather at the Independence Arcade in Colombo 07 for the official declaration ceremony of Sri Lankas first National Insurance Day.
Presiding over the days events as Chief Guest will be the Chairperson of the IBSL, Indrani Sugathadasa. Other dignitaries present will include; the Postmaster General, D.L.P Rohana Abeyratne, the Director General of the IBSL, Damayanthi Fernando, the President of the IASL, Deepthi Lokuarachchi and the CEOs and MDs of Insurance companies in Sri Lanka.
In honour of the occasion a commemorative stamp will be launched on the 1st of September at the ceremony at the Independence Arcade. Prior to the event the stamp will be officially presented to President Maithripala Sirisena on the 31st of August.
The IASL and the MSF have organized an extensive and widespread awareness campaign throughout September, including competitions, sales promotions, media campaigns, activations and numerous other programs. 
Given the very low level of penetration in Sri Lanka, the achievement of our goal to have the 1st of September declared National Insurance Day, is a tremendous achievement. It is a historic event that will be forever remembered among the Insurance community of Sri Lanka as well as the general public. Thus, serving as a means of increasing the influence of the industry and the spread of Insurance awareness throughout Sri Lanka, stated the Chairman of the MSF, Hashra Weerawardena.
The primary responsibility of the Insurance advisor is to help people get back on their feet following some form of calamity and loss. However, this task has often proved difficult over the recent years due to the lack of awareness about the value of General and Life Insurance among the public. It is our fervent hope that by naming a day in honor of Insurance and spreading our message of awareness throughout the island, we may see a drastic improvement in the industry, stated Deepthi Lokuarachchi, the President of the IASL.

SL military's professionalism prevailed: US (Rted) Admiral Fallon
	
The professionalism of the Sri Lankan military was able to prevail eventually allowing the work of re-stabilising the country in the aftermath of the tragedy or war which didnt seem to know boundaries leaving the people traumatised, Admiral William J. Fallon (Retd) of the US Navy said.
He said this when delivering the keynote speech at the Colombo Defence Seminar today.
He said he believed that the ending of the war had set a couple of examples to the rest of the world -- one being the people live in peace and security.
The second is that people continue to work, live and enjoy security throughout the world. However, we should keep in mind that lot of work needs to be done. Also, it is the responsibility of respective governments and State actors to pull together and contain violence for the best interests of today and tomorrow, he said.
There is no better example in the world than what really happened in this country by way of violence. Violence always needs a lots of collective action since expectations on the part of civilians are very high as far as their security is concerned. Audience here today may have experienced a cauldron of violence in different situations, although they are basically tragedies. I was in the Pentagon when 9 /11 strike took place. he said.
The two-day seminar on the theme Countering Violent Extremism: Global Trends is the 7th in the series of Defence Seminars first initiated in 2011 with the objective of establishing intellectual connectivity on preserving strategic national, regional and global security.
President Maithripala Sirisena participated as the Chief Guest while Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, State Minister of Defence, Tri-forces Commanders, Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara, former Secretary of Defence, Past Commanders, Senior Army tri-service Officers and a host of dignitaries were present at the inaugural ceremony.
Meanwhile, Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said the Sri Lanka Army was keen on restraining the re-emergence of violence on its shore and help maintain the security in the region and in Asia.
Delivering the welcome speech at the Seminar, the Commander said the Sri Lanka Army is to have done its duty in liberating the country from the three decades of terrorism.
With first-hand experience in defeating terrorism and being in possession of a highly-trained professional outfit, a potent combination in the contemporary setting, the Sri Lanka Army earnestly aspires to engage in sharing its related security expertise by playing a vigorous role in influencing the security architecture of Asia and the region, and to strengthen regional integration in security ties," he said.
The Commander said the Defence Seminar was initiated in 2011 with the intention of sharing experience and knowledge earned from a three-decade long terrorist that ended in 2009 after wiping out one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world.
Violence is one of the most challenging problems of our times. It doesn't matter any more of which part of the world you live in. The unfortunate reality is that violence spurred by terrorism has gone global and every human being is equally susceptible and vulnerable to its ferocity,  Lieut. Gen. Senanayake said.
Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne said this years seminar was organised not only to share the valued experiences gained by the military, but also to establish intellectual connectivity on preserving strategic national, regional and global security. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Spec-tacular Vision
## Section: Medicine

Spec-tacular Vision
	
Caring for your eyesight is very important. Defects and imperfections can cause hindrance to an individuals eyesight. Eyesight weakens with age too. These problems are commonly addressed by using spectacles (or eye glasses). Dr.M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital, answered questions posed by the public on eyesight, whether one needs spectacles and the importance ofobtaining them. 

Do I need spectacles 
The answer to that question depends on several tell-tale signs that give enough hints that you should visit your Ophthalmologist. Small kids often sit too close to the TV screens when watching television. According to Dr. Wijetunge, this often happens when the child fails to see long distances clearly. This is often misconceived as habit, but in reality their eyes need to be checked as prolonged negligence could worsen eyesight. 
Complaints from kids that they cant read the black or whiteboard when sitting at the back of the class are also a common indication that the child might
require glasses. 
Constant headaches, eye discomfort, watering eyes, constant blinking, squinting (when finding it hard to see things clearly) and finding it hard to read unless the book has to be held at a distance away from the eye are some of the signs to look out for, warned
Dr. Wijetunge. 
Eyesight is also said to weaken when a person reaches 40 years of age; which is known as Presbyopia. 
These symptoms signify the need for a vision check- up where ones eyes will be tested and spectacles will be prescribed by the doctor if the requirement arises. Such a need is confirmed through a vision test. Some people can identify objects at short distances, but not those that are far away. Some people might experience the reverse. Some people might fail in both. These are due to refractive defects in the eye which can be corrected by wearing spectacles. 
Purpose 
Spectacles are worn for different reasons, but all spectacles serve the purpose of enabling the patient to see well. Spectacles with the appropriate lenses, to correct a defective sight, will be recommended upon visiting an Ophthalmologist. 
Dr. Wijetunge equalized the human eye to a camera. Light rays fall on the retina. When a patient is able to see short distances, but has difficulty seeing long distances, it is known as myopia or more simply short sightedness. In this condition, the eye greatly focuses on light rays causing them to fall in front of the retina rather than on the retina. So the patient can only see things at a short distance. This condition is corrected by the glasses that contain concave lenses which cause the light rays to focus onto the retina, he explained. 
Dr. Wijetunge further described that when the light rays are focused less than usual, this caues the light rays to fall beyond the retina. These people have long sighted vision. This condition is known as long-sightedness or hypermetropia. Patients with this condition are prescribed glasses with convex lenses which corrects this defect,
he said.Another condition known as astigmatism can affect eyesight according to the retired eye surgeon. Astigmatism is caused by a defect in the curvature of the cornea of the eye. This is corrected by the prescription of glasses known as cylinders,he explained.

Its all in the lenses 
The most important and the main parts that fit the rimmed framework to make up a pair of spectacles are the lenses. It is also the part of the glasses that correct your visionary defect enabling better eyesight through the correction of the defect. The doctor listed out some types of lenses that are commonly used. There are various types of lenses. The variety includes concave lenses, convex lenses, bifocal lenses and varifocal lenses,
he said. As previously mentioned concave lenses are generally prescribed for shortsightedness and convex for long-sightedness. Bifocals are lenses that contain 2 parts with different focal lengths which improves a persons near vision through one part and improve long distance vision through the other. 
Varifocals are lenses that allow both long distance vision and near vision and all lengths of distances in between. This is used to correct defects such as presbyopia which is far sightedness caused by the loss of elasticity of the lens of the eye that occur typically in middle and old ages, commonly at the age of 40. 

Vision tests 
When a person first complains that eyesight seems to be weakening they are subjected to the most common visual acuity test which is the Snellens Chart. This test determines the strength of eye sight and helps the ophthalmologist decide whether glasses are needed. There are other tests such as refraction test, pin-hole test that are used to confirm defects in the eye. 

Caring for your spectacles 
Caring for the glasses that help care for your vision is important. There are a few things that have to be kept in mind when using glasses. They may be small things, but are important to keep your glasses fully effective and functional. Dr. Wijetunge explained that it is important to avoid keep your glasses scratch free. Washing glasses with mild soap and water is a way to keep your glasses clear. It is never advised to just use any type of cloth to dry the glasses. The glasses are usually provided with a cloth that should only be used in wiping your glasses, he explained. Its also recommended to remove the specs using both hands instead of with one hand, Dr. Wijetunge mentioned. He explained that using only one hand when wearing glasses could make them lopsided.

Texas troubles  are just starting as Harvey weakens
	

As Harveys winds die down, trouble for Texas has just begun as days of flooding rains across the heart of U.S. energy production threaten the countrys fourth-largest city and leave farmers struggling to save horses, cows and crops. 
Harvey smashed ashore as a Category 4 hurricane Friday near Rockport, Texas, a town left devastated. It was the strongest storm to hit the U.S. since 2004 and broke a 12-year record span in which the nation avoided being hit by a system ranked Category 3 or higher on the five-step Saffir Simpson scale. 
The storm may spur $1.59 billion in damages, according to catastrophe model results from Kinetic Analysis Corp., which said insured losses may be $1.11 billion. 
The storm is striking a region that has a cluster of refineries that process 5 million barrels of oil a day. 
In addition to the energy threat, crops and livestock may struggle to cope with rising waters, while airlines have canceled flights at multiple Texas airports. Because of where the storm has stalled, the Houston area could be in for days of torrential downpours and tornadoes. 
Harvey had maximum sustained winds of 70 miles (113 kilometers) per hour, the hurricane center said in an advisory at 1 p.m. local time.

Whats that clicking creaky noise
	

Are you worried about the noises that your knee makes Some call it a clicking sensation. Others describe this as a creaky, cracking or scratching noise. This usually happens when the knees move about, especially under pressure. Is this truly a dangerous condition What are the reasons behind these types of noises 
Before understanding this creaky feeling, lets find out what comprises the knee. The thigh has a long bone called the femur which ends up on top of a lower leg bone called the tibia. The exact site where these two bones meet is called the knee joint. Imagine balancing one long bone on top of another. This would be a very difficult task if not for the structures which fix the bones. There are several muscles which pass in front of and behind the knee. One huge muscle is your quadriceps and another group is named the hamstrings. There are also tight bands called ligaments which hold the joint steady. In front of the knee joint proper there is this small bone named patella(knee cap). Ideally this should slide over the knee joint during all movements. If sliding is hindered, pain is the result, especially when using the stairs. 
The knee is called a hinge joint because it moves only in one plane. You can bend the knee and straighten it out. Although termed a hinge joint the exact situation is much different. The knee joint involves a bit of rotation as well. All these factors predispose to lots of injuries. 
Returning to the clicking knee, mainly three conditions may give rise to this. Clicking is medically termed crepitations. 
The first reason is the passage of air bubbles mixed with joint fluid from one compartment of your knee joint to another. This is usually painless. Your knee has several compartments or rooms. When you move about the knee, the tiny amount of fluid meant to lubricate the inner surface of joint and some small air bubbles, pass under pressure from one place to another. This makes a noise. No treatmentis necessary. 
The second reason is rubbing of bands called tendons and ligaments that surround any persons knees. As mentioned before these bands are meant to hold the knee in place. When these ligaments or tendons rapidly slide on top of each other, the cracking sensation can be felt. Then again this is painless and no treatment is required. 
The third reason is worn out cartilage inside the knee. The cartilage is a spongy slippery surface covering the two huge bones of the knee. It also covers one side of the knee cap (oval shaped bone at the front of the knee). The role of the cartilage is to protect the underlying bone from friction damage. The cartilage can be damaged because of many reasons. Osteoarthritis is one key reason. Previous injury to the knee might be another. Then, engaging in strenuous sports like rugby or football for many years can damage the cartilage. The movements are painful to do and continuous clicking/ creaking is felt when the knee is bent (or extended). 
Contrary to the popular belief there are methods to prevent cartilage wear and tear in western medicine. There is also treatment available to prevent pain. If we strengthen the muscles, this would stabilise the knee and prevent unnecessary movement. The patients who have osteoarthritis need motivation in abundance to continue exercising till benefits are achieved.
