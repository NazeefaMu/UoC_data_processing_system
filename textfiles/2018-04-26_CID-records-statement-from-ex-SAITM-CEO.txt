The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today recorded a statement from former SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senaratne over the shooting which took place in Malabe last year.

The CEO escaped unhurt on February 6, 2017 when two men on a motor bike wearing full-face helmets opened fire at the car, driven by him near the SAITM campus in Malabe.

However, it was later revealed that Dr. Senaratne had allegedly staged the shooting together with a Pradeshiya Saba member.

Meanwhile, on April 18 this year, Kaduwela Municipal Councilor Lakmal Kushantha was arrested by the CID in connection with the shooting. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
