The Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT Campus) recently held its Foundation Awards ceremony for the 9th consecutive year at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI), Colombo 7, to felicitate 78 students who had successfully completed the Foundation Certificate in Higher Education.

Special accolades were awarded to K Kumaresan and M.M.N.B Paaris who topped the September and January intake batches respectively for the Foundation Certificate.
All 78 students who had successfully completed the Foundation Certificate in Higher Education will be eligible to follow the University of Westminster internal undergraduate degree programmes in either Software Engineering, Information Systems with Business Management and Computer Science.
IIT offers a unique opportunity for students just after A/L and O/L to follow world renowned internal British degrees through the Foundation Programme in IT and Business. It caters to students who are unable to enter a local university as a result of limited admission and for those who wish to commence their higher education just after O/L.
The one year Foundation Programme in Business and Foundation Programme in IT is designed to fast track students to obtain their internal British degree.
The two Foundation Programmesare a blend of academic and work-based learning, equipping students with the knowledge, understanding and skills relevant to employment
The Foundation Progranmes are designed and developed in partnership with employers and are highly valued by both employers and students.
The limited intake for a class for the Foundation Programmes ensures that students receive dedicated attention which is vital, given that in any field the foundation must be solid in order for the entirety to be a success.
