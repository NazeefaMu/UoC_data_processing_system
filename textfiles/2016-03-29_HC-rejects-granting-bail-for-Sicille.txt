HC rejects granting bail for Sicille


	

The Colombo High Court Today rejected granting bail for Sicille Kotelawala, in connection with the Golden Key case, because of the failure to produce a Government executive officer as one of the sureties.

Earlier, the Appeal Court had granted her a cash bail of Rs.100,000 with two sureties of Rs.1,000,000 each by the Court of Appeal.

However, High Court Judge Manilal Waidyathilaka postponed the case for March 31 for the sureties to be present in Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
