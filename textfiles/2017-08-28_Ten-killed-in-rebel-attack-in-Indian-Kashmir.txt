SRINAGAR AFP Aug 26, 2017 - A day-long gun battle Saturday left at least 10 dead in Indian-administered Kashmir as militants stormed a police facility in a pre-dawn attack, authorities said.   


The militants, believed to be three in number, detonated grenades and fired automatic assault rifles to gain entry to the police headquarters in southern Pulwama district which also houses families of some officers, director general of police S.P. Vaid said.   


One police officer was killed in the initial assault, while three paramilitary troops were injured and evacuated to a nearby hospital, he said.
