The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday, the statement made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that he would only recognise the status quo that prevailed in Parliament before the appointment of the new prime minister was an indication that the new government was illegal.

UNP Spokesman Harin Fernando told a media briefing that the Speaker had made it clear through his statement that the appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa was unlawful.

“We are confident that those who crossed over to the other side would return to us as they would realize that they have accepted ministerial portfolios in an illegal government,” he said.

MP Ajith P Perera said the Speaker had actually accepted that UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Prime Minister of this country till a new Member of Parliament manages to muster the support of a majority of parliamentarians.

“As such the appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa and that of ministers and the others are null and void,” he said.

Mr. Perera said the Speaker should convene Parliament at least on November 7 because he could do it based on the interpretation given by former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera in 2003 that the Prorogation of the House is done by the President not through his executive powers but as a matter of administration of the House. He said the Speaker could convene the House as he holds the administrative powers of Parliament. (Yohan Perera)
