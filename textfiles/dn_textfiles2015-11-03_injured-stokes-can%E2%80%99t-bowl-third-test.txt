Injured Stokes can’t bowl in third Test

England all-rounder Ben Stokes will not bowl any further in the third and final Test against Pakistan after injuring his shoulder, the team spokesman said Monday.
The 24-year-old fell on his right shoulder during the first day's play in the third Test in Sharjah on Sunday while taking a catch and had to walk off the ground in great discomfort.
The England team management had a scan of Stokes's shoulder on Monday before announcing he will be further assessed.
"He (Stokes) has been ruled out of bowling for the rest of the third Test. We will make a decision on batting as and when depending on circumstances. There will be a detailed diagnosis on Tuesday," said the spokesman.
"It’s a right shoulder injury and the specialist will be looking at the scan overnight. Our doctor will then talk to him. There is definitely no chance of him bowling. If we need him to bat we will make the decision whenever."
Stokes bowled 11 overs in Pakistan's first innings of 234 without taking a wicket.
England replied strongly with 222-4 after day two, trailing by just 12 runs with six wickets intact.
England will be hoping for a big lead and that Stokes can contribute with the bat in their bids to level the three-match series after losing the second Test in Dubai.
The first Test ended in a draw in Abu Dhabi.
