Janashakthi General Insurance Limited recently announced an exciting array of new benefits for its Full Option personal car policyholders, which include a free personal accident cover of up to Rs.5 million for the entire family and a free household cover of Rs.2 million. 
The new policyholders and existing policyholders who renew their policies during January 1, 2017 – April 30, 2017 will be eligible to be part of this exciting offer. 
“As a leading insurance provider in Sri Lanka, we strive to give peace of mind to our customers by giving them the assurance of guaranteed protection at all times. By adding benefits such as a free personal accident cover valued at Rs.5 million and a free household cover of Rs.2 million to what is already a comprehensive insurance solution, we believe that we are able to offer protection to the most important needs of our customers and their loved ones. 
We look forward to seeing personal car owners avail of this opportunity during this period and secure their vehicles and the lives of their loved ones through this exciting extension to the Full Option personal car insurance cover offered by Janashakthi,” said Janashakthi General Insurance Limited Chief Executive Officer Jude Fernando. 
Identifying that families most often only seek protection that is limited to the average motor insurance cover for their personal vehicles, Janashakthi stepped forward to enhance the benefits provided through the Full Option insurance cover. This ensures that complete protection is provided to a family when obtaining the Full Option cover for personal vehicles, reiterating Janashakthi’s commitment towards the entire family and its wellbeing. 
These enhanced benefits are offered in the wake of recent special value additions offered by Janashakthi in conjunction with Associated Motorways (AMW), enabling Janashakthi Full Option policyholders to have their vehicles repaired and attended to at any AMW Pitstop or AMW authorized service centers located islandwide on an expedited, priority basis. 
“At Janashakthi, we are committed to offering our customers a superior level of service and product offerings to ensure total customer satisfaction. Understanding the evolution of our customers’ lives, we constantly look at enhancing and adapting our policies to address their current needs. 
These latest benefits to our Full Option policy are aimed at meeting such needs and taming the risk of financial hardship for their families in the event of unforeseen circumstances,” said Janashakthi General Insurance Limited Chief Operating Officer Dayalanie Abeygunawardena.
