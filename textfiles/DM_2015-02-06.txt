Beware of the UNP, JVP: Polgampola tells Maithri
	
Peoples Liberation Fronts Alternative Group Convener and former parliamentarian Anurudda Polgampola warned President Maithripala Sirisena to be careful of the UNP and the JVP claiming that they were engaged in political deals.
The advisors of the previous government led to its downfall. This government must also be careful when dealing with such people, he said.
Mr. Polgampola claimed that the JVP was providing a lot of humour by raiding government institutions and making allegations against some former government members without any basis.
The JVP had repeatedly accused the External Affairs Ministry Secretary of various misdeeds but now it is now silent on this matter while she is holding the same post. It is not talking about political victims of the JVP either. The JVP is talking about corruption but it sold the V FM radio channel owned by the JVP and only credited two million rupees to the party and defrauded money when building the party headquarters, he said.
Mr. Polgampola also accused the JVP of being pro-UNP and asked it to reveal the truth.
He said the government must make constitutional changes such as in the case of the 13th Amendment very carefully.
The government must introduce constitutional changes so that separatism will not be encouraged but the aspirations of the poor Tamils such as the right to education would be ensured. That is what the previous government did not focus on, Mr. Polgampola said adding that it would unfortunate for the country if former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who obtained about 5.8 million votes kept out of politics.
President Rajapaksa stood firmly against separatism and stood for a united country. He lost the election because he used powers and state property as his own, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Reforms to disqualify crossovers
	
The proposed constitutional reforms if enacted will disqualify MPs who cross over from party or independent group, Daily Mirror learns.
A discussion paper on the constitutional reforms has been distributed among leaders of political parties in represented in Parliament.
According to the reforms, the President is the Head of State, the Head of the Executive and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The President will act on the advice of the Prime Minister except in cases exempted by the Constitution.
The presidential term has been limited to five years in the proposed changes to the Constitution and can be removed by a no-confidence motion passed with a two-thirds majority.
During the term of the office of the present President, the subjects of Mahaweli Development and Environment will be assigned to him.
The Prime Minister is the Head of the Government while the number of Cabinet Ministers has been limited to 30 and the number of state and deputy ministers should not exceed 40.
The reforms propose that the Term of Parliament will be five years. It can be dissolved within the first four years and six months only upon a resolution to that effect with a two-thirds majority.
Provisions relating to the Constitutional Council and independent institutions repealed by the 18th Amendment will be reinstated.
It has been proposed to set up a Council of State to make recommendations to the President and the Cabinet of Ministers on the implementation of matters in the policy statement of the government and adherence to the principles of good governance.
This council will consist of 35 members and appointed jointly by the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader while 20 members will be selected from the political parties and independent groups in Parliament. One seat will be assigned for a party not recognized in the House.
A new electoral system -- a mix of the first-past-the-post system and proportional representational (PR) system has been proposed in the new constitutional reforms, Daily Mirror learns. The preferential voting, system will be scrapped if these reforms are incorporated in the constitution while dual citizens will be disqualified from being elected to the post of President or to parliament.
The proceedings of the parliamentary committees including the COPE and PAC (Public Accounts Committee) will be open to the public. Parliamentary Bills once passed will be certified by the President. There wont be urgent Bills. An all-party committee will discuss the changes proposed for the electoral system.
The committee is expected to discuss the ratio between the number of members to be elected from the constituencies and the number under the PR system. The number of seats from the PR system will be decided on the basis of all valid votes or votes polled by the losing candidates. (KB)

Thavishas killer loses appeal over sentence
	
The killer serving life for the murder of Sri Lankan student in Sheffield has lost an appeal against his sentence, The Star said.
Kasim Ahmed was ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years behind bars after admitting murdering 25-year-old Thavisha Peiris.
Ahmed, 18 and his 26-year-old cousin Shamraze Khan, who denied the offence but was found guilty, attacked Mr. Peiris, 25, when he pulled up on Southey Crescent, Southey, in October 2013.
Mr. Peiris, who was originally from Sri Lanka and had graduated from Sheffield Hallam University, bled to death.
Ahmed, of St Ronans Road, Sharrow, challenged his 23-year tariff, with his lawyers arguing it was too long and claiming the sentencing judge had been wrong to class the case as highly serious and claimed his troubled background had not been taken into account enough.
But his challenge was thrown out by top judges.
The court heard Ahmed, who had already served a prison sentence for robbery, went out armed and intent on robbery.
He and his cousin had forced two teenagers to hand over their mobile phones and cash earlier in the night and then targeted Mr. Peiris when he stopped to ask for directions.
A post-mortem examination revealed Mr. Peiris, who was working his last shift that night after landing his dream IT job, suffered 14 stab wounds, including one to his heart.
Dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Jackson said: This murder, which was committed with an intention to kill, was so serious that a reduction of the minimum term below 23 years would not have been appropriate.
It is sadly the case that defendants in many criminal matters have been brought up in dysfunctional homes and come from troubled families and there are occasions when the courts can take that into account in order to reduce their sentence. In this case, however, the judge took the view that, because of the gravity of the offending, it was not possible to make any reduction for personal mitigation,
