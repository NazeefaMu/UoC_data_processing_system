He has received several awards and honours, including the coveted Padma Bhushan and Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for “The Most Creative Artist” from the President of India. The celebrated musician has a special bond with Sri Lanka, because his father, who was a great violinist himself, was based in Sri Lanka in the 1930s and is credited with evolving the South East Asian playing style by which the violin became a lead instrument instead of an accompanying instrument – global first.He himself has spent his early childhood in the island. He has a strong emotional bond with Sri Lanka and it is one of his personal dreams to find a violin recording of his father here.

The audience also had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to immerse themselves in the sounds of The Liepajas Symphony Orchestra, the oldest orchestra in the Baltic States. It was established in 1881 and became a national orchestra in 2010, performing across the globe and winning many awards globally.
