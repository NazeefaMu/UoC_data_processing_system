Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today told Parliament that neither the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) nor any other similar pact under different names would be signed with India.
He said only an agreement in connection with economic and technological cooperation would be signed and that it would not provide any opportunities for Indian professionals to work in Sri Lanka.
In a special statement in Parliament, the Prime Minister said the government had informed India that Sri Lanka was opposed to the inclusion of‘services’ in the agreement that is to be signed and that India was agreeable to the exclusion of this clause. (Yohan Perera)
