A punishment with a difference
	

The Cockerel party leader had imposed an unusual punishment on 15 party seniors who failed to attend a funeral! The deceased was a family member of a Diyawanna member of the party.

The party leader first displayed the names of the 15 members with their mug shots on a board and later made an announcement that the promotions and a host of privileges enjoyed by them would be suspended for a specified period. Without stopping at that, he had issued a decree prohibiting all party members from attending a wedding or a funeral taking place at the residence of any of the 15 members.

Act of gallantry was cause of their amusement
	

A deputy hailing from the Colombo district was walking along the council lobby the other day talking to a comely fair purohita when he suddenly noticed several strands of thread sticking out from the companions sari-pota.

Showing great concern over the blemish on the sari-fold, he immediately stopped her and started trying to remove the jutting strands.
Meanwhile, a group of members from both sides of the divide came on the scene and they were highly amused to find the bespectacled deputy dressed in coat and tie awkwardly bending over holding the fair ones sari-pota.
An opposition stalwart from the group directed a barb at the deputy who kept concentrating on the delicate job of removing the strands of thread unmindful of the colleagues passing by: You have noticed a minor defect on her sari-pota. But would you have noticed even a knife if it was placed against our neck
The group proceeded on their way laughing, but the deputy continued regardless, they say.

An anecdote to heart diseases
	
Globally, the incidence of heart disease is increasing at an alarming pace. The stress of modern living, lack of exercise and diet patterns can be noted as contributory factors of this deadly prevalence. As we have heard countless times, heart disease can be prevented by taking precautionary measures. However, advanced heart failure requires urgent treatment and attention, which patients are rarely prepared for. Renowned Consultant Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at the Heart, Lung and Vascular Centre of Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, Singapore Dr. Sivathasan Cumaraswamy, has been awarded by the Ministry of Health, Singapore for his outstanding contributions to the development of cardiothoracic surgery. Born in Sri Lanka, Dr. Cumaraswamy is a proud graduate of the Colombo Medical Faculty and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He is one of the few Sri Lankans to have literally held countless throbbing hearts in his own hands. In a recent interview with the Daily Mirror, Dr. Cumaraswamy demystifies what it means to be diagnosed with heart disease and advanced heart failure.

Q What does it mean to be diagnosed with heart disease
If a person is diagnosed with heart disease, it can be treated through various means. We generally have three options. The first is through drugs and medication. Not all patients need opt for procedures such as Angioplasty surgery. The next group would be classified as those who require a balloon or stent procedure. Those with complicated multiple blockages in their arteries would have to undergo a bypass surgery. These are the standard basic procedures of cardiac surgery. 
Whenever people suffer a heart attack, they lose part of their heart muscle. So, the effective mass of the functioning heart muscle gradually lessens if they keep getting heart attacks. It will come to a stage where the heart becomes weak and cannot supply blood to all the organs. Its like a car engine which breaks down. Instead of running on four cylinders, it runs on two cylinders. The car will hardly move. This happens to humans when the heart becomes so damaged that they cant generate enough blood to flow through organs such as the brain, kidney, liver and intestines. Patients who have had a massive heart attack and have collapsed can be resuscitated and revived. But some will end up with such massive damage that they will have difficulty managing day-to-day activities. 
The second group of patients develop disease of the heart muscle. This is not due to the blockage of the arteries but due to the disease of the muscles. One such condition is cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscles are weakened and the heart grows larger and larger. Cardiomyopathy is commonly identified as a hereditary disease as it tends to pass from parents to children. This group is difficult to treat because the heart muscles alone cannot be treated. Another unusual group is those who develop viral infection of the heart muscles called Myocarditis. Other groups of diseases include heart valve disease. If treatment is delayed or if they are not treated properly, such patients will end up with advanced heart failure. 

QWhat is advanced heart failure
The early stages of heart failure can be treated with medicine. There are a number of ways this could be done. But as these stages progress and the heart becomes weaker, options become more limited. When the stage of advanced heart failure is reached, patients are very weak. They wont be able to walk or leave the house. They will be breathless and their legs will start swelling due to congestion. They will have difficulty in breathing and eating because their liver and intestines will be congested as the heart is unable to pump out blood. 
Doctors can look at such a situation in three ways. One is to opt for a transplant, which would be the best choice of treatment. In the past, there was no option other than preparing the patient to face their final moments with palliative care. But now we have the option to operate and hook on a mechanical or electrical heart pump. This gives patients another chance. This is done in an open heart surgery. 

QWhat are the alternative options of treating advanced heart failure
The left ventricle in the heart is the major pump. It ventricle receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it through the arteries to the rest of the body. In patients with heart disease, we connect the pump to the left ventricle, through a certain procedure. Blood will be pumped out from the left ventricle and will pass through a pipe connected to the aorta. In other words, this procedure partially bypasses the heart. The idea is to replace the amount of blood that is normally pumped by the heart with a machine which will pump the blood back to the body. This will restore the blood pressure, where the brain, kidney and intestines will receive an adequate supply of blood. 

QWhich patients are eligible forheart transplant
Nowadays, when we have a patient with advanced heart failure, we assess them and debate whether or not a transplant can be done. Generally the cut-off age to carry out a transplant in a patient is 65. Any person over the age of 65 is not an ideal candidate for a heart transplant. If a patient with advanced heart failure also has other organ dysfunctions such as those of the kidney, we cannot offer them a transplant because the immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent organ rejection will harm the kidney. Therefore, to have a transplant, a patient has to be relatively younger and fitter.

QAre there any other options other than heart transplant
If the patient is not eligible, the other option we can offer is the Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD). We use this device on two groups of patients. One is for those eligible for transplant but where a donor heart is unavailable and the patient has to wait their turn on a waiting list. Obviously when they reach their turn, the chance of these patients surviving more than 18 months is only about 10%. In other words 90% patients will perish within 18 months. In such cases, we use the LVAD as a bridge to a transplant. We hook the patient up with the LVAD and get them back to an active life and put them on the waiting list. When a suitable heart becomes available, we call the patient and perform a heart transplant surgery. 
For patients older than 65 and for those not eligible for transplant, we offer this device as a permanent form of treatment. In Singapore, we have given these devices to about 82 patients and our longest surviving patient has been living up to eight years now.
This particular patient got married after two years of receiving a LVAD following her diagnosis with cardiomyopathy. Following the procedure, such patients can return to their daily lives. The only hassle is carrying the electrically charged batteries around with them. The pump hooked onto the heart has a wire that exits the body from the abdomen. This wire is hooked on to the batteries that supply the electricity to the pump. These batteries are like mobile phone batteries and can last up to 18 hours. The patient has to wear these batteries hooked on to the system and carry two spare batteries with them. When the battery power is low, there are alarms that warn the patient. The quality of life of such patients is good. Nearly 80% of our patients are doing well. 

QAre there any side-effects to these procedures
Problems can arise. Infections can be caused as there is a foreign body entering a patient. This is one of the side-effects which is also a major problem. Patients need to maintain their hygiene and clean the exit site with antiseptics every day and keep it dry. Neglecting this may cause serious infections. Once the patient is stable within a few months, they can do this on their own without a caregiver. Secondly, because these pumps are made of titanium, when blood comes into contact with the pump, it tends to clot. To prevent this, we give the patients anti-clotting agents to keep the blood thin. We use a combination of Aspirin and Warfarin. Warfarin is a common drug used on patients prone to blood clots. These patients have to be on this drug for a while. In rare cases, some patients even bleed into the brain. There is only a 5-10% chance of this happening. 

QHow accessible are these forms of treatment
The pump alone costs approximately US$100,000. The accessories such as batteries have to be taken into consideration as well. By the time patients with advanced heart failure come to us, they are very sick. Most Asian patients are very reluctant to have these procedures done and avoid surgery at all costs leading to their health deteriorating as they wait. In the West, patients get surgeries done early and their recovery is smooth and effective. In our experience, on average, patients must remain in intensive care for at least one week. Their hospital stay would be around three to four weeks. As a result, hospitalisation costs are also high and can easily come up to around US$150,000, depending on how sick they are. 

QHow prevalent is heart diseasein Asia
Heart disease is becoming a major non-communicable disease. About 10% of our patients with chronic heart disease ultimately reach the stage of advanced heart failure. On a global scale, about 8% of the worlds population live in the United States. However, of all transplants done globally, 60% are reported from the US. Whereas, if you take Asia with the largest population in the world, the number of transplants done annually is only about 5%. Europe, with only about 12% of the worlds population, carry out 30% transplants. 


QHow far is Sri Lanka from implementing a heart transplant programme
There are patients who are gravely ill and waiting for a heart transplant. Hospitals are trying their best and as it is, kidney transplants and liver transplants are being done in Colombo. The waiting list is a normal routine when it comes to heart surgery. Unfortunately, a majority of these patients will not live for more than 12 to 18 months. I understand that there are initiatives to implement a heart transplant programme here. I have been coming to Sri Lanka in the last couple of years. We have worked on protocols of managing heart patients. There are capable surgeons and cardiologists in the country. First of all, the heart transplant programme can be implemented in Sri Lanka as the cost is much lower than the LVAD procedure. Only a handful of countries can afford the LVAD procedure. In Singapore, we can afford it because the population is relatively small consisting of only 5 million people. In Sri Lanka, there is a population of 22 million. Generally the people of Singapore are also healthier and the patients are therefore less.

## Title: Antibiotic Resistance:

Antibiotic Resistance:
	


Though micro-organisms have their uses, invading and infecting our bodies are certainly not one of them! There was a time in the not-so recent past when tuberculosis equalled a preassigned death certificate and leprosy meant that you had to spend your life in an asylum, isolated from civilization.
Then in 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in a petri-dish of mould. Penicillin, the first antibiotic was followed up with many other such antibiotics of different classes.Today, with the correct antibiotic taken at the correct time, almost any infection from tuberculosis to pneumonia to meningitis can be cured. However, antibiotic resistance is an ominous threat hanging over the bright skies of medicine, threatening to take us back to the time when infections were not curable through a drug. 
Antibiotics are substances capable of weakening or destroying micro-organisms, specifically bacteria and fungi.These differ from the other drug groups because they deal with living organisms, focusing on a feature specific to a certain group of microbes. For example, penicillin focuses on the bacterial cell wall, preventing new cell wall formation, thus making the bacteria vulnerable to the external environment. Antibiotics are different to each other in function and strengths. Some antibiotics do not work on certain bacteria, while some cure infections more effectively than others. 
In a perfect world, the same antibiotic, say amoxycillin, will always work for a strep throat, killing all bacteria the same way fever always responds to paracetamol. Fortunately for the bacteria, evolution has come to their help. When an antibiotic is administered, due to the fast reproductive rates of the bacteria, mutations occur to produce organisms that can survive the effects of the antibiotic. In addition to this, in a colony of microbes, there are some organisms with features that can combat the effect of antibiotics and overcome it. Eventually, through the continuous use of the same antibiotic, a group of bacteria that can survive it emerges, originating from these few microbes. Through this process, bacteria is able to withstand the attack of multiple antibiotics, and superbugs are born.
When these mutated species spread from one person to another, these antibiotics will not work on the latter either. 
One could suggest that the easiest solution is to find newer antibiotics to compensate for the newly-emerging subgroups but this is practically impossible because despite numerous research and millions of dollars spent, only one new antibiotic has been produced in the last thirty years.

Today, these antibiotic-resistant infections cost a great deal of time and money, with prolonged hospital stays and costly drugs being administered, in addition to isolated treatment in the ward and increasing death rates when compared to normal infections. If this threat continues, higher numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will form and spread and there will come a day when there are groups of disease-spreading superbug bacteria which will not respond to even the strongest antibiotics. This will literally take us back to the Middle Ages and will make us incapable of curing even a simple skin infection or a strep throat. 
Antibiotic-resistance has always existed but it has been blown out of proportion due to peoples carelessness. Prevention of this fast-growing disaster is the responsibility of both doctors who prescribe antibiotics and patients who use them. Doctors should be cautious to prescribe antibiotics according to the required guidelines, only when it is necessary and to inform patients on the correct use of antibiotics. Special hygienic measures must be taken when treating patients with suspected antibiotic-resistant illnesses in order to avoid spreading the bacteria to another person. 
We are accustomed to self-prescribing antibiotics even for small ailments like colds and sore throats. Remember that most of the time, these diseases are caused by viruses which will be cured automatically by the bodys immune system without the help of medication.
Thus, always follow the doctors advice on using antibiotics. Never insist on antibiotics if your doctor says you dont need them. When an antibiotic is prescribed, even if the signs and symptoms of the illness disappear, continue the drug course until the end. Do not use antibiotics leftover from an earlier course for another aliment. Finally, prevention of the spread of infection through improved hygiene is the best method of fighting the war against these little organisms.

1.6 bn avoidable loss incurred in Bond auctions: AG
	
The Auditor Generals report submitted to parliament stated that relevant authorities at the Central Bank should be responsible for a loss totaling Rs.1.674 billion, the Auditor General Gamini Wijasinghe said yesterday.
The losses which were deemed avoidable in the report, was in reference to the two Bond Auctions which took place on February 27, 2015 and March 29, 2016.
The revelation was made during the continuation of evidence led by Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Navana before the Presidential Commission for the Controversial Bond Issuances. Giving evidence the Auditor General said that the net profit gained by the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd during April 1 to August 31, 2016 was amounting to Rs. 5867 million.
When delivering his evidence over the Bonds Auction held on March 29, 2016, the Auditor General explained that the value of the bids offered by the CBSL initially at the auction was Rs. 40 billion but had unusually accepted Rs. 77.732 billion bids exceeding Rs.37.732 billion.
However, the Funds requirement of the Government at the time was around Rs. 80 billion.
He moved that the decision to raise funds solely from the Bond auction was irrational because it could incur financial losses to the CBSL in various ways.
The CBSL could have stopped accepting bids at the Rs. 40 billion cut out and raise other funds requirements of the Government through using Direct Placement Method.
When questioned by the commission Auditor General said if the DPM was not available the CBSL could have stopped the accepting bids at Rs. 40 billion cut out in the auction and go for another auction later within a week to raise other funds requirement.
And he said the OD facilities of BOC and Peoples Bank could have used to manage the process until the second auction, because the funds were required to the Government by April 2.
Commenting on the participation of the Employees Provident Fund in the bond market, the Auditor General also said according to his findings that the EPF had invested only in the secondary market at lower interest rates despite its availability in investing at primary market at higher interest rates. However, when questioned by the Commission it was revealed that such decision is identified as a complex one to the EPF authorities.
On the other hand, at the cross examination conducted by Nihal Fernando PC and Counsel Romali Tudawe the Auditor General was asked to answer on some theoretical questions regarding Treasury Bonds and the methods he used in loss calculations.
It was seen that the Auditor General was uncertain at some points responding to the questions during the cross examination.
Subsequently, considering the significance of his evidence, the president of the Commission SC Justice T. Chitrasiri advised the Auditor General to avoid subject matters that he does not have expert knowledge and to reply with great attention to the questions, because contradictory responds would be a reason to set aside the whole evidence of him.
Meanwhile, the Commission yesterday requested the Auditor General to inquire and prepare a report on transactions taken place in the Secondary Market regarding the issuances of Bonds in the Primary Auctions held during February 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016 by the CBSL.
Earlier, it was revealed that the CBSL had failed to provide details regarding the secondary market transactions in order to calculate more possible losses due to the controversial bond issuances.
The Commission did so with the intention of examining any further financial losses to the State or any other public body.
The decision was made acceding the application made by the Attorney Generals Department while the objections, which were based on the mandate given to the Commission were also overruled.
The objections were raised by the counsel who appeared on behalf of the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd and the Former Governor.
The Commission which was appointed by the President comprised Supreme Court Judges Kankanithanthri T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai to inquire into the Treasury Bond issue will resume today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Cabinet calls for action against instigators of violence, hate speech
	
The Cabinet of Ministers yesterday directed the law enforcement authorities and the Attorney General to take immediate action against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech against religious and ethnic groups.
Issuing a statement, the Cabinet of Ministers said the National Unity Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena reaffirm commitment, in accordance with the mandates received from the people at the Presidential elections in January and Parliamentary elections of August 2015, to ensure that the nation never again returns to a conflict-ridden past.
The government reaffirms commitment to guide our nation towards reconciliation, sustainable peace, and economic progress. Communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence, and impunity have no place in the society that we strive to build, it said.
The statement by the Cabinet of Ministers
The National Unity Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena reaffirm commitment, in accordance with the mandates received from the people at the Presidential elections in January and Parliamentary elections of August 2015, to ensure that our nation never again returns to a conflict-ridden past, and instead resolve to guide our nation towards reconciliation, sustainable peace, and economic progress. Communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence, and impunity have no place in the society that we strive to build.
In this context, we are deeply concerned by the recent incidents of violence targeting places of religious worship, shops and business enterprises, and houses. We denounce in the strongest terms, these acts of violence and hatred, including incidents of hate speech by certain individuals and groups aimed at inciting violence against the different ethnic and religious communities in our country.
We are deeply saddened by the destruction of property and loss of livelihoods as a result of recent incidents, and the pain of mind and fear caused to individuals.
We affirm that hate filled expressions and actions by individuals and groups with vested interests, resulting in demeaning, denigrating and inciting violence against fellow citizens of various ethnic, religious backgrounds has no place in Sri Lankan society. 
While reaffirming the Governments commitment to reconciliation, peace building, peaceful co-existence, and the rule of law, we direct the law enforcement authorities to immediately take all necessary steps in accordance with the law of the land, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic groups in the country.
The strictest action must be taken without delay, in accordance with the law, against all persons or groups who act to incite violence, and engage in acts of violence. The law must be applied to all regardless of social status, ethnic or religious background or political affiliations of perpetrators of such acts.
We also direct the law enforcement authorities and the Hon. Attorney General to expedite action against those responsible for all atrocities committed, as impunity holds the dangerous possibility of our country receding into conflict. 
We express our deep appreciation to civil society and religious leaders who have stepped up to counter the attempts of a few to spread hate in our country, and who have called for calm and peaceful co-existence at this time.
We take this opportunity to urge the active participation and leadership of all Sri Lankans in efforts aimed at reconciliation and fostering peaceful co-existence in our country, without which, the stability and economic growth and progress that our nation so richly deserves will continue to elude us.
Gautama Buddhas Teachings emphasize the importance of co-existence, tolerance, respect and compassion. This nation is blessed by the teachings of the four great religious traditions in the world Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam  which provide us the guidance required for peaceful co-existence, upholding human values, and honest and hard work required to rebuild our nation as one of the most progressive in the region.
We urge all the citizens of this nation, young and old, to contribute their best to our country as patriotic citizens to build a nation that is stable, peaceful, and progressive; a society where the dignity of each individual is upheld; where diversity is respected; and where every individual has the opportunity to enjoy the freedoms that are the rights of equal citizenship.
We must all stand united to strive to eliminate this dangerous affliction of hatred towards each other, and resolve that we will never allow ourselves in the present or in the future, to once again be dragged into conflict as in the past.

An official conference was held the other day with the Finance Ministry secretary in the chair to find a solution to the problem of allotting suitable space to house the office of the State Minister.

The high officials from the newly created State Ministry faulted the secretary at the very outset about the failure to find suitable space in the Line Ministry premises to house the office of the State Minister.
In response to criticism directed at him, the Ministry secretary replied that they had to look for accommodation elsewhere as there was no adequate space to accommodate both Ministers in the same building complex.
Asked whether he found suitable space for the State Ministers office in any other place, the secretary replied in the affirmative.
Inquiries made by the State Ministry officials revealed that the place that the secretary had picked to convert into the State Ministers office was a room at another Ministry premises currently used by Ministry drivers to bed down for the night.
Do you mean that you propose to convert a drivers bunk house of another Ministry to our Ministers office asked the State Ministry officials in amazement.
When there was no answer, they posed another question: Was it your Boss who made this suggestion
Without waiting for a reply, the State Ministry officials had walked out of the conference room, they say.

He foiled their plan to share the limelight!
	

Number One in yahapalanaya visited the flood-hit parts of the Kalutara district recently. He was due to participate in a shramadana in Pahiyangala area as well.

Media had given much publicity to the shramadana that Number One had planned to attend and Diyawanna members, purohitas and white-collar high-ups of the Kalutara district rushed to Pahiyangala and were waiting for the arrival of Number One for the event.
Number One on arrival in Pahiyangala saw the political and white collar bigwigs wearing gloves and boots waiting all agog at the venue of the proposed shramadana obviously for the purpose of posing for a picture with him.
Wise to the ways of publicity seekers, Number One after greeting them told them: You all wait at this end. Ill go over to the other end to start the shramadana.
Having thus made it clear to the politicos and white collar bigwigs that they were not expected to follow him, Number One walked away.
Thus disappointed, the politicos and white collar ones had faded from the scene one by one, they say.

If need arises, use tri-forces to remove garbage: Ravi
	
Relevant authorities should take stringent and immediate measures to remove waste material gathered in Colombo within four days, and for this purpose, they may seek the assistance of the tri-forces if necessary, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
He made this statement while addressing a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone for a new building at Kanapathi Hindu College in Kotahena.
Minister Karunanayake said the tug-o-war between the Colombo Chief Minister and Linear Ministry over garbage removal should not inconvenience the general public.
He said the nauseating stench of garbage scattered around the city was an eyesore, and that not removing garbage on a regular basis posed serious health hazards to the people.
However, when contacted Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V.K. Anura, he refuted the allegations saying there was no garbage in the city. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Sheain Fernandopulle)

Is Your Blood Pressure Under Control 
	

Out of the many illnesses that deteriorate the quality of human health, non-communicable diseases have been identified as a common threat known to cause the highest number of deaths today. Non-communicable diseases are also known as non-infectious diseases and are not transmitted through micro-organisms. 
High blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and fatty liver are the four main non-communicable diseases people fall victim to. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a rising health-risk in our country which 20% of the population suffers from. A vast majority of patients with hypertension are above 40 years of age. Speaking to the Health Capsule, Dr. Pradeep Kumarasinghe De Silva, Consultant Physician of the Colombo National Hospital, shed light on the causes, consequences and control of hypertension. 

What is hypertension 
The normal blood pressure of an adult is 120/80 mmhg. Hypertension is basically high blood pressure which is sustained at a higher level than the normal set level. 
Hypertension is classified as essential hypertension and secondary hypertension. The most common form of hypertension which 96-97% patients suffer from is essential hypertension, a disease condition that is not a result of another disease and is mainly due to lifestyle habits. The age group of patients that suffer from essential hypertension is generally 40 years and above. 
Secondary hypertension is high blood pressure that arises as a result of other health conditions such as kidney, blood vessel and endocrine disease. 3-4% suffer from secondary hypertension. Patients in this category include people above as well as below 40 years. 

Causes for Hypertension 
According to Dr. Kumarasinghe, the main cause for hypertension is a persons lifestyle habits. Lack of exercise, bad food habits and diets with high calories, high salt, high fat and sugar levels, mental stress and anger are negative lifestyle traits that pave the way to high blood pressure. Genetic factors are also responsible for hypertension. If you have a family history of hypertension, chances are you are more likely to be diagnosed with high pressure. Hypertension is also an aftermath of various diseases such as kidney and endocrine problems. 

Diagnosis of hypertension 
Hypertension is an asymptomatic condition, meaning a vast majority of high blood pressure patients may not show symptoms. A minority may show symptoms such as headaches and dizziness. On most occasions, patients will not show symptoms and will remain oblivious to the fact that they are hypertension patients, so I advise people to get their blood pressure checked when they reach the age of 40. 
Dr. Kumarasinghe mentioned that one blood pressure reading alone cannot confirm hypertension. Several readings have to be taken. Just because a reading taken in one instance indicates high blood pressure, this does not mean that you are a hypertension patient. A series of readings are taken at different times. If all readings are above the normal level, then it can be confirmed that you suffer from hypertension. 

How to control hypertension 
Hypertension is one of those lifelong diseases that can never be cured. The only solution is keeping your blood pressure under control. This is done through the use of pharmaceutical drugs and changes in lifestyle patterns. Regular exercise is essential. Additionally, a change in daily diet also has to be made. Food with high fibre content and low salt levels with less calories and less fat should be consumed. A peaceful mindset and avoidance of stress should also be maintained. Yoga and meditation are advised in this case. A patient suffering from hypertension will be put on medication.
Pharmaceutical drugs will help keep blood pressure under control. But Dr. Kumarasinghe said the use of these drugs was not temporary. Medicine has to be taken permanently throughout ones life, as hypertension is a disease that cannot be cured and hence should always be kept under control. Blood pressure can be controlled as long as medication is taken, but once it is stopped, blood pressure will rise again. Some drugs belonging to the category known as beta blockers can aggravate asthma and cause other problems. A doctor will be able to select the suitable drug according to the patients health history. 

Why is it important to get your blood pressure checked 
A vast majority of hypertension patients do not show symptoms and hence do not prompt for medication. Dr. Kumarasinghe strongly advises against this. High blood pressure could lead to more fatal conditions such as strokes, heart problems, kidney and eye diseases. These may occur without warning. Blood pressure should always be kept under control.
Non-communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and fatty liver are often interconnected. You cannot isolate one condition. Once a patient is subjected to hypertension, there is always the possibility of the patient becoming vulnerable to diabetes and high cholesterol as well. So, early detection is of vital importance. Management of hypertension is essential to avoid other dreaded conditions. Dont wait for symptoms to manifest. By then it might be too late.

It was more than a question of diplomatic etiquette
	

One of the Blue party senior purohitas in yahapalanaya attended a function hosted by an envoy of a neighboring country.

The function over, the deputy envoy approached our purohita for a chat and suddenly asked a question that took our man by surprise: Why are you so averse to the joint project of our two countries
Suppressing his anger at the undiplomatic query raised by the diplomat, the purohita replied that the country was going to be the loser by the proposed tank deal and he would oppose any deal that could place the country at a disadvantage.
The deputy envoy who appeared set to throw all norms of diplomatic propriety to the four winds presently made a remark that gave the senior purohita a jolt. You are antagonistic towards our country. Thats the reason for your opposition to this project!
The purohita replied in a firm tone: I am not opposed to your country. I only love my country. I am not going to change my stance on this project come what may!
Finding that the purohita was not prepared to take things lying down, the deputy envoy made a hasty retreat, they say.

A huge fire has engulfed a tower block in Latimer Road, west London, with eyewitnesses claiming people are trapped in their homes.
The fire at Grenfell Tower on the Lancaster West Estate was reported at 01:16 BST and about 200 firefighters are tackling the blaze.
The Met Police said people were being treated for "a range of injuries".
The BBC's Andy Moore said the whole tower block was alight and there are fears the building might collapse.
London Fire Brigade sent 40 fire engines to the tower.
Eyewitnesses said they could see lights - thought to be torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, which people say is "close to burning through".
George Clarke, the presenter of Channel 4 TV programme Amazing Spaces, told Radio 5 Live: "I'm getting covered in ash, that's how bad it is.
"I'm 100 metres away and I'm absolutely covered in ash.
"It's so heartbreaking, I've seen someone flashing their torches at the top level and they obviously can't get out."
Tim Downey, another eyewitness, told the BBC part of the building was "completely burned away".
"It has burned through to its very core," he said.
"It looks very bad, very very bad. I've never seen anything like this. It's just such a big fire.
"The whole building is just crumbling. It's just billowing black smoke." (BBC)

London fire tears through residential tower, leaving 12 dead
	
At least 12 people are dead and dozens injured after a massive fire rapidly tore through a 24-story apartment building in west London in the early hours of Wednesday, police said.
All 24 floors of Grenfell Tower in North Kensington were swiftly engulfed, trapping residents in their homes and reportedly forcing some to jump to escape the flames. London's fire chief, Dany Cotton, said the blaze was "unprecedented" in her 29 years of service.
Residents had reported concerns about fire safety in recent years, and questions were raised about whether a recent refurbishment of the building, in which exterior cladding was installed, contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.
Firefighters continued to search the building for survivors.
Around 200 firefighters, 40 fire trucks and 20 ambulance crews were at the scene at the height of the blaze.
London Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said that the death toll had risen to 12 by the early evening and warned more casualties were likely. The London Fire Brigade said it had searched almost the entire building.
Witnesses described people leaping from the building and of trapped children banging on windows as the fire broke out at around 1 a.m. local time, while people slept.
A website run by the "Grenfell Action Group" said residents of the tower had expressed concerns over the safety of the building, specifically pointing to fire risks. Fire chiefs said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the blaze. (CNN)

Desperate residents are building ropes from sheets in an attempt to escape from their windows as a huge inferno is engulfing a tower block in west London.
The 'horrendous' blaze has struck the 27-storey Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, White City, in the early this morning.
The fire has spread from the second floor to the roof of the towering block, with 200 firefighters struggling to bring it under control.
Desperate residents trapped high in the enormous tower were heard screaming for help as they built ropes from sheets in an attempt to reach the ground. One neighbour said he believed someone had jumped from the block.
The residential block holds 120 flats, with two of the residents being treated for illness from smoke inhalation.
Terrified residents in their pyjamas have been evacuated as police are pushing people away from the area for fear the block will collapse as debris has started to fall from the tower. (Daily Mail)

London high-rise fire leaving many dead and dozens injured
	
A number of people were killed, at least 50 injured and many others missing on Wednesday as a fire ripped through a high-rise apartment building in west London where residents had long warned of the potential risk of a catastrophic blaze.
A thick plume of smoke could be seen for miles around, while witnesses reported people jumping from open windows near the top of the 24-story building after being trapped by the advancing flames.
Hundreds of other residents, many who had been asleep when the blaze broke out shortly before 1 a.m., were forced to flee down dark and smoky stairwells. The building, which is located in a poverty-stricken pocket of one of Londons wealthiest neighborhoods, was engulfed within minutes, said locals.
It was like a horror movie, smoke was coming from everywhere, said building resident Adeeb, who hobbled down nine flights of stairs on crutches with his wife and three children.
Adeeb, who declined to give his last name, said there had been no alarms, and that he only learned of the fire when his daughter woke him.
She said I can see fire and I opened the door and could see smoke, added Adeeb, who is originally from Syria but has lived in Britain for 16 years. One of his daughters was hospitalized.
London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said a number of people had been confirmed dead. London ambulance services said they had taken 50 people to five area hospitals.
At least 40 fire engines responded to the scene, with 200 firefighters involved in a futile effort to contain the blaze. Many rushed into the building wearing breathing tanks, searching floor by floor for survivors even amid concerns that the structure could collapse.
Cotton said a structural engineer was monitoring the stability of the building, but that it was still safe for rescue screws to enter. She said firefighters had climbed as high as the 20th floor to rescue residents and carry them down the buildings stairwell, and that the searches continued.
The fire, which was believed to have begun on one of the lower floors of the 120-unit, public-housing building, was still burning as of 10 a.m. in London, some nine hours after it began.
This is an unprecedented incident, Cotton said. In my 29 years of being a firefighter I have never ever seen anything of this scale.
Speaking within sight of the burning high-rise  originally white and gray, but most of which had turned a charred black  Cotton said she would not speculate on the exact number of deaths because of the size and complexity of the building.
As of early Wednesday morning, people were believed to still be trapped inside a high-rise that is home to about 500 people. Witnesses reported harrowing scenes as residents trapped in top floors leaned out windows, flashing their mobile phone lights and calling frantically for help.
A woman held her baby out a window as fire and smoke surrounded her. At least one person was reported to have fallen from a top floor, in flames.
Sajad Jamalvatan, a 22-year-old biomedical engineering student, had been seeing a movie at the nearby Westfield shopping center with his sister when his mom called to say their building was on fire.
Minutes later, he was back in front of the high-rise, and watched a horror scene unfold.
As soon as I arrived, someone pointed and said someone is jumping, someone is jumping. About 16th or 17th floor, we saw a body coming down.
Seeing people die in front of you... he stared at the sidewalk as his voice trailed offf.
He said the blaze had advanced quickly, and that the alarms did not appear to have been triggered. There are plenty of alarms in the building, but no alarm went off, he said. When I arrived, there were 10 flats on fire. After that, the whole building was on fire.
It went like that, he said, snapping his fingers.
The fire raised immediate questions about how a recently renovated high-rise apartment building in the center of one of the worlds wealthiest cities could so quickly become a 24-story inferno.
Residents said they had heard the faint sound of smoke alarms from individual units, but that it was unclear whether the building had an integrated alarm system. Many said there were only minutes to flee before the building became an inferno.
By mid-morning, an acrid smell permeated the area. About 100 people  residents, worried family members and onlookers  stood outside the nearby Rugby Portobello community center. Some were still in their pajamas, having fled in a panic hours earlier.
Neighbors streamed into the center with food. One man pushed a baby stroller teetering with bottles of water, jugs of milk and cans of baked beans.
The building, Grefnell Tower, is located in one of Londons poshest areas, home to celebrities, politicians and wealthy foreigners. Its just a short walk from Kensington Palace. But the area also includes pockets of poverty, especially in a cluster of high-rise buildings that mark an unofficial western entry point to central London. Authorities said they did not know the cause of the fire, and that it would be investigated.
But residents of the building, which was constructed in 1974 and is used as public housing, had long warned of potential fire hazards even though it was completely renovated just last year.
It is our conviction that a serious fire in a tower block or similar high density residential property is the most likely reason that those who wield power at the KCTMO will be found out and brought to justice! a residents organization, the Grenfell Action Group, wrote in a blog post last year.
KCTMO, which stands for Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, is the group that runs public housing on behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the west London area where the fire broke out.
On Wednesday morning, the Grenfell Action Groups web site was updated, with a post on the fire.
All our warnings fell on deaf ears, and we predicted that a catastrophe like this was inevitable and just a matter of time, the post read.
Residents said they had been instructed by management before the blaze to stay in their apartments in the event of a fire, and to wait for emergency services to arrive. They said they had been told that their units were fire-proof for at least an hour.
Nick Paget-Brown, who leads the borough council, told Sky News that he had toured the building last May after it was reopened following the renovation. He said hundreds of people were likely in the building at the time of the blaze.
Im really not in any position to answer any questions about the structure, he said. Clearly theres a lot more work to do to actually evacuate the building and to establish how safe it is. This is a very, very, very severe fire. (Washington Post)

Mangala hits back at MR over GSP+ remarks
	
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera hit back at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over the latters statement on GSP+ concession.
In response to Mr. Rajapaksas claims that obtaining the GSP Plus facility is trivial, since Sri Lanka is very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country, Minster Samaraweera said,  Mr. Rajapaksa is clearly trying to distort facts because he cant acknowledge the fact that the National Unity Government has in fact managed to obtain a formidable boost to Sri Lankas economy.
He conveniently hides a fundamental issue. A country has to be classified as "upper middle income" by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for the GSP Plus. Even if Sri Lanka were to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantages of GSP Plus for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit, Minister Samaraweera said in a statement.
Full statement issued by Minister Samaraweera;
Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his advisors, instead of working to take our country to the heights that our country could have achieved soon after the conclusion of the conflict in 2009, chose to run our country to the ground. He made our country heavily indebted on the one hand, having borrowed at exorbitantly high, commercial rates; while taking decisions that made Sri Lanka withdraw from the international stage, on the other, thus making our country and our people isolated and shunned by the world. He hides the fact that time after time, major donor countries voted against Sri Lanka at the time, in international financial institutions.
Having eventually lost an election which he himself called for, ahead of time, he appears to still not be able to come to terms with that loss. His hunger for power makes him and his advisors continue to indulge in the lies, tricks and games that were so much a part of his regime and so much a part of his personality. Just recently we saw how he lied to the people about his travel to Japan. He said that he was travelling to Japan at the invitation of the Emperor of Japan! The Embassy of Japan responded to a question from a journalist denying this. Why resort to this kind of lying to hoodwink the people, Mr. Rajapaksa If you are in fact a follower of the teachings of Gautama Buddha as you try to show the people, isnt it about time, at least at this stage of your life, to try to abide by even one of the five precepts, and refrain from indulging in lies.
Mr. Rajapaksa, in a statement titled Government should not create unrealistic expectations about GSP Plus says that obtaining the GSP Plus facility is trivial, since Sri Lanka is very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country. He conveniently hides a fundamental issue. A country has to be classified as "upper middle income" by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for the GSP Plus. Even if Sri Lanka were to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantages of GSP Plus for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit. This shows that Mr. Rajapaksa is clearly trying to distort facts because he cant acknowledge the fact that the National Unity Government has in fact managed to obtain a formidable boost to Sri Lankas economy, in application of Article 4(1) of the GSP Regulation of 2012, for at least four years.
This period of, at the very least four years, comes just when the European economy starts to show signals of growth recovery. With less unemployment and more consumer demand, this is the moment to join in enhanced partnership with the European Union!
But let me add a point. Mr. Rajapaksas reasoning that we shouldn't aspire to a better deal, because some time in the future the economy will grow is callous and insensitive to the workers of our country and their families. It reflects a complete lack of concern for our workers who expect progress in the immediate present, and they deserve progress in the immediate present. So what if Sri Lanka, thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of its entrepreneurs and workers looks poised to cross a certain threshold of average income Does it mean that we, as a government, should sit on our hands without giving them the opportunity for a better deal that they deserve now in the present Shouldn't we help them to reach our national goals sooner rather than later
The idea that GSP Plus puts Sri Lanka "under the supervision" of the EU is simply absurd. By committing to a number of universal human rights principles, we do nothing that was not already recommended by Sri Lankan people who came before the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to give their input and views. Protecting every citizen from torture is not an alien imposition. It is a sovereign decision from a humanistic nation, towards its own citizens, inspired by the most sacred human values and principles. How ironic that Mr. Rajapaksa who claims to be not just a follower but a guardian of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not advocate granting the very basic human rights principles and rights and freedoms to the citizens of this country! Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of protection Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of human rights and freedoms
It was incompetence and arrogance of Mr. Rajapaksa and his advisors, and their determination to deny the people of this country their rights that resulted in Mr. Rajapaksa failing to retain the GSP Plus facility. It was ill-advised to not implement the 2011 recommendations of the LLRC, a Commission which he himself appointed, to protect citizens from torture, criminalize disappearances, and fully investigate cases of human rights violations. In fact it was an injustice caused to the law abiding soldiers of this country as well. Having failed himself, and the people of our country, now in 2017, it is simply invidious to criticize a successful measure that the Government seeks to implement for the benefit of the people of our country.
We know very well how Mr. Rajapaksa and his advisors tried until the last minute to retain the GSP Plus facility in 2010, and lost. Licking their wounds, they then sought to lie to the people by saying that he decided to not pursue the facility, to avoid damage to the countrys political, legal and institutional framework. He probably still cant get over those lies. So he keeps repeating them in different formulations and words even seven years later in 2017.
For this government, the GSP Plus system is a partnership that helps our nation and our people regain their due place once again on the international stage as a respected nation and a respected people standing shoulder to shoulder with the international community, shedding the pariah tatters that the former government chose to put on our nation and our people. Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people deserve the best in the world. Sri Lanka is a proud nation and the Sri Lankan people are a proud people with the self-confidence to speak and act as equals with every country or group of countries in the world. We don't need to hide from global dialogue in order to feel better. On the contrary, we feel stronger when our laws reflect the best of global humanism, when our citizens benefit from the best law enforcement, when our workers and entrepreneurs see the ports of the world open to the fruit of their efforts.

Melioidosis: another deadly disease that increases during floods
	

QWhat is melioidosis
Melioidosis is a tropical infection, transmitted from soil and water to humans. It is seen only in warm, tropical countries. The causative pathogen, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a bacterium found naturally in soil and water. The bacterium enters the body through soil or water contamination of abraded skin.
QWho is at risk of being exposed to this infection
The infection is transmitted through exposure to soil, mud or water. Therefore, melioidosis is more common in people who have regular and frequent exposure to soil and water, such as paddy farmers, agricultural workers, home gardeners and construction workers. Since most rural Sri Lankans walk barefoot in their home compounds, paddy fields and roads, they may get exposed to this bacterium. During flooding, the whole community becomes exposed to large amounts of mud and water and the risk of contracting this infection increases. 

QWho is more likely to get melioidosis
Although many people get exposed to this bacterium, infection is more common in people with underlying medical problems, especially diabetes. However, in disaster conditions like flooding where there is a high exposure to contaminated water, even healthy people may get infected. 

Q What are the symptoms
There are no unique symptoms in melioidosis. Patients with melioidosis usually have fever. They may have lung infection with cough or skin abscesses. Some have infection in the liver, spleen, salivary glands, lymph nodes, bone or joints. Melioidosis can even infect the brain. Infection may develop very suddenly and acutely or develop insidiously and slowly over a few weeks. Melioidosis may be mistaken for other fevers, such as dengue or leptospirosis. 

QCan it cause an epidemic
Melioidosis occurs throughout the year in Sri Lanka but increases during the southwest and northeast monsoons. There is a rapid increase in cases of melioidosis during rainy weather, storms and flooding and other natural disasters. 

QWhat is the death rate in melioidosis
Melioidosis is a severe, potentially fatal infection and the death rate can be as high as 25-50%. However, early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can save the patient. 

QIs melioidosis common in Sri Lanka
Melioidosis is increasingly recognized in Sri Lanka. According to our records, we have between 250500 cases diagnosed in the last 10 years. Most of them were diagnosed within the last 3 years due to increased awareness among doctors. However, it is regrettable that there are many doctors in Sri Lanka who are not knowledgeable on this disease. 

QWhere is this infection found in Sri Lanka and does it affect adults or children
Meloidosis is found all over the island. Most cases are seen in rural, rice growing areas. It is less common in the cool hill country. Infection occurs in all age groups, including children and in both sexes, though the highest incidence is seen in middle-aged males. 

QIs there any treatment
There are well-established antibiotic treatment guidelines for the treatment of melioidosis. 

QAny take home message
Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Sri Lanka. It is widely distributed throughout the island and affects all age groups. It should be included in the diagnosis of fevers in Sri Lanka.

Ministry Sec. delaying assuming of duties: GMOA
	
The newly appointed Health Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne had been unable to assume duties due to the differences with Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said.
Mr. Seneviratne, who is currently working as the Mahaweli Development & Environment Ministry Secretary was appointed as the Secretary to the Health Ministry by President Maithripala Sirisena a week ago.
Responding to a question raised by the Daily Mirror journalist at a press briefing held in Colombo, GMOAs Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said though President Sirisena appointed Mr. Seneviratne as Health Ministry Secretary, he had not assumed duties so far.
We have information that Health Minister Senaratne opposes the appointment of Mr. Seneviratne. The new Secretary has a remarkable record in the places where he served. We suspect whether the Minister wanted to appoint someone close to him, he said.
Responding to the matter Mr. Seneviratne said he could not say an exact date that he would assume duties on the new position, however there was no special reason behind the delay.
Im not aware that the Health Minister Senaratne opposes my appointment. At the moment I cannot give an exact date that Im going to assume duties. Soon after my work done at the Mahaweli Ministry, I will assume duties, Mr. Seneviratne said.
Minister Senaratne could not be reached for a comment. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Miraculous escape
	
A coconut plucker who lost his grip and had a nasty fall onto a pointed Gyridicilia stick which pierced through his left thigh, was later operated at the Karapitiya hospital, and the wooden stick of about five feet safely removed after a surgery which lasted about two and half hours.
The victim Edirige Piyasiri (55) is the father of four children. Plucking coconuts is his main livelihood. On the day of the incident (12th June) he had plucked coconuts from 31 trees belonging to a businessman of the area. He had then climbed onto another tree continuing his routine, and while attempting to climb down from the tree he had lost his grip, when the branch he was holding had given way, and fell on a fence of Gyridicilia wood. With the impact of the fall a stick pierced through his left thigh causing severe injuries to him. He was first admitted to the Embilipitiya Hospital but later transferred to the Karapitiya Hospital where he was subjected to an operation by the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital's organ transplanting specialist, Doctor Ranjuka Ubesiri.
The team of doctors at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital led by Dr. Ubesiri had performed this operation lasting about two and half hours and removed the wooden stick which had pierced through the left thigh of Piyasiri. Dr. Ubesiri commenting on this rare experience said that first he had to stop the blood circulation in the leg of the victim and the wooden stick safely removed. The patient had narrowly been saved of any damage to the main arteries. After the operation the blood circulation of the patient is now normal. A MRI scan is to be done to ascertain whether any damage had been caused to the respiratory track of the patient.
He advised that in the event of a similar incident where the body is pierced by sharp edged sticks, attempts should not be made to remove them, as it might lead to a drain on the blood. (D. G. Sugathapala and Sumathipala Diyagahage)

MYTH: Trimming your hair frequently makes it grow faster 

BUSTED: This is a myth. Our hair cycle has three phases. There is a growing phase, a resting phase and finally the hair falls out. The resting phase is normally three months. That is a uniform thing. But the length of growing phase depends on each individual. It can vary from months to years and depending on how long this phase is, the length of the hair will also vary. It will grow until the end of the growing phase. By the time it falls out, there will be a new hair follicle growing in its place. By trimming, you can even the hair length and it can look cosmetically nicer but that doesnt make your hair grow faster or longer. explained

Nightmares with Natural disasters
	
torrential floods: What went wrong

Despite being a land of rich biodiversity blended together with the ability to withstand harsh weather conditions, Sri Lanka today stands fragile and vulnerable to impacts of climate change.
Adding to the island nations burden of grief, the country recently faced a number of natural disasters with floods and landslides taking the forefront.The Daily Mirror spoke to experts representing the environment and Government sectors, in an attempt to gain a better insight into the causes that resulted in disastrous floods and how flooding could have been mitigated.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, System Ecologist and Chairman of Rainforest Rescue International, Dr. Ranil Senanayake explained the main reasons behind the disastrous floods Sri Lanka experienced recently. According to him, the impact of climate change was listed as one of the main factors that gave rise to the recent flood.
There are many contributory factors that created the recent flood situation. One is the increase of extreme event frequency brought about by climate change. We will be exposed to both heavy rainfall events and strong drought events into the future. While it is the developed countries, which have affected the climate most, we are making a bad situation worse by burning more coal, petrol, diesel and gas attempting to ape the destructive model of development promoted by businessmen and their political buddies, Dr. Senanayake said.
Explaining the causes, he stated that the second reason was the weakening of the soil structures.
He said that this happened mainly due to the removal of forest covers and as a result of pouring chemicals that destroyed the life in the soil, which eventually led to robbing the soil of its cohesive strength.

What we can prevent is the massive loss of life and property at these events. We have to be ready for such events

Next is the willy-nilly urbanisation with no consideration for the physical and cultural geography of a place. Neither the percentage of impervious surfaces created nor the amount of wetlands filled up is important to the greedy developers. With this comes the unchecked dumping of rubbish into the waterways.
Another serious event is the blasting allowed for granite factoring. The shock waves from these blasting sites weaken the soil structures that overlay the rock base, making it easy for water to enter and liquefy the disturbed soil, creating the horrific landslides we have witnessed.
Finally there is no organised official warning, nor response strategy to such events. We have a Climate Change Secretariat, whose responsibility is to model such extreme events and work with all arms of Government to be ready for these extreme events. Attending international conferences alone will not work! he quipped.
When inquired if the flood was preventable by any means, Dr. Senanayake said that heavy rainfall would make such flood situations inevitable. He was of the view that since intense rainfall could not be prevented, the flooding accompanying such events could also not be prevented.
What we can prevent is the massive loss of life and property at these events. We have to be ready for such events in the future and the Government must invest in a flood response plan as well as a drought response plan. The corporate sector as well as the public must be brought into these rapid response plans because as often as needed, these sectors can mobilise resources even faster than the Government.
We should think about future flood events and begin designing houses on stilts as seen in much of Asia for flood-prone areas. The flood-prone areas should be identified and given an early warning system.
We should instruct all Government representatives attending international conferences to fight for holding the global temperature under a 1.5 degree rise without compromise. We should stop clearing our forests and converting our lands from high biomass to low biomass, just to please some foreign investors who have no interest in the well being of our people, Dr. Senanayake added.


Director of Irrigation for Drainage and Flood Systems at the Irrigation Department, Eng. Janaki Meegasthenna said that the main reason for the blockages along rivers and flooding was a direct result of increase in the number of constructions along river banks, especially the construction of bridges, encroachment settlements in wet zones and construction of hotels along river sides.

Forestalling the projects due to protests by residents and political representatives have also played a crucial role..

People dump garbage in the drains thereby blocking the drainage system including culverts. With the high intensity rain fall that we were receiving, the condition was further aggravated. Some of the road constructions including bridges and culverts have been built without analysing the rainfall trends, which is important according to hydrological studies. Also, forestalling the implementation of former projects/project proposals due to protests by residents and political representatives have also played a crucial role in giving rise to the recent floods.
If these project proposals were implemented beforehand, the flood situation could have been mitigated to some length. If action was taken to initiate project proposals such as the Gin - Nilwala diversion to Hambantota, the third phase of the Nilwala River or if the needful was done to commence the work of the Mallawa reservoir, we could have mitigated the risk of floods to a greater extent, she said.
On the other hand, it should also be noted that the Sri Lankan irrigation systems needed to be improved because they are very old systems. These systems were designed BEFORE the impact of the climate change. I think now we need to improve our spill gates, canals and drainage canals. Nowadays, we have implemented the Climate Resilient Improvement Project. Under this project we have already started to improve the drainage system, spill gate canals and expand the existing tanks; especially in areas that are mostly affected by the flood. We are also improving tanks in areas such as Minneriya, Parakrama Samudraya, Giritale, Kawudulu including Nuwara, Tissa, Padaviya tanks and the Yoda Wewa complex, Eng. Meegasthenna added.


Deputy Director of Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, Dr. C. H. E. R. Siriwardana elucidated that the Sri Lankan climate was controlled by the North East and South West Monsoons.
However, since geologically the central part of Sri Lanka was made out of particular rock types that were very resistant, the island held the ability to stand out under any weather condition, he said.
Geologically it is the central mountain base that controls the climate and it should be noted that these mountain ranges are very resistant to weathering. These central highlands are responsible for controlling the winds. When the wind collides with the mountain range, this results in producing seasonal rainfall on either side. The wind colliding with the eastern slope results in the North-East Monsoon. When the wind collides with the free ranges in the western slope, it creates the South-West Monsoon, Dr. Siriwardana said.

As a result of deforestation, whatever the waste material come flowing down various waterways. Central highlands produce a lot of sediment which can easily get settled and course through the rivers...

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said that with the changes of the climatic pattern, the rainfall that needed to be dispersed throughout the whole year had fallen in a very short period.
Stating that it was a 400mm - 600 mm rainfall that we experienced recently, Dr. Siriwardana said that various reasons-including the condition of drainages and human activities such as deforestation- that gave rise to soil erosion, could be listed as contributory factors that gave rise to the floods.
As a result of deforestation, waste materials come flowing down various waterways. The central highlands produce a lot of sediment which can easily get settled and course through the rivers in the low-land areas.
Partially, these negative impacts take place due to man-made activities, such as deforestation and mining. We as human beings should bear the responsibility for what has happened to our nature today.
Particularly, when the population grows, lots of small settlements are cropping up while concrete pavements and towns are being created. Earlier we had a dense forest cover that helped in the gradual absorption of water into the ground. However, with the lack of sufficient forest cover at present, there is no way to absorb excess water into the ground. Therefore, the excess water floods the surface, he explained.
He also laid special emphasis on the fact that excessive sand mining could be helpful in some instances although this was not always the case.
He explained that when the sand in the river was excessively mined, the river naturally deepens causing less inundation. However, he also noted that when the sand was removed from the low-land areas, the water table in the area would deepen.
This causes the upper and middle level slopes to give way to erosion causing landslides, he said.
Dr. Siriwardana also provided an insight into what leaves Sri Lanka prone to landslides disasters.
Uprooting of rubber trees and replanting them causes a lot of water to be absorbed into the soil eventually resulting in landslides. The recent landslides in the western slope areas around Kalutara, Galle and Ratnapura are mainly due to the uprooting of rubber tress. When rubber trees are uprooted, a lot of waste material is being produced. This could cause siltation in the lower courses of the river, he said.
A lot of garbage is released into waterways including water bottles, plastic and polythene. This causes severe damage to the environment and are a definite cause of blocking river channels and drainage systems resulting in floods.
Most of the drainage patterns are now blocked due to the emergence of unauthorised buildings-particularly in suburban areas such as Kaduwela, Kalutara and Malabe. Most houses are built blocking regular waterways such as drainages. When the population grows, there is a definite increase in the amount of garbage added to the environment resulting in blocked waterways.
With a construction boom going on in certain areas, soil excavation is also currently rampant. If one travelled from Colombo to Kandy, one could observe a lot of barren lands where certain fertile soil has been cut down and excavated for various construction purposes. If this soil mining is not properly filled and restored, soil erosion could take place. It should be noted that when flash floods occur, everything gets washed away in the process.
Respective authorities should enforce strict regulations with regard to addressing such issues and strictly monitor such activities in order to prevent further environmental disasters, Dr. Siriwardana concluded.


landslides insri lanka,a man-made Disaster
The South - West Monsoon brought Sri Lanka heavy rains, causing dreadful landslides and floods affecting many districts and more than 576,042 individuals.
National Building Research Organization (NBRO) had issued landslide warnings for areas where showers could still be expected. People have already forgotten about the Monsoon accompanied misfortunes - floods, landslides and most importantly, relief. Nature has become unpredictable and we know that those floods and landslides have been an annual occurrence in the recent past, and we have been mourning with the victims, instead of taking action to mitigate them. We lack preparation and skills needed as a country to face such tragedies. People lack the attitude needed to save their own lives. Eyewitnesses said a man was waiting for a rotti and before he could make his escape, he lost his life within minutes to a landslide. 2017 May has now become unforgettable with the floods and landslides as well as the bitter lessons of nature. Its our responsibility to make sure those natural disasters do not reccur in the coming years.

Unusually heavy rainfalls have caused the immense landslides in the country recently. In the past, it rarely exceeded 100 millimetres but now the rainfall levels have been recorded as high as 200 and even 400 millimetres.
Commenting on the recent landslides the professor said This time it is not normal. Earlier, the landslides used to occur in hilly areas, but this time nearly all the landslides occurred in the foothills of mountains, where the sediments have been deposited. Normally, hilly areas have the hard rocks, that werent seen in these landslides. Populations are moving up the hills and continuing to build more settlements in unsuitable places without taking into account the safety standards or the hazardous elements the place may have in store, he said.
NBRO warning
People living in on steep slopes or close to dangerous cut slopes should be watchful. People should evacuate from the pre-landslide signs like the slant of trees or posts, sudden cracks appear on walls or the ground and sudden appearances of muddy water springs emerging from the ground. People are advised to stay alarmed of landslides in the vulnerable areas and be prepared to move away if heavy rain continues.


Mentioning recent landslides he said: Quarries and road construction are responsible for landslides up to a certain level. But this year, many natural disasters took place due to the rare occurrence of heavy rainfall within 2- 3 hours. There are a huge number of maps and if people take good use of those maps, it will be easier to identify the weak zones that are prone to natural hazards. If the relevant authorities havent done it yet, it should be initiated right away.


According to the researches done by the NBRO, 10 districts have been identified as vulnerable to landslides-including Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Kegalle, Ratnapura, and Badulla in general.
Most of the recent landslides were reported from Ratnapura, Kegalle, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla. The heavy rains were a triggering factor as well as a lubricant for these- landslides.
Destruction turned to suffering
Landslides now occur in the Moneragala - Badulla and Kurunegala slopes. Rain was the triggering factor for this years landslides, but the unplanned human settlements and faulty land use have also largely contributed to the disaster. There has been some kind of human activity related to most of the landslides, as per the investigations of NBRO, he said.
Palinda Nuwara landslide was due to improper land use; drone imagery has proof of uprooted rubber plants at the starting point of the landslides. The rubber estate was removed completely and the hollows filled by the rain water saturated the soil with water and made it unstable, causing the landslides. The slope supported the load to move downward faster and the soil in the already open and eroded rubber estate added a massive volume to the sliding river of debris. The landslide took the weakest route down the hill and destroyed a human settlement below which was not supposed to be there, he described.
Referring to the Aranayaka landslide he said:
Aranayaka was a very fertile land. I think we had to keep the agriculture practices only; free from settlements. The changing trend in land usage on top of Aranayaka mountain area was the cause for the landslide that occurred in the area, which began from a small tea estate. Commenting on the situation in Matale, he noted that spontaneous mud springs, sink-holes and cracks on earth were due to the eroding of the limestone basin under the Matale surface.

Traditionally people in the area built houses in an elevated manner accompanied with steps as a precaution to minimise flood risk.

Emphasising on the minor landslides occurring in the Gampaha District, he said that even in Ja - Ela, they were due to unregulated excavations and building houses on land propped up by retention walls.
Improper road construction and excavations and non- renovation of excavated slopes make the soil unstable. Therefore, whenever an extra pressure is applied to the slope; landslides occur.
We have noted a number of cases in hilly regions where the primary cause of a destructive landslide is being an excavated slope not refilled. Those are categorised as huge landslides based on the amount of debris that rolled down the slope.
There are man-made cavities in Ratnapura, as a result of the gem industry. This would cause trouble in future, if those cavities are affected by floods. The tradiotnal adage in the Ratnapura region is Expect floods after 14 days from the (Sinhala and Tamil) New Year.
Traditionally people in the area built houses in an elevated manner accompanied with steps as a precaution to minimise flood risk. Even the traditional knowledge of flood safety is not practised today. There were people who could guess the water level just by checking the clock tower in the Ratnapura town. Timing to get away if water levels rise, he said.

People would assume hills as ideal places to live because they do not see how human settlements and agriculture can disturb the delicate balance

Local authorities failure
Lack of response and cooperation of local authorities with the NBRO, in following the recommendations and land clearance processes have been identified as a major cause for landslides in certain areas.
To minimise harm from landslides, we have issued a circular through the Disaster Management Centre in 2011, stating that for any construction in hilly slopes, a recommendation is mandatory from NBRO. Our recommendation goes directly to the local authorities from where the plans are approved. Many local authorities are following the NBRO guidelines prior to starting projects, but we have noticed that a district which is famous for a sacred Bodhiya, is the weakest in responding to us in assistance. None of the local authorities in that district cooperate with the NBRO. That district was heavily affected by floods and landslides this year. I think the Bulathsinhala area has not practised our recommendations as well. Obviously, we do not deny the right to building houses, but those who are building houses should do it with a sound knowledge of the landscape.
We have been trying to educate them with awareness programs and meetings to get them cooperate with us, but nobody reacted well. However, most of the local authorities cooperate. It seems that certain politicians do not stop the public from building houses in risky areas in fear of losing votes, thus losing the votes and the lives of voters.

Threats
Building houses near river banks is dangerous due to the risk of bank collapses. The Japanese experts were here to investigate the landslides, but they were unable to proceed as our people themselves were living in danger zones on hills. People would assume hills as ideal places to live because they do not see how human settlements and agriculture can disturb the delicate balance. 

Faking tragedy
Now in this disaster situation, it is very problematic to keep count on the real victims of flood and landslide, as many fake victims are gathered in relief camps.
While collecting data of landslides, we are carrying our investigations to identify the real victims of natural disasters. It is the same people who wouldnt care a bit about building houses safely that are now bothering our officials to check if their houses are prone to possible threats.
Uprooted rubber plantations are one of the major reasons for floods according the Director. The Kukule Ganga landslide was due to too much of water in the soil he said.
He said there were no rules or methods to force replanting rubber trees again.
The NBRO can only recommend things, we cannot force, make rules or punish the guilty. Institutions powerful enough to act upon breaking laws are therefore mandatory.

Ninth item among Atapirikara (eight-fold offering) creates a stir
	

A special pinkama was held in the city quite recently under the patronage of the Mahanayake Theras of the tri-nikayas to invoke the intervention of the pantheon of deities to protect the country from natural calamities.


Organizers of the pinkama had come across an unexpected problem when it was the time to make the traditional pirikara offering to the Maha Sangha. They had accidentally discovered an extraneous item placed inside the boxes that contained atapirikara. It was a booklet that described in glowing terms the yeoman service rendered to Buddha Sasana by the previous regime! It soon came to light that a well-known Buddhist prelate was responsible for placing the booklet in the special box.
Soon messages passed back forth between the organizers and the yahapalanaya authorities and finally organizers started removing the booklet from the hundreds of atapirikara boxes.
However, the prelate who had got the booklet introduced into the boxes raised a strong objection to removing it. Not to be outdone, the official in charge of the atapirikara pooja arrangement, put his foot down. Remove all the booklets It is my own neck at risk!

No Selfies allowed on railway tracks: Railways Dept.
	
People who take selfies on railways tracks would be arrested and legal action would be taken, a senior official of the Railways Department said today.
Accordingly, the Railway Department would deploy Railway Security officers on tracks to arrest people who use the tracks.
The senior official said the decision was taken following a weekly meeting at the Department.
The Railways Department has taken this decision following two incidents involving selfies in Kollupitiya and Ambalangoda recently.
A total of 20 deaths have been reported so far during the past five months near vulnerable places on railway tracks or stations, while the victims tried to take selfie photos using their mobile phones or while engaged in conversations with their earphones plugged, they said.
According to the Railways Act of 1864 it said, legal actions would be taken against the persons who use the railway tracks, but he question was that the law was never implemented.
The department had decided to arrest people who attempt to take selfies, while standing on railway tracks, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Panama establishes ties with China, ditches Taiwan in win for Beijing
	

Panama has established diplomatic ties with China and broken with Taiwan in a major victory for Beijing, which continues to lure away the dwindling number of countries that have formal relations with the self-ruled island.
Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela said in a televised address on Monday that Panama was upgrading its commercial ties with China and establishing full diplomatic links with the second most important customer of its key shipping canal.
Im convinced that this is the correct path for our country, Varela said.
Taiwans government said it was sorry and angry over Panamas decision, and said it would not compete with China in what it described as a diplomatic money game.
Our government expresses serious objections and strong condemnation in response to China enticing Panama to cut ties with us, confining our international space and offending the people of Taiwan, David Lee, Taiwans minister of foreign affairs, told a briefing in Taipei.
Taiwan would immediately end cooperation with and assistance for Panama, and evacuate embassy and technical personnel in order to safeguard our national sovereignty and dignity, Lee said.
China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who it thinks wants to push for the islands formal independence, although she says she wants to maintain peace with Beijing.
China and Taiwan have tried to poach each others allies over the years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, although Taipei struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful China.
Panama is the second country to switch its recognition to Beijing since Tsai took office last year, following a similar move by Sao Tome and Principe in December, trimming to 20 the number of countries that formally recognize Taiwan.

## Title: Pelvic Floor Dysfunction following pregnancy
## Section: Medicine

Pelvic Floor Dysfunction following pregnancy
	

Have you noticed that a small amount of urine leaks out accidentally when you cough, sneeze or lift things during pregnancy You could be having a condition known as pelvic floor dysfunction.

Q What is the pelvic floor
It is a sheet of muscles and ligaments extending from the pubic bone in the front of our body to the base of the spine situated in our back. Basically it is a balloon-like membrane which can stretch to a certain extent, according to the weight it bears and come back to its original position once the weight is removed. 

QWhat is the role the pelvic floor plays
It bears the weights of the bladder, bowel, uterus, the womb and controls the emptying of the bowel and bladder. 
When these organs are not well supported, the sphincters cannot be squeezed properly and it causes a stress incontinence which leads to the leakage of urine and a dragging feeling when you cough and sneeze. It can also lead to the sagging of the uterus and other organs. Moreover, it affects the vaginal muscles. If your pelvic floor is overly stretched, there is a reduced satisfaction in sexual activities and less sensitivity in the vaginal area. 

QWhat is pelvic floor dysfunction during pregnancy
When you are pregnant your body has extra weight to bear. This causes a lot of stress on the pelvic floor, causing it to become more stretched than usual. As a result, the floor can weaken from the 12th week of pregnancy. Constipation, which is a common complaint among pregnant mothers, can also lead to pelvic floor dysfunction. 

QWhat can I do to maintain a strong pelvic floor
Doing pelvic floor exercises on a regular basis can prevent this condition during pregnancy and even after. It helps increase the blood supply to the perineal area after the delivery, which will shorten the period of healing. 
Always squeeze and hold your pelvic floor muscles before you cough, sneeze or lift something, eat plenty of food rich in fibre (e.g. mango, papaw, kohila) to avoid constipation and empty your bladder completely when you go to the toilet. 
When you are sitting on the toilet, lean forward. Keep your knees slightly higher than your hips (use a small stool to rest your feet on). Rest your elbows on your knees or thighs so that your back is straight. Gently bulge your abdomen. Now relax your pelvic floor and avoid pushing. 

QHow can I do pelvic floor exercises
First of all, you need to identify your pelvic floor muscles. Insert a finger into your vagina. Tighten the muscles as if you are holding in your urine, then let go. You should feel the muscles tighten and move up and down. Now that you have found the muscles, go on repeating the steps given below.

First sit and lean slightly forward with a straightened back and squeeze and lift the muscles as if you are trying to stop urinating. Next hold for up to 5 seconds and relax for 10 seconds. You can repeat these steps up to 10 times, 3-4 times a day. Dont forget to keep breathing while exercising. Some people might feel that they can speed up their progress by increasing the number of repetitions and the frequency of exercises.
However, over-exercising causes muscle fatigue and an increase in urine leakage. If you feel any discomfort in your abdomen or back while doing these exercises, you are probably doing them wrong. Breathe deeply and relax your body when doing these exercises. The most important thing to remember about pelvic floor muscles is that they dont strengthen on their own after being stretched beyond a certain limit. After each delivery, you should help these muscles get back to normal. You will also have to remember that hormonal changes after menopause can worsen this condition, causing your bladder to leak often by the time you reach middle age after childbirth.

The event brings together people representative of the entire Christian community  Roman Catholic, Mainline, and Evangelical. The spirit of ICF is to build bridges of friendship and trust, spanning the diversity of the community. The Pentecost event draws both lay people and clergy, in all three language media into a celebration with the intent of interaction at all levels of the community. Praise, worship, prayer, insightful messages and an opportunity for fellowship are all included in the programme.

Pentecost marks the event that brought the disciples of Jesus together after his ascension and energized them with the power of the Holy Spirit, changing the fearful and reticent into fearless witnesses of Jesus. With His power they effectively communicated the message of the love of Christ to a negative world. Pentecost was when they came together with one accord and it is recognized today in all traditions of the church.

Dream Works, the biennial month-long Art and Craft Exhibition which opened on Thursday 25th May 2017 at the British School in Colombo is a spectacular art extravaganza which showcases the talent of the juniors of the school. The aim of the art exhibition is to share the enthusiasm and unseen talents and capabilities of young children with their proud parents, grandparents and sometimes even extended family. The brilliant and creative art teachers of the Junior School Ms. Indika and Ms. Noeline have spent a lot of time selecting the themes and the contents for presentation, and also displaying the paintings and 3-D models to ensure maximum effect, with the assistance of members of the Junior School staff. 
On display on all the walls of the corridors and the main stairway of the Junior School are a spectacular range of paintings, sculptures, 3-D models with recyclable materials, wall hangings, mobiles, craft work and murals depicting lifestyles, moods, nature, fashion and a bit of history. A wide range of materials have been used in bringing this whole exhibition together; canvas, clay, jute, mesh and wire, grey cloth, used bottles, wood off-cuts and decorative materials for fashion designing are some of them. Items ranging from toothbrushes to drinking straws and popsicle sticks to barbeque sticks have been used to portray fantastic hairstyles to fit in with the theme DreamWorks. Decorative umbrellas, lamp shades and dreamy-curtains add to the creativity of the theme. The imaginative patterns and colour schemes, and the use of the vibrant hues from nature are truly an exhibition of talent from an outstanding showcase school. 
The opening ceremony was a riot of colour with costumes designed by the students themselves. It was a super display of dancing talent brought out by our fantastic dance teachers, Ms. Romina and Ms. Nadeeka, in line with the themes of the exhibition. The Principal Dr. Scarth, warmly welcomed the invitees and parents and described that he had a preview of some of the exhibits which were outstanding pieces of work from children of the Junior School. He mentioned that it was a remarkable sight to see the students proudly showing their creations to the parents. Dr. Scarth also mentioned that the clay models showing different hairstyles was his favourite section.

The opening dance was by 5B depicting the life of fishermen to the rhythmic beat of the song Hoiiya Hoiiya. Next came the fabulous dancers from 6D inspired by Polynesian culture; they presented a Hawaiian dance followed by a tribal dance displaying superb movements and expressions. Following them on stage was 5C in their glitzy black and gold costumes, portraying Egyptian murals in imaginative steps  to the beat of Walk like an Egyptian. Pretend by 5A was an enchanting masquerade to the tune of the Beautiful Blue Danube by Yohann Stauss; the ladies in beautiful ball gowns and the gentlemen in their immaculate dress suits were a sight to behold! The dance presented by 6B was inspired by colours and rhythms from Middle-East; the popular song Asha drew whistles and claps from the audience. Next followed the rhythmic movement of the dancers from 5D to the tune of the song Umbrella with the concept drawn from the umbrellas designed by students of Year 3. Vibrant hues from the world of birds were brought alive by 6A. The birds display of talent in dancing made Rio come alive in the BSC Auditorium on May 25 evening. It was a first ever to have witnessed tropical birds rapping along with the music!

Next, the Chief Guest Mrs. Shanta Gunaratna delivered an inspiring speech emphasising the importance of child art education in moulding a well-balanced personality in every child. She said that parents should encourage their children to bring out their creativity and the freedom of expression from a very early age. She also went on to say that the parents of the students of BSC are indeed fortunate as their children get a fantastic opportunity to bring out their creativity and display it in this manner. 
Finally, 6C drew inspiration from the colours from the wonderful animal kingdom to bring out their fantastic walk on the ramp for Katy Perrys ROAR!. 
The Head Boy Krrish Khanth and the Head Girl Maya Vitarana delivered the vote of thanks at the end of the event. All in all, the opening ceremony and the art exhibition were a marvelous display of talent from the students of the Junior School of the British School in Colombo.

Turkish president says Qatar isolation violates Islamic values
	
REUTERS, 13th JUNE, 2017- Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan denounced the isolation of Qatar by neighboring states as a violation of Islamic values and tantamount to a death penalty against Doha in a crisis reverberating through the Middle East and beyond.
Erdogans comments marked the strongest intervention yet by a powerful regional ally of Doha eight days after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and imposed stringent economic sanctions on it.
Qatar denies the allegations of supporting Islamist militants and Iran.
The measures against Qatar, a small oil and gas exporter with a population of 2.7 million people, have disrupted imports of food and other materials and caused some foreign banks to scale back business. Qatar, which imported 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbours before the diplomatic shutdown, has also been talking to Iran and Turkey to secure food and water. A very grave mistake is being made in Qatar, isolating a nation in all areas is inhumane and against Islamic values. Its as if a death penalty decision has been taken for Qatar, Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party in Ankara.

Vigneswaran takes over NPC temporarily
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran today temporarily took over all four ministerial portfolios of the council under his purview after informing two of the ministers to resign and the other two to go on a month's-leave, due to charges of corruption.
When the committee report which was made over the corruption charges levelled against all four of the council ministers was taken up for debate today, the Chief Minister informed the Education Minister T. Gurukularajah and Agriculture Minister O. Ainkaraneshan to resign.
Meanwhile, the Chief Minister informed Transport and Trade Minister B. Deniswaran and Health Minister P. Sathyalingam to go on a month's leave as there were investigations of corruption pending against them.
Mr. Vigneswaran afterwards informed Council Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam that he will take over the portfolios of all ministers under his purview for the time being.
The council ministers who were accused said that although they were not guilty of the charges levelled against them, they would accept the decision taken by the Chief Minister.
Meanwhile, Opposition Council Member V. Jayathilake said they were not given the opportunity to express their opinions during the debate and therefore, all opposition members walked out of the council.
However, he said discussions with regard to the vacancies of the four ministries would be held on June 22, during the council session. (Romesh Madhusanka)

Was it by design or by accident
	

The former strongman visited the country of the Rising Sun recently and was given a red carpet welcome by the compatriot community there. And by a strange coincidence, soon afterwards he found himself in the company of a yahapalanaya deputy who was to remain his inseparable companion until the end of his visit in that hospitable country.

The deputy is said to be a Blue one hailing from the Puttalam district and he was in the council even during the regime of the former strongman. 
By the way, a rumour was abuzz in the recent past that this worthy was on the verge of joining the JO, the current political vehicle of the former strongman. However, it did not happen. There was another rumour later that he had had second thoughts about the contemplated move considering the possible outcome of several pending court cases against him.
However, the question as to why our man had obviously planned to go about in a foreign country in tow with the former strongman still remains unanswered, they say.
