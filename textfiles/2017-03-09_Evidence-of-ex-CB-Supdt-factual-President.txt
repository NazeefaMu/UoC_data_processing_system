President Maithripala Sirisena today said the evidence given by a former lady superintendent of the Central Bank was the factual, correct and steady evidence given by any witness called before the Presidential Commission to investigate allegations against the former governor of the Central Bank.

Addressing a ceremony organised by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Women Organisation at the SLFP Headquarters to mark International Women’s Day, the President said as a woman she had demonstrated her valour to fulfil her duty honestly and steadily.

“She had stated that she was under pressure and that there was nothing that could be done in her capacity. Her evidence is a classic example of the honesty, steadfastness and the qualities of a woman dedicated to fulfilling her duty.
