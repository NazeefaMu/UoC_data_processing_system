Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, says the government will start execution of projects next year, and people will feel the benefits by the end of the year or at the beginning of 2018. 
Excerpts:  



"It is beyond my control. The Finance Minister also has a long term view on this. Sri Lanka has too many providers in the telecommunication sector. These tariffs will be a burden, but services will be better. We will give better value addition in future. "

 

Q  How do you see the current political situation?  

The next year will be a crucial one. For the last couple of years, attention was paid the consolidation of the government and getting the necessary mechanism in place. We have levelled the ground to have the race in the proper manner. The next year will be very crucial for us in terms of delivery. We will start seeing results. As you all are aware, there are lots of expectations of the people. It was difficult to live up to them. Though there is a change of government, the working order or the system did not change. It does not happen overnight. In the first year, what was done was the change of policies and all. It was done slowly and steadily. The international community has confidence in us. Now, we have built a roadmap for the development 
of the country.  
Execution of work will be done next year. People will see the results at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2018.  

Q  In what way?  

That is in terms of development, job creation, investment coming in and new innovations. There will be a new mechanism working in Sri Lanka. I think the first year was meant for bringing reconciliation and strengthening the rule of law. People have freedom of expression. It shows when you look at social media, print media and electronic media. They are not controlled any more. The Prime Minister just makes a noise in Parliament. That is it. It is his pure right. But, they are not victimized. They are not being whisked away and harassed.   

Q  You talk about the government with optimism, and plans for development. But, we see a lot of tension between the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the government. How does it affect the very survival of the government?  

It purely depends on the President and the Prime Minister. They realize the January 8th promise they gave to people. They have different parties to maintain. The President has to look after the SLFP and the Prime Minister the UNP. Unfortunately, there are scattered incidents in which some MPs become stingy. They want their own party to govern the country. They do not have a mandate for it. Some have even come to Parliament on the National List. That is their sheer luck. When you are in a national government of this nature for the first time after 1948, it won’t be easy even for the politicians to understand the concept. They may make irrational comments. It is up to the leaders to see that the party cadre is kept in line. This kind of odd statements may be heard.  
I am a Cabinet Minister. I know how the President and the Prime Minister handle the situation.  

Q  Actually, some of your own party MPs were critical of the SLFP MPs and asked them to leave the government if they want. What do you think of it?  

It was a pure retaliation probably from the UNPers. We have watched how the SLFPers have behaved. They have been very arrogant. I come from a district where all the nine electorates were won by the UNP. Unfortunately, I am placed in a very bad situation now. 
I got the third highest percentage of votes in Sri Lanka. My hands are really tight because of the national government. I feel I got a very bad deal. However, I believe in the concept of national government. That is the Prime Minister’s vision. I always want to support it. My leader has a bigger picture in mind. What is good for the country is not to fight on party lines but to deliver something to the country. We have to grasp this opportunity and move forward. I sometimes disregard my personal ego because I feel the county will benefit in the long run. I have beaten Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and Dilan Perera at three consecutive elections. Now, what is asked is what Haring Fernando has done. To be frank, it is very difficult for me to do when the people who have lost got ministries. If it were a UNP government, I could have done a lot more for the people. There are sacrifices one has to make. Personally, it is hurtful when people complain about non-delivery. We still have four more years. I am certain that the national government will start working. Some politicians are unfortunately selfish because they want to have the whole cake and eat.

Q  What do you feel about the work you do for your constituents?  

 I do not handle a subject directly relevant to people in Badulla. It is a ministry similar in standing to the Mahaweli Development Ministry and Mahapola Bursary Scheme in the past. The Ministry in charge of digitization will be one like that. It will change the whole landscape of Sri Lanka. It is very difficult to explain it to people because they may not understand what it means. Digitalization is bringing your life into your fingertips. I will be able to transform the country by changing the way people think in terms of their education, health, and e-governance. Everything will be brought into smart phones so that people can get services without any travel. That is the industrial revolution assigned to me along with this Ministry. It may take time for me to deliver. It is a new ministry. It has to be formulated.  
I am impressed with the last budget. Next to the north, there are rebates for investments in the Uva Province. I have been able to talk  to four companies. The Prime Minister has also instructed to extend the expressway from Hambantota to Badulla. That way, he wants to promote tourism.  

Q  In this manner, the government has been talking about ambitious projects. However, people complain that nothing has happened on the ground for the last couple of years. What is your response?  

As I said, though the last government was changed, the faces did not change. Ground level mechanisms have not changed. The thinking pattern of Ministry Secretaries is very different. We need to infuse positive thinking.  

Q  Does it mean that bureaucrats do not listen to the government?  

Not all of them. I would say most of them are very laid back. They do not want to have progressive thinking. They do not want to move fast. They try to keep the time growing. For a politician, it is only five years. But a bureaucrat remains there till he retires.  

 

"Execution of work will be done next year. People will see the results at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2018...They do not have a mandate for it. ...Some have even come to Parliament on the National List.   "

Q  What is the alternative then?  

That is why, we have a separate fast-tracking system. Various bureaucrats s are brought and pushed to work. We have figured out a way forward. Procurements are sometimes delayed for months. It is not about the politicians, the policies or whatever.   

Q  How certain are you that this government will serve its full term?  

I am absolutely certain. The next local government election will be an ideal opportunity. Some people think this will be a chance for them to get a stand against the government. People are smart enough to understand that this government has a vision. There are issues. But, the UNP will have a very clear victory.  
If US $ 8 billion investment as planned comes in, it will be a major boost. If the Free Trade Agreements with India, China and Singapore succeeds, it will be a boost to develop the country. We want to be an alternative to Dubai and Singapore. People are looking at Sri Lanka. You need to have a stable government to instil investor confidence.  

Q  How are you getting ready for the local government election?  

I will start work on it in January. People must have confidence. They need to understand that what we said would be delivered. A few will be unhappy as one year passed without anything. We have to go to the grassroots level and explain about it. We will ask for one more opportunity to perform. It is easy for the government. It is always the party in power that wins local elections.  

Q  There are rumours that you will move away from Badulla to do future politics. Is there any truth in it?  

 It is an absolute falsehood. There is a certain segment of Badulla politicians in the opposition spreading such disinformation. I got the highest number of preferential votes. Once I deliver, people will begin to realize. A modern hospital is coming in Badulla. Three call centres will be set up in Badulla creating 1000 jobs. I know my time is four years more. We are going to develop dairy farming in our area. A foreign university will also be established.  

Q  In the run up to the last election, the government promised free Wi Fi zones. How has it materialized?  

When these zones were launched, they were done by five service providers. They did not want integrate among themselves. When one service provider gives free Wi Fi access at one place, a customer using another service cannot use internet in it. So, the project did not get off the ground as fast as we expected. We had to redo the whole thing to integrate all. By now, we have 500 sites. There is a problem. We did not have proper advertising on the project. We did not have a budget for it. After this festive season, I have planned a massive promotional campaign on it.  

Q The recent tariff hike has hampered the use of internet. What is your response?  

It is beyond my control. The Finance Minister also has a long term view on this. Sri Lanka has too many providers in the telecommunication sector. 
These tariffs will be a burden, but services will be better. We will give better value addition in future. 
We will bring down the cost. In the long run, the Finance Minister has a different plan. At the moment, I take the blame and keep quite.
