Commenting on the incident where Cricketer Kumar Sangakkara faced an unpleasant experience with a UK immigration officer in London, the British High Commission in Colombo on Friday said their Border Force officers were trained to maintain high standards of professionalism and courtesy, especially at the UK Border.
When contacted by Daily Mirror to get a response from the High Commission over the incident, it further said there might be instances when officers failed to carry out duties maintaining accepted standards.
"We recognise that there may be instances when officers fail to adhere to these standards. However, all official complaints lodged with the UK Border Force are rigorously investigated," it said.(Sunil Jayasiri)Unpleasant experience with UK Immi. officer-Sanga
