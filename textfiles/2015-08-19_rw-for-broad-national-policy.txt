	A broad national policy for the betterment of the country will be put to Parliament after obtaining President Maithripala Sirisena’s approval by the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) which emerged victorious at the general elections.
	Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would take oaths today as Prime minister of the UNFGG government told a media briefing at Temple Trees today that a national policy that addressed main issues that the country faced would be worked out with broad consensus of all parties.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said he would immediately start discussions with the President and all other political parties on a national policy.
	Answering questions fired at him by the international media on the foreign policy including ties with India and China, he said all these would be included in the national policy that would be discussed and decided upon.
	Meanwhile, former Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake who briefed the journalists said the UNFGG would obtain a comfortable majority in Parliament shortly.
	An optimistic Mr. Karunanayake said the party could even muster a two-thirds majority. (Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
