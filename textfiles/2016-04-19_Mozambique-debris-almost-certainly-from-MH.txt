Two pieces of debris recovered from beaches in Mozambique -- one found last December and the other in February -- almost certainly came from missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Tuesday.

"Part No. 1 was a flap track fairing segment, almost certainly from the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft, registered 9M-MRO," the Safety Bureau report said of the piece found December 27.

The second piece of debris was found February 27, approximately 135 miles (220 kilometers) from the spot where the first item was discovered.

"Part No. 2 was a horizontal stabilizer panel segment, almost certainly from the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft, registered 9M-MRO," the report said.

MH370's disappearance is one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries. The plane vanished from radar on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, with 239 people on board. (CNN)
