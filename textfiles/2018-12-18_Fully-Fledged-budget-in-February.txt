The new government will present a fully-fledged budget for 2019 in February after the Cabinet was sworn in, it is learnt.

Besides, it will present a Vote on Account (VoA) to allocate money from the Consolidated Fund to carry out the government’s functions.

A UNP MP who is slated to take oath as a Minister said a fully-fledged budget could not be debated and passed in Parliament during the remaining weeks of this month.

“We will bring a Vote on Account first to find money for a couple of months. Afterwards, we will bring the budget for 2019,” he said.
