Floating armoury: Court insists vessel be handed over to shipping co.


	

The Galle Deputy Habour Master was ordered by court today to carry out immediately the earlier court order to release the ship that contained the floating armoury to the shipping company or else action would be taken against him for contempt of court.
Galle Chief Magistrate Nilupuli Lankatilleka severely warned the Deputy Harbour Master for his failure to enforce the court order and held that the approval of the Navy or the CID was not required to enforce a court order.
Ceylon Shipping Lines that owned the ship had informed court on several occasions that the ship was in an unserviceable condition and it was liable to develop oil leaks or any other defect causing extensive environmental damage. The court had permitted them to replace the ship and to transfer the armoury and informed the court order to the Habour Master and the Southern Commander of the Navy.
However, when the officials failed to enforce the court order, the Magistrate had made an order for the second time. When the case was taken up on a motion filed by the shipping line that the ship was yet to be released, the Deputy Harbour Master was noticed to appear in court today. The shipping company informed court that the weapons had already been handed over to the Navy. (D.G. Sugathapala)
