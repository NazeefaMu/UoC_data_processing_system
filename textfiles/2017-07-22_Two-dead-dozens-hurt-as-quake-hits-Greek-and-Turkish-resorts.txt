Greece/Turkey, (Daily Mail), 21 July 2017 -  Two people died and hundreds injured after a powerful earthquake struck off the Turkish coast overnight, triggering a tsunami that hit tourist resorts in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and damaging buildings across the region.  


The epicentre of the magnitude-6.7 quake was off Bodrum, southwest Turkey, with the country’s Aegean coast and Greek holiday islands including Kos and Rhodes 
worst affected.   


Holidaymakers fled hotels in terror and some even jumped from balconies as the quake hit before running for their lives to higher ground as tsunami waves surged through beachfront resorts moments later, flooding bars and restaurants, carrying away cars and depositing boats in town streets.  


On the island of Kos, where a state of emergency has been declared, two male tourists - a 22-year-old from Sweden and a 39-year-old from Turkey - were killed after being crushed under a collapsed ceiling at the White Corner Club bar. Another man from Sweden has lost both of his legs, police said.  
Parts of a historic mosque in Kos Town also came crashing down into the street and rescuers were this morning sifting through rubble looking for trapped survivors.   
n Turkey, at least 70 people were admitted to hospitals in Bodrum.
