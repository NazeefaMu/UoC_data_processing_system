A new Ministerial one, known as a moneyed businessman is these days fired with a new ambition: to own a media institution, they say.
He is said to be eyeing a TV station owned by the bucks of a former powerful family who have now found formidable obstacles in the way of running it. The Ministerial one keen to buy it has already made an offer, they say.
This businessman-turned politico from the East raised to Ministerial status despite being a tenderfoot to Diyawanna is set to wrap up the deal, but there is some dilly dallying on the part of the young co-owners, they say.
