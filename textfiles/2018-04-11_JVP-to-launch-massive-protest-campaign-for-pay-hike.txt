The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it would launch a massive work stoppage and protest campaign after the May Day to secure a salary increase for public and private sector employees and against the scrapping of the pension.

JVP Politburo member K.D. Lal Kantha told a news conference that the cost of living of a family had risen by Rs.6,000 rupees a month after the present government came into power.

JVP general secretary Tilvin Silva said the JVP had planned to hold its May Day parade and the rally in Jaffna on May 1 so that the Vesak festival would not be obstructed.

“No one can postpone May Day. But we accept the fact that there is a practical difficulty in organizing the May Day parade and the rally in Colombo on May 1 due to Vesak celebrations. We will hold our rally on May 1 in Jaffna and the main rally in Colombo on May 7 with a participation of more than 5 million people,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
