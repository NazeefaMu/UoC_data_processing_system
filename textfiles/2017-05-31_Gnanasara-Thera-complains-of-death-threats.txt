The Organised Crimes Division (OCD) today informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate that a broad investigation has been initiated over a complaint received from Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), regarding death threats received by Galagoda Athe Gnanasara Thera.

The BBS Chief Executive officer Dilantha Kumara Vithanage had lodged a complaint with the prosecution, over the alleged unknown death threats received to the Thera, and subsequently OCD initiated the investigation.

Filing a facts report before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the prosecution sought a few appropriate court orders to conduct the investigation broadly. (Shehan Chamik Silva)
