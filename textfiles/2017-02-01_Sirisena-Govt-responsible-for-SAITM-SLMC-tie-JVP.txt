The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today charged that it was not the court but President Sirisena’s government that was responsible for the verdict permitting the registration of SAITM medical graduates with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).

JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said  permission was granted to a corrupted and illegal institute which was misused by the Rajapaksa political authority. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
