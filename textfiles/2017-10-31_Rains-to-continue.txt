Rains to continue


	

The rains are expected to intensify in the wake of low level atmospheric disturbances over Sri Lanka, the Department of Meteorology said.

It said showers or thundershowers would occur in the Western, North-Western, Uva, Northern, North-Central provinces and in the districts of Galle, Matara, Ampara and Batticaloa.

“The possibility of heavy rains is high in the hilly areas with rains of more than 150 mm can be expected at some places in the Central and Sabaragamuwa Provinces,” the Met Department said.

It said strong winds of up to 70-80 kmph and very rough seas can be expected in the sea areas off the coast extending from Galle to Kankesanturai via Puttalam and Mannar because of the active cloudiness over the Western and North-Western sea areas.

People have been asked to take precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning and requested fishing communities to be vigilant of rough seas. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
