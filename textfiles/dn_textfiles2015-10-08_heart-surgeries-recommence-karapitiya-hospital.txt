Heart surgeries recommence at Karapitiya Hospital

Heart surgeries at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital has recommenced, Cabinet Spokesman and Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
"I have already had discussions with the relevant parties and solved the problem. A new theatre will be constructed at the hospital soon," he said.
The minister said consultant cardiologist Dr. Namal Gamage is Sri Lanka's only consultant thoracic heart surgeon who can perform three or more heart surgeries a day.
Dr. Senaratne blamed the Health Ministry for the issues at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital by sending more surgeons.
"Another cardio thoracic surgeon was sent there creating a conflict because he was not fast as Dr. Gamage. Another thoracic surgeon was also sent adding fuel to the burning fire. A long waiting list ensued," he said.
Dr. Senaratne said issues have now been solved.
Another theatre will be constructed at the hospital and the thoracic surgeon will be sent to the Chest Hospital, the minister said.
