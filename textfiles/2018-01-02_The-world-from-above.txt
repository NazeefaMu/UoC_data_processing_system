The images reveal the most stunning shots taken across the world last year. Spectacular scenery is quite common in memorable drone images, but close ups of people and animals was a common theme in 2017.  

Those photos to make the cut included a leaping polar bear in Northern Canada, a woman harvesting water lilies in Vietnam, window washers in Moscow City and a herd of hippos swimming in Tanzania.

But there was also no shortage of epic scenery with shots of the Namibian sand dunes, beautiful beaches across the world and the concrete jungle that is Dubai also making it. (Daily Mail)
