Is it the start of a state-run violent era? JO asks


	

The Joint Opposition expressed concern yesterday over the Monday’s horrific shooting in Kalutara and said they wondered whether the incident was a precursor to a state-run violent era similar to the 88-89 insurgency.

JO national organiser, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said that, for the first time in history, a gang of underworld figures clad in police uniforms had attacked a prisons bus and killed five suspects and two prisons officers.

“This is horrendous. During the previous government’s tenure, underworld figures left the country. As soon as the new government came to power they returned. In fact a government politician is behind the return of the thugs who left the country,” he alleged at a media briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
