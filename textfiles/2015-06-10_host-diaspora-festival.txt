The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was planning to host a festival of Diaspora by the end of the year in a bid to facilitate meaningful interactions between the government and the Diaspora communities to move forward reconciliation and development efforts.
MFA Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne addressing the weekly press briefing at the Ministry premises said the Ministry was also considering the possibility of making the festival an annual event in order to harness the tremendous capacity and goodwill of the Diaspora community for the development process of the country.
She noted that some members of the Diaspora was willing to return to Sri Lanka and among them were intellectuals, professionals and experts, who could contribute to the development of various sectors in the country – a fact that had been reiterated at the meeting held last week in London among members of various Tamil Diaspora groups, which was also attended by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Ms. Colonne pointed out this festival therefore, was organised in light of the lack of an official mediation platform for the Diaspora communities to engage with the government, although was recommended by the LLRC (lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission), that engagement with the Diaspora community was vital in ensuring long lasting peace in the country.
