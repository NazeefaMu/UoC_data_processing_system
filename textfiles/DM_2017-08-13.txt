Four Lankan kids cured of thalassaemia major in India
	
Four Sri Lankan children suffering from thalassaemia major were cured of the disease through bone marrow transplantation in Bengaluru.
Children of ages, four, five, 10 and a 15-month-old baby were treated a month ago.
The children could not find a match from their own families, so we had to go for unrelated donors. The chances of getting a match from unrelated donors are only 10% to 15 %, said Dr Sunil Bhat, head of oncology and bone marrow transplant, Narayana Health City, who conducted the surgery.
He said the match for bone marrow for two of the children was found from the Indian registry of donors called Datri and the other two were from DKMS, a German registry.
The father of one of the children, who did not wish to be named, said that they struggled to find a match and since Sri Lanka did not have tie-ups with the registry, they had to look at other countries.(Deccan Herald)

Port agreement signed before committee report: Susil
	
Several conditions favourable to the country had been recommended by the Cabinet Sub Committee appointed to study the contents of the Hambantota Harbour Lease Agreement, Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
Minister Susil Premajayantha is a member of the Sub Committee.
Decreasing the 99 year lease period, the ratio of shares to 50 percent or to a close proportion, security of the harbour, leasing on partnership basis with China, jurisdiction under Sri Lanka are some of the amendment recommended by the committee, he said.
However, the agreement had been signed in a hurry before the committee report could be presented, he said.
Although provisions are included for amendments in the agreement a signed agreement can be amended only by mutual consent, he said.
Meanwhile, arrangements are also being made to lease out the Trincomalee harbour to India. The country would have to face difficult situations by transferring two main harbours on either sides of the country to foreign nations, he said. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)

Sri Lanka all out for 135
	
India dismissed Sri Lanka for 135 runs and enforced the follow on, with Kuldeep Yadav taking 4 wickets, Indian media reported. Earlier, Hardik Pandya scored a century to power India to 487.
The slight glimmer of hope that the Lankans had after winning two sessions over India on day one meant nothing on day two as Sri Lanka failed to curtail the Indian tail.
Pandya exhibited excellent temperament to negotiate the first hour of play sensibly combining for a 62-run stand for the eighth wicket with Kuldeep Yadav (26), before he switched to his beast mode taking 58 runs in just 32 deliveries batting with number 11 batsman, Umesh Yadav en route to his maiden first-class triple-figure mark with the help of eight fours and seven sixes.
With the first innings score stretched to 487, it was time for the Indian bowlers to take centerstage.
Mohammad Shami claimed two up front before chinaman bowler Kuldeep got in to the act with 4 for 40. Shami was on point right from the start, finding his line and length and hint of away movement from angle made life tough for both SL openers Upul Tharanga and Dimuth Karunaratne.
