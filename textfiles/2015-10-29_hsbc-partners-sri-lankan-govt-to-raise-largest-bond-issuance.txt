HSBC has advised the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on behalf of Sri Lanka to complete a US$ 1.5 billion, 10-year international sovereign bond issuance. 
The transaction, which was priced at a yield of 6.85 percent per annum, marks the second 10-year sovereign bond issue in the international capital markets in 2015 and Sri Lanka’s ninth overall and largest ever bond offering. The final order books stood at US$ 3.3 billion, an oversubscription of 2.2 times. 
Patrick Gallagher, CEO of HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives said, “HSBC is delighted to once again have supported the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in issuing the second ten year sovereign bond having partnered the government of Sri Lanka on all of its sovereign bond issuances since 2007. HSBC continues to be a dominant force in the debt capital markets in Asia and this transaction further stands testament to the ability we have in closing large capital markets transactions and manifests our strong and continued commitment to the country.”
Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s had rated the Issue at ‘BB-’, ‘B1’ and ‘B+’ respectively. 
The strong order book from investors across Asia, Europe and the US meant Sri Lanka was able to price the issue at 6.85 percent after initially launching the trade at a price guidance 7 percent.This tighter yield reflects the continued confidence that the international investors have placed in the sovereign bond issuance of Sri Lanka.
Shamindra Marcelline, Head of Financial Institutions Group and Public Sector for HSBC Sri Lanka said, “This landmark transaction is the sovereign’s largest ever bond offering and clearly marks another significant achievement by the sovereign, especially given the global headwinds in the financial markets and it clearly reiterates the confidence placed by the international investor community in the country’s strong credit story.”
