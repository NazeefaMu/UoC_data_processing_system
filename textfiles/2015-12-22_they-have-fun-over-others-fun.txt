They have fun over others’ fun!


	


A group of Diyawanna members were having their usual fun time in the House lobby the other day.  They were swapping anecdotes, most of them woven around romantic escapades of certain purohitas.
One member was saying, “…This one was holding her hand as usual. You have to guess who she is. All I can say is that she is an opposition member. The affair has gone the full distance…”
“I suppose you people don’t know about the hot affair about this one of the same rank,” another member took his turn. “He visits the building just opposite the …in Colombo, practically every evening. That’s a property belonging to his Ministry. He doesn’t take any extra pain to cover his tracks, because he can always claim that he goes there on official business. Of course, there is no office functioning there. I understand that a young beauty and her housemaid are the only occupants of this building which has the appearance of a typical residence in this locality. I hope you can guess who our guy is!”
“I have heard about a raging affair of another high up,” another member spoke up. “This one is a regular visitor to a high-end hotel close to Galle Face. However, he never uses the front drive to approach the hotel. He has a secret access to it, they say.  He goes straight to the suite where his lady love is snug.”
“Do you want us to guess who that man is?” a member who so far played the audience somewhat angrily turned on the colleague. “Why can’t you name him?”
“If I reveal his name, one of you people might leak the story to the nosy media guys and we all would be in a soup. So I have to censor the name!” the member who was challenged replied.
