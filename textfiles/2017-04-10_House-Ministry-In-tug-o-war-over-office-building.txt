The Parliamentary authorities had made fresh reminders to the Agriculture Ministry asking that it be shifted elsewhere from its current location in Rajamalwatte Mawatha, Battaramulla for the building to be used by them in administrative work.

The building has been sought by the Parliamentary authorities to be used by Parliament for some of its activities.

However, the Agriculture Ministry has sought time till May to vacate the building.

Asked about the latest status, Secretary General of Parliament Dammika Dissanayake said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had made the request.

“We want to shift some of our functions there. Initially, the Agriculture Ministry was supposed to hand over by April 17. Now, time has been sought till May,” he said.

The Government decided to expand the scope of Parliament with the introduction of new committee and assignment of new responsibilities to the Legislators. (Kelum Bandara)
