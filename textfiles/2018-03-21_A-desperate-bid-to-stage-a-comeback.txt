While the various snags in the way of constituting the new local bodies being cleared, picking heads and deputies to the local bodies won with decisive majorities have become a big headache to the main political parties, they say.

 


According to all present indications, picking a member for the deputy chair of the Colombo MC has posed not only a big problem to the party leadership, but also a potential threat to the party unity as well. A Green party heavyweight with a strong vote base in the city is said to have demanded that his nominee be offered the deputy chair in the city council pointing out that of the party members elected to the council, about 20 were his faithfuls. “Remember, I am in a position to tilt the balance of power in the council the way I want. Therefore, offer the deputy office to my nominee,” he had told the party leadership and had added: “By the way, I want my due place in the government restored without further delay.”


The Green heavyweight had later bragged that if the party continued to ignore him and his demands, he would get at least 18 Green members to sit in the opposition when the city council meets for the inaugural session.


However, the Green leadership continues to turn a deaf ear to the Green heavyweight’s demands, they say.
