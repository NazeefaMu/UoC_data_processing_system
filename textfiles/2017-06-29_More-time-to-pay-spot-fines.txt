More time to pay spot fines


	

The police have extended the time to pay spot fines by a week considering the inconvenience caused to the people due to the ongoing postal strike.

Police media said drivers can pay their fines at the special counters set up at the Divisional Secretariats (DS) that would function until the postal strike was called off.

The spot fine receipt should be produced to the respective police station.

If the date of the payment of fines is today, then the charge sheet should be amended by producing it to the OIC Traffic of the particular police station. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
