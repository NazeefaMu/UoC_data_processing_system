As soon as the Right to Information Act came into operation, a certain NGO had sought the details relating to the assets and liabilities of several yahapalanaya heavyweights.

 


By the way, there were allegations in the recent past that this NGO committed to bringing about transparency in all government affairs, was not carrying out their own affairs in a transparent manner.
The yahapalanaya bigwigs who were livid over the ‘cheeky’ request had reportedly given the NGO chaps a tongue- lashing asking them to put their own house in order first and to get whatever information they wanted from the Polls commission.
