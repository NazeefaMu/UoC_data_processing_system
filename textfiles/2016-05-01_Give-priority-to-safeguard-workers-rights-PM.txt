Give priority to safeguard workers’ rights: PM


	

May Day is internationally dedicated to those who labour and work for the betterment of the society at large, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in his May Day message.

The message: “As a nation, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that their commitment is valued and appreciated, their welfare is assured and that the proper environment is shaped to enhance their contribution to society.

As we come together to celebrate May Day, it is timely to reflect upon the role of the unions that represent the workers and their rights. The unions must ideally give priority to safeguarding the rights of the workers instead of focusing on political agendas. Indeed such a farsighted vision would not only empower the workers but also serve the best interests of the country. We as a government are willing to set the stage for such a progressive move with optimism and sincerity.

As the workers gather today to celebrate their day, I take this opportunity to wish them a renewed sense of hope not just to overcome the challenges at their work places but also to overcome the challenges they face in life every day.”
