A person who had been arrested in connection with drug trafficking with two Pakistanis was sentenced to death today, by High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena.
The convicted named Sampath Fonseka was caught with 245 kg heroin in Bambalapitiya with the two Pakistanis who had already been sentenced to death after pleading guilty.
Since the suspect did not plead guilty, the case went to trial and the prosecution proved his connection with drug trafficking.
