Political appointee harassing subordinates


	

A certain character who has secured the post of Commissioner General of a key state establishment through political influence has begun victimizing subordinates whom he dislikes, they say. 




This upstart who is yet to be confirmed in his post is said to be harassing all employees whom he considers disloyal to him by unnecessarily pulling them up, transferring them from one division to another and subjecting them to various other forms of inconvenience.


On representations made by some victimized employees, a high political authority had recently ordered this high-up to cancel some transfers made for no rhyme or reason.
