Prime Minister Key welcomed the signing of an agreement between Auckland Zoo and the Sri Lankan Government, which will see the zoo, gifted a second elephant, a statement from the office of the New Zealand Prime Minister said.

“New Zealand’s weather seems to agree with Sri Lankan elephants with the first, Anjalee, putting on 700 kilograms in her first year in Auckland,” Key said.

“The second elephant will prove a great draw-card for tourists and locals alike. This is another example of the close and growing relationship between our countries and I thank the Sri Lankan Government for entrusting us with her,” he said.

In return Auckland Zoo will help with Sri Lanka’s management of its own elephant population, as well as help train Sri Lankan wildlife workers.
