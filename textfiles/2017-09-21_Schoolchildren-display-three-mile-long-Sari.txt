Schoolchildren display three-mile-long Sari


	

More than 250 students of Alwathugoda Sarath Ekanayake Primary School lined up along the Gannoruwa–Kandy road today to display a three-mile long bridal Sari worked by a beautician who claims it to be the world’s longest Sari. She is hopeful of setting a Guinness world record for her work.

Several other students posed as flower girls in the event held in the form of a wedding.

The display held under the patronage of Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake created heavy traffic congestion compelling the police to deploy a contingent under SSP N.M. Sisira Kumara to control the traffic.

The display was organised by a beautician couple in Alwathugoda. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
