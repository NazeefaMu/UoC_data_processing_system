President Maithripala Sirisena was attempting to protect Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from the no- confidence motion because the United National Party (UNP) votes were procured by Mr. Wickremesinghe for the victory of the President, the National Freedom Front (NFF) charged today.
NFF politburo member Nimal Piyathissa said at a media briefing held in Battaramulla that they had acknowledged President Sirisena was compelled to protect PM Wickremesinghe since he had received a considerable support from the UNP at the January 8 presidential election.
“The President on Monday at a special Cabinet meeting had instructed the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) not to proceed with the no-confidence motion. President Sirisena could not ignore the UNP,” he said. (Piyumi Fonseka and Sanath Desmond)
