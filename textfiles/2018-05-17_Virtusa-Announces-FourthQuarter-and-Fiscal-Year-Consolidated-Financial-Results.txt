Management Commentary 

 

Kris Canekeratne, Virtusa’s Chairman and CEO, stated, “We are pleased with our strong fiscal 2018 financial results, increasing our top-line by 19% and ending the year in excess of $1 billion of revenue for the first time in our company’s history. Our continued above-industry growth is a testament to the success of our strategy.  As we look to fiscal 2019 and beyond, we believe Virtusa is in a position of strength, given our ability to help transform our clients’ businesses at every level through end-to-end digital transformation and IT platform rationalization and modernization, driving significant ROI for our clients.  ”

 

Ranjan Kalia, Chief Financial Officer, said, “We delivered strong fiscal year 2018financial results highlighted by approximately 19% revenue growth, 200 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin accretion, and 30% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Our fourth quarter revenue was modestly below the midpoint of our guidance range, and our non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint driven byslightly better than expected eTouch contribution. Looking to fiscal 2019, our current guidance calls for continued above-industry organic revenue growth, coupled with earnings growing faster than consolidated revenue growth.” 

 

Financial Outlook 

 

Virtusa management provided the following current financial guidance:

 

• First quarter fiscal 2019 revenue is expected to be in the range of $293.5 to $301.5 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.13. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.45to $0.51.

 

• Fiscal year 2019 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,230to $1,270million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.50to $0.66. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.08to $2.32.

 

In accordance with US GAAP, Virtusa applies the if-converted method to its convertible preferred shares when reporting its fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 results. The if-converted method is used to calculate the share impact of convertible securities.  Under this method, only when the convertible securities are considered dilutive are they then included in the computation of weighted average shares outstanding in reported results and full year guidance.  

 

• Fourth quarter GAAP Income per share was calculated by including the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares in net income available to common stockholders and excluding the impact of the convertible preferred shares from the weighted average shares. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was calculated by excluding the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares from net income available to common stockholders and including the impact of the convertible preferred shares in the weighted average shares outstanding as these shares were dilutive on a non-GAAP basis. 

 

• GAAP EPS guidance was calculated under the assumption that these convertible preferred shares will be anti-dilutive in fiscal 2019. Thus, in determining full fiscal year 2019 GAAP EPS guidance, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are deducted from net income available to common stockholders and the convertible preferred shares have been excluded from weighted average shares outstanding. 

 

• Non-GAAP EPS guidance was calculated under the assumption that these convertible preferred shares will be dilutive in fiscal year 2019. Thus,in determining full fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP EPS guidance, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are excluded from net income available to common stockholders and the impact of the convertible preferred shares are included in the weighted average shares outstanding. 

 

The Company’s first quarter and fiscal year 2019 diluted GAAP EPS estimates are both based on average share counts of approximately 30.5million (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). The Company’s first quarter and fiscal year 2019 diluted Non-GAAP EPS estimates are both based on average share counts of approximately 33.5 million (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). GAAP and Non-GAAP average share counts assume a stock price of $49.01, which was derived from the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the five trading days ended on May9, 2018.  Deviations from this stock price may cause actual diluted EPS to vary based on share dilution from Virtusa’s stock options and stock appreciation rights.
