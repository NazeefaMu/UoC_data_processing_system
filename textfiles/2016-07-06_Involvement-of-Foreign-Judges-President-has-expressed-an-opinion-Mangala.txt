President Maithripala Sirisena has expressed an opinion on the final accountability mechanism and both the President and the Prime Minister would look at all the available alternatives before making a final decision which will be acceptable to the majority of all stakeholders, Foreign Affairs Minister Managala Samaraweera today said.

Responding to a question during a news conference held at the ministry that statements made by President and the Premier seemed they have already decided about certain measures (on an accountability mechanism), he said no decision had been made and the leaders have only expressed their opinions.

“Sri Lanka has a democracy where even the leader of the republic has the right to express his opinion. The President has said so and we respect his views. But finally, we know the President and the Prime Minister will look at all the options available and take a decision which will be acceptable to the majority of the stakeholders,” he said.

Commenting on seeking foreign assistance in the process of accountability, Minister Samaraweera said there could be areas in which foreign expertise could be needed and said seeking foreign assistance was not alien to Sri Lanka or wrong.

“Foreign expertise was sought in the past as well to look into the assassination of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. The President only opposed to the involvement of foreign judges. There are many opinions. A majority including the President expressed sentiments against foreign judges while the TNA and others support the involvement of foreign judges. But, we think there are several alternatives between these two. There is no need to worry. In the final outcome, if this is to work, this must be a credible alternative not an attempt to satisfy ourselves. I’m confident that we can come up with such a mechanism once the consultations are over,” he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
