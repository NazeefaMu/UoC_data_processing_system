DPA, 07th MAY, 2018- Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has said that his Future Movement bloc lost a third of its seats in parliament in Sunday’s elections.


The bloc won 21 seats, he said on Monday, compared to 33 seats in the previous polls in 2009.


“We were hoping to achieve a better result and a bigger bloc but the Future Movement faced a scheme to eliminate it from political life,” Hariri said during a press conference at his residence in Beirut.


“Your trust is a medal on my chest,” he said.


Lebanon held its first parliamentary election in nearly a decade on Sunday.
