LTTE prisoners stage hunger strike

Former LTTE cadres detained at the Magazine Prison in Colombo, launched a hunger strike yesterday urging the authorities to release them.
Prisons Department sources said the detainees were refusing to take food and were staying in their cells.
Prisons Commissioner General Rohana Pushpakumara said he had met the prisoners who are on a hunger strike and discussed their issue.
According to Pushpakumara the prisoners had told him that their protest was not against the prisons administration but to get the attention of the authorities about their demand for a release.
The Commissioner General said he had asked for a written request containing the prisoners' demands while promising to hand it over to the President as requested by the prisoners. Similar hunger strikes have been reported from other prisons across the country where some ex-LTTE cadres are being held.
Meanwhile, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday called on the government to take immediate steps to either free the prisoners or file prosecutions if they are guilty of any charges.
