Slip of the tongue betrayed him


	



 

This was a public rally of a main political party held in a city suburb with the party leader in the chair. 

 


It was the turn of the electorate organizer to welcome the distinguished guests and the party supporters. While observing the formality of permission seeking, he blurted out the name of a former leader. 

 
Titters and amused looks greeted the gaffe and the organizer looked sheepish for a moment and then recovered himself and addressed a namesake of the former leader seated beside the chair.  The quick-witted cover-up of the mistake brought a second round of amusement among the guests and the crowd, they say.
