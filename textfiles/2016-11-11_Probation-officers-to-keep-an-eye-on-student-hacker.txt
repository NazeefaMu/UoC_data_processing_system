Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today directed probation officers to monitor the behaviour of the Kadugannawa schoolboy who had hacked the President’s website.

The CID told court that it had sent the data retrieved from the computers taken into custody to be examined and the report, when received, would be submitted to Court.

The inquiry postponed for March 8, next year. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
