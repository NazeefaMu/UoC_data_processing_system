Puttalam District parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha and his brother Jagath Samantha Perera  were remanded today until May 25 by the Chilaw High Court for violating bail conditions.

The High Court granted the two suspects bail on June 26 last year under the condition that they were to sign in at the Chillaw police station every Sunday. 

However, both suspects have violated bail conditions since 2017.

The siblings were arrested for allegedly assaulting the Arachchikattuwa Divisional Secretary when he was inspecting a storage facility in 2007. (Jude Samantha and Augustine Fernando)
