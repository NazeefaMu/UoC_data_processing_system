Sri Lanka continues to be a key part of India’s “neighbourhood first” policy, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said today.

He expressed these views at the 68th Republic Day of India celebrations held at India House in Colombo.

The High Commissioner said he hoped that Sri Lankan businesses would take advantage of their proximity to the fastest growing major economy, India.

“India’s total development assistance commitment to Sri Lanka is now around US$ 2.6 billion, with over US$ 435 million as outright grants. The Indian flagship housing project, aiming to construct 50,000 houses, is proceeding well with over 45,300 houses constructed till date,” he said.

The envoy cautioned against the threat posed by the dark forces of terrorism and stressed the necessity of defeating these forces decisively.

While reading out excerpts from the Address to the Nation by Indian President Pranab Mukherjee, the High Commissioner credited strong democratic institutions built over the last six and a half decades for making India an oasis of stability.

He highlighted India’s achievement in social, political and economic fields in the last six and half decades.

“Today, India is the fastest growing economy amongst the major economies of the world. India is the second largest reservoir of scientific and technical manpower, the third largest army, the sixth member of the nuclear club, the sixth member in the race for space, and the tenth largest industrial power. From a net food grains importing country, India is now a leading exporter of food commodities,” he said.
