Is it only a ceasefire?


	



 

There were recent reports that a major crisis was threatening to uproot the Tree party. Even the party’s supreme body failed in its attempts to resolve the crisis triggered by accusations levelled against party leadership itself.

 


It has now transpired that it all started when the powerful secretarial one decided to take the bull by the horns for the failure to offer him a seat in Diyawanna in terms of an agreement reached before the last general polls.


Highly ruffled secretarial one commanding a sizable power base in the East began giving the party leader jolts one after another and the latter    highly shaken by the growing opposition to him finally held out the olive branch, they say.


So the secretarial one is going to take the Diyawanna seat vacated by a party member in January and the ousted one is to have the solace of being offered an ambassadorial post.


However, some party members say it is too early to say that crisis is over. There are smoldering cinders still lying under the ashes, they say.
