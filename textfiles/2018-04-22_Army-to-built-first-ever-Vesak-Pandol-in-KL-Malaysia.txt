Arrangements were underway to put up a Vesak Pandol by the Sri Lanka Army in Malaysia on account of the forthcoming Vesak season to showcase the significance of Vesak, the Army said.

This is the first-ever such Vesak Pandol put up by SLA in a foreign country.

Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake who paid a visit to the Brickfield Buddhist temple in Kuala Lumpur, while he was in Malaysia to attend the 16th edition of the Defence Services Asia (DSA) Exhibition, inquired into the progress of the project of erecting the first-ever Vesak pandol.

During the visit, the chief incumbent of the Brickfield Buddhist temple had extolled the supply of Army expertise and the manpower for erection of this 60 ft tall Vesak Pandol with thousands of lights.

The Thera also appreciated the support of the Army for a mega responsibility of this nature in a foreign land which is largely occupied by non-Buddhists.

Army said a group of Corps of Engineer Services (CES) troops as per directions of the Commander of the Army were to begin the erection of this historic structure in Kuala Lumpur shortly.(DS)
