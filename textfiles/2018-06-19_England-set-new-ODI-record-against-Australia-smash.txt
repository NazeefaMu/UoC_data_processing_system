England have smashed a new world record one-day score, pulverising Australia's bowlers to hit 6-481 at Trent Bridge in the third ODI on the back of centuries from Jonny Bairstow and Alex Hales.

Bairstow smashed 139 – his fourth ODI century in 2018 – while Hales made 147 and there were half-centuries too for Jason Roy (82) and Eoin Morgan (67).

England hit 41 boundaries and a whopping 21 sixes, dismissing an inexperienced Australian attack that took punishment all around the ground.

The score surpassed the previous ODI record of 444/3, set by England on this same ground two years ago against Pakistan.
