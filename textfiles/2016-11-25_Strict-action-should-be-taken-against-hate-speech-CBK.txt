Former President and Chairperson of Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said today that hate speech had arisen in Sri Lanka in the recent past, which challenged the initiatives being taken by the government to heal our country after decades of bloodshed and destruction.

Mrs. Kumaratunga said in a statement that hate filled expressions and actions by groups with vested interests, resulting in demeaning, denigrating and inciting violence against fellow citizens of various ethnic and religious backgrounds had no place in the Sri Lankan society.

“For the first time in contemporary Sri Lanka, the Government has a stated vision to build One United Nation by promoting reconciliation and a lasting peace. The Government is working towards bringing about reconciliation among all communities, making it the highest priority,” the statement added.

She said the Government and the people of Sri Lanka were presently engaged in the noble task of rebuilding a society in which good governance prevails.

“The challenges faced in realising this are immense. Yet, the new opportunities that have opened up and the favourable socio-political context created since January 2015 must be seized,” she said.

The statement said the active participation and leadership of all patriotic Sri Lankans was essential for the achievement of reconciliation, peace and honest, effective, people friendly Governance if we were to attain political stability, economic growth and progress we so richly deserve as a nation.

She said, short, medium and long term efforts were underway to address the grievances of all communities and to build a sense of respect, equality and pride in every citizen living in an inclusive Sri Lanka, where each person has the opportunity to enjoy the freedom that is the right of every citizen.

She stressed that strictest action must be taken without delay, against persons or groups who act to provoke disharmony by creating divisions among citizens along ethnic and religious lines, and added that President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickrmasinghe and the entire government had categorically reiterated that hate speech would not be tolerated.

It said ONUR, while appreciating the arrest of two individuals from two different communities, accused of hate speech and for inciting racism, urges the relevant authorities to take appropriate action against all such incidents regardless of the social status, ethnic/religious background or political affiliations of the perpetrators.

“We note that there are numerous complaints against hate speech and incitement to racism, where strong evidence is available, yet investigations and prosecutions are pending for some time.We urge the law enforcement authorities to take early action on all these incidents,” it said.
