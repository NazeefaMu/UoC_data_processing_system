An eight-hour water cut would be imposed in Colombo from 9.00 p.m. tonight to 5.00 a.m. due to an urgent repair to the main pipeline that carries water from the Ambatale Water Purification Centre to Maligakamda, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said.
The Water Board said that the water connection would be interrupted to certain areas in Colombo 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and Colombo 13.
