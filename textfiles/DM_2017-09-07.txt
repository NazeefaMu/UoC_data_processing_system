Killing of senior journalist and editor Gauri Lankesh
Family members mourn the death of journalist Gauri Lankesh (HT) 

The murder of senior journalist and editress Gauri Lankesh in her home in Bengaluru has brought the focus back on the perilous conditions journalists in India work in. 
India was ranked a lowly 136 among 180 countries in the latest world press freedom rankings released in April with the dismal performance blamed on Modis nationalism and growing self-censorship in the mainstream media. India slipped three places as compared to the year before. India was ranked just three places above Pakistan and was one notch below violence-torn Palestine. Indias neighbours Bhutan and Nepal were placed at 84th and 100th rank, respectively.

This came after a string of journalist deaths and murders, especially in small-town India, including Hindustan reporter Rajdeo Ranjan in Bihar last year. Two years ago, a similar study by Reporters Without Borders termed India as among the three most dangerous countries for journalists in 2015. 
With Hindu nationalists trying to purge all manifestations of anti-national thought from the national debate, self-censorship is growing in the mainstream media, the report from media watchdog Reporters without Borders said. India was ranked 133 last year.

New Constitution shouldnt undermine war victory: Gota
	
A new Constitution or Parliament shouldnt be allowed to reverse the victories which were accomplished by uniting the country after defeating terrorism, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said.
Speaking at the launch of Eliya (light) Forum in Colombo on Wednesday, Mr. Rajapaksa said people fear that the accomplished victories would be scraped by bringing in a new Constitution.
This is why experts coming from different fields decided to create the Eliya to enlighten the public about the new Constitution. We want to inform the people that the new Constitution should not be brought in, he said.
He admitted that there were shortcomings of the current Constitution but said the motives behind the introduction of a new Constitution were dreadful.
The same group which collected funds for the LTTE and supplied weapons to them, are today attempting to achieve what they couldnt accomplish from terrorism. The new Constitution is a necessity of separatist Tamil politicians and international organisations which attempted to hinder the war against the LTTE, he said.
He said they have no faith in the government which is attempting to introduce the new Constitution.
We saw how the government assured army leaders that the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) would not be set up. However, it was established later on. The government always said it would protect war heroes but today a large number of soldiers had been imprisoned, Mr. Rajapaksa charged.
Ven. (Prof.) Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera, Rev. Fr. Wimal Thirimanna, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, Sarath Weerasekara, Thamara Kunanayagam, Manohara de Silva PC, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Rushdi Habeeb and Dr. Seetha Arambepola also addressed the forum.

New Office hours for Govt. offices from Sep. 18
	
The Ministry of Public Administration and Management yesterday issued a circular changing the office hours of government institutions in the Battaramulla area to 7.15 a.m to 3.15 p.m. from September 18.
Secretary to the Ministry J. J. Rathanasiri speaking exclusively to the Daily Mirror said the steps were taken to support measures taken by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to reduce the traffic congestion in the area.
This is a pilot project which works hand in hand with the priority bus lane project implemented by the Megapolis Ministry, Rathnasiri said.
The project will also ensure employees arrive at their office under designated service hours which will be decided by the heads of departments. 9. 15 a.m to 3. 15 p.m are compulsory working hours, he said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Director of the Megpolis Ministrys Transport Development Project P. Dissanayake said the main aim of the project was to reduce the number of office workers on the road during peak hours.
Under this project employees go to work ahead of others and leave office before peak traffic, he said.
The project will only be implemented in the Battaramulla area as of now as it is a pilot project, but officials are looking to introduce the new working hours to private sector as well in the future.
Various government plans have established the vicinity as the administrative center of the capital with government institutions to be shifted to the area soon. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The Mount Lavinia Police yesterday initiated a special investigation into the mysterious death of a newly-wedded businessman who was found lying unconscious in a hotel room on the Beach Road, Mt. Lavinia on August 31.
Police said the injured who was admitted to the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday night while being treated at the Intensive Care Unit.
They said the deceased, identified as Mohan Wijethilaka (42), was found lying unconscious in the hotel room with broken teeth and bruises on his face.
However, the officers of the Mt. Lavinia Police Crime Branch suspect whether the death was an attempted suicide as they found 16 empty Paracetamol cards and the trouser belt of the victim hanging from the ceiling fan of the hotel room.
Police said the victim and his wife were regular customers of the famous hotel.
According to the police, the businessman and his wife had checked in at the hotel on August 28 and left the following day.
However, the victim had again visited the hotel on August 30 and occupied a room.
Police said the victim had been found unconscious and admitted to hospital by a trishaw driver and a friend of the victim who were allegedly sent by the victims wife in search of him.
Meanwhile, the victims brother lodged a complaint with the Mt. Lavinia Police that he was suspicious about his brother's death.
The businessman was married to an Animal Rights Activist on August 18.
The postmortem report will be received by the police today. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Speaking at the meeting President Maithripala Sirisena asked those present to brace themselves for the Local Government and Provincial Council elections, it is learnt.
The President reportedly told the Central Committee that though the government had come up with the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to postpone the provincial council elections due this year, it all comes down to the determination by the Supreme Court.
Therefore, he said the party should be ready and waiting for elections to both the local authorities and the provincial councils to be called at any time.
The President took the opportunity to express his gratitude to all those who helped conduct the annual convention of the party held last Sunday.
Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando, who is tipped to cross over to the opposition, criticized the UNP saying there were major frauds involving expressways that had come to light. This he said was after the latest revelations with regard to the bond scam that had emerged recently. He therefore urged the party to quit the government. (Kelum Bandara)

Issuing a statement, the former MP said that what had been discussed and revealed to the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) was never disclosed to a third party when she was a member of it.
I wish to reiterate that during the time I functioned as a member of the COPE nothing that was said before this committee was ever disclosed to a third party in an illegal manner. Although the name of my son had been mentioned before the Bond Commission no factual information had been presented to support this claim. The conversation referred to has taken place in 2016 during which time I was not a member of Parliament, Ms. Senanayake said.
She said certain media outlets had dragged her and her sons names into the Bond inquiry without any basis or proof. This shows just how low the media is willing to stoop in order to sensationalise a story, she said.
Denying any wrongdoing, Ms. Senanayake said that from the very beginning she had engaged in clean politics and legal action would be taken against all those who had defamed her in this matter.
I will make a broad statement over this matter when I return to Sri Lanka, said Ms. Senanayake who is currently overseas.

The landed and the landless: Golu Hadawatha & Akkara Paha
	
Golu Hadawatha, the first of three films that Lester James Peries directed for Ceylon Theatres, was also the greatest love story ever conceived onscreen here. The countrys largest and oldest importer, distributor, and exhibitor of films, Ceylon Theatres (established on September 29, 1928) had extended an offer that would not be equalled by any other producer or financier: he would be given unconditional control over the story, the script, the music, and the editing, while much of the crew had to be taken from the studio.
For the first time, Lester had got the best of both worlds: artistic freedom and financial security. That he would opt for an unconventional love story, which in his own words went against the grain of his previous work, was only to be expected: he needed a source material that was safe. Not for nothing, after all, had his producer given him everything a filmmaker of his calibre needed at that point. By giving him everything, they were expecting something in return. Something big. 
Karunasena Jayalaths prose sweeps off his pages, often at once. Much of his emotional tenor, his romanticised outlook, came out from his dialogues. Thats where his package was and thats where he got the success he clamoured after. Regi Siriwardena once said somewhere that the man bridged the gap between Martin Wickramasinghe and pulp fiction. The pulpy, populist immediacy you sense in his conversations comes out from his stints as a journalist, though he also owed that to his schoolboy experiences. The two part structure in Golu Hadawatha was born out of this quality: it was there to ensure that you never felt the anger you usually felt towards an unrequited love, since, in the words of Jean Renoir, Everyone has their reasons. 
Siriwardena wrote the script for Golu Hadawatha overnight, retaining the dialogues as they were and playing around with that two part structure, which had become a must-have in movies that delved into the unknowability of anothers perspective. That sense of unknowability pervades the first part, where Sugath (and us, the audience) is put off by Dammis rebuffs which are mysteriously followed by suggestively gentler overtures. Formally this structure was innovative, but our cinema, even then, never fell back on into nonlinear, lopsided narratives that the directors of the eighties would indulge in. Lester was still a classicist, and would remain so until his very last movie. 
Behind the success of Golu Hadawatha, Siriwardena wrote in his foreword to Philip Coorays The Lonely Artist, lay perhaps many social forces  notably, free education. With his sixth film Lester had intruded into new territory: the children of 1956, who had aspired to be the heroes and the villains of an art form which had depicted them as set pieces or bit players. They had been either the jesters or the maids and servants until then, belying which was another relevant point. 
Golu Hadawatha was and is discernibly different from the love stories that adorn our television screens and theatres today, for the simple reason that now the tension between love and the inability to fulfil it comes from an easy source: the rift between the rich and the poor. But the lovers in a movie like Golu Hadawatha, or even Dahasak Sithuvili and Hanthane Kathawa (both of which were released around the same time, in 1968 and 1969), were spurred on by a different kind of conflict, which was more or less an offshoot of their social conditioning. These lovers were the sort who wasted away knowing they had the luxury of a (largely) bourgeois life and the option of returning to it, once they decided that wasting away was no longer feasible. 
While he did move away from the milieu of Delovak Athara and Ran Salu, Lester James Peries overwhelming sympathy for the elite nevertheless tempered Golu Hadawathas central conflict. Both Dammi and Sugath were the next generation of the children of 1956. Their parents would have even brought to power S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. They were of a different time, different certainly to Lesters own background, and Regis assertion about those many social forces was true considering their way of life in the film. Coeducation and mixed schools, love letters (the literary equivalent of todays text message), and the twilight-ness of their homes, between the rusticity of the village and the sophistication of the city, reflected it amply, and in turn reflected their distinct personality. Over time they would become the single biggest audience in the Sinhala cinema. Golu Hadawatha acknowledged that, and in acknowledging that, it no longer shrugged them off as set pieces and props: they had finally become the heroes of their own stories, their own films. 
Douglas Ranasinghe once told me in an interview that in his day the likes of Sugath were considered as parajithayo, the defeated, whom we identified with through their sense of hopelessness. Back then we were content in seeing them accept that defeat and return to their families, their benefactors, because they had both: as much as they were torn down and wasted away by their harsh experiences, they had the money and the power to sustain their anguish. Today, with all the murders and suicides and with the democratisation of correspondence through the mobile phone, love has become more common, more proletarian if you may, amply echoed in the choice of milieus our scriptwriters and directors continue to go for in love story after love story. 
Golu Hadawatha was and is discernibly different from the love stories that adorn our television screens and theatres today, for the simple reason that now the tension between love and the inability to fulfil it comes from an easy source: the rift between the rich and the poor
The lovers of the past in our movies could endure their torment because they came from backgrounds that, as with Sugath, subsisted on plantations and estates (and occasionally, caste). The lovers of today are poor and frugal on the one hand and rich and depraved on the other, with the tension between the two being exacerbated by the refusal of the rich lovers (usually the woman) family to acknowledge the poor lover when he tries to convince them that hes educated or at least on his way to being an educated man. Sugath could deteriorate and still cling to a comfortable lifestyle. Not these lovers. I believe thats what came out most discernibly in Golu Hadawatha, and the string of imitative films (both popular and serious) which briefly followed it. 
Lesters three films for Ceylon Theatre continue to fascinate me because of the vastly different social backgrounds of their characters. In his first film he had opted for the rural bourgeoisie, while in the third, Nidhanaya, he returned to the fading feudal aristocracy. (As with Renoir, Lester was most sincere at portraying this aristocracy, right down to Kaliyugaya, Yuganthaya, and Wekanda Walawwa.) 
In Akkara Paha he moves into a setting which he would not, at least until Baddegama, return to: the fading village peasantry, cut off from their own roots and homes. In Lesters films, the fear of being uprooted is very much pervasive. Its a fear that is both externalised (the threat of homelessness) and internalised (the threat of being denied the fulfilment of ones desires and hopes).
Akkara Paha depicts both these: in the first instance, through Senas family moving into a government scheme in Minipe once they sell their property, and in the second instance, through his ambivalent reactions to his lover, Sandawathi, and the girl who ends up as his destroyer, Theresa. 
Lester was at his best, as I said before, when depicting the lives of the decaying elite. Most critics and commentators today would argue that he was at his weakest at the other end of the spectrum: when he was depicting the poor
Lester was at his best, as I said before, when depicting the lives of the decaying elite. Most critics and commentators today would argue that he was at his weakest at the other end of the spectrum: when he was depicting the poor, the landless. Part of the reason for this, I think, was that even in a film like Akkara Paha that overwhelming sense of poverty comes out from expectation, from ellipsis, never fully realised.
Once he rejects his family and Theresa, once he rejects his scholarship and goes for menial employment, the film cuts to Sena fainting at the lumber yard he runs away to and then waking up at the hospital. In probably the most bittersweet ending Lester James Peries ever conceived in any film, we see Sena writing in English the invitation to his sisters wedding. I dont think anyone in our family will understand this, he tells the sister, to which she replies, Father was adamant. He wanted you to write in English. The scene cuts to the wedding, the two newlyweds ride away in their car, and Sanda and Sena, now reconciled, run away to catch sight of and wave to them. They slowly walk away, Amaradevas dirge on separation and reconciliation plays out, and the camera pans out until these two are no more than faint spots. 
Its rather elliptical, in a way incomplete, which is probably why those commentators were quick to castigate him when he returned to that milieu in whatever form later on. To some he was a humanist; to his detractors, that humanism was a sign of noncommittal complacency. The final reconciliation between Sena and Sanda is obviously a prelude to a life of misfortune and discomfort we will never see: the futility and pathos of it is derived from its sense of incompleteness and expectation. We dont see them any agency at work, because they are subservient to their fates, and are ready to yield to it. The politically committed cinema of the seventies would have denigrated this as inadequate, unsatisfying, and evasive. 
Compared with Golu Hadawatha, Akkara Paha was not surprisingly given a more lukewarm reception here. Partly because of its political undertones (its allusion to the governments resettlement policy was misconceived as propagandist), it was more widely acclaimed abroad, receiving a world premiere at the Museum of Modern Art (where all his other five films were also screened) courtesy of Donald Richie. 
Compared with Golu Hadawatha, Akkara Paha was not surprisingly given a more lukewarm reception here. Partly because of its political undertones, it was more widely acclaimed abroad, receiving a world premiere at the Museum of Modern Art
And as with all his work, he had shown with it that he preferred the microcosm of the world to the world itself; that the minutest changes in sensibility were more engrossing to him than either the plot or overt action. He had engaged in a different social setting, and the result, which wasnt to everyones liking, obviously, was the most searing, bittersweet, and elegiac tribute to the inevitability of accepting misfortune he could come up with. Ironically, what was so real and heartfelt about this was also what was alienating and repugnant, at least for the politically committed, symbol hunting critic. In depicting the landed and the landless in quick succession, he had hence proven to his audiences just how divisive the lonely artist could be.

Amend IR Bill: Dayasiri tells Govt.
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) today called for amendments to the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill.
Co-Cabinet spokesman and Minister, Dayasiri Jayasekara, said during the debate on the Inland Revenue Bill Section 100(1) of the Bill could be problematic because that clause authorises the Finance Minister to obtain information on any person.
'This authority may be used by the Finance Minister to tax some and exempt others," the minister said and added that taxing of religious places of worship under the Bill could also cause issues. a "It is advisable to put off the implementation of this Bill so that the businesses will have enough time to change or modify their systems. If we fail to do it the government will not able to achieve the desired results envisaged by this Bill," he said.
However, the minister said many of problematic clauses had been rectified after discussions his party had with the President, Prime Minister and the Finance Minister. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The MP claimed that the government had passed the Bill to prevent public servants from going to court and that it was unjust to backdate the Bill. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Ceylinco General Insurance 2Q PAT up 286%
	
Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd., announced excellent results for the period ended June 2017, indicative of yet another outstanding year of growth.
Ajith Gunawardena, the Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco General Insurance, elaborating on the excellent performance of the company, said:  The company recorded a premium income of Rs. 8.7 billion (Rs. 8,738 million) up to the 2nd quarter in 2017,with an impressive growth of 11.4 percent, which signifies an increase of almost Rs. 900 million over the same period last year, which I would say is an exceptional achievement. Moreover, the company recorded an after tax profit of Rs. 431 million with an increase of 286 percent, for the period ended 30th June 2017 whilst the profit before tax stood at an exceptional Rs . 611 million. As a result, Ceylinco General Insurance has maintained its unassailable lead. This is in the midst of stiff competition. This strong growth trend will no doubt help us to end the year on a resoundingly successful note.
Elaborating further on the impressive figures, Patrick Alwis, Managing Director of Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd, added : Ceylinco General Insurance paid claims amounting to Rs. 4.9 billion during the 6 month period ended June 2017. A large number of flood claims were paid to over 1,400 customers thus enabling them to return to normalcy in the shortest possible time. Staff of Ceylinco General Insurance acted promptly to pay compensation within 14 days to all of its policy holders with flood cover who were affected by the devastating floods we experienced in May  June this year 
Recently in another landmark move, Ceylinco General Insurance announced yet another breakthrough in Motor Insurance - a Rs. 1 million cover that will reimburse medical costs incurred in the treatment of heart disease, cancer, kidney failure, stroke and several other serious illnesses including heart attack and open heart surgery, major organ transplants, chronic lung and liver diseases, deafness, blindness, multiple sclerosis, paralysis etc as an exclusive benefit for Ceylinco VIP On The Spot policy holders
During the early part of the year, Ceylinco General Insurance embarked on an immense CSR initiative: Ceylinco VIP Akurata Saviyak, providing financial assistance to under privileged school children, in order to help them to continue their education unhindered. The first phase of the project was launched in Moneragala district by extending of 1000 scholarships to students in grades six and seven. Each of the 1000 students selected will receive Rs 1500 per month, from grade 6 onwards till they reach the Advanced Level, thereby easing the burden on their parents and giving them a solid platform to remain in school till they complete their Advanced Level examinations. 
A great number of children living in economically and socially-deprived regions in the island, face the burden of abruptly ending their schooling career due to financial difficulties faced by their families. This initiative adopts a more sustainable approach which will ensure that these childrens lives will be enriched owing to an uninterrupted educational experience facilitated by Ceylinco General Insurance.

Vietnam and Chinese flags wave in front of Tiananmen Gate for a welcoming ceremony 

REUTERS, 6 September, 2017 -China on Wednesday dismissed Vietnamese condemnation of its military live-fire exercises in the disputed South China Sea, saying it was acting within its sovereign rights. 
China conducted the drills around the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam claims, prompting Vietnam to say it would resolutely protect its legitimate rights through peaceful means. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing that China had done nothing wrong.  We hope the relevant side can regard the drills calmly and reasonably, he said, without elaborating. 
China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims.  Tension between China and neighbouring Vietnam is at its highest in three years over the disputed waters.  Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China in July under pressure from Beijing.

Elle Gunawansa Thera is a mad man in robes: SF
	
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday called Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, who condemned the statement he made with regards to war crime charges, a mad man in robes.
"That monk is mad. Thats all I have to say," he said in response to a question asked by a journalist after the 71st anniversary celebrations of the UNP held at the party headquarters, Sirikotha.
Speaking further, Minister Fonseka said the Thera had never visited him or helped him as claimed by certain news reports."This monk is simply trying to score marks for the things that others did," he said.
Responding to the assurance given by the President that he won't allow anyone to touch General (retired) Jagath Jayasuriya, the minister said the President meant no international faction would be allowed to act against our soldiers.
"But the President didnt say he would prevent domestic action against soldiers who had committed war crimes. There is a handful of people who have brought disgrace to the army and Jagath Jayasuriya is one of them. Action should be taken against them. Jayasuriya is the one who issued the order to carry out the Rathupaswala shooting as well," he charged.
When asked about reports that the minister was attempting to take revenge against a former counterpart, he said it was he who went to jail due to an act of revenge.
"Should I stay quiet just because I was put behind bars and my family was intimidated" he asked.

Entire citizenry taxed by new IR Bill: JVP
	
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said today everyone in the country had been taxed under the new Inland Revenue Bill which was formulated to satisfy the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the purpose of obtaining an IMF loan.
He said tax concessions granted to medium scale businessmen, senior citizens, semi-government schools and artistes had been removed from the new Bill and even the government claim to reduce the gap between direct and indirect tax is not evident.
"The government introduced direct taxation on mansions, capital gains and casinos are not in use now whereas indirect taxation such as VAT is still in use," the MP said.
He said the government should reduce fraud, corruption and wastage instead of poor people being taxed to increase government revenue.
"Government cannot earn Rs.45 billion from this Bill. It can increase its income by other means such as reducing the losses incurred by SriLankan," the MP said and added that the JVP had submitted 49 amendments to be included in the Bill and proposed that 16 others be removed.

HNB collaborates with EDB to launch new SME export credit facility
	
Jonathan Alles, Managing Director/CEO, HNB and. Indira Malwatte, Chairperson and Chief Executive, EDB along with the senior officials of the EDB, HNB and SME exporters of diversified industries at the launch of the HNB SME Expo Credit Scheme


Sri Lankas most innovative bank, HNB PLC working in close collaboration with the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka (EDB) announced the launch of HNB SME Export Credit, a pioneering new facility specially designed to meet the requirements and aspirations of Sri Lankas burgeoning Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector.
Aimed at fostering unprecedented new opportunities for export-oriented growth in the SME sector, HNBs new facility is the first of its kind to be specially developed for the sector, and is part of a broader effort from HNB to support macroeconomic growth in Sri Lanka.
Moving forward we are confident that HNB will be able to serve a catalyzing role that will drive a drastic improvement to the nations export performance, the results of which will feed directly into the local and provincial economy of Sri Lanka. Such developments are vital for grassroot development in Sri Lanka and HNB looks forward to working closely with the EDB and SMEs across the island to achieve this goal, HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles stated.
In particular, the credit facility will focus on bringing on-board new-to-bank export clients for pre and post shipment financing with limited tangible security, with special emphasis on Tea, Rubber, Spices, Cinnamon,  Coconut,  Textiles   and   Garments,   Fisheries   and   related   industries. During the course of proceedings, the bank also extended its first credit facilities under the HNB SME Expo Credit brand to 10 local SME exporters from these sectors. In addition to our position as Sri Lankas premier retail bank, HNB has long been associated with growth and development in the SME sector. The launch of HNB SME Export Credit is therefore a natural extension of this relationship, working in collaboration with EDB.
Through our own extensive network of clients, HNB has already identified several SMEs which have the potential to take their products into international markets and effectively compete in them. However, there are many more that need to improve in terms of scale and quality before they are ready to enter the international markets. This is a process that has to take place organically, but one which we are confident will gather momentum as more SMEs begin to succeed overseas, HNB Deputy General Manager  SME, Jude Fernando stated.
According to Fernando, the most difficult obstacle for SMEs seeking to compete in international markets is the long lead time between delivery on an export contract and the time taken to receive payments. Currently the only branded facility specifically designed for SME exports is the new facility launched by HNB which will offer individual clients up to Rs. 40 million in export credit with concessionary rates and easy payment terms, in order to enable them to trade on credit with international buyers.
Commenting further on the significance of the new facility, HNB Assistant General Manager -Trade Services, Janath Ilangantileke said: There is tremendous potential to develop and transform the small and medium scale export industries in Sri Lanka, through this initiative of HNB. Sri Lankas SME sector holds the key to an entirely new paradigm in export-led growth for the country; provided they are ready and willing to adapt, and add value in order to meet the higher quality requirements of the export markets.
The EDB commends HNB for its efforts to harness the SME sectors potential and provide invaluable links to international markets and buyers. It has been our experience that many of our local SMEs have the skills, the talent, and the innovative products necessary to make in-roads into international markets. The only thing that many of them were lacking was the financial capacity necessary to compete in this sector.
In that regard, the EDB is deeply committed towards ensuring that this collaboration with HNB leads to growth opportunities for our nations vital SME sector while also promoting a drastic improvement in export growth over the coming years, EDB Chairperson and Chief Executive, Indira Malwatte said.

## Title: If not for Ranil there wouldnt be a Yahapalana Govt.

If not for Ranil there wouldnt be a Yahapalana Govt.
	
The 71 Anniversary of United National Party falls on September 6, 2017. However, the occasion will be celebrated only on September 10 (Sunday), in Ratnapura. 
The founder of the United National Party was Prime Minister Don Stephen Senanayake. The party was formed on September 6, 1946. During his tenure, Senanayake commenced various projects in the country. Especially, they were commenced under the colonization schemes. Many landless people were provided with fertile lands for agricultural purposes in Galoya and Udawalawa areas. Despite protests from the opposition he didnt abandon his mission. Udawalawa Tank, Senanayaka Tank and several other multipurpose projects were launched during this period. He also played a major role in forming the Colombo Plan. He was called the father of the nation 
The television was introduced to the nation during JRJs regime
	A huge development project like Mahaweli was successfully concluded during his regime
	President Premadasa was called the Leader of the Poor
	After Sirisena won the Presidential Elections, there were huge concerns regarding the taking over of power from the former ruler
	Ranil intervened in the matter and communicated with America informing them of the prevailing situation inSri Lanka
After the demise of D.S. Senanayake, in 1952, his son Dudley Senanayake became the Prime Minister. He launched several projects for the betterment of the people. We can highlight two of them. One is the forming the Farmers Force and selecting the outstanding farmers. He also established three research centers to help the paddy (Bathalagoda), tea (Talawakele) and coconut (Lunuwila) industries. He opened the University of Moratuwa, Hardy Advanced Technical Institute in Ampara and the Bikku University in Anuradhapura. These are dowries given to the nation by him. Once he gave free rice and he was called Bathdun Piya. He tendered his resignation when there were strikes (Hartal) in 1953. The people who initiated the strikes were protesting against a reduction in their rice ration. 
After that Sir John Kotelawala assumed duties as Prime Minister. During his period, Kotelawala launched major hydro power projects such as Lakshapana and initiated the construction of the Kelaniya Bridge. 
Dudley Senanayake again returned to power in 1965 with the help of the MEP and the Federal Party, in the North. 
During the 1970 elections, The National Government of Dudley Senanayake lost and the United Front assumed power. 
After the demise of Dudley Senanayake the Leadership of the party was taken over by J.R. Jayewardene (JRJ) in 1973. JRJ organized the party from the grassroots level and ensured future victories. In the elections held in 1977, JRJ could record an unprecedented victory obtaining five-sixths in the history of Sri Lanka. 
In 1978 JRJ introduced a new constitution and became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka. As the first Executive President, he initiated many things to develop the country. He established the free trade zones, opened up the economy, paved the way for Foreign Investors to invest in Sri Lanka and started other promising projects. Reservoirs such as Lunugamwehera, Inginimitiya, Maduru Oya, Rantambe, Kotmale, Randenigala and Victoriya were reconstructed.
Huge administrative centers such as Sethsiripaya and Isurupaya were constructed during his regime. He was able to provide the new Parliamentary Complex to the country, thanks to Japanese aid. Its the Japanese who also constructed Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital. In the meantime, Kotte was converted in to a new Administrative Capital and renamed as Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. The television was introduced to the nation during JRJs regime. 
JRJ introduced information technology as a subject to the schools. Lands were distributed to landless people under the Swarnaboormi Programme. The University of Ruhuna, Eastern University, the Medical Faculty of Jaffna, Air Lanka and the Special Task Force are creations of J.R. Jayewardene. A huge development project like Mahaweli was successfully concluded during his regime.
It has to be specially pointed out that he created a job bank for the benefit of his supporters at the grassroots level. As a result of this programme many party supporters, who were less influential, could obtain good employment opportunities in the Government Sector. That is the way he protected the party supporters at the grassroots level. He created the Jathika Seveka Sangamaya and Rajya Seva National Trade Union Federation. The Indo-Lanka accord was signed in 1987. The Provincial Councils were established under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. 
After the retirement of JRJ in 1988, R. Premadasa was elected as the Executive President of Sri Lanka. He launched many development projects. President Premadasa was called the Leader of the Poor. He spread Gam Udawa (The Village re-awakening Movement) across the country. As a result he was able to provide houses to homeless people under the Million Houses Project. He established the Urban Development Authority, National Housing Authority, Central Environmental Authority and Janasaviya, for low income families. President Premadasa also established large scale Garment Factories and decentralized administration to Divisional Secretaries. 
He launched a programme to recruit people for the Government and Semi Government Institutions. He did this by conducting competitive exams. Candidates were shortlisted for interviews after considering their performances at these exams. The physical fitness of selected candidates was also checked. Therefore many could enter the Government Service sans political differences. This impartial way in which people were recruited must be commended. But there was a drawback in this system of recruitment. Many party supporters in the grassroots level as a result couldnt enter Government Service that easily. Due to this programme only a few party supporters were seen in the Government Service. 
After the assassination of President Premadasa, D.B. Wijetunga assumed duties as the President. Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in 1993. Wickremesinghe entered Parliament at the 1977 General Elections. He was appointed as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs by JRJ. Later he was appointed as the Minister of Youth Affairs. He is a nephew of JRJ. In 1994 Wickremesinghe took over the party Leadership. He had another stint in power in 2001. During this period, he created an economic resurgence in the country. Large scale investments were made and the country experienced a rapid economic growth. In 2003, President Chandrika Kumaratunga took over three ministries: Mass Communications, Defense, and Ministry of Home Affairs. This happened when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was visiting George W. Bush in Washington DC. 
In 2010 and 2015 he didnt contest elections for the post of president and supported common candidates. The Common Candidate Mathripala Sirisena won the Presidential Election held on 8 of January, 2015. This Sirisena did with the support of the UNP headed by Wickremesinghe and Civil Organizations. The main role during this election was played by Ranil. Critics wouldnt debate it if one forms the opinion that hadnt  Wickremesinghe offered the fullest support of the UNP, it would have been difficult for Sirisena to have won the Presidential Elections in 2015. 
After Sirisena won the Presidential Elections, there were huge concerns regarding the taking over of power from the former ruler. There is a secret. Wickremesinghe intervened in the matter and communicated with the USA Government informing them of the prevailing situation in Sri Lanka. This is undoubtedly an occasion when the country was benefited by Wickremesinghes healthy relationships with this powerful Western Country. Early in the morning on the following day of the elections, we heard on national television Wickremesinghe informing the USA Government about the situation in Sri Lanka. If somebody wants to know the veracity of this, a recorded version of this clip can be obtained from the National TV. This is possible only if the record hasnt been erased! 
After that the matter was settled. It is crystal clear that if Wickremesinghe wasnt present on that day there wouldnt be a Yahapalana Government today. Some people have penned books regarding the Yahapalanaya victory. However they havent included a single word about the role Wickremesinghe played, which paved the way for the smooth exchange of power from the former ruler to President Sirisena. I wrote to one of these authors who wrote a book on the much talked about presidential elections. It is sad to say that so far I havent received a response. 
There wouldnt have been a Yahapalana Government if Wickremesinghe wasnt there. That is the truth. Therefore it is the duty of all UNP supporters and to pay homage to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe because we have been presented with a peaceful country.
