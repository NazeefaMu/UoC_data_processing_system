Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne yesterday said he would be pleased if he was given some other ministerial portfolio instead of labour, as he could perform better.

He said he had already made a request to President Maithripala Sirisena for a change in the ministerial portfolio.

“I served as the Labour Minister for four long years, and was later given the same portfolio. Today, some of my ministerial subjects have been removed. Therefore, I would like to have a different portfolio to serve the country better,” the minister told journalists following a workshop held in Wellawatte recently.

He said he had served as the minister of Health, Power and Energy, Justice and Public Administration in the past, and that he would be happy if he was given a ministry with such prominence.

Commenting on the alleged Cabinet reshuffle, the minister said he was aware of the news but no discussion had been made in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or in the Cabinet on this matter so far.

However, Minister Seneviratne admitted that there were setbacks in the government as there were people's issues that needed to be addressed immediately. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Indika Sri Aravinda)
