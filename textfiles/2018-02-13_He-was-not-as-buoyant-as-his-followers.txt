A prominent politico who campaigned day and night for the party’s candidates had retired to bed on the final night saying, “The nuisance is over. I want to enjoy a good sleep.”

 


The following morning a group of enthusiastic party activists had turned up at the politico’s residence. Finding that their man was still asleep they sat down opposite the house and began discussing interesting tit- bits from their campaign experience and swapping humorous anecdotes raising raucous laughter. The politico who was fast asleep was wakened by the racket outside an furious of being disturbed came out and berated his party supporters in raw filth, they say.
