Several posts and face changes are due to take place at the Green party’s annual national convention round the corner, they say.
A new face is expected to take over the chief secretarial job and a person now holding an assistant position is tipped to be raised to this office. 
Several Deputy Leader posts are to be created and the hopefuls for these posts are to be elected at this convention. 
The purpose behind increasing the Deputy Leader posts is to produce a dynamic second rung leadership for the party, they say.
