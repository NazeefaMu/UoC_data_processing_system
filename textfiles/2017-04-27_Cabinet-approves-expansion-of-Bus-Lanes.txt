Cabinet co-spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka told the weekly Cabinet Briefing that the Cabinet proposal had made to implement Bus Priority Lanes in Moratuwa-Ratmalana, Wellawatte-Kollupitiya on the Galle Road and from Parliament Junction to Rajagiriya, Borella, Maradana, Pettah and Colombo Fort along the Parliament Road.

It also had proposed that the concept should be put into practice from roundabout in Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mawatha to Pettah, the Thummulla Junction to the Museum Junction and the Eye Hospital Roundabout to the Thummulla Junction during busy hours.

The Cabinet proposal also suggested to promote importation of Low Floor air-conditioned buses through concessionary loan schemes, prepare a common ticketing system with electronic card payment facilities and to improve three-wheeler and taxi parking facilities.

The Minister said Cabinet approval was granted as the pilot project implemented along the Parliament Road between 12 and 23 of March with the assistance of Korean International Cooperation Agency had showed positive outcome. (Ajith Siriwardana)
