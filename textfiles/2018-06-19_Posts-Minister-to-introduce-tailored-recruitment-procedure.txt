Posts Minister to introduce tailored recruitment procedure


	

Post, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.A. Abdul Haleem said today a tailored recruitment procedure will be introduced to the Department of Posts to overcome postal issues.

Responding to a journalist at a news conference, he said following a discussion with the National Salaries' and Cadres' Commission, the chairman had agreed to introduce a separate service minute for the department.

The minister said there was a delay in resolving the matter, as the commission had failed to provide a positive response and a Cabinet sub-committee decision had recommended a tailored recruitment procedure with the involvement of the trade unions to be handed over within a month.

He invited all postal workers to report for duty and said he would inform Parliament and the Cabinet of the shortcomings in the Public Administration circular 06/2006. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
