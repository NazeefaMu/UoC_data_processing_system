Lotus Tower: No added expenses due to construction delay


	

Despite the delays in constructing the Lotus Tower, which is scheduled to be completed by October 2017, the estimated expenses have not increased, the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) yesterday said.
Recently appointed TRCSL Director General Sunil Sirisena said under an agreement signed with the construction company ensured the cost of construction did not increase due to delays.
The main structure of the building had been completed. Construction of the Lotus Tower and installing the elevators were the only work that remained, he said.
“The Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) would look into the tenders of the office complexes and businesses that will be set up inside the building. Everything inside the building would be digital technology and not analogue technology,” he said.
Last year construction of the building came to a halt when Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga, claimed the land on which the building was constructed belonged to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and that the land had not been obtained through proper legal means.
“The building has been constructed on land belonging to the TRCSL. However, we need more land to construct other facilities around the building and we are discussing the transfer of land with the necessary authorities,” he said.
Once completed the 530 meter building, the tallest in South Asia, will be used for communication, observation and other leisure facilities.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
