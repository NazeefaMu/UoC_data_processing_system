A search and rescue operation was underway after two women who were bathing at the Ramboda Falls in Nuwara Eliya were dragged by the current this evening.
Four members of a family who had gone on a trip to Nuwara Eliya from Chilaw had gone to Ramboda Falls to bathe at around 5.30pm.
They had ignored the warnings of the people of the area against entering the water, because of the strong current following the heavy rains in the central hills, and bathed at the falls.
The group were soon dragged along by the strong current. The two men had been saved by the residents of the area, but they had failed to save the women.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the rescued men were heavily under the influence of liquor and the Kotmale Police were to produce them before a doctor.
The Kotmale Police, with the assistance of the people of the area, have launched a search operation. The assistance of Navy divers has also been sought.
The missing women were aged 27 and 33 years. (Ranjith Rajapaksha – Hatton)
