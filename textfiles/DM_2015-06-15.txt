CEB to convert all diesel power plants to gas
	
	The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will convert all its furnace oil and diesel powered power plants to gas powered plants in the near future using the gas deposits found in the Mannar basin which will be a major turning point of the economic, trade and industrial progress in Sri Lanka, Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
	Delivering the keynote address at a ceremony held to mark the World Ocean Day at the Sri Lanka Foundation, Minister Ranawaka said the idea that Sri Lanka possesses oil and gas deposits was floating since mid 20th century and there were several attempts to detect them. Ultimately, the seismic studies and subsequent excavations carried out in and around the Mannar basin concluded successfully with the detection of gas deposits in the Mannar basin.
	"Our target is to pump gas to Kerawalapitya from Mannar at the first phase and provide gas generated power to the Colombo city. We expect to set up an authority with necessary legal and controlling power by October to deal with gas exports by calling international tender. The present government has undertaken a hugely indebted administration as the previous government has spent four fold of funds than the required amount on almost all projects. As a result, each and every member of the present and future generations has been indebted to nearly Rs. 400.000. The government has no option but to run the economy through Treasury Bond issue which is also a huge burden to the economy," Minister Ranawaka stressed.
	Minister Ranawaka pointed out that time is right for Sri Lanka to come out of this debt trap if we are to achieve economic, social, cultural and human progress. The sound economic management must be an integral part of the economic development. In the past, our leaders were lamenting that Sri Lanka did not have enough natural resources such as gas, oil, coal or iron to achieve a speedier development. Fortunately, no one can say that now. The successful gas exploration in the North of Sri Lanka is a golden opportunity Sri Lanka has received to expedite our development, he emphasized.
	It is important to realize that no country could achieve instant success only by detecting natural resources if that country fails to exploit the new found wealth under a pragmatic leadership and sound management. The best example is Norway and Nigeria. Norway jump started its journey to achieve its development goals soon after finding oil and gas in late 60s and became a highly developed country in the new world in a few years. Nigeria remains an impoverished country with widespread sectoral, religious and political violence while sitting on a deposit of 35 billion billion barrels of petroleum. Oil resources were found in Nigeria in late 50s. Nigeria is also the 10th country in the world with oil and gas resources. However, the per capita income of Nigeria is US$ 3,000 while in Norway it is US$ 86,000.
	Minister Ranawaka emphasized that it was extremely vital not to make the environment a victim of the exploitation of petroleum resources as the humans have done much damage already to the nature by their haphazard and over usage of fossil fuel. We must use petroleum resources found off shore without harming the sea. 'Under the United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea,' Sri Lanka can claim for the proprietary rights to a an extent of 23 times of its land mass or the size of one third of land mass of India. Our responsibility and commitment must be to use this vast resources for the benefit of our country while protecting the nature, Minister Ranawaka stressed.

MR creates ethnic rifts, prejudice: UNP
	
The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday that it was highly regretted to see former President Mahinda Rajapaksa trying to create rifts, prejudice, hatred and animosity among different ethnic groups in the country.
Issuing a statement, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said Mr. Rajapaksa fantasised on becoming the next Prime Minister, by having media stunts at temples. He charged that Mr. Rajapaksa was hurling baseless abuses at the government of President Maihtripala Sirisena, being unable to counter the allegations made against him.
Mr. Hashim, in his statement, said the former President crowed over the possible resurgence of the LTTE as a gimmick to cover up various forms of allegations levelled against him.
"At the Matara rally, the former President, in his message, has mentioned that the LTTE is raising its head again. Certain laymen, frequenting temples with buckets of flower in their hands, do not even follow the five precepts. These so called patriots even compromise the interests of the country for petty political gains. I do not know to what category the former President belongs," he said.
He asked the former President to refrain from spreading such falsehoods. He asserted that no military camp had been removed.
"The former President has failed to respond convincingly to the allegations about the construction of provincial presidential palaces. He has failed to reason out the spending of Rs. 28 billion for unnecessary activities out of Rs. 55 billion allocated for road development. We are yet to uncover information related to the vehicles used by him and his family. Expenses have been made from the state coffers to look after the pet dogs kept by him at Temple Trees," Mr. Hashim said.

	The OHCHR will remain very engaged in discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities on the need for transparent and inclusive processes to develop credible mechanism for accountability and reconciliation, ahead of my report to the September session, he said.
	He said the new Government in Sri Lanka had passed a constitutional amendment which, if implemented appropriately, would bring renewed hope for democracy and the rule of law. 
	I encourage the Government to consult broadly with all political parties, civil society, and above all victims and their families, to ensure full national support and ownership of these processes, the Commissioner told the opening remarks of the 29th Human Rights Council Session on Monday.

	Mr. Perera said the UNP would also remind the President in writing that he would have to honour the pledge made during the Presidential Election that Parliament would be dissolved after hundred days.
	This government has the mandate to rule this country only for 100 days and therefore it is not correct to go on for two hundred days, he said. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
