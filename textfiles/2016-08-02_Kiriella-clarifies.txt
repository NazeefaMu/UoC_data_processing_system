In response to Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake's claim on the appointment of a large number of advisors, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the Highways Ministry had only one advisor named Dr.Wimal Gunawardane.

The Minister said the others had been appointed only by the Road Development Authority to assist in addressing public concerns in the execution of road projects.

"I have already explained this to the people. I am doing so again for the benefit of Mr. Ramanayake ," he said.

He said public pressure is always there in carrying out road projects. Yet, he said the projects had to be executed with the proper management of public opinion. For that he said assistance of officials was needed for the RDA. (Kelum Bandara)
