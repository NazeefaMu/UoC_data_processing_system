US training for Sri Lankan forces - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, stated that USA had expressed willingness to offer military training to members of the Sri Lanka's Security Forces.
He added that this opportunity could be gained following discussions with American President Barack Obama, US Secretary General and the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka.
President Sirisena made these observations yesterday, joining the committee stage debate of the budget under Defence Ministry financial head.
The President stated that US training for members of Sri Lankan Security Forces had been deprived for several years.
He added that the government would take measures to enhance the quality of the Sri Lanka's Security Forces. He added that government had been able to increase the number of security forces personnel who are enrolled to the UN Peace Keeping Forces.
 
Police will provide quality service - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stated that he appointed a committee to look into the necessities of the Police in order to make it a qualitative force.
He said the Committee consists of ministry secretaries, secretary, Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry being the chairman.
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget under Defence Ministry finance head in a response to Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake who questioned the quality of the Police Service.
 
We released 38, while former regime released 12,000 hardcore detainees - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliamnet yesterday, that one should compare the charges against 38 LTTE suspects released by the incumbent government and the 12,000 LTTE suspects released by the previous government to understand which group was more dangerous than the other.
"Who is more dangerous? Is it the 12,000 LTTE detainees released by the previous government, or the 38 LTTE suspects released by the present government? Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asked in Parliament.
He said that opposition MPs accused the government of releasing 38 LTTE suspects. But the previous government had released 12,000 LTTE suspects. "We could tally the charges against the 38 that we released and the 12,000 the previous government released and then find which lot was the most dangerous," the Premier said.
We should have solved our human rights issue within our own country. China, the US and India, all these countries helped us to end the war without harming civilians. Pakistan trained our troops, the US trained our troops. Without their help, we could never have won the war. These nations still help us in reforming the armed forces, he said.
"Who promoted racism? Who incarcerated Sarath Fonseka? Who killed Lasantha Wickramatunga, Nadaraj Raviraj? Killing of MPs Raviraj and Maheshwaran helped strengthening the hands of Prabhakaran. Today there are patriots in their hundreds here. These are cardboard patriots.
These patriots have no substance. They are just like some ice cubes. If we throw them out they would melt away. We have not stopped the court cases against those who have been given bail.
"Mahinda Rajapaksa went to Geneva and betrayed our forces. Thereafter, the UN started investigating us. Who struck a deal with Prabahakaran before the 2005 Presidential elections? Who gave funds to the LTTE after Foreign Minister Kadirgamar was killed? Tell us of those deals too.
Without shouting of non-existing threats here, he said that opposition member's speeches at the committee stage debate on budget proposals under the Defence Ministry expenditure heading were nothing but beating of war drums.
"Tell me for whose sake you are beating war drums? We do not have a war here. What do you propose? With whom should we fight?
Do you propose that we should join the countries currently bombing Syria because there is a war? Or are you proposing that we should bomb Tamil Nadu for sending its fishers to poach in our waters? Your beating of war drums lead you think that you could rouse the people and win them back by beating war drums. If you are mistaken, the war was over many years ago," the Premier said.
 
Repeal of PTA, detrimental to interests of national security - MR
Attention should be drawn on the release of LTTE detainees on the request of certain entities and deproscription of the Tamil Diaspora groups in the name of reconciliation, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament yesterday.
“Reconciliation is not doing everything that the Tamil Diaspora wants,” he said. “We laid the foundation for reconciliation after end of war. We provided all facilities to the South and to the North, thereby achieving reconciliation, he said.
The former President said he warned the repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act would be detrimental to the interests of the national security and requested the government think twice before placing the country’s security at stake.
Participating at the committee stage debate on budget proposals, former President said: The government has also agreed to amend the Public Security Ordinance and to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with legislation acceptable to foreign powers.
I see this as a reckless dismantling of the country’s core security legislation. “In 2009, we militarily defeated the LTTE which had been officially named by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation as the deadliest terrorist organisation in the world. Though we have defeated the military machine of the LTTE, their political and financial structures based in Western countries remain intact. Therefore, my government maintained constant vigilance to ensure that there was no resurgence of terrorism in Sri Lanka. There were nearly four attempts of varying severity by separatist terrorists to regroup in the North, but due to our vigilance, my government was able to nip all those attempts in the bud.
“At present, I see that vigilance no longer exists. My government rehabilitated and released over 11,000 LTTE cadres, while retaining in custody only those were considered to be dangerous to the community. The present government had hastily released hard core terrorists without disregarding the nation’s security, to political pressure from certain interested quarters. While the hardcore LTTE detainees are being released, the Prevention of Terrorism Act is being used to imprison members of the military, he said.
The PTA was enacted to deal with terrorism, not to detain members of the armed forces. If any investigation is to be carried out into the conduct of military personnel, the government has a duty to deal with the issue under the laws applicable to the military or under the ordinary laws of the country. That is a basic custom that we have to extend to members of the armed forces who sacrificed so much for the country. We have to be heedful of the self respect of our armed forces.
Officials of foreign organisations have been permitted unfettered access to Sri Lanka’s military installations, such as the Naval base in Trincomalee. This had resulted in an immediate danger posed to members of the intelligence wing of the Navy, reminiscent to the situation that arose after the Millennium City betrayal in 2002.
We have to be mindful of the events which occurred on the so called Mahavir Day marked recently. The black flags and the posters on the Jaffna campus openly defied Prabhakaran and called for the establishment of Eelam.
The Provincial Councils of the Northern Province ordered that schools be closed, while hartals and hunger strikes were organised in the North to pressurize the government to release the hardcore terrorists. We must be mindful of where these incidents are leading the country to?
Despite danger signs that have been manifesting themselves, the government has taken the ill-advised move of removing the proscriptions on eight pro-LTTE organisations. A 17-year-old youth committed suicide by jumping in front of a moving train. It is said that a letter was found in his possession demanding that LTTE prisoners be released forthwith.
It is not possible to believe that a teenager would have resorted to this type of behaviour, without instigation and elaborate planning by others. I have seen on the internet photographs of the Tamil Youth Organisation and the Canadian Tamil Congress, both of whom were recently de-proscribed, hoisting the Eelam flag and paying public homage to Prabhakaran. These are organisations which my government banned to safeguard Sri Lanka’s security, but they have all been irresponsibly de-proscribed by the current administration.
Rajapaksa said officials of foreign governments have visited our country and made demands to Sri Lanka’s leadership about withdrawing the military from the Northern province. Decisions with regard to the deployment of troops are matters that should solely be within the sovereign jurisdiction of Sri Lanka. I cannot approve officials of foreign governments declaring that they will remain ‘’cautious and vigilant’’ with regard to military matters in Sri Lanka.
He said the root cause of these problems is the ill-conceived foreign policy of the current administration which is based on bending backwards to please certain foreign governments which are in turn influenced in their policy towards Sri Lanka by various Tamil Diaspora organizations which could use their votes at elections in those countries, the former President said.
He said that in October this year, the present government ill-advisedly accepted and co-sponsored a resolution against Sri Lanka which is based on a report which states that there are ‘reasonable grounds to believe’ that Sri Lanka’s armed forces committed grave crimes during the last phase of the war against the LTTE. In terms of this resolution, the government had agreed to establish a war crimes court to try Sri Lanka’s military personnel with the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators and to allow this mechanism to obtain funding from foreign countries.
They have also agreed to reform domestic laws to bring into line with the laws implemented by international war crimes tribunals.
 
Why don’t the govt investigate secret cells at Trinco naval camp - Sumanthiran
Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran told Parliament yesterday, that disappearances was a serious issue and around 20,000 complaints on disappearances have been received during the previous regime.
He questioned as to why the authorities have not investigated the underground secret cells at the Trincomalee Navy camp, while the then Navy Commander had also confirmed it. He said during an interview with a National newspaper, the then Navy Commander had strongly rebutted accusations that there had been a secret detention facility within the Trincomalee Naval base.
He also questioned whether the Boossa is a detainee camp or a remand prison, as there were persons who had been taken into custody were separately held in Boossa, while the others were held under judicial custody.
Though an assurance had been given by the government to commence a special process to release Tamil political prisoners on October 31 and complete the process by November 7. But they had bailed out only 39 suspects, while and one person was sent for rehabilitation.
"There were no suicides taking place during the previous regime with regard to the issue of Tamil political prisoners, as the people were aware that they could not expect a solution from them. But they have faith in this government," he said.
"The previous regime did not make any promises, but the present government continuously makes promises and breaches them. So there is no difference between the then government and the present government.
“We are taking a political risk by supporting the Budget. Without fulfilling the needs and the expectations of Tamil community, the government is creating a fight between two groups. We have reached to the limits of our patience.” said the MP.
He also questioned the government as to why it did not scheme to demobilize the Army.
He also expressed his displeasure over the establishment of a special court to carry out court proceedings relating to cases of Tamil prisoners, by the picking of a judge by the Minster of Justice, as it would affect the transparency of proceedings.
He also spoke about the minor staff appointments recently by the Justice Ministry and claimed that only one Tamil speaking person was among the 91 minor staffers who have been recruited. He also emphasised the necessity of filling of the vacancies of Tamil speaking judges.
 
War heroes to be offered Special Privilege Cards
The government is taking measures to offer a special privilege card to war heroes who rendered a great service to protect the nation, said Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena yesterday.
He said the privilege card would be issued in coordination with fifty institutions in the country. He added that the government initiated these measures in recognition the war heroes.
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Defence Ministry Financial Head.
Defence State Minister Wijewardena further stated that the government would not permit anybody to act in a way that would affect the national security, as the latter is considered to be of paramount importance.
He stated that the government is taking measures to procure all necessary items the security forces needed in order to strengthen them.
He also stated that discussions are under way to purchase the required flights for the Sri Lanka Air Force, adding that discussions are afoot to purchase two ships from India for the Navy.
He added that the international community admired Sri Lanka and President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who came forward to salvage the nation. He also said that due to the changes brought about by the duo, countries such as USA, China, Japan and the United Kingdom have come forward to strengthen Sri Lanka's security.
 
Police service will be brought to int’l standards - Sagala
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday, that plans are afoot to bring our Police service to international standards.
He said as a first step towards this programme, the Special Task Force (STF) personnel will be deployed for UN Peace Keeping operations in several countries shortly, he said.
He said the government would enhance the quality of the Police Service. Salary anomalies would be rectified and salaries of Police personal would be increased by 20 percent this year and another 20 percent by next year. Right now, we have an obsolete Police Ordinance and we will take steps to pass the newly updated Police Ordinance, he added.
A Committee too has been appointed with experts in the field to address the shortcomings in the Police service, he said.
Minister Ratnayake said a new university would be established for only Police personnel to improve their skills and knowledge professionally and practically.
He said this is a radical budget which is being extensively debated in society now. This was not seen in previous budgets and this is healthy sign of good democracy, he said.
 
Law of country means people of the country - Ajith
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera told Parliament yesterday that the law of this country is for the people of the country and it is necessary to ensure the legal rights of people.
Joining the Budget Committee Stage debate held for the 2nd allotted day, the Deputy Minister said that delays in trial procedures have undermined public confidence in the judicial system.
A large number of trials are still in progress.
“The draft amendments to the Civil Procedure Code should be brought in to Parliament, which would enable to introduce the Pre Trial procedures to solve this issue. It would be done under the present government,” he said.
He also added that the facilities concerning the main three institutions, Police, Courts and Prisons which ensure justice for the people, should be strengthened by providing educational facilities to police officers.
