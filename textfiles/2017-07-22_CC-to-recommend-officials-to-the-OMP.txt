With the Office of Missing Persons Act becoming operational, the Constitutional Council (CC) chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will meet next week to discuss the appointment of officials to this office, an official said.

The Act became operational after President Maithripala Sirisena placed his signature for the gazette notice.

The office will consist of seven members who will be recommended by the CC for endorsement by the President.

The OMP will investigate cases of disappearances primarily about those who went missing during the armed confluence. (Kelum Bandara)
