A Sri Lankan maid, who has remained in Saudi Arabia for 17 years, had returned to Sri Lanka yesterday after being paid her salary, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) said.

Media Secretary Nalin Rajapaksa said K.G. Kusumawathi, a resident of Abanpola in Atawarala went to Saudi Arabia in 2000.

“She has worked in a remote desert area as a shepherd for 15 years and not got in touch with her family members for the past one and half years,” he said.

Mr. Rajapaksa said on a complaint made by her family members to the SLBFE, Foreign Employment and Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale had directed the labour officers of the Saudi Arabian Embassy to take steps to get her sent back to Sri Lanka.

He said the embassy officials were able to locate Ms. Kusumawathi with the assistance of the immigration and emigration office in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Arabian Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

“Her employer had agreed to pay her Rs.3.6 million as salary arrears,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.

Meanwhile, the minister said this could be considered as the largest amount we were able to recover as salary arrears paid to a Sri Lankan migrant worker in SLBFE’s history. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
