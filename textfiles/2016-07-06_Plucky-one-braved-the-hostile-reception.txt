Plucky one braved the hostile reception


	

The former strongman attended a series of public functions held in the Panduwasnuwara area quite recently.

 


Betel leaf party purohitas and Diyawanna members hailing from Wayamba had been invited to these meetings.


The Sports purohita and former Deputy Indika were among the VIP invitees. However, the former Deputy had decided not to attend these meetings and sounded a note of warning to the Sports purohita. “Machang, now that we are with the new Big Boss, attending meetings where the former Boss is present can land us in trouble.”


The Sports purohita, being a plucky one had shrugged off the warning and attended the first meeting in the series.



 

On seeing the Sports one arriving at the meeting, a section of the crowd had started greeting him with boos and catcalls. The former strongman had beckoned the Sports one and had him seated by his side, but the jeers and boos had continued. 


Finding that the situation was taking a turn for the worse, the Sports one had left the stage with the intention of leaving the scene. However, the hooligans had tried to subject him to further harassment and even manhandle him, they say.
