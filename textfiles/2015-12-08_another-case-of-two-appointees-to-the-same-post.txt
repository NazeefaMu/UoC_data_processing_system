Another case of two appointees to the same post


	

Here is another classic case in yahapalanaya where two appointees to the same high post are embroiled in a dog fight. 
The story runs like this:  The second in command of yahapalanaya appointed a member of his choice to the directorate of a certain state-owned insurance company when a person already appointed to the same post by the purohita handling finance was already settled in the seat.  The second in command’s late appointee called over to assume duties, but the person appointed by the purohita refused to budge an inch from the seat. And this led to a verbal duel between the first and second appointees. 
Yahapalanaya authorities who wanted to settle this matter quietly immediately kicked the first appointee upstairs as the chair of a development bank. 
However, once bitten twice shy, the man has vowed not to move from the seat until he gets specific instructions from the purohita who offered it to him.
So the stand-off continues to the great amusement of the employees of the company, they say.
