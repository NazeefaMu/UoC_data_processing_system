The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged today, that the Government had restricted peoples’ right to obtain information on certain subjects, including information released by the Central Bank and information related to International Trade Agreements, under the new Right to Information Bill while accepting the access to information as a right.

JVP MP Vijitha Herath said it was mentioned in the Bill that releasing certain information was a punishable offence, which was unacceptable.

“We can accept restrictions in obtaining information related to national security. But people have the right to obtain information related to International Trade Agreements and information of the Central Bank,” he said.

Mr. Herath said people had a right to know information about International Trade Agreements such as ECTA and what impact they could make on the country, people and the future.

He said information released by the Central Bank should be available to people according to world accepted accords and added that even the World Bank had given access to its information through its website.

Mr. Herath said it was a serious matter where it was mentioned in the Bill that providing certain information could subjected to Rs. 5,000 fine or two-year imprisonment.

He said even though ensuring people’s Right To Information was a commendable move by the Government, the matters which hinder the Right To Information, should also be scrapped in the Bill. ( Ajith Siriwardana)
