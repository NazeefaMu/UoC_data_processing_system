A taskmaster or a psychopath?


	



 

There is a lady boss of a government establishment who barks at employees who apply for leave for more than one day, they say.

 


This fair white collar one appointed as the head of this establishment tasked with collecting revenue for the exchequer, thanks to right political connections, has issued a standing order saying that applications for leave exceeding one day should be submitted to her for approval. 


Very often this high-up would rebuke leave applicants saying: “Why are you taking so much of leave? Remain at home if you are not well enough to work. There are enough people for us to recruit!”


“Quite recently she railed at an employee who returned to work after sick leave. In fact, he was taken ill while on duty,” a fellow employee recalled.
