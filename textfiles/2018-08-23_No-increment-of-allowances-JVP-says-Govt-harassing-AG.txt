No increment of allowances, JVP says Govt. harassing AG


	

The government is attempting to harass Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe by withdrawing the proposal to increase his salary and his allowances, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.

JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake levelled this allegation when House Leader Lakshman Kiriella announced the government’s decision to withdraw the proposal.

“The Auditor General is carrying on a campaign to stop corruption and has already disclosed certain facts. We feel the AG is being subjected to political victimization. The government should have referred the matter to the party leaders meeting before taking such a decision,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
