General Secretary of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Udaya Gammanpila MP said today that he had learnt that some UNP members wanted to delay the debate on the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by taking away the Mace and sabotaging the Parliamentary session.

Addressing a media briefing, he said Premier Wickremesinghe had reportedly requested President Maithripala Sirisena to delay the Parliamentary debate on the NCM during his discussions with the President

He added the President had refused the request and asked to carry out the debate as scheduled.

“In such a scenario, the PM must have been desperate and trying to delay the Parliamentary session. Sources say that the UNP members are in an attempt to delay it at least until the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. We urged the Speaker to stand his ground and not to let detractors delay the session,” Gammanpila said.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
