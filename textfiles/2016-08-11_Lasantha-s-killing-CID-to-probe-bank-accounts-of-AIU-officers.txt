Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Sulochana Weerasinghe on Thursday allowed the CID to check the 63 bank accounts held by 60 Army Intelligence Unit (AIU) officers including that of Kandegedera Piyawansa who was remanded in connection with the killing of Sunday Leader Chief Editor Lasantha Wickramatunge.

The Accounts are being held in 33 financial institutions

At the outset of the inquiry, Army Legal Officer I.P. Prageeth told the Magistrate that the information with regard to the killing of Mr. Wickramatunge is missing from the army Intelligence Unit.

He said this in response to a report filed in court by CID Officer Nishantha Silva. Captain Prageeth said their investigations had revealed that the records kept at the intelligence unit in connection with the killing were missing and it would take at least a month to identify the culprit or culprits.

The Magistrate further remanded the suspect till August 25 and ordered the Prison Superintendent to produce the suspect in the Gampaha Magistrate’s Court for an identification parade in connection with the assault on journalist Upali Tennakoon. (Indika Manoj Cooray and Dayaratne Pathirana)
