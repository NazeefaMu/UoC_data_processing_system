Faulted for bypassing party leader


	


There are several kinds of purohitas and from among them the ‘State’ ones are an unhappy lot because the purohitas above them have failed to delegate powers and functions to them, they say. 
One of these unhappy purohitas recently kicked up a row saying that his nominee for a post of director in one of the institutions under the Ministry had been ignored. He later sent a missive to the yahapalanaya boss complaining that the purohita above him had summarily rejected the list of nominees for high posts he had submitted. 
The Big Boss sent no reply to this missive.  However, during a visit to the Diyawanna House, he had sent for the unhappy ‘State’ purohita. 
Pulling this purohita up for sending him an ‘unwarranted’ missive, the Big Boss warned him not to send complaints against other purohitas directly to him in the future bypassing his own party leader, they say.
