	About 10 domesticated elephants would be given for peraharas and other functions for a nominal fee while annual permits would be given to adopt elephants, Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera today said.
	The permits would only be provided after a back ground check on the funds and facilities of those who want to adopt an elephant.
	“This will be renewed each year after the Ministry has inspected the premises and the health of the elephant,” the Minister said.
	Even though permits would be granted for elephants, the ownership of the elephants would remain with the government.
	Several elephants were also being raised in captivity at the moment and can be used for peraharas and other functions for a nominal fee.
	“They are being raised in a place similar to Pinnawala and there are about ten elephants under this programme so far,” he said.(Text and Video Darshana Sanjeewa)
