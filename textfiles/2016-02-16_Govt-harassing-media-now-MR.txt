The government which came to power with the help of the media has set taboos to media institutions which also attacked me, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday.

Responding to journalists while attending a wedding at a tourist hotel in Narigama, Hikkaduwa he said the Yahapalanaya Government was causing problems to media institutions as well as journalists.


Expressing his views about forming a new party and the leadership, he alleged the government was not capable of fulfilling the necessities of the common man, and that is why journalists and the people rallied round him wherever he went.


He said more details about the new party and its aspirations will be revealed soon. (Janath De Silva)
