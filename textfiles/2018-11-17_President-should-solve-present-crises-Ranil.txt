UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe last evening said President Maithripala Sirisena should immediately resolve the present crisis based on the no confidence motion passed in Parliament yesterday.

Speaking to foreign journalists last evening he said, “One cannot wait for a day or two but should resolve it immediately as the country had already gone into a state of anarchy”.

Also he said his party and other allies are ready to prove its majority at any time and in every possible way. (Yohan Perera)
