A booklet to slander ‘the Master Brain’


	



 

A certain group with ties to the JO has produced a booklet in Sinhala titled ‘Maha Molakaru’ (The Master Brain) about a bigwig in Pohottuwa, they say.

 


While arrangements were underway to bring out the booklet in print, a copy of its manuscript had found its way into the hands of the ‘Maha Molakaru’ himself. 


This incident had led to a big battle behind the scene, they say. 


By the way, the ‘Maha Molakaru’ had made a searing attack on a ‘Doctor’ who is said to have written the booklet at an office in the Rajagiriya. Several leading lights of the JO had been present at this meeting. 


The former strongman and other Pohottuwa big guns these days are looking for all parties involved in the conspiracy to bring out the booklet, they say.
