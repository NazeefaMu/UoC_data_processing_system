Eco Engineers Company on way to Green Glory

Eco Engineers & Company has won a Green Apple Environment Award in the international campaign recently to find the greenest companies, councils and communities.
They competed against more than 500 other nominations in the Green Apple Awards for Environmental Best Practice, and Eco Engineers & Company was presented with their trophy and certificate at a glittering presentation ceremony in the Houses of Parliament, London on Monday, November 16.
The event was hosted by Labour Leader candidate Liz Kendall MP and as as a result of this Green Apple Award success, Eco Engineers & Company have been invited to have their winning paper published in ‘The Green Book’, the leading international work of reference on environmental best practice, so that others around the world can follow their example and learn from their achievement.
Speaking on the achievement and award founder of the Eco Engineers & Company Engineer Athula Jayamanne said that the newly received award and international recognition will further fuel the company’s recognition as a environmentally best practicing only Sewage and Waste-Water treatment industry player in Sri Lanka.
“With this award we could also progress to represent Sri Lanka in the Green World Awards, and the European Business Awards for the Environment” Jayamanne highlighted. The Green Apple Awards began in 1994 and have become established as the country’s major recognition for environmental endeavour among companies, councils, communities and countries.
The awards are organised by The Green Organisation, an independent, non-political, non-activist, non-profit environment group dedicated to recognising, rewarding and promoting environmental best practice around the world.
The Green Apple Awards are supported by the Environment Agency, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, the Chartered Institution for Wastes Management and other independent bodies.
Eco Engineers & Co. was established in 2004 and within a short period, it was able to become the leader in Sewage and Waste Water treatment industry, due to the applications of innovative, patended wastewater treatment technologies.
At present, Eco Engineers have expanded their wings into Building Construction, MEP & Sub sectors of Environmental Engineering amidst the growing developments in the construction sector in Sri Lanka. Eco Engineer's & Co. has become the only Sri Lankan Waste Water treatment company that export their own patented innovations to India, Maldives, Malaysia and Indonesia. In addition to that, Eco Engineers & Company has become the first environmental company that has won Presidential Award and Two Consecutive National Awards including several international awards in short period of time.
