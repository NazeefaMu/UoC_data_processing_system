Sri Lanka and the US signed an agreement to amend the US-Sri Lanka Open Skies Agreement of 2002 to facilitate the movement of cargo goods more efficiently and profitably,” the US Embassy said today.

In a statement, it said US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap and Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G. S. Withanage signed the agreement on Monday.

The Embassy said the amendment strengthens global express delivery cargo networks, enhances bilateral connectivity and competitiveness, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.  

Ambassador Keshap said the amendment to the bilateral Open Skies Agreement further strengthens the robust and longstanding trade relationship between the US and Sri Lanka.

“As Sri Lanka’s largest trading partner, the US seeks economic growth that provides employment and opportunity for the citizens of both our nations,” he said.

The signing took place during the Tenth International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Air Services Negotiation Event (ICAN 2017) held in Colombo on Monday.

Within the ICAN 2017 framework, the US is meeting with over a dozen countries and agreed in principle on amendments to two existing aviation agreements to expand rights for US carriers to include key seventh-freedom rights for all-cargo operations,” the Embassy said.

“This year’s ICAN also provides a venue to discuss a wide range of civil aviation issues with bilateral partner governments to resolve business issues and to obtain new rights for US carriers. The US delegation includes representatives from the Departments of State and Transportation,” it said.
