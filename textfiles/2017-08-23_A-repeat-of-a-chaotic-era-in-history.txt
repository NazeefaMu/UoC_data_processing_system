A Buddhist monk from a District North of the central capital called on the former strongman the other day.


The monk well versed both in astrology and the country’s history made several interesting predictions during the long conversation that ensued, they say.


“Our nation today is going through a chaotic period reminiscent of the reign of our last king, Sri Wikrama Rajasinha,” the monk was explaining to the onetime powerful politico. 


“This situation will soon take a turn for the worse. My prognostication is based purely on astrological factors not on the current political indicators. A difficult time for the Sangha is also ahead. Remember that the Sangha too had to discharge a responsibility at that grave hour of the nation!”


The monk made a series of predictions about the country’s future some of which are linked to some prominent actors in the current national scene and the monk referred to them even by name and title as well, they say.
