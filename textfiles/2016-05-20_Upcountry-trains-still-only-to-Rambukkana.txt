Train services on the upcountry line from Colombo Fort will end at Rambukkana, the Railway Control Room said.

The Train services were curtailed after one of the compartments of train No: 19 derailed at Balana on Tuesday.

“As a result, trains from Colombo Fort only travel to Rambukkana,” a Control Room official said.

The Railway Security Department said the track had been badly damaged and because of the rains it would take a few more days to complete the repairs.

Meanwhile, the train service between Thalawa and Thambuththegama has begun operations. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
