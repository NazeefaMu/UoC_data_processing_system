Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunnetti said today a forensic audit should be carried out through a Parliament Select Committee on the Central Expressway.

He told parliament that a forensic audit would reveal the truth behind the awarding of tenders for the Central Expressway.

Speaking at the adjournment debate on the Central Expressway, Mr. Handunnetti said the fraud and corruption on the Central Expressway may surpass the Central Bank Bond scam.

He said the JVP was not against the construction of the Central Expressway and added that it should be done free of fraud and corruption.

Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the Auditor General's reports had revealed that there had been no major frauds in 2015, 16 and 17 when constructing expressways. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
