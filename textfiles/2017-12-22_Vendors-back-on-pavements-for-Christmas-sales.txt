Vendors back on pavements for Christmas sales!


	



 

There are two government politicos racing each other in allocating pavement space in a main city to vendors for them to make a fast buck from the Christmas sales.

 


The pavements of this city were cleared of improvised stalls and hawkers some time ago, enabling the shoppers and other pedestrians to move about safely. And vendors, thanks to their political patrons, have now begun taking up the pavement space to sell their wares, forcing the pedestrians on to the road, endangering their lives and causing traffic snarls.  The two politicos are bringing back the vendors to the pavements with an eye on their vote at the upcoming polls, they say.
