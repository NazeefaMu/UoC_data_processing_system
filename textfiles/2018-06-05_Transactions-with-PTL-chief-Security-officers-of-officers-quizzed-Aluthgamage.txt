CID has questioned the personal security officers of 24 MPs who had reportedly encashed cheques given by PTL owner, joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told Parliament today.

He said his party wanted the names of those MPs who transacted business with Mr. Aloysius so that if any of them were members of the COPE, they could be removed from it. “We have said earlier that COPE members who had transacted business with the PTL Chief should be removed,” the MP said.

State Minister Ajith P. Perera who responded said, MPs such as Mr. Aluthgamage cannot afford to talk on the bond scam because they are facing various charges and involved in court cases. “I suggest that MPs who had transacted business with PTL should not be allowed to be in any of the Committees,” he said.

Mr. Aluthgamage said Mr. Perera’s personal security officer had also questioned by the CID. “I accept there are court cases against me but I would like to say that the state minister's personal security officer had also questioned,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
