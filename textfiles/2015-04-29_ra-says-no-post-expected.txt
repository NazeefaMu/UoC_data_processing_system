Expressing his contentment over the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, National Movement for Social Justice Head Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera yesterday said he did  not expect to serve in the Constitutional Council that is be established in accordance with the new legislation.
“I am satisfied with the enactment of the 19th Amendment and therefore I don't want any post,'" he said.
“I am happy because I agitated for political reforms without expecting anything in return," he said.
The Ven. Thera expressed his gratitude to all political parties including the UPFA, UNP, JVP, and TNA for backing the 19th Amendment in Parliament. He also thanked religious and civil society leaders. “This is a victory for all these forces and no single party can claim credit for it," he added.
However he lauded President Maithripala Sirisena whom he said would go down history as a leader who had willingly shed his powers away.
The Thera called for the enactment of the 20th Amendment which paved the way for electoral reforms but accepted that it would be difficult to hold the next election under the new system. (Yohan Perera)
