‘Gel Saviya’ in Anuradhapura around 20 years ago

Gautama Buddha enunciated ‘Parathittha Patiwajjatha’ which means that one must look into the welfare of others. What he practised as an aspirant of Buddhahood (Bodhisatwa) was self sacrifice. He was also concerned about the welfare of others. The main object of attaining Buddhahood is to show others the path so that they can relieve themselves from suffering. The didactic poem ‘Loweda Sangarawa’, which we often read as schoolchildren, laid down the axiom in brief that one must consider his own interests and those of others equally well. (Athweda Paraweda Samawa sithanne).   




The Pragna Pradeepa Movement, founded 31 years ago by Member of the Western Provincial Council Jayantha De Silva, is based on this noble concept enunciated by Gautama Buddha. It is a benevolent and people’s friendly movement dedicated to find solutions to misery and ignorance. It soon turned into a gigantic welfare progamme spread all over the Western Province and beyond. ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ spread its branches like a huge tree and with its light glorified the life of tens of thousands of young men and women. The founder of the movement Jayantha De Silva was just a Municipal Councilor when he launched it with his meager salary.   


The ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ movement has continued to grow and has guided the people along the path to a happier, fuller and a pleasanter life. Since its inception it has launched many a social welfare programme to help the carters. Helping the Dhamma schools with cash and kind, implementing projects to uplift artistes, helping temples, providing monetary assistance to women belonging to low income families and make them depend on self employment, housing aid for low income families, implementing infrastructure projects in urban areas, and donating books and school requisites to children are among them. ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ is today a household word and a towering figure in the field of social service that supersedes any other social welfare organization in the country. It is really distinct in that it never resorted to propaganda and seeking cheap popularity at a colossal expenditure. Organizations launched for the sake of popularity were short-lived. However the ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ movement, is deep rooted in the hearts of the people.

Welfare of the people   


The ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ concept was the brainchild of Provincial Council Member Jayantha De Silva. However, several of his friends extended their wholehearted cooperation as the movement progressed. Yet the success of the Pragna Pradeepa movement depended entirely on the unstinted courage and determination of its founder who was motivated by one thing. That one thing is the welfare of the people. His dedication and self sacrifice contributed to the success of the Pragna Pradeepa movement.   


Jayantha De Silva’s ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ has been functioning for 31 years as a beacon light guiding thousands of people to better their lives regardless of communal, religious, or political differences. He is an unparalleled social worker. He continues to fulfill his responsibilities for the welfare of others.   


The flames of ‘Pragna Pradeep’ would brighten the society as an unparalleled social welfare movement, not only in Sri Lanka, but also in the whole of Asia.   


The wholehearted cooperation of a group of individuals, who have joined hands with the founder, has strengthened the ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ concept. 


The ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ movement, engaging in well organised and transparent social welfare activities, celebrates its 31st anniversary on May 13, 2018 in Kataragama. The programme includes a series of religious activities, donation of books and school requisites to children of low income families in the area.   
All members of the ‘Pragna Pradeepa’ movement and others who take an interest in this worthy cause are cordially invited to attend the occasion.
