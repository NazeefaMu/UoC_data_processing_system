AFGHANISTAN, (Daily Mail, US) 19 March 2017 -   An Afghan soldier opened fire Sunday inside a base in the southern Helmand province, wounding three U.S. soldiers before being shot dead.   


Navy Cpt. Bill Salvin, a U.S. military spokesman, said coalition forces had killed the soldier ‘to end the attack,’ but Col. Mohammad Rasoul Zazai, an Afghan army spokesman, said the soldier had made a ‘mistake’ and had not fired deliberately.  Several U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan in recent years in so-called insider attacks carried out by Afghan police or soldiers.
