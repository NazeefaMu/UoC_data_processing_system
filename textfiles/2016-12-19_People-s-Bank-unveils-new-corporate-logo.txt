This new corporate logo defines our ambition and the pioneering journey ahead. Our evolution into digital banking and our sustainability initiatives are transforming banking in the nation. While we may be embarking on a new path, our modern and sophisticated logo reflects our respect for tradition with familiarity and trust - values that People’s Bank embodies and upholds.

In order to symbolize the purpose of People’s Bank, the initial logo of the Bank was an emblem with two stalks of grain (to symbolize agriculture), industrial wheel (to symbolize industries) and two hands (to symbolize providing support to people). Since then the Bank logo went through many stages of enhancement and the present logo was introduced in the year 2000. Preserving the originality and its promise, the Bank logo will go through a further enhancement as a result of a recent survey conducted, improving only the colour palette and People‘s Bank lettering to better convey people’s expectations in the areas identified by the survey; and trust, efficiency and sophistication and to win more clarity and visibility.
