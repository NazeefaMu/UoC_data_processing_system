Seethawaka Ganaga hydro electricity scheme to add 20 megawatts to grid

The Seethawaka Ganaga hydro electricity scheme in Deraniyagala costing US $ 60 million once completed will add 20 megawatts of electricity to the national grid to facilitate the government's programme of providing low cost electricity to the people, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister said so when he visited the proposed project site in Deraniyagala on an inspection tour recently.
Siyambalapitiya said under this project, a dam with a height of 42 metres would be build across Seethawaka Ganga at Dabakotuwa, Higuralakanda to feed water to an electric turbine built 1,470 metres away in the lower river basin along with this project infrastructure in Deraniayagala area would also be developed in keeping with the wishes of the people in the area including a bridge linking Dangampala and Hingurukanda.
The minister said the Seethawaka Ganaga Electricity Scheme in Deraniyagala will be Sri Lanka's last and final medium scale hydro electricity scheme.
