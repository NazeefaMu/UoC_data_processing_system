Amendments will affect communal harmony - BBS

The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) charges that the proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code will cause communal and ethnic harmony. BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said said the BBS would not allow the Bill to be passed in Parliament.
Speaking to the media Gnanasara Thera said in all probability, the Bill had been prepared at the request of an NGO, to harm the ethnic and religious harmony of the country. He said the Bill will be used against the media and political freedom of the country. He said the bill would destroy the Sinhala Buddhist leadership.
“The three Chief Incumbents said they were not aware of the Bill. Legal experts know nothing about the Bill," he said, accusing the Bill of being drafted and tabled in the parliament secretly.
Convener Dr. Dilantha Withana said there was no difference between the Bill and Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The BBS said it would conduct countrywide awareness campaigns to protest the Bill.
