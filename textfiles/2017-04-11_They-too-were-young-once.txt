“They too were young once!”


	



 

A youth convention organized by a political party was held quite recently.

 


Party stalwarts had taken the initiative to bring large youth groups from their respective strongholds in the country for participation in the big event. 


However, a strong presence of middle-aged persons was conspicuous among the youths brought to the convention by a youthful politico from Wayamba. 


One of his colleagues having observed this incongruity had asked the Wayamba politico why he had brought the middle-aged persons to the youth convention.    


The politico from Wayamba had replied: “I could not round up enough young chaps. After all, these middle-aged ones too were once young fellows!”
