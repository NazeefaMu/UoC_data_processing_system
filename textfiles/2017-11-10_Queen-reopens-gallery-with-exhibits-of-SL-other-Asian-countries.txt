Queen Elizabeth had officially reopened the Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia at the British Museum in London which displays a wide range of objects related to the history of Sri Lanka and several other countries since 5000BC, the Sino radio station in London reported.

The Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery displays a wide range of objects related to the history of Sri Lanka, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal from 5000BC to the present day.

Originally opened by The Queen in 1992, the gallery has undergone major renovation and restoration works in the past year.

The refurbishment, made possible by a donation from The Sir Joseph Hotung Charitable Settlement, will allow the gallery to exhibit new types of object, including fragile works such as textiles, ink paintings and calligraphy.

According to Royal Life Magazine, the gallery refurbishments are being unveiled in stages, with the final phase of reopening due to take place in December.
