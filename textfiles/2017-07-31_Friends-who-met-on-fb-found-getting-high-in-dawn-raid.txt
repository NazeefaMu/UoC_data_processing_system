The Colombo Excise Special Operations Unit said that they had busted a drug induced party and the organizer of it had been taken into custody from Sirisanda, in Puwakpitiya, Avissawella.

Those participating in this wild party were said to have befriended each other on facebook and once they assembled at the designated spot the party had begun with those present, both men and women getting high on drugs and booze.

Officer in charge of the unit, P.N.Hemantha said that this was the first time that such a bust had taken place in the village as post parties where drugs and alcohol was consumed were held on the beach and in the main towns. However, the detectives had been unable to find any of the drugs that were used by the revellers to get high although a large collection of expensive foreign liquor had been confiscated after it was found at the site. The party that had begun on the night of 29th had gone on well into the early hours of 30th (Sunday), police said.

The raid was conducted on the directions of Excise Commissioner General A. Bodaragama.(Jayantha Samarakone)
