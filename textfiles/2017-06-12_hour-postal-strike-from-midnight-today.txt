A 48-hour strike will be launched by employees of the United Postal Trade Union’s Front from midnight today.

The trade union staged a protest outside the Postal Headquarters in Colombo today over a number of unresolved issues in the Postal Department.

The protestors charged that the government was trying to handover several buildings which house postal offices in Nuwara Eliya, Galle and Kandy to an Indian company to build hotels.

"These buildings have historical value but they are in grave danger today. Since the government has failed to take prompt action, we will go for a 48-hour token strike from midnight today. If the government comes up with solutions before midnight, we will not engage in the strike,” United Postal Trade Union’s Front President Chinthaka Bandara said.
