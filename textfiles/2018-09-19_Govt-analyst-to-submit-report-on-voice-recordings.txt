Colombo Fort Magistrate M/s. Lanka Jayarathne today ordered the government analyst to submit an immediate report on the recorded telephone conversation over an alleged attempt to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

The magistrate also ordered to check whether the recordings were compared with the voices of Police Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) DIG Nalaka de Silva and Anti Corruption Force Organisation working Director Namal Kumara.

The suspects were ordered to provide a convenient date and a time to appear at the Government Analyst's Department and Ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers to seek orders from the Court to inform the suspects.

Rejecting a request made by the CID to prevent both the complainant and the suspect from travelling abroad claiming this as a serious incident, the Magistrate ordered the CID to provide a detail report as based on which Act and Clause that would prevent them from travelling abroad.

Following a request made by a motion, the complaint was recalled and the mobile phone which relates to the incident was produced and handed over to court. (Manopriya Gunasekera)
