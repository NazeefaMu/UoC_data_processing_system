No CEPA with India: Minister


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will not be finalising or discussing a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India during his visit to New Delhi tomorrow, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said today.
In a statement, he rejected claims made by certain politicians that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and his Indian counterpart would finalise the agreement and that it would adversely affect the country.
The minister said before signing such an important agreement, there were many aspects that needed to be carefully scrutinised.
He said, through such baseless claims and empty rhetoric on the CEPA and the Indian visit, some bankrupt politicians were attempting to misinform the people.
Mr. Samarawickrama said the present government would not allow any international agreement to fill the pockets of politicians instead of the benefits trickling down to the people. (Piyumi Fonseka)
