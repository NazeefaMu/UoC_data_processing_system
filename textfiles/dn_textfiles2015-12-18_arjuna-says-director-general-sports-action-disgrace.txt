Arjuna says Director General of Sports action is a disgrace

Ports and Shipping Minister and a top candidate for the SLC vice-president's post Arjuna Ranatunga has described the Director General of Sports K.D. S. Ruwanchandra's action as a "disgrace" and blamed him for applying double standard of rules to different candidates contesting the forthcoming SLC election.
"There are many critics who are waiting to blame the Sports Minister, but those fingers must be pointed at these officials," said Ranatunga participating at the 30th anniversary celebrations of Ports Authority Childrens' School at the Ports Authority yesterday.
"If these officers do not perform their duties properly it is the Minister and the government who will be blamed by the public. That is exactly what's going on with the SLC elections," Ranatunga said.
The former Cricket World Cup winning captain said that he will inform the President and Prime Minister of the misuse of powers by the DGS.
"There is a mandatory requirement in the SLC constitution that for some posts a person should have served a minimum of two years in the Ex-Co. I am sure that some of the candidates have not fulfilled this requirement, but the DGS has accepted their nominations," noted Ranatunga.
"At the same time he has rejected some applications due to not fulfilling the same requirement. His conduct is unfair and has led to great injustice. It may be my party or Thilanga's party everyone has to be equally treated.
"The DGS should have been aware and inquired into these matters before reaching a final decision. His bad governance is a disgrace to the Sport Minister and the government. We feel sorry that even though we are also a part of the government, this kind of misconduct has occurred," Ranatunga further stated. AA
