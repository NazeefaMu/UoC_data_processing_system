Soon after the agreement to lease the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company, the government yesterday sought Cabinet approval for a 40-year lease of the Mattala International Airport to an Indian company.

The Cabinet paper was presented by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.

An Indian company had made a bid to develop the airport which built under the previous regime with financial assistance from China.

The airport and the harbour are in close proximity to each other. (Kelum Bandara)
