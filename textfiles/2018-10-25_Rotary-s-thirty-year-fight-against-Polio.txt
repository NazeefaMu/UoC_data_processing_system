Rotary’s thirty year fight against Polio


	



Marking World Polio Awareness Day on October 24, Rotary International has worked tirelessly for a time period spanning over three decades to eradicate Polio from the world. Polio is a virus that affects the nervous system of the body and extreme cases may lead to paralysis. It also mainly affects children below the age of 5 years. The fastest and easiest solution to be immune to the disease is a simple vaccination. However, due to the lack of proper health care and poor access to clean water, the disease still survives in some countries and Rotary, along with other established organisations, work towards making the world Polio-free.  

This has been the longest standing and most significant effort taken by Rotary. The brainchild project for this issue began in 1985 when PolioPlus was launched by Rotary International. Mass vaccination took place under this program in 122 countries to 2.5 billion children. Further progress was made with Rotary working closely with the World Health Organisation. The Polio Eradication Fundraising Campaign also took place in the beginning of the 21st century. The most notable milestone was made as Rotary joined hands with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Throughout the years, the Foundation has been the main source of funding to the Rotary projects against Polio.   

Currently Polio is prevalent in three countries, namely Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. Until it is eradicated, the rest of the world still remains at risk. More than a million Rotary members have spent their time and resources in trying to help eradicate Polio. However, due to the lack of resources, poverty, health facilities etc. this has been a tedious task. Less and less cases of Polio are reported annually and this is seen as a positive outcome of the steps taken by Rotary. Collaborating with global ambassadors, including many high-ranking individuals as well as celebrities, the ‘This Close’ campaign works towards making communities aware of the effects of Polio and help in empowering those affected by it.  

For all these amazing initiatives being implemented, large amounts of funds are required. This year Rotary aims to raise $3.4 million to serve this purpose. In addition to this, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will double the amount for every donation given.  You can help us too. Simply make a donation on the official End Polio website handled by Rotary. Remember that each dollar helps bring a vaccine closer to one small child. Standing together, you too can assist in changing history and making the world Polio-free.
