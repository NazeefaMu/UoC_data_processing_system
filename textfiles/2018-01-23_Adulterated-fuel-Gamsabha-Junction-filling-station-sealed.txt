Adulterated fuel - Gamsabha Junction filling station sealed


	

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) yesterday sealed the fuel dispensing pumps and the underground petrol storage tank of the Gamsabha Junction filling station over complaints that it had sold kerosene-adulterated petrol, Petroleum Resources Development Ministry said.

The raid was carried out by the CPC Special Raids Division.

“A sample was referred to the laboratory for testing and further action will be taken after the results,” the CPC said.

CEYPETCO sealed the Nawala filling station last Wednesday after it was found to have pumped kerosene to bowsers for commercial purposes. Filling stations have only been permitted to pump fuel to vehicles and not to bowsers or any other vehicle for commercial purposes.

Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said they had introduced an expeditious method of carrying out raids and requested the public to inform the Special Raids Division via the following numbers: 0728870624 and 0777748417 of any incidents of adulterating diesel with kerosene.
