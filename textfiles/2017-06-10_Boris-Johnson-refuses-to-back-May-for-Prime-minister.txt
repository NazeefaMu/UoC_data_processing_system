Boris Johnson refuses to back May for Prime minister


	



 

Boris is the favorite to be the next Tory leader - and has already repeatedly refused to back Theresa May after her election nightmare.   


The outspoken Foreign Secretary was asked if he believes Mrs May should be Prime Minister but would only say ‘it’s early days’ after retaining his Uxbridge seat.   


He also stayed silent when a reporter suggested that the Tory leader was ‘fatally wounded’ - and then appeared not to hear when another journalist asked him: ‘Does your party need a new leader? Is it you?’.The knives are already out for the Tory leader after a dismal campaign, a series of policy blunders and a manifesto now branded the party’s ‘worst ever’.  Theresa May is said to have ‘no intention’ of resigning and plans to form a Government - but some MPs including Anna Soubry said she should quit as soon as possible.   


Jeremy Corbyn has again repeated his demand that Mrs May leaves office immediately - John McDonnell said he expected Boris’ leadership campaign to start today. George Osborne said the result was ‘completely catastrophic for the Conservatives and Theresa May’ and said the woman who sacked him would be lucky to survive.   


Nigel Evans, member for Ribble Valley, told BBC 5 Live that her decision to call a snap election meant: ‘We didn’t shoot ourselves in the foot, we shot ourselves in the head’.
