Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya said he had learnt that of attempts by the top brass of the Government to outsource dialysis service of kidney patients to Indian companies.

Dr. Padeniya was delivering a speech at the function to mark the launch of book titled Wakugadu Satana by Dr. Channa Jayasumana.

He said his office learnt of such a project proposal by the Government to be implemented through surreptitious means.

He said the GMOA would seek the document containing these proposals from the respective authorities.

Commenting on the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the country, he said though it was called the disease of unknown origin, the etiological factor was well established at the moment.

“The origin is known. But, it is called unknown origin. That is for the convenience to distract attention from reality,” he said.

Instead of addressing the kidney issue, he said the authorities concerned were planning to outsource dialysis of patients to India.

Referring to the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India, he said the GMOA, as the professional body of medical practitioners, had the legitimate right to be involved in the process to ensure clarity in the interest of the country.

He said ‘health in all policies’ was the principle in evolving matters concerning a country.

Dr. Padeniya noted that economic, environmental and health aspects had to be considered in signing international agreements and therefore GMOA would strive to see that all were cleared. (Kelum Bandara)
