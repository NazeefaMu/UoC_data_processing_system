The President and the Prime Minister had failed to fulfill the promises made by them at the time the unity government was formed, Petroleum Resources Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said at a function in Diyagama, Kadawatha.

He said they had also failed to arrest the thieves, much to the disappointment of the people and pointed out that by delaying to investigate the cases of fraud and corruption of the previous government, the thieves had been transformed into heroes and heroes into thieves.

"People voted for this government to expose the thieves and to take the country forward, but those who robbed the government are still at large. The government had completed three and a half years of its term but not a single thief has been arrested. If 118 politicians were paid by Arjun Aloysius, then all of them have to be sacked," the minister said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
