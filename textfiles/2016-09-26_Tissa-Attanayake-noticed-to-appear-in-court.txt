The Colombo High Court today noticed former Secretary of the United National Party Tissa Attanayake to appear in court over allegedly publishing a letter with forged signatures of the Common Opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena and the then Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe during the 2015 Presidential election.

He was indicted earlier by the Attorney General on three counts over committing offences under the Penal Code, International Political and Civil Rights Convention and Presidential Election Act.

Earlier, Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne sent a reminder to the Attorney General’s Department to expedite proceedings in the forged document case against Attanayake. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
