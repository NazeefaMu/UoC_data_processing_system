National productivity wasted on vulgar projects


	

High time to do away with nit-picking, tilting windmills over blathering politicians and dashing coconuts

It is quite discernible and palpable that our country is passing through a period of vital transformation with regard to public administration. 


A very healthy dialogue has erupted in course of a very short span of time over the historical judgment delivered by the court regarding misappropriation of public funds by two very important public servants.  The crux of the matter is that the court itself says that they have not used that colossal amount of money for their personal use.  The other day, some people talking at our nearby tea-kiosk generated a lengthy discussion in their conclave and came to a unanimous verdict that it was a deterrent punishment to the present breed of administrative officers not to carry out the orders of the high ups with scant care to the establishment code, so that the verdict was poetic justice. 


Some others argued that they could resort to summary justice as both parties were brothers and sisters. Since independence, they have been misappropriating public funds in their turns. Yet, another member of the village concave said that the verdict had to be hailed as the tipping point and no any other alternative was possible to arrest this game. 


This transitional Government could prepare the necessary springboard for concrete good Governance later one day. By listening to their ‘pundit’ talk I could call to my mind two books I had read at the university library. One is serving unto Caesar by our veteran civil servant Bradman Weerakoon and Peter Principle. 


But I for not being able to remember the great author who penned it, necessarily a guide book for amateur administrative officers. I humbly believe that if these two victims of public funds misappropriation had read these ground breaking books they might have not done this blunder and could survive as two of the unblemished honorable public servants.  Yet, I have a great respect towards Mr. Lalith Weeratunga for his stellar performance in administrative service. He fell victim to the corrupt system that prevailed.
The ongoing tragedy is that the concerned parties, in a desperate attempt, are nitpicking and misguiding the general public. That is infra dig and could have drastic boomerang effects because of the very fact that people are very knowledgeable now. 


If they go into the matter deeply, there are surely some other ways to skin a cat. It is generally believed now that most of the politicians are playing to the gallery. That cock won’t fight.  The children of the present population are armed with a profound understanding of the status quo with regard to almost all the public matters of national importance. They educate their parents and elders not in uncertain terms. Most of the young and immature politicos are rope walking. 


The children in unprivileged families are very angry, because they seem to know that their children are pursuing higher education in salubrious countries and disturbing the apple cart here. When all these things come out on the public platform, the leaders become unanswerable.


It is crystal clear that God has a soft spot for the people who live by their sweat. Therefore, God could be found at the places where people work under the scorching sun or where rubble is broken into pieces, where steam-rollers work making roads under the unbearable heat. -the workers or the underdog as our old red brigade said in the radical university days, when our blood was heated. 


But the utter disgrace to the economists, professors and doctors of political science is that they dash coconuts, where God is not present. 


Even when Kataragama Devale turmoil erupted and the goons surrounded the very abode, the God was not present there. In fact, stupid people dash coconuts at the wrong place. That is why they do not get the expected results from dashing coconuts.  God sees to the interest of the less fortunate. Our gross national product is wasted on vulgar projects, 
LO AND BEHOLD!
