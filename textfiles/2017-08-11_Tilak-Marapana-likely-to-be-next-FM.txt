Minister of Development Assignments Tilak Marapana is likely to be appointed Foreign Minister, a position which had fallen vacant following the resignation of MP Ravi Karunanayake who came under the pressure following his alleged involvement in the ongoing bond scam.

Well informed sources from the government told Daily Mirror that Marapana is likely to be appointed to the post. “Mr. Marapana is the most likely choice of both the President and the Prime Minister and should take oaths shortly,” sources said. He is likely to be sworn in today according to sources.

He holds the ministry of development assignments at the moment and is likely to get the foreign affairs portfolio as well. (Yohan Perera)
