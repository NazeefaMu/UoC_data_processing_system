NBTS seeks blood brothers!


	



Donating blood is a meritorious deed that helps save many lives. The National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), attached to the Ministry of Health, is a decentralized unit which is the sole supplier of blood and blood products to state hospitals, including private institutions registered under the Ministry of Health. The NBTS recently announced that there is an impending risk of going through a blood shortage from the period of January to April this year.   

According to NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa, approximately 400 to 450 thousand units of blood from voluntary blood donors are collected annually by the NBTS island wide. Any volunteer between the ages of 18 and 55 with a healthy body weight not less than 50 Kg can donate blood whereas in the case of a regular blood donor, the individual can donate blood up to the age of 60 years. Moreover, it is crucial to ensure that the donor is physically fit and is not under medication for any chronic illness or is not suffering from any disease or infection. It isn’t recommended for an individual to donate blood if he or she has traveled abroad within the past three months at the time of the blood donation. While a whole blood donor can donate blood every four months, it should be noted that platelet donors can donate blood after a two week interval.   

 

Shortage of Blood 
Expressing his views to the Daily Mirror, Director of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said that during the period between January and April, a blood shortage is experienced every year. He said that the situation could worsen in the event an election is held during the given period.  
 
“It is a usual phenomenon to experience a blood shortage between January and April annually. We experienced this shortage this year too. On top of that, we had the elections in February. During the election period, it is normal to witness a drop in the blood supply. This year, both these factors coincided,” Dr. Bellana stated.   

“If we don’t do anything about it, we will walk into a crisis by next month or April. We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks,” he added.   

The NBTS has been instrumental in carrying out several effective blood donation campaigns throughout the country in a bid to raise awareness on the importance of donating blood while ensuring that the risk of an impending blood shortage would be countered via such an endeavour. Stating that the recent blood campaign that was held in Kaththankudi was a success, Dr. Bellana added that it was the first time in history that a blood donation campaign was held in Kaththankudi. The campaign attracted 600 donors and to date this has been the highest ever statistic associated with a blood donation campaign held in the Batticaloa District. The blood donation campaign at Kaththankudi was organized by a Senior Consultant of Classic Travels (Pvt) Ltd and social worker, Rizwan Hafiz in collaboration with the NBTS.   


We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks


“Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim community. Among them there were also ladies with burkhas who volunteered to donate blood. Their participation has helped dispel recent rumors, that it is considered bad to donate blood according to their religious practice. We held a similar campaign last Saturday (Feb. 17) in the Batticaloa town with nearly 160 donors. Though this campaign didn’t attract a big crowd, it was nevertheless a record set for the Batticaloa region when considering statistics of the past couple of years.   

“So, we have stepped up the campaign activities and we are seeing some improvement. We are seeing how people are coming and extending support to this noble cause. Given the situation, I hope we might not run into a crisis, but we would have definitely experienced one if we had not acted in advance,” Dr. Bellana said.   


A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groups


Upon inquiring about how Colombo has coped with the situation pertaining to an impending blood shortage, he said that Colombo is always the highest in terms of available blood donors since it is congested with the highest population. However, noting that the same could not be applied in the case of Batticaloa, Dr. Bellana said that this was one of the main reasons why a blood donation campaign was organized in the said region. Highlighting that the situation in Hambantota is very unsatisfactory at present, Dr. Bellana informed that the NBTS is planning to organize its next blood donation campaign in this town in the near future.   

“In the overall, we are doing well in certain regions and not so well in other regions. I don’t think Batticaloa will be a problem hereafter because we have had a good campaign here. Also, we have raised awareness among people and blood donation has been promoted among them.The blood donated by donors, free of charge, during the campaign is collected and stored. Then we issue this to the public and private sectors for medical reasons as per their needs,” he added.   

 

Accidents and Traumas 
Explaining that accidents and traumas make up a high number of cases which demand blood, he added that surgeries which are growing in numbers, and are an everyday occurrence, have a greater demand for blood supply. Thalassaemia and cancer patients also require blood very often.

“Not so long ago, we used to supply a lot of blood to treat dengue patients. Now since the treatment patterns have changed, not much blood is required to treat dengue patients although earlier we had a huge demand in this aspect. The number of major diseases, surgeries and accidents has increased at present, which is why we need more blood. It should also be noted when you take the Sri Lankan community, O+ is the type of blood that is mostly available within the community. O-, AB- and AB+ blood groups are very rare in the public,” Dr.Bellana said.   

 

Organizing a Blood Donation Campaign 
To take part in this noble venture, it is important to know how to organize a blood donation campaign in one’s locality. Deemed to be a meritorious act, donating blood for those in need is indeed a good cause that would save many lives. Enlightening us on the procedure, NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa shared her views on the subject. She said that it would be ideal to arrange blood donation camps during the April festive season and that blood donors are most welcome to donate blood.   

“A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groups comprising Government and non-government organizations, private institutions, friends and volunteer groups. It should be noted that at least 50 donors should take part in a week day donor campaign whereas a weekend donor campaign is expected to attract at least 100 donors. On the other hand, a volunteer can donate blood at the premises of National Blood Centre Narahenpita anytime between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm. This centre is open all 365 days of the year. Donors can also donate blood at any of the hospital based blood banks between 8.00 am and 4.00 pm,” Dr. Saranajeewa said.   


Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim community


Explaining further on how to arrange a campaign, Dr. Saranajeewa said that the camp premise should be a familiar location to donors comprising sanitary facilities such as a washroom in addition to facilities such as parking space, clean and be a calm atmosphere. While laying emphasis that the NBTS doesn’t approve anyone except volunteers as donors, she further highlighted that organizers will be called for a meeting by respective blood bank networks prior to hosting the campaign to educate them on the procedures pertaining to organizing the event. The necessary equipment for blood transfusion would be provided by the NBTS.   



“Mass blood mobiles with the participation of 1000 to 3000 donors are generally conducted by the National Blood Centre and Cluster Centre blood banks since they have the required capacity. Additionally, the NBTS wishes to invite the public to celebrate their life events by organizing a blood donation campaign at the blood bank premises. Also, those who are willing to donate blood can register themselves at the NBTS, which maintains a donor registry. This is very useful for the NBTS in the event of an emergency, in which case the NBTS can call and request a registered donor to donate blood” added Dr. Saranajeewa.
