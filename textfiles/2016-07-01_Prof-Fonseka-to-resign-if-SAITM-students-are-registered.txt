Prof. Fonseka to resign if SAITM students are registered


	

Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman Carlo Fonseka said he would resign if those who pass out from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe were given provisional registration to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka.

He said this during a meeting held with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) at the SLMC office on Thursday.

GMOA Treasurer Nalinda Herath told a media briefing that Prof. Fonseka told them that the SLMC stance on the SAITM controversy remains unchanged despite any political interference.

“We informed him of attempts by those backing the SAITM medical degree shop to give it SLMC approval. Just like the drama in which the Health Ministry showed that Court approval was obtained by SAITM students to carry out their clinical studies at state hospitals, the students will file a Court case against the Health Ministry, demanding SLMC approval. Later the Health Ministry will agree in Court that the SLMC approval will be given accordingly. The ministry will later interpret it as a Court order,” Dr. Herath said.

However, the GMOA said if the students who obtain their MBBS at SAITM were given provisional registration by the SLMC, the entire SLMC staff should resign. (Piyumi Fonseka)
