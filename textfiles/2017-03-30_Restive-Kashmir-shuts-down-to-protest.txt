HINDUSTAN TIMES, 29th MARCH, 2017-   A restive Kashmir shut down to protest the killing of three civilians by security forces during an encounter with militants in Budgam district, raising possibilities of another prolonged unrest in the militancy-hit valley.   


The civilians were killed in the Chadoora area of central Kashmir after security forces opened fire on protesters who were allegedly pelting stones during an encounter between militants and army. A local militant was also killed in the encounter whom the stone-pelters were allegedly trying to help escape.   
At least five civilians have been killed by security forces since March 10 when army chief General Bipin Rawat warned of “tough action” against people trying to disrupt operations by security forces.
