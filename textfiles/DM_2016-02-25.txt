ComBank ends 2015 with solid bottom line growth
	
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has recorded a profit before tax of Rs.17.144 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, a year in which it strengthened its positions in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and accelerated its transition to becoming Sri Lankas first private international bank. A carefully managed performance saw Sri Lankas largest private bank attain solid growth across all business lines to improve pre-tax profit by a healthy 8.94 percent over the preceding year and achieve net profit of Rs.11.903 billion for 2015, a growth of 6.47 percent despite lower margins, reduced capital gains and higher tax commitments. Profit before Financial VAT and Nation Building Tax (NBT) was up 8.73 percent to Rs.20.033 billion.
The gross income increased by 7.03 percent to Rs.77.868 billion and the net interest income grew by a robust 11.47 percent to Rs.30.346 billion, the bank reported in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). One of the many performance highlights of the year under review was the strong growth of the banks loan book, which increased by Rs.102.684 billion or 25.33 percent to Rs.508.115 billion. This was the first time that the banks loan book achieved a net growth of more than Rs.100 billion in a year. Total assets grew by a noteworthy Rs.84.195 billion or 10.58 percent over the 12 months to Rs.879.805 billion at December 31, 2015. Deposits from customers increased by Rs.94.740 billion at an average of Rs.7.9 billion a month to Rs.624.102 billion at end-2015, reflecting an year-on-year growth of 17.90 percent.
We are pleased with these results because they reflect the ability of the bank to grow in changing conditions, while continuing to enlarge its footprint in Sri Lanka and overseas and consolidating its position as a catalyst in the socioeconomic progress of our country, Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said. The banks Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam added that 2015 was noteworthy because a strong foundation for future growth had been set with the licences secured to operate in Myanmar, the Maldives and Italy.
These achievements are perhaps the most significant for the year as they expand our horizons, presenting new opportunities for growth and further strengthening our position in our home market, he said. Elaborating on key performance indicators in the year under review, Commercial Bank said the interest income had increased by 6.79 percent to Rs.66.031 billion, while the interest expenses had grown by 3.11 percent to Rs.35.685 billion, helped by an improved current account and savings account (CASA) ratio and due to timely re-pricing of assets and liabilities. The other operating income improved by 7.65 percent to Rs.10.936 billion, with net fees and commissions growing by 11.24 percent to Rs.5.374 billion, other income including recoveries of loans written off increasing by 20.67 percent to Rs.4.055 billion and the conversion of a net loss on trading of Rs.305 million in 2014 to a net gain of Rs.813 million in 2015. However, the net gains from financial investments in the year reviewed totalled only Rs.694 million as against a profit of Rs.2.273 billion in 2014, which came mostly from profit from bond trading.
Although the bank witnessed in increase in impairment charges by 22.11 percent to Rs.3.943 billion, the banks non-performing loans reduced in the year under review. Notably the bank was successful in reducing its non-performing loans in absolute terms during the year under review. The total operating income before impairment charges grew by 10.44 percent to Rs.41.282 billion and the net operating income improved by 9.33 percent to Rs.37.338 billion, the bank reported. The total operating expenses for the 12 months was up 10.04 percent to Rs.17.306 billion. The banks gross and net nonperforming loans (NPL) ratio improved to 2.74 percent and 1.41 percent respectively from 3.47 percent and 1.86 percent at the end of 2014, while return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) reduced to 1.42 percent and 16.90 percent respectively due to lower margins and high asset growth. The cost income ratio stood at 48.92 percent, which is below the industry average, while the banks net interest margin reduced to 3.39 percent from 3.60 percent in 2014.
The bank improved its provision cover to 48.49 in 2015 from 46.34 percent at end-2014. Capital adequacy ratios declined marginally due to the growth of its loan book, but at 11.60 percent for Tier I and 14.26 percent for total (Tier I + Tier II) capital adequacy, remained well above the minimum statutory requirements of 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively. At group level, Commercial Bank, its subsidiaries and associates reported profit before tax of Rs.17.136 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of 8.05 percent. Net profit (attributable to equity holders) for the year grew by 5.48 percent to Rs.11.85 billion. Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the bank operates 18 branches and Myanmar, where it has a representative office in Yangon. In September 2015, the bank received the regulatory approval for the establishment of a fully-fledged Tier I bank in the Republic of Maldives. The bank also received licence to operate a fully-owned money transfer operation in Italy recently.

COPE flexes muscle: Ranjan
	
Raids would be conducted islandwide on corrupt officials and malpractices in Government Departments, State Committees, Banks, and State Boards, including all Government institutions soon, Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said.
The Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) would conduct the investigations, Ramanayake said while addressing a media briefing today.
He said that no reports were published by the previous COPE Committees.
With the support of the Yahapalana Government, the United National Front (UNF) and with the support of the other collective parties, we hope to conduct investigations in the near future, the Minister said. 
When we discussed the COPE committee, the question of whom the Committee could not question or investigate also cropped up.
We have the authority to question even the Central Bank Governor. We have the authority to summon Ministers as well, he said.
Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran was questioned today.
Now the COPE has the authority to influence decisions taken by the Cabinet, a Minister or Ministries. Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa was the first Cabinet Minister to be arrested due to COPE investigation, he said.
The people, who involved in frauds and malpractices in the previous Government, have got afraid to the COPE Committee more than the FCID, he said.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila and the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are saying that the present Government is trying take revenge by framing false charges, he said.
If you have guts, please come forward to a media panel and say that the Judiciary, the law enforcement and the Executive in the country are wrong.
You will be getting the same treatment that Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera received. The Law will do the needful. If it is about revenge, I expect you to express your views at media briefings, the Minister added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Countrywide blackout: PM calls for report
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has requested the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry to submit a report to him on the countrywide power failure that lasted for about four hours today.
Ministry Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda said the Prime Minister had wanted a report because this was the second countrywide blackout experienced during the last five months.
In September last year, the country experienced an island-wide blackout for more than three hours due to a technical fault at the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Dr. Batagoda said that two committees would be appointed to look into the matter and submit a report. An internal committee comprising CEB officials and an external committee with technical experts will be appointed to investigate the matter, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

DFCC posts healthy balance sheet growth
	
2015 was a year o f transformation for DFCC following the amalgamation with DFCC Vardhana Bank and the change in the financial yearend to December 31 from March 31. The performance reported is for nine months from April 2015 to December 2015 as against that of the previous full year. Net profit after tax as at December 31, 2015 was Rs.1,642 million (group) and Rs.1,068 million (bank) while that for FYE March 2015 was Rs.4,439 million and Rs.3,240 million, respectively. However, there were several exceptional items in both periods which distort the comparison.
FYE 31 March 2015 included substantial one-off capital gains and impairment reversals, while the period ended December 31, 2015 entailed significant nonrecurrent expenses incurred during the amalgamation for items such as systems integration and data migration. The change of the financial year meant that the bank incurred an additional taxation charge based on the full year, even though results were for nine months.
Also, substantial dividend income, which accrues in the first quarter of the calendar year, could not be included. Meanwhile, total assets grew by 17 percent to Rs.247,109 million as at December 31, 2015 from Rs.210,610 million as at March 31, 2015. This included a robust credit portfolio growth of 18 percent to Rs.171,111 mi l l ion from Rs .144,896 million. At the same time credit quality was not compromised.
The ratio of impaired loans to total loans for December 31, 2015 was 5.1 percent compared to 6.1 percent for March 31, 2015, indicating a credit quality improvement. Close monitoring drove down the banks ratio of impaired loans to total loans as well as its regulatory non-performing loan ratio, with the latter improving to 3.7 percent as at December 31, 2015 from 4.3 percent as at March 31, 2015. Its balance sheet strength is demonstrated by a group Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 15.4 percent and a total capital adequacy ratio of 15.3 percent making DFCC Bank one of the highest capitalised banks in the industry. CEO Arjun F e r n a n d o commented, While 2015 was a transformative year for DFCC, the amalgamation with Vardhana has laid the foundation for the bank to take on the competition. We are therefore confident of resuming our normal growth trajectory in 2016 and beyond.

GMOA to stay away from talks with govt.
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today it would temporarily stay away from all discussions with the government until a national policy regarding international trade was formulated; the government reached a firm stance without making contradictory statements on the ECTA and back away from its hostile attitude towards the GMOA.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the decision was taken following the approval of its executive committee.
The executive committee decided that the GMOA should stay away from discussions with the government as the government is insulting the GMOA while discussions are in progress, he said.
Dr. Herath said the GMOA had several rounds of discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama on the proposed Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) and added that they pointed out the negative impact on the employment sector due to the agreement.
We propose the government that a national policy on international trade was formulated before signing international trade agreements for which the government agreed during the discussions but they do not seem to have taken any move towards that, Dr. Herath said.
GMOA media spokesman Dr. Naveen de Soyza said the government that came to power promising to ensure opinion of opposition factions had not allowed even the opinion of the professionals.
The government does not like to uphold the opinion of the professionals as the uprising of the professionals is the destruction of the uneducated, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Island-wide blackout lasting hours
	
The entire country plunged into total darkness following a major power failure this afternoon and the Engineers of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) were struggling to detect the cause for the breakdown.
Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda said a disruption on the main line from Polpitiya in Lakshapana to the Kolonnawa main grid seemed to be the cause of island wide blackout experienced this afternoon.
When asked whether the disruption of power was an act of sabotage Dr. Batagoda said he could not rule out such allegation as disruption of a single grid could not result in a countrywide blackout as each section has a respective protection system in place.
Meanwhile, General Manager CEB M C Wickramasekara said the current findings on the technical side of the disruption of power could not be interpreted as sabotage or not.
He said an initial technical report had revealed that the link between Polpitiya and Kolonnawa had been disrupted and that they are waiting for a full technical report to determine what exactly caused to the blackout.
Questions were being asked whether the power failure which lasted more than two hours was an act of sabotage or a technical fault.
Deputy General Manager  System Control of the CEB, H.D.S.Thimothius soon after the break down told the Daily Mirror that he was struggling to find the cause to the power failure and added the System Control branch was in the process of restoring the power gradually.
It could be due to a strike of lightening on one of our major generators or any other reason. The entire system has suffered a break down. We are right now in the process of restoring power section by section. It will take another two hours to restore power to the entire country, Mr. Thimothius said around 4.00 pm today.
Meanwhile, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has instructed Ministry Secretary Batagoda to appoint a committee to investigate the island wide power failure and report. (Sandun A Jayasekera, Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Nation Lanka Finance announces rights issue to raise Rs.502mn
	
Nation Lanka Finance (NLF) has announced a rights issue to raise Rs.502 million to support the companys core capital requirement and ensure its compliance with regulations that have been stipulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).
The investment to increase core capital will help improve the companys overall liquidity whilst supporting its continued operational growth and expansion. The proposed rights issue will be held on the basis of 02:01 at Rs.1 per share, with a total of 502,326,522 ordinary shares being offered to the existing shareholders of the company.
The core capital base of the company in the financial quarter ending September 30, 2015 was recorded at Rs.72 million and given that the rights issue is fully subscribed, the capital base by March 31, 2016 is expected to increase to Rs.747 million with the expected operational profits. (The minimal capital requirement set by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is Rs.400 million). Commenting on the companys upcoming rights issue, Nation Lanka Finance CEO Jayantha Perera stated,
The capital infusion provided by this rights issue will help Nation Lanka Finance to boost its performance in the current financial year and will strengthen the companys core capital base, whilst ensuring its compliance with the stipulated Tier I capital adequacy ratio set by the CBSL. This issuance will augur well for the companys continued growth and will enable us to retain our current position of profitability. Our focus on compliance is also part of our long-term strategy to establish Nation Lanka Finance as a reliable, dynamic and leading force in the financial services industry. Commenting on how the rights issue would be handled in the event of an under subscription, Perera stated, We are confident that this will not be the case.
However, in the event that the rights issue is not fully subscribed, the company will take the shortfall into consideration and consolidate on profitability to strengthen the core capital base and gradually improve liquidity. This rights issue was recognized as an important part of our expansion and was unanimously approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), which was held on February 10, 2016. As we look ahead to the future, Nation Lanka Finance will continue to establish itself as an organisation whose board of directors and management remain completely committed towards ensuring shareholder wealth maximization.

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said Cuban leader Fidel Castro seemed to be following the policy of President Maitripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, when he extended an invitation to United States President Barak Obama to visit Cuba in June.
Addressing a function in Colombo, he said the Cuban leader had come to terms with global realities, and decided to afford a red carpet welcome to the US President.
He said the Cuban leader had taken such an approach after he witnessed the plight that befell the countries such as Brazil, Iran and Argentina after being hostile to the US.
That is what the Government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is doing.
Otherwise, it is not servitude to the US. Today, Fidel Castro seems to be following the policy of Maithri-Ranil approach in this manner, he said.
He said the non-aligned foreign policy was always the best. (Kelum Bandara)

The Thera, making a special statement, said that he and Asgiriya Chapter were strongly objected to the reopening of the road and that even President Maithripala Sirisena was of the same opinion.
I objected to the reopening of the road from the beginning. Why are they in such a hurry to open the road The traffic congestion will get worse, if it was opened. Lots of people including foreigners gather around these roads. So, how vehicles could be allowed to use the road, the Thera asked.
Ven. Atthadassi Thera said if the road was opened by force, they could do nothing and added that however, the President said a few months ago that the road would not be opened and asked to propose alternative roads.

Union Bank records impressive growth in 2015
	
subsidiaries concluded the year 2015 with a notable business performance; reflected by a 226 percent increase in post-tax profit that signals the strong growth momentum mobilised within the year.
Core banking growth and profitability The principal source of income from the banks fund-based operations escalated to Rs.2,022 million in 2015. This is an increase of Rs.259 million or 15 percent compared to Rs.1,763 million recorded in the previous year.
It is a noteworthy achievement, given the substantial reduction in interest spreads experienced by the bank during the year. Net interest margins dropped due to decreasing spreads and increased investments made in unit trusts during the year. Return on the unit trust investments are reflected under net trading income of the bank.
The banks loans and advances stood at Rs.40,095 million as at 2015 year-end. This is a Rs.14,151 million (55 percent) growth in comparison to the previous year, and is the highest absolute growth achieved by the bank since its inception. The composition of loans and advances of the bank changed in line with its new strategic positioning, as a fully-fledged commercial bank serving a wider clientele including corporate, SME and retail banking segments.

Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera had filed a fundamental rights petition seeking the Supreme Court to issue an Interim Order preventing the police from arresting him, allegedly for illegally keeping a baby elephant in his possession.
He was also seeking a declaration from the Court that the action of the Respondent Police officers in attempting to arrest him and singling out him, constitute an imminent violation of his fundamental rights to equality and equal protection of the law and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention.
He cited CID Director B.R.S.R. Nagahamulla and the IGP as Respondents.
He had stated that in 2015, after the Presidential election, a team of officers from the Wild Life Department accompanied by several others from the Police Department had inquired about the alleged possession of baby elephant from him.
He states that in 2014, in keeping with Buddhist rituals, after the conclusion of a Perehera, a baby elephant had been abandoned at his temple. He stated that he continued to provide and for the pachyderm and also instructed the volunteers to take care of the baby elephant until the authorities took it into their custody.
