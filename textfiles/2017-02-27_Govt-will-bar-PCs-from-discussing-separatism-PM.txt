Govt. will bar PCs from discussing separatism: PM


	

The government intends to place a bar on the provincial councils from discussing separatism, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.

Mr. Wickremesinghe, who was speaking at the opening of the new 'Sanghawasa' at Nagarukkaramaya in Kotikawatte, said the government intended including a clause to that effect in the new Constitution.

He said devolution of power in the new constitution would be based on the existing provincial council system.

"The existing system will be used as a frame for devolving power in the new constitution. Some allege that the government is going to introduce federalism, but I aver that no such system will be introduced. The government does not intend to divide the nation," he said.

He said a grama rajya system, too, would be introduced through the new Constitution.

He reiterated that the status which Buddhism enjoys today will not be changed. (Yohan Perera)
