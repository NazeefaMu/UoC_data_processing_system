The UNP will decide on its next course of action including the likelihood of a secret ballot to select a candidate for the premiership after the Supreme Court delivers its Judgment today, with regard to the petition filed against the dissolution of Parliament, Party Spokesman Harin Fernando said yesterday.

Mr. Fernando was responding to reports that the UNF was preparing to have a secret ballot to decide on a suitable person to take over the Premiership.

“We will decide on the next course of action only after the Supreme Court delivers its judgment on the dissolution of Parliament today,” he said.

“We will have to think of our next move especially if an election is going to be held,” he added.

President Maithriapala Sirisena on Tuesday said current leader of UNP Ranil Wickremeisnghe will not be appointed as the Prime Minister even if all 225 MPs tell him to do so. (Yohan Perera)
