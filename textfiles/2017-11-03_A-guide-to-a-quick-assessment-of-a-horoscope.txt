There has to be a methodology underpinning the process of learning any subject. However, it is a great advantage to have a good grasp of the broad principles or fundamentals relating to a particular subject before undertaking an in-depth study of the various parts of the subject step by step.  This rule holds good for the study of Predictive Astrology as well.

 

Broad principles as a guide 
There are certain broad principles serving as a guide to judging a horoscope at a glance. It is very helpful for a student of Astrology to have a thorough understanding of such principles for studying the rationale behind these principles in detail. Let us look into a few broad principles that can guide you to make a quick judgment of a horoscope.

 

 
When Lagnadhipati is in the Lagna itself
Even a person born into a poor ordinary family would rise to a very high position if his Lagnadhipati is posited in the Lagna, a quadrant (Kendra) or a trine (Moolatrikona) or in the 11th House aspected only by benefic planets.

 

When Jupiter, Venus and Mercury posited in a quadrant or a trine
If Jupiter, Venus and Mercury are posited in quadrant or a trine, the native is assured of learning, wealth and fame.  The native would achieve wealth, prosperity, and a position of authority when several planets are exalted, Swakshetra, or Vargottama in good Bhavas. 

 

Benefits in dwirdwadasa position to Sun 
Benefits in the 2nd and the 12th Houses from the Sun confer strength on the native to achieve self-reliance and prosperity through perseverance. Benefics on either side of the Moon, in the same sign or the Houses adjoining the sign give the native a sound and agile mind, peace, happiness and prosperity. 


The native is very fortunate if the 9th House is occupied by its lord or by benefics and aspected by benefics. 

 

Conjunction of benefics, mutual aspects and exchange of signs 
Conjunction of lords of trines and quadrants, their mutual aspect or exchange of signs confer success and prosperity on the native.  Benefics in the quadrants and malefics in the 6th, 8th and the 12th Houses give success and happiness.

 

Vacant 6th, 8th and 12th Houses
If there are no planets in the 6th, 8th and the 12th life becomes free from misfortunes. Malefics in the Lagna, the 2nd and the 9th Houses make the native lead a life of grinding poverty and hardship.

 

What the Lagna represents
The Lagna represents the personality, traits, childhood, health, environment, physical body, and the general character.  If the Lagnadhipati is strongly posited and if the Lagna is aspected by only benefics, the native would have a successful beginning in life.


If the Lord of the Lagna occupies a trine or a quadrant Swakshetra or exalted, the lord of the 8th in a House other than an angle and the Lagna is occupied by a benefic, the native is blessed with good health and long life. Aries, Leo and Sagittarius natives are energetic and vigorous from birth due to the influence of the Sun and Mars. In their 20s and the 30s they show a tremendous drive, an imposing personality, and marked organizational and administrative skills. Most captains of industry and commerce today are those who have been born under these signs.

 

Positions that produce multi-millionaires, great thinkers and upright rulers
A person born with Rahu, Mars, and Saturn posited in Virgo would be a multi-millionaire. 
People born in Cancer are great thinkers. They are short-tempered, they have ‘a forget and forgive nature. ‘ 


Taurus natives are strong-willed and persevering.  Many firm and upright rulers have been born under this sign.
