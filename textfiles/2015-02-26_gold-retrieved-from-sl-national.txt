Twelve pieces of gold removed from the stomach of Sri Lankan Muhammad Suwair in Kochi, India after he was admitted to Ernakulam Medical college hospital. Officials said they were waiting for one last piece to emerge out.
“Admission in ICU is just a precautionary measure taken to ensure that nothing untoward happens to him, even if the chances for it are very slim.
We are waiting for the last piece to come out,” said a hospital official. Muhammad Suwair was arrested while trying to smuggle in almost 13 gold coins wrapped in a condom. He was later admitted to hospital due to physical discomfort and the officials had managed to extract 12 out of 13 pieces. (New Indian Express)
