RW & Co. tried to drive a wedge between India and me: Prez


	

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and his associates tried to drive a wedge between him and India.

Addressing the people gathered at the Jana Mahimaya rally at Battaramulla, the President said Mr. Wickremesinghe’s team spread misinformation to distance him and India.

“India is our close ally with whom we have strong relationships which dated back to thousands of years. Ranil Wickremesinghe's team spread bogus reports and misinformation. Soon after my assassination plot was revealed, misinterpreted facts were secretly given to the media by Ranil Wickremesinghe and the team. We received Buddhism from India and we have years long of economic and cultural relations. We are close friendly countries. I will make sure our relations with India will soar,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said the housing project in the North kept delaying for three and half years because Mr. Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, Ravi Karunanayake as the Finance Minister and D.M. Swaminathan as the Resettlement Minister fought over each other to win the project.

“This project should have benefited 50,000 innocent families but not a single house was made. Other projects were initiated but this one kept delaying because the three ministers tried to win over the project,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
