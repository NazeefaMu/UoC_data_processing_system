Bandu and Bindu asked to settle among themselves


	

The Colombo Chief Magistrate today invited the two parties to arrive at a settlement over the inquiry against Bindu Bothalegama, who is alleged to have violated the performing rights of the complainant, veteran actor Bandu Samarasinghe.

The Magistrate also directed Mr. Bothalegama to provide a statement to the CCD about the other parties who were allegedly involved in guiding him to imitate the veteran actor and had published DVD films.

Senior counsel Amarasinghe appearing for the complainant told the Magistrate that his client did not want to see Mr. Bothalegama swept off from the industry but in the first place should have obtained Mr. Samarasinghe's permission before indulging in such activities.

He said his client was concerned about the others involved in this matter by producing films using Mr. Bothalegama and to earn money in an improper manner.

Counsel also sought court to direct the CCD to produce them in Court on the next date.

The defence counsel said his client regretted his failure to ask permission from the complainant but that his client had not violated the complainant’s performing rights. He said his client was prepared to apologise to the complainant for for any inconvenience or embarrassment caused.

Mr. Samarasinghe complained to the CCD saying his performing rights had been infringed upon by Mr. Bothalegama violating the clause 17 (1) of the Intellectual Property Act.

The Magistrate put off the case for April 25. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
