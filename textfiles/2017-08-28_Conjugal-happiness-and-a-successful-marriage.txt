Conjugal happiness and a successful marriage


	



 

In countries in the orient like Sri Lanka and India marriage is considered as something sacrosanct – an inviolable sacred bond.  People attach so much importance to marriage, they look one’s success in marriage as one’s success in life.


Therefore, even young couples in love, when it comes to the question of marriage, would want to find out whether their horoscopes are matching. They would want an astrologer to match the ‘porondamas or the Kutas – astrological determinants of conjugal compatibility to ascertain whether their marriage would be a success.  Matching of ‘porondamas’ which people refer to as ‘porondam gelapeema’ in Sinhala, is a widespread practice prevalent in our society.  However, there are several astrological factors that enable a quick and accurate appraisal of the compatibility of horoscopes of a couple seeking matrimony. 


Following are some of the astrological factors that serve as determinants of conjugal compatibility:
Natives of Taurus, Scorpio and Aquarius would make ideal partners for Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn natives


Gemini, Libra and Aquarius natives would be compatible partners for natives of fiery signs Aries, Leo and Sagittarius.


Natives of watery signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces would make good partners of natives of the earthy signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn.


Those born into fiery signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are not compatible with those born into watery signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. 


A couple seeking matrimony would be an ideal match if they have been born into the same Lagna or if one person’s 5th sign happens to be the other’s 9th sign or if the 3rd sign is the other person’s 11th sign. 


If the sign Sun occupies in one horoscope is the sign where Moon occupies in the horoscope of the other, their marriage would be a great success.


If the sign in which Mars occupies in one horoscope is the same where Venus is posited in the other horoscope, their marriage would be a strong bond.


Venus occupying a sign owned by Mars in one horoscope while Mars occupying a sign owned by Venus in the other horoscope is a favourable position signifying a successful marriage. In fact, two young people, a boy and a girl with such a planetary position in their horoscopes would fall in love at first sight, say astrologers.  Closer the Sun and the Moon to Jupiter or Venus better the position.  It is more favourable if they are posited in trines to each other. If the Sun in one horoscope is posited in conjunction with Mars in the same sign as in the other’s horoscope their union would be a success. 


The most important thing to ascertain in matching two horoscopes is whether the couple would remain devoted to each other until the death puts them asunder.  The other important factor that should be determined is whether couple is mentally and physically fit to enjoy conjugal happiness. Another important factor is whether marriage would result in the birth of fortunate children.
