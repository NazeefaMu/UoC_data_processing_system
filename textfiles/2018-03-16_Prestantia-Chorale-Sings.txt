The Prestantia Chorale Team members to present 2018 Easter Choral Reflection   

The international award winning champion Choir: the Prestantia Chorale, directed by Dr. Priyeshni Peiris Perera who won the “champions” Trophy, with the highest ranking Gold medal in the Musica Sacra category at the 4th Asian Pacific Choir Games 2017 will hold an evening of spirit filled Easter Choral music for the fifth consecutive year to raise funds for the Ceylon School for the Deaf & Blind through “Free will donations.”   


In keeping with its tradition, which found its roots as a small ensemble to sing on an Easter Sunday service upon the request of Bishop Keerthisiri Fernando at the Holy Emmanuel Church, the “Asia Pacific Choir Games - Sacred Music Champion Choir” will present the Easter Choral Reflection: “Amazing Grace” on March 25, (Palm Sunday) at 6.30pm at The Methodist Church Wellawatta, 1st Chapel Lane, Galle Road as a “Free and Open to All” event in collaboration with CHRAFT (Christian 
Arts Foundation).   


“Prestantia”: From humble beginnings to win a “Champions Trophy” and “Two Gold Medals” at the Asian Pacific Choir Games (APCG 2017)   



(Dr. Priyeshni Peiris-Perera receiving the Champions Trophy for “Musica Sacra” category at the 4th Asian Pacific Choir Games 2017).   

 

The word Prestantia means ‘Excellence’ in Latin and the Prestantia Chorale was formed under the musical direction of Dr. Priyeshni P. Perera, who is currently the only person to hold a Doctorate in Music from the USA and returned to Sri Lanka. She established the Prestantia Music school (www.music.edu.lk), a leading performing arts school in the country and linked the choir calling it “The Prestantia Chorale.”   


The Prestantia Chorale received 82.88% - The highest Gold medal in the “Music Sacra with Accompaniment” and claimed the “Championship trophy” for this category facing stiff competition from both local & international choirs such as PSM Miracle Voices UII (Indonesia), Li Ming Chorus of Hong An Tiantai Temple Buddhism Academy of Music (China), KMITL Chorus (Thailand) and Asteria, St. Theresa’s Childrens Choir & St. Cecilia’s Choir (St. Joseph’s College) from Sri Lanka.   


It is important to note that at APCG 2017, the “Prestantia Junior Concert Choir” also topped all the school choirs and reputed music academy choirs in Colombo, receiving an 87.5% with a high ranking Gold medal, only to miss the “champions trophy” by a mere 0.75% to the Russian Children’s Choir (88.25%) which ranks #1 children’s choir in the world! This was the very first attempt by both the Prestantia Chorale and the Junior choir at an international choir competition and to achieve such high accolades in its debut attempt is quite noteworthy. The “Prestantia Junior Concert Choir” & “Junior Open Choir” will sing with the Prestantia Chorale for a few selections. Dr. Priyeshni P. Perera continues to foster music education by serving as a full-time Lecturer at the Department of Western Music at the University of Visual & Performing Arts (UVPA), Colombo.   


The past Easter choral productions were titled: “The Borrowed Tomb” at The DRC –Bambalapitiya, “On Angels Wings” at St. Pauls Church Milagiriya and “Wounds of Healing” in 2017 at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour to full audiences.   


It is unique that this team comprises of professionals from all walks of life: Medical Doctors, Lawyers, Clergy, Software Engineers, Bankers, Merchandisers, Music Practitioners and students awaiting university entrance and those of different religious and ethnic backgrounds. Their common interest is passion for “Music” which is at the heart of what they continue to achieve as a team. At present, the members are ; Praveeni Fernando, Pavithra Madapatha, Sudarshi Nonis, Shanika Mendis, Sunara Ranasinghe, Privanka Fonseka De Mel, Tharaka Peiris, Sanduni Perera, Siroshni Illangage, Janaka Fernando, Melantha Fernando, Wasantha Kumara Geekiyanage, (Rev) Upul Fernando, Shavan De Mel, , Dave Fernando, Dihara Fernando, Shamal Fernando, Navodh Fernando and (Dr) Amal Shehan Perera.
