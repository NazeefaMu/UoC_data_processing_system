Asian Alliance Insurance PLC clinched two prestigious awards – a Gold in the Insurance category and a Silver in the Overall Large Companies category – at the 2015 National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA), thereby increasing the tally of prestigious international and national awards bagged by the company. 
The two latest awards from the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, which recognized Asian Alliance Insurance’s excellence in business and contribution to the economic progress of the country, conclude a remarkable month for the insurer. In early November 2015, the company overcame competition from giants in the insurance sector in Asia to receive the highly prestigious award for ‘Innovation of the Year’ at the Asia Insurance Awards and thereafter also won a Bronze Award in the Life Insurance category at the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) Brand Excellence Awards 2015.
“Asian Alliance Insurance takes great pride in these prestigious accolades based on diverse criteria, which recognize our excellence in an array of key areas of operations,” Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said.
“More important than the awards themselves, the entire Asian Alliance Insurance team takes pride in the vast progress that we have achieved in many fronts, which has culminated in recognition at international and national level. These awards also serve as a motivator for us to keep raising the bar further, especially with regard to enhancing customer convenience.”
The National Business Excellence Awards, this year’s edition of which was held recently at Hilton Colombo and followed by a gala dinner, annually recognize and reward Sri Lankan organizations that have excelled in all-round performance.
