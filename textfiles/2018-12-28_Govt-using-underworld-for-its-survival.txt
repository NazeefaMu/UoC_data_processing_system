Govt. using underworld for its survival


	

The government is using the underworld for its survival, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today.

MP Shehan Semasinghe said it was the duty of the government to ensure the safety of all citizens.

“Instead, the government is using the underworld for its own survival. Firearms are being used in broad daylight illegally. This year alone, 54 people have been shot dead. Six unidentified bodies had been found in five districts on Thursday. How can one say the security of the country has been ensured,” he said.

He said at a time when President Maithripala Sirisena had highlighted the importance of expediting investigations into the VIP assassination plot, Ministers Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Thalatha Atukorale had said there was no such plot.

The MP said the next year would be politically crucial.

“MP Range Bandara says he will make a decisive decision while Lakshman Wijemanna says he will even sacrifice his life. For what? These people are here not to serve the people but to get hold of portfolios. This government has to change,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
