They are in dire straits now!


	



 

Two siblings active in politics at the national level are openly complaining that they are in severe financial difficulties, they say.

 


The sibling out of office now, but continuing to run an office, is said to be so hard pressed that footing the office staff’s monthly pay bill has set a big poser to him.


He also has to maintain at his own expense the private security detail continuing to serve him.  


Meanwhile, his sibling holding a political office too is said to be lamenting about the difficulty in making both ends meet.
