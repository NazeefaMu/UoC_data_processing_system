SLFP Senior Minister John Seneviratne today rejected claims made by UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi regarding not releasing the Seevali Ground in Ratnapura for the Joint Opposition rally on Saturday.

“They had requested a land where lorries are parked, not the Seevali Grounds. Tiron Attanayake, a former Municipal Council member, had made a request to the Municipal Council commissioner. The request letter which was dated on September 20, requested the Commissioner the land area where lorries were parked for a promotional campaign on Saturday,” the Minister said.

Later, another letter was sent to the Commissioner requesting the Seevali Ground for their promotional campaign reasoning that they are expecting more people. “The commissioner had permitted to use the Seevali Grounds,” he said.

However, the minister said the JO had made a statement saying that they had not been allowed to use the Seevali Grounds and had been allowed to use the lorry parking ground instead.

When contacted by the Daily Mirror, Municipal Commissioner M.W. Kulathilaka said permission had been given to use the Seevali Grounds only if the Lorry parking ground was not enough to facilitate the people. “But permission was not given to set up a stage on the ground, “he said.
