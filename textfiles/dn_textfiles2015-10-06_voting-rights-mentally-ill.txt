Voting rights for the mentally ill

Voting rights have been granted to persons receiving treatment at the National Institute of Mental Health with the assistance of Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, the institute’s former director Dr. B. Jayan Mendis said. Addressing the media at the National Institute of Mental Health, Mulleriyawa yesterday, he said before granting them voting rights, these persons were fully educated on voting.
“They were also provided with National Identity Cards.
Usually when a person is admitted to the institute his or her guardian or family members keep their IDs and use them to obtain all benefits granted to the patient by the state and other institutions,” he said.
Dr. Mendis said patients at the institute were not ill treated. “Several changes have been made to give them dignity. Mothers of new born babies can stay in the institute with their infants and husbands while taking treatment for postnatal depression. This facility saves their family lives,” he said. Dr. Mendis pointed out that the majority of the health staff in the institute did not support changes which uplift the dignity of the mentally sick patients but a handful of staff members supported him.
