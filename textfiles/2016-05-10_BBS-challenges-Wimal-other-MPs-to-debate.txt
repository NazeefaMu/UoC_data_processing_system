BBS challenges Wimal, other MPs to debate


	

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera today challenged MP Wimal Weerawansa over the statements he made to the media condemning the organisation.

“I will challenge not only MP Wimal Weerawansa but also Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Manusha Nanayakkara, Dilan Perera, Rajitha Senarathne, Mangala Samaraweera and political analysts Gevindu Kumarathunga and Dayan Jayathileke for an open debate to discuss the statements made by them against the BBS,” the Thera said.

“They are claiming that BBS is funded by Norway and it is a conspiracy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). If there’s a CIA conspiracy and if we are funded by Norway, there should be investigations against us to find out the truth. If anyone funded us, there should be bank accounts and bills related to any transaction relating to those transactions. The BBS is funded by the innocent Sri Lankan Buddhists becase the work that we are doing is done for their sake. Unfortunately it is sad to say that several ministers were willing to making statements without knowing anything about the BBS,” he said.

“Democracy is not saying lies and it is not a privilege given by Parliament to ministers. What we discussed in the previous government is valid even for this ‘Yahapalana’ government. They were the people who shouted at us when we exposed incidents which were threat to national security and they did nothing,” the Thera said.

“We have not taken a penny from any government or NGO to build up the BBS. We are not the reason for the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now he is reaping what he sowed,” the Thera said. (Chaturaga Pradeep)
