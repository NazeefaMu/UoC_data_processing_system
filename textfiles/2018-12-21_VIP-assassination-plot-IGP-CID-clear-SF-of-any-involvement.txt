UNP MP Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said today the Police and CID had cleared him from any involvement in the assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena.

He told parliament that IGP Pujith Jayasundara had informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in writing that no complaint had been lodged with the CID against MP Fonska on any involvement in a plot to assassinate the President or revealed such involvement during investigation carried out by the CID on the matter.

MP Fonseka read out the letter sent by the IGP to the Speaker and the letter sent by the Senior DIG of the CID to the IGP and requested that the two letters be tabled in parliament.

He said even though he was cleared from allegations, some media institutions with ploitical agendas were involved in slinging mud at him and requested the speaker to mediate to protect his privileges.

MP Fonseka had earlier requested the Speaker in writing that his privileges had been violated due to an allegation made by the President over an assassination plot and the Speaker had requested a report from the IGP on the matter. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
