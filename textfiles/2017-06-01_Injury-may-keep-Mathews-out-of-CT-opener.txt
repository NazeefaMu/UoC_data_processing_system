Angelo Mathews' hamstring injury may keep him out of their opening Champions Trophy encounter against South Africa on Saturday (June 3).

Skipper Mathews who returned to the side after a long injury layoff has injured his hamstring once again during the practice game. His absence will be a major blow to the islanders who will be facing South Africa in the tournament opener.

“It’s a very minor injury,” Mathews said. “I am trying my best to play on 3rd. Doctors have not ruled out a possibility of playing on Saturday but I will definitely be available for the second match.

Mathews injured his hamstring injury during his match-winning innings in the second T20 against South Africa in January and missed both Australian and Bangladesh series played thereafter.

He made his return during the Indian Premier League in April before joining the national squad in early May. (Mirror Cricket)
