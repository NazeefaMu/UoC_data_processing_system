A prominent political authority from the central province has come under pressure from his father not to contest any polls round the corner.

 


Son and father, both belonging to the black-coated gentry, are disillusioned with the current political situation.


The politico has been unhappy for some time as he is being always compelled to carry out orders from above and is never allowed to take independent decisions, they say.
