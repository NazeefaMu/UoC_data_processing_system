I’ll go home tomorrow, if allegations proved: Arjuna


	

While rejecting the allegations made by the Joint Trade Union Collective of the Ports Authority, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today he would resign from politics and go home tomorrow if it was proved he had defrauded a single rupee.

He said the union leaders did not have the backbone to go to the Police, FCID or the Bribery Commission instead of making false allegations against him because they did not have any evidence of fraud.

“If I had defrauded any money, they can go to the Police, FCID or the Bribery Commission and make a complaint against me. They are not doing so because they do not have any evidence. They are just criticizing me saying I am a thief. I have sent a letter of demand for Rs.500 million for making false allegations against me,” the minister said.

He said those so-called union leaders were making baseless allegations because he had stopped all fraud and corruption in the Ports Authority. (Ajith Siriwardana)
