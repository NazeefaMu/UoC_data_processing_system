Fuel price hike likely if US imposes sanctions on Iran:  PM


	

The impending US economic sanctions on Iran might result in another fuel price hike as it would have a negative effect on Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this when a question was raised by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane on certain scandals involving vehicle and gold imports in the House last afternoon.

“The impending US sanctions on Iran could affect Sri Lanka adversely. We don’t know whether this would result in an oil price hike as Sri Lanka currently imports Iranian crude. However, we will have to be prepared to face any adverse situation,” the Prime Minister said.

He said that the ongoing trade war between China and the USA would also affect Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka should be prepared to face any adverse situation that may be caused by these global developments. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
