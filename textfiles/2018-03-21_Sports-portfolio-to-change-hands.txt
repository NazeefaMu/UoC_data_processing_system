A story doing rounds in political circles says that the sports portfolio is due to change hands soon.

 


Festering problems in the sports sector have become a thorn in the side of the government and there are complaints galore that the Ministry has failed to effectively address the shortcomings and drawbacks that have led to continuous setbacks in the popular game. Meanwhile, the government has received reports that the match defeats in particular make an adverse impact on the government as well. Therefore, a decision is said to have been made at a high level to offer the Sports portfolio to a more suitable person in the Green party in a portfolio swap between the two main coalition partners.


The name of a lanky Green politico hailing from a political family in Matale area is being mentioned in connection with the proposed swap.
