Healthcare services in hospitals in the Western Province came to standstill today because of the trade union action launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.

Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen D. Zoysa told a media briefing that the trade union action had been extended up to tomorrow morning even though it was earlier planned to take place from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon today.

However, he said emergency treatment was carried out uninterrupted. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
