Former Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran said yesterday that the current political crisis could be resolved by forming a national government with the involvement of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.

He expressed his views while participating at a programme to present awards to regional artistes held at the Cultural Theatre Hall in Vavuniya.

"There is a conflict between the Executive and the Legislature. It is not constitutional. We have to resolve this. I have made a suggestion for it. There are other ways to do it. I will expand on this later. Unless we resolve this now, we do not know what will happen in the future," he said.

He said he had no intention to contest either a provincial council election or a general election if called. Yet, he said he would contest whatever election the people want him to. "There are numerous requests for me to contest parliamentary elections. It can happen," he said.(Sithum Chathuranga)
