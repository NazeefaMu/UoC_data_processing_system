	An Automated Teller Machine enabling Employment Provident Fund (EPF) members to check their EPF balances was installed at the Labour Secretariat yesterday by Labour Minister S. B. Nawinne.  

The new system will give the opportunity to nearly 2.5 mn members of the EPF to check their balances at any time of the day and also to know whether the employer has contributed his or her monthly contribution to the EPF. 
Minister Nawinne said that all the regional offices of the Labour Ministry, numbering more than 30, would be equipped with these ATMs for the easy access of EPF members.
“Members must print their finger mark on the screen of the machine to obtain a display of his or her account and balance,” Information Officer of the Labour Ministry W.K.Sarath Kumara said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
