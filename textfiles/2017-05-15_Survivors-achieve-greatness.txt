Those who read our previous articles on Shani Erashtaka should by now be familiar with the three types of Shani Erashtaka, Jamma, Lagna and Ashtamaya.


You also should know by now that of the three Erashtakas, the most evil one is Jamma Erashtaka and the impact of this Erashtaka is more severe on Cancer natives than on others.

Impact severe on Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces natives   
It should also be noted that the Ashtamaya Erashtaka is not very severe on all natives except on those whose ascendants are Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces.  When the native happens to be born in Libra, Aquarius, Capricorn or Sagittarius, he would hardly feel the malefic influence of Saturn. Saturn attaining exaltation in a sign/House while being the lord of the eighth House would endow the native with long life.  However, he would undergo much misery and suffering during the Jamma Shani Erashtaka. 

Impact of second round mild on those   surviving the first at birth   
Saturn takes nearly 29 ½ years to traverse through the 12 signs of the Zodiac or to make one circuit round the Zodiac. The Jamma Erashtaka becomes very severe on those natives undergoing it at an age between 12 and 20, 42 and 50 or 72 and 80. Natives who survive the Jamma Shani Erashtaka at birth would not undergo much suffering when they come under the Erashtaka for the second time, say veteran astrologers.

Survivors become great men and women
Besides, natives who survive the Jamma Erashtaka at birth would become great men and women endowed with uncommon courage, perseverance, resolution and the capacity to undergo much suffering. 


According to certain renowned Indian astrologers, Prince Siddhartha who came to be known as Gautama Buddha after achieving Great Enlightenment was subject to Jamma Shani Erashtaka at birth. 

Fall victim to paralysis, convulsions, arthritis and phlegmatic diseases
When Saturn enters the Cancer sign, the native would become victim to paralysis, convulsions, arthritis and phlegmatic diseases. 


If a native suffers a disability or an injury during a Shani Erashtaka, the effect of it would last a life-time. 

 

Universal law
According to Vedic Astrology, a certain ethereal power pervades the entire universe and the earth inhabit is also is subject to it. 


People generally believe that man is subject to the influences of –planets. They also believe that man is subject to the influences beyond the comprehension of the ordinary human beings. 
However, it is a truism that the human potential is so vast man could develop the strength necessary to withstand the forces of nature. 


We all face vicissitudes of life. Mental and physical suffering, disease and death are common facts about life.  The rich and the poor, the king and the beggar alike are subject to this universal law. 
Shani Erashtakas too should be considered as a reminder of this law and also as a challenge to tap on the power inherent in us to successfully meet that eventuality.
