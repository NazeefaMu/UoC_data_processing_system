A prospect that brings him happy tears!


	



 

There’s a top team member hailing from the deep South whom you can still call young and in fact, he is said to be set for a second marriage.

 


He is reportedly walking on air these days. Confiding the secret of his unusual happy mood in some intimates he has said:


“People in my area visiting me these days make it a point to inquire from me as to when I am supposed to take oaths in my new high office and shower their blessings on me. So, I can’t help happy tears springing into my eyes!”


Although this politico is having high hopes of being elevated to Number Two position one of these days, there are three to four others too nursing the same ambition, they say.


In fact, Number One had occasion to mention some names himself when once the question as to who was good enough for the coveted post had arisen. The post, by the way, seems to be up for grabs these days.
