FR filed by Rosy re-fixed for support

The Supreme Court yesterday re-fixed for support a Fundamental Rights petition filed by former State Minister of Child Affairs Rosy Senanayake who sought an order directing the Elections Commissioner to carry out a recount of the preferences secured by members of the UNP who contested the 2015 General Election from Colombo District.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Chandra Ekanayake, Sisira de Abrew and Anil Goonaratne, the Court was informed that the petitioner's counsel was not present in Court and the respondents are yet to receive notices. Accordingly, the petition was re-fixed for support on February 23.
In this petition, the petitioner Bernadine Rose Senanayake had cited the Election Commissioner, Colombo District Returning Officer, Attorney General and all UNP candidates who contested election from Colombo District as respondent.
The petitioner stated that she was nominated as a candidate by the UNP to contest the Parliamentary General Election 2015 under the UNP symbol from the Colombo District.
She stated that subsequent to the release of the final result sheet, it was brought to the attention of the petitioner by a number of counting agents that in respect of certain polling divisions the votes secured by some candidates had been arbitrarily, illegally and unlawfully altered by the election officials present at the computer room when entering same into the computer.
She stated that the enhancement of the number of preferences secured by curtained candidates and the reduction in the preferences secured by the petitioner as aforesaid caused a distortion of the total preferences secured by the petitioner resulting in an incorrect determination of the preference votes secured by the petitioner. She further stated that this deprived the petitioner a seat in parliament from the Colombo District although the petitioner was in truth in fact qualified to be elected as a member of parliament.
In her petition, Mrs. Senanayake also sought as order to recount the preference votes secured by her and Hirunika Premachandra and Mano Ganeshan.
