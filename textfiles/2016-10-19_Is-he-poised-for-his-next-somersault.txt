Is he poised for his next somersault?


	



 

A certain politico who is said to have called at Temple Trees carrying all his personal effects tuck in a ‘sili-sili’ bag at the time the former strongman was busy forming a government, has become a multi-billionaire today.

 

This was revealed while the past history and the origin of the political career of this politico hailing from the Puttalam area came up as a topic at a discussion held at a high-end hotel in the city quite recently. The participants at the discussion were several onetime whitecollar high-ups who functioned as top aides to the former strongman.

The politico who had mastered the tricks of the trade made a political somersault on time to become a top team member in yahapalanaya as well. However, being compelled to make regular visits to the FCID, the purohita is a disillusioned man these days, they say

. The politico has now held out the threat to quit the government along with his four or five party members if the law hounds were not pulled off his neck. Meanwhile, he had also informed the former strongman of his decision to cross the floor.

Perhaps the former strongman may have had in his mind the latest posturing of the turncoat politico when he declared at the JO-organized public rally in Ratnapura that a change in the head count in the council could send the present government packing home adding such an eventuality was not far from being a reality, they say.
