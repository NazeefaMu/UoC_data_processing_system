The Saudi Arabian Government has decided to reopen the court case on the Sri Lankan housemaid who was sentenced to be stoned to death after being found guilty of adultery, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha De Silva told Parliament today.
He said the decision to restart the case was some kind of achievement because the sentence would be re considered through this move.
This new development came a day after Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Authukorala informed the House that there would be good news on this matter soon.
Dr Silva said foreign ministry officials had visited the woman and had a long discussion with her. (Yohan Perera)
