Doping charges against Kusal Janith doubtful - Sports Minister
Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara said in Parliament yesterday, that there was doubt as to whether the doping charges against Sri Lankan cricketer Kusal Janith were a part of a conspiracy to oust him ahead of the 20/20 Cricket Tournament to be held in India next year. The minister was responding to a question for oral answer raised by UNP MP Lucky Jayawardana, said the Sports Ministry is standing with him on this issue.
We will be intervening on his behalf by providing legal support and as well as other facilities. After being charged with the use of steroid, arrangements have been made to test the second sample of his blood. President Maithripala Sirisena had also instructed that necessary steps be taken on behalf of Kusal Janith.
There is nothing we could do with Kusal Janith if proven guilty, but we are working on the assumption that he is innocent.
The minister however said that stern action would be taken against players if they were found guilty of using steroids.

Naveen, Anura Kumara wants Ravi Algama Committee report tabled
Plantation Industries Minister and former Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, urged current Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera to table the Ravi Algama Committee report.
They made this request when Minister Jayasekera requested for two weeks’ time to respond to a question by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti pasted on the order paper for oral answers. MP Handunnetti in his question had asked the minister to table the Committee report headed by Ravi Algama to investigate acts of fraud and corruption that had occurred in Sri Lanka Cricket under the previous regime.
MP Anura Dissanayake noted that the question should not be postponed as it is relevant to the Sri Lanka Cricket election to be held shortly.
“The former minister appointed a committee and its report is now submitted. As public representatives, we have a right to know what happened during the past years,” he said.
Minister Navin Dissanayake speaking at this point, stood by the argument of MP Anura Dissanayake, adding that he firmly believed the report should be available to the public domain.
Responding to these queries, Minister Jayasekera stated that he needed time to study the report, noting that it was not proper to reveal its content to the public or media without confirming the charges made in it.
“There are policy decisions that the ministry should adhere to as of the recommendations by the report. If you permit me time till December 19, I would make a ministerial statement and table the report thereafter. Even though various allegations have been directed against individuals labelling them as thieves over the past few days, while the charges were not properly proved. As a responsible minister, I am unable to do so.
I will hold proper investigations and if the charges are proved beyond doubt, I will take action against them. I do not want to cover up anybody, nor wish to protect thieves. Over the past years, a large number of incidents of corruption have taken place at the Sri Lanka Cricket. I cannot reveal them without properly looking into them,” Minister Jayasekera replied.
