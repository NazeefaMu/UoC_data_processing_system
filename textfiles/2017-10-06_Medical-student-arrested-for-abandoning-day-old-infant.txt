Police told the court that the 22-year-old woman was a university student and a resident of Polonnaruwa and had an affair with a youth in her village.When she became pregnant, reportedly by the youth, she had rented a house at Puliyankulama where she lived by herself until she entered the Anuradhapura Hospital for the confinement.

In her statement to the police she admitted to having deserted the baby to keep this matter hidden from her parents and fellow students.

The police had rushed to the scene after receiving an anonymous telephone call to find the child wrapped in a piece of cloth.
