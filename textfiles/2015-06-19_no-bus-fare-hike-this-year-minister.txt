Internal Transport Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said today the bus operators had agreed not to increase the annual bus fares in July as laid down in the National Bus Fare Policy.
He said the decision was taken on the basis that operational cost had decreased by 0.03% when compared to the operational costs last year.
“It now costs only Rs.89.97 per kilometer where as it was Rs.89.99 at the time bus fareswere revised on the previous occasion. Fuel prices had not increased while the interest on leasing and repairs and maintenance had decreased,” the minister said.
The minister said the decision was taken at a meeting with bus operators’ trade unions on June 17.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
