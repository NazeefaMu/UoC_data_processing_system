Sure of one Green ‘aye’ for no-confidence


	



 

The JO members led by the former strongman had recently met behind locked doors to work out the nitty-gritties of the much publicized no confidence motion. 

 


The former strongman had pointed out that motion would carry much weight and a telling effect if they could collect the signatures of a section of Green members in addition to the Blue party sympathizers. 
A Pohottuwa leader said that they were in a position to get some Blue sympathizers to sign the motion.  “What about the Green ones raising a big racket against their leader?” the former strongman queried.       

      
” There are several Greens shouting a lot. But none of them is coming forward to sign the motion!” another Pohottuwa member replied.  “There is at least one Green member who will certainly put his signature,” Pohottuwa boss assured.


“Who is he?” they all asked in unison. 


One of them made a guess – a young Green member known by a three-letter first name – a direct descendent of a onetime leading political family in the country. And their boss confirmed it. 


They all had recalled that this dissident Green member announced in public his elation over the debacle of yahapalanaya at the recent mini-polls.
