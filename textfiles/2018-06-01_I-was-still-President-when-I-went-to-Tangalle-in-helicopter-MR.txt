I was still President when I went to Tangalle in helicopter: MR


	

Responding to President Maithripala Sirisena’s remarks that a certain individual has provided helicopters to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to fly to Tangalle as soon as the presidential election results were announced, Mr. Rajapaksa said he was still the President of the country when he left Colombo.

“As far as I am aware, I was still the President of the country when I left. I left Colombo even before the final election results were announced. The President of the country still functions, until a new President is sworn in. That’s the true story. The Head of my security division was from Polonnaruwa. He also went there,” he told journalists at an Iftar ceremony held at his residence last evening. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
