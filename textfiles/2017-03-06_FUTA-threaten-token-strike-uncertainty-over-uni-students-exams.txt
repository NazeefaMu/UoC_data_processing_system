FUTA threaten token strike; uncertainty over uni students' exams


	

The Federation of University Teachers’ Associations (FUTA) today threatened to go ahead with its planned trade union action on March 8 and 9 even though it might jeopardize the exams of undergraduates.

FUTA President Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri told a media conference that not only the students but it would even hamper the work of the lecturers.

“We have waited so long hoping that our demands will be granted. Students’ exams are also scheduled to be held on Wednesday and Thursday. We are aware that the examinations may be disrrupted and some of them may be postponed causing inconvenience to students. But there is nothing we can do,” he said.

Dr. Dewasiri said just as the patients face difficulties when the doctors stop work, the students would suffer during the strike by FUTA.

FUTA Secretary Arjuna Parakrama said there was a crisis facing the Education and Higher Education sectors.

“Government authorities lack a proper understanding of the university sector. Salary deductions made by the recent circulars brought university lectures to the same as other administrative officers,” he said and added that they were demanding security and respect for their profession.

“There are anomalies in vehicle permits, communication allowances and other privileges when compared with other administrative services. When the unity government was elected it promised to allocate six per cent from the GDP to the education sector. However, it has been reduced to 0.6 per cent, which clearly shows a breakdown in the entire system," Prof. Parakrama said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
