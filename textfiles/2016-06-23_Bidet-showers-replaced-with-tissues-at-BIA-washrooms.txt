The bidet showers fixed at the washrooms of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) have been removed from today and replaced with toilet tissues, a BIA official said.

The official said the decision was taken to maintain the cleanliness of the washrooms as they get damp due to the use of bidet hand showers and added that this was in accordance with the system prevailing in Singapore. (T. K. G. Kapila)
