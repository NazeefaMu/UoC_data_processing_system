National Development Bank (NDB) further extended its footprint in the Northern region of the country with the opening of its 97th branch in Thirunelveli and 98th branch in Chavakachcheri recently.
Opening the new branches strongly reinstates the bank’s continued commitment towards the rapid post-conflict economic development taking place in the region.  
The bank’s expansion strategy focuses on promoting financial inclusion by offering relevant, responsible financial services to aspiring communities and promising economic regions. Therefore, with the opening of the two new branches, residents and businessmen in the areas are expected to benefit from a wide range of financial and advisory services.  
Thirunelveli and Chavakachcheri are thriving agrarian communities with a progressive economy that contributes to the gross production of the country.

NDB’s new branches will be geared to support these thriving agricultural communities which spell out many entrepreneurial opportunities. Through its newest branches, NDB aims to provide customised SME banking solutions coupled with effective entrepreneurial education and advisory services to the aspiring SME owners in the Thirunelveli and Chavakachcheri regions. Some of the SME banking services that will be offered include long-term loans on concessionary interest rates, short-term working capital loans, supplier finance facilities, importer/exporter funding facilities as well as distributor finance facilities. 
Further, NDB will also offer a gamut of retail banking products including current/savings accounts, fixed deposits, housing loans, pawning services, vehicle leasing as well as insurance services to the residents of both regions to help them grow and secure their wealth while enjoying easy access and convenience of banking with automated facilities such as Visa debit cards, Internet banking and Western Union money transfer services.
