A leading purohita hailing from the Colombo district recently paid a visit to a large factory belonging to a deputy purohita from a political party other than his.

 


While going round the factory, the deputy spoke to the purohita more about the confining the former strongman’s offspring to the state-run lodge pending hearing of the case against him than about the factory itself. The deputy who himself had to spend a brief spell in the state-run lodge in the recent past continued to express his deep concern over the fate of the young member from the former royal family. Then the purohita from the Colombo district said: “It was some people from your own political party who pressed for action against the young man.  So you had better convey your concern over this affair to your own party high ups. As for us, we can do nothing about it…”
