Rugby Sevens is our future

Aloha rugby hearts and proud Sri Islanders who follow the union game it's all about survival in the league. The decisive factors - player injuries, mental toughness, supervised rehabilitation, active recovery, energy management, legal nutrition, and carbohydrate loading etc ...that saves the muscles from depletion, and frees them to motor the full 80mins to much reward ..especially the ability and confidence to run from inside their own 22m.
Good sides can punish mistakes as tired lactic saturated muscles and minds stutter, make bad decisions and list up simple errors that cost massive!
Let's take the opening warrior weekend for 2016 ... perfect examples of playing the full 80mins, playing to the whistle and punishing mistakes. Kandy grafted a win against an opportunistic Havelocks, who certainly did not lack possession or decent ball, given the quality of their injury hit team. Danushka Ranjan sorely missed midfield and hoping for recovery or greener pastures? He is easily the country's best finisher and looks to get bigger, better, faster, as he grows and gains experience.
Havies just couldn't finish despite the Muthuthanthri effort, efficiency, work rate and coach Laggas strategy to deny Kandy decent ball.
All the planning in the world comes down to the 15 in the middle, who need to get the job done. Scrums and lineouts must be owned, mauls controlled and rucks dominated at pace ... on the day despite all Havies had, KSC simply did the small things really well... and were strong enough to deny Havies the magical try line, jealously guarded by some solid defence.
Shenal Dias is almost back to his multiskilled best, dominating lineouts and working hard in the loose. Kevin Kutty Dixon is another on that special list ...with a rare burst of pace and a genuine side stepper off both feet.
Kandy's two try advantage grunted all the way and only a snap individual Marija magic, sealing the deal at full time ...much relief for coach Sean and missed chances for Tavita Lagga.
All roads now point to the hill capitol, the KSC flag proudly marking the club colours, and still unbeaten on top of the Dialog league. Havelocks at no 2 with a little less confidence in nudging the top ...unless Navy or CR causes some serious upsets at Nittawela.
Navy rubbed a little more salt into the CR bruises, when they shocked Longden Place with a 21/20 win in the dying minutes ... to give Danushka 'Gertha' Perera a well deserved man of the match award, and massive celebrations for the thousands of naval supporters crowding the terraces on the day.
The leader board - Kandy 34 points, 2. Havelocks 27p, 3. Navy 25p. 4. CR 19p. 5. Army 18p.
The buzz among rugby fans is news from the blue shirts contracted players, who have fallen short despite Bilal Hassen, Terrance Henry, Achala Perera, Reza Mubarak skill levels and experience etc ... Park management have not seen the results and there is much speculation about the rest of the season and the composition of the playing XV.
I believe that there is much need for strict guidelines to be enforced, so that players are protected at all times. We must have player representation, we must encourage former national players to contribute their wealth of knowledge, gained over hard years of international rugby ... like the cricket example, years of playing for Sri Lanka, must be regarded, and a criterion established to reward those who bravely matched the best in the rugby world. A hall of fame and a list of tours and honours to mark how we islanders survived the pressures of the hardest sport in the world - this is our history!
Sri Lanka Rugby needs to guard its pride of place and begin to broadbase this phenomenal game. We need to adhere to the IRB's principles for world rugby and look to make our mark.
The rugby union is currently between legal issues and hopefully sorted in the first quarter of 2016 ... the game needs careful investment and efficient administration to evolve and secure its slot on the Asian Rugby platform.
Sevens is our future ... we have medal prospects on several levels ... Asian series, Asian games, Commonwealth games, World Cup, World Series, and this year the 2016 Olympic games ... how many fantastic opportunities for our island warriors to showcase their talent and fly the flag, beyond conventional ambitions - what a fabulous future for our men and women.
Domestic rugby needs the inspiration from our national players on a weekly basis. We need the names, we want the crowds back to club rugby ... we need skills and magic to entertain and thrill the fans ... it's all down to how much the warriors step up and wow their fans.
Week 7 matches to carry that unique possibility of intense confrontation on many levels - 9 Jan: Army v Police @ Diyagama. 4pm kick off. 10 Jan: Kandy v Navy @ Nittawela, 4pm kick off.
National rugby needs club rugby to set the highest standards and the most careful consideration with insurance for players. The players are the lifeblood of progress, skill, performance, reputation and magic in the middle ... in 2016 we need to contract all national players and set in place a facility that enables Sri Lanka to hit up as contenders, initially in Asia ... then Asia Pacific and finally on that world platform. I believe ... I dream ... I breathe.
Bula bula Sri Islanders... the future is in our own hands to evolve - let's start with the 7s. Cheers!
