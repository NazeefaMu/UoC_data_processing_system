Cant compare Lankan and Rohingya refugees: India
	
Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India stood on a different footing from the Rohingyas who seek shelter from persecution in native Myanmar and any comparison between the two is misconceived, the Indian Government has told the Supreme Court.
According to the Hindu, the Government was responding to comparisons made by the Rohingya in the Supreme Court between their plight and the relief facilities given to the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees.
The Rohingya have sought the same aid and the benevolence India had shown the Sri Lankan Tamils.
But a six-page government affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Friday said there was no comparable parity between the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and Rohingya.
It explained that India reached out to the Sri Lankan Tamils on the basis of two Indo-Sri Lankan Agreements signed in 1964 and 1979.
India had agreed to repatriate and grant Indian citizenship to 600,000 persons of Indian origin together with their natural increase by 1981-82.
The government denied the charge that the Rohingya were met with stun grenades and chilli powder at the Indian border. It said the Border Security Force performed its duties in challenging circumstances.
The Supreme Court cannot direct the government to ensure that foreigners enter the territory of India, it said.

Chemical attack: 4 nations slam Russia
	

THE HINDU, 16th MARCH, 2018-Tensions between Russia and the West continued to ramp up as France, Germany, Britain and the U.S. jointly accused Russia of involvement in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in early March, which they said involved the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War. It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty and any such use by a state party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of all of us, they said in a joint statement on Thursday.
All four shared Britains assessment that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack, and condemned Russias failure to address the legitimate request by the U.K. government to explain whether and how a nerve agent developed under a Russian programme could have gotten into third party control. Thats the only alternative to the Russian states direct involvement, they said.

Disagreements in UNP over Colombo Dy. Mayor post
	
Some of the Tamil members of the United National Party (UNP) in the Colombo District have expressed their dissatisfaction on the partys decision to name Mohamed Iqbal as the Deputy Mayor of Colombo.
Mr. Iqbals name was announced at a meeting of UNP elected members of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) last morning.
Member of the Western Provincial Council and one of the UNP organizers in the Colombo District C. Y. P. Ram said it is sad that a Tamil is not named for the post. The party named a Muslim as the Mayor and a Sinhalese as the deputy in 2011 while this time a Sinhalese has been named the Mayor and a Muslim as the Deputy. Even the Muslims members of the party are not happy with Mr. Iqbals appointment, Mr. Ram said.
He said John Ram who had become second in 2011 and who fought a hard battle to win the Kotahena East ward would have been a better choice. Mr. Ram said he had already written a letter to the party leader asking him to appoint Mr. Ram to the post.
However a senior UNPer in the Colombo MC, who did not wish to be quoted, said Mr. Iqbal has been serving the CMC for more than 20 years. Besides, this member said it was the party leader who had decided on the appointment. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: In memory of Prof. Valentine Joseph The great scholar  who was a humble human being
## Section: News Features

In memory of Prof. Valentine Joseph The great scholar  who was a humble human being
	
The first death anniversary of Valentine Joseph, a Professor of Mathematics from the University of Colombo, fell on March 15. 
That one small head could carry all he knew  a line from the poem The Village schoolmaster by Oliver Goldsmith comes to mind when I think of a great scholar who passed away recently. He was so humane that he remembered to care of the geckos at his home (feeding them with butter cake) and inquire into well-being of a youth who came to see him in hospital. 
I too recall with wonder how this great man remembered every question I asked about life  when he neednt have because after all, I was just an old student of his among the many thousands who had passed through his hands. He never forgot who he was; just a simple instrument in the hands of God, the Creator. The balance between God, Man and Land was imperative to him; the great Tao. Yet he was able to, in simple terms, deliver a very complicated piece of the truth in terms of mathematics in everyday examples. He was sought after by men like Sir Arthur C. Clarke as well as all his family members. He could without any shyness say that the greatest happiness he found was in meeting and being with his wife! This lady, shared with me how human her late husband was that even when he was at the hospital bed, writhing in pain when someone had visited him, and asked Sir do you remember me, this great man had replied, of course, how is your son doing. 
Contentment
Leading a life of simplicity is a gift of God. It comes with contentment. Contentment comes with belief. His great mind understood that faith is a well-grounded assurance of what we hope for and a conviction of the reality of things which we do not see. (Bible, Hebrews 11:1) and perhaps the words of St. Augustine, of Hippo - Thou hast formed us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless till they find rest in Thee. Each night he would kneel to pray however much painful his knees were hampering this posture. Submitting to the Creator everything that this mind carried; an act of thankfulness to all what The Almighty had bestowed on him. This I believe brought out the childlikeness as opposed to the childish ways of the so called academics of this day and age. A carefully thought out, carefully worked out, faith as opposed to a faith that promises people to fashion their gilded bulls, made him see the vastness of his Creator and respond each day in total submission, in silence. When goaded, he would compare the varieties of beliefs that people possess, but again in his generous ways would not downplay any. The Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 

He never forgot who he was; just a simple instrument in the hands of God, the Creator. The balance between God, Man and Land was imperative to him; the great Tao

Greatness and laughter
This great man never laughed at others, instead tried as much as he could to laugh with them and I believe he succeeded. He would often laugh at himself, his lack of knowledge, wisdom, comprehension and his shortcomings and misgivings. The ability to laugh at oneself is the unfailing test of greatness; the difference between a tyrant dictator and a wise ruler. I remember when an eminent Sri Lankan scientist, an old student of his, published a full page article about the Origins of the Universe scientists trying to merge the questions of How of science with the question of Why in religion; he lamented that day, How come they have forgotten Gdels incompleteness theorem - one cannot have both completeness and consistency. 
We look down at hand held devices that hold our Brains and Grey matter but he delighted at the depth of insight Calvin has in his beloved cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes that took him soaring above the earth. A piece of butter cake that accompanied his mug of tea, given by his wife, shared with the geckos around him made his day. Peddling his bicycle when he was teaching in the university gave him the daily physical activity and the contentment that he was walking the talk about saving the environment, not polluting it, just as he learned from Einstein, his beloved teacher among Plato, Galileo, Confucius, Newton, Goethe, Schweitzer, Immanuel Kant, De Chardin, Tagore, Nietzsche, Marx, Heidegger, Tesla ,. He could, I think, accept sadness and gladness, praise and criticism, joy and pain, gain and loss, with the same sense of wisdom. I can with conviction say of this great man to quote (Rudyard Kipling, in his poem, If-) 
If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, 
And lose, and start again at your beginnings, 
And never breathe a word about your loss: 
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew 
To serve your turn long after they are gone, 
And so hold on when there is nothing in you 
Except the Will which says to them: Hold on!  Unquote, 
this great man exhibited it. 

This great man never laughed at others, instead tried as much as he could to laugh with them and I believe he succeeded

Yet, above everything he followed his Greatest Teacher, the teacher even Einstein referred to as the Transcendental God. He followed the teachings of God, walking in the footsteps of Jesus whose resurrection we will celebrate this month. He exemplified him in thought word and deed. He knew Jesus teaching that any man who wants to be the master has to be a servant and he who wants to be the lord has to become a slave. He knew that to enter into heaven one must become like a little child. His laughter exhibited this childlikeness. 
He knew to be content in plenty and content in want. He knew what it meant to clothe the naked, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, care for orphans and widows and honour all men and women. He knew that the First in this fleeting world will be Last in the Eternal Kingdom. He knew that his identity did not lie in what he did, but what he was in the sight of God; an adopted son of the ruler of the Universe; a prince, not exemplified as the earthly kings and queens, but in the example of a naked man hung on the cross who died to rise again giving all humankind Hope and meaning to all what they strive to achieve on earth, to look after the earth and replenish it, to the Glory of its Creator. 
His favourite song, Across the Bridge, theres no more sorrow by Jim Reeves, showed the longing to meet the One who Created the Universe and shared a little bit of the complexity as well as the simplicity of Relativity with him, for a brief moment on this earth. 
Rest in Peace, Sir. 
Rohan Wickramaratne.

NISC urges Govt. to pass Judicature Bill
	
While stressing the need to pass the Judicature (Amendment) Act in Parliament so as to set up a permanent High Court-at-Bar to take action against fraud and corruption, National Intellectual Sangha Council (NISC) yesterday appealed to all political parties and organizations, to extend their support to the Bill without disrupting the move.
NISC advisor Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera said they requested the Sri Lanka Bar Association (BASL) and other groups to stand firm and support the Bill without any hindrance.
The Thera told a news conference that setting up of a special court was the only solution to expedite the pending cases and added that most of the people are reluctant to file cases due to delay in the legal proceedings.
He said the Good Governance Government was deviating from its promise given to people at the last presidential election.
We need to put the Government on the right track so that we can get our aspirations fulfilled. We expected that the Government would take action against the fraud and corruption as its first task but it had forgotten it, said.
The Thera said developmental goals could not be achieved when the countrys judicial system was inefficient.
Ven. Hadigalle Vimalasara Thera said about 2,700 pending cases in courts could not be taken up under the prevailing judicial system and added that the proposed special court was vital for this.
He said some political forces had challenged the Bill in Supreme Court and that they had reasonable doubt whether they had done so because they were engaged in massive fraud and corruption.
If there are any technical issues in the Bill, they should be rectified and passed it in Parliament. The case on the Central Bank Bond Scam should also be taken up in this court, the Thera said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Permanent High Court of Trial at Bar-- Leads to unequal treatment: De Silva
	
Senior Counsel Romesh de Silva PC yesterday (16) making the submission on the proposed Judicature Act (Amendment) Bill that this Bill will lead to unequal treatment to equals.
Seven Petitions came up for Special Determination of the Supreme Court before the Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices Buwaneka Aluvihara and Nalin Perera.
Counsel Romesh de Silva PC with Sugath Caldera and Niran Anketel appearing for the President of Bar Association of Sri Lanka submitted that proposed Bill imposes permanent High Court of Trial at Bar whereas there is no such Court.
He submitted that the new Bill gives powers to the Minister to specify the location of the Permanent High Court of Trial at Bar and the Executives such as Attorney General and the Director General of Bribery Commission to institute criminal proceedings.
He said the new Bill if enacted would erode the judicial system and this Permanent High Court of Bar does not come under the existing High Court of Province.
He said there is apprehension that the Attorney General or the Director General of Bribery Commission can choose a particular person and target him whereas, in the normal law, one has to be charged under normal Act.
He added here the Minister specify the Court and Attorney General or Director General of Bribery Commission institute the proceedings. He underlined that indictment can be filed in the correct Court but not in the Court specified by the Minister.
In the normal law of the land, the Chief Justice has to nominate the three judges of the High Court but in the proposed Bill, the Attorney General of the Director General of Bribery Commission can choose a victim and locate the place of trial.
He said there is a deliberate machination which is ultra vires and violation of the rights of accused.
He pointed out under the proposed Bill, the proceedings cannot be postponed for any reason.
Gamini Marapana PC with Navin Marapana appearing for Professor G.L.Pieris submitted that there is no Court such as Permanent High Court of Trial at Bar. He described that this is a cart before the Bull as such.
He argued that Attorney General or the Director General of the Bribery Commission should not supervise the judicial system. He said under the said Bill, the Attorney General and the Director General of the Bribery Commission take powers to transfer the case from one court to another. He contended that it is interference in the judiciary.
He submitted that the Clause 2 amends the Judicature Act to make provision for the Permanent High Court at Bar to try, hear and determine the trials of the offences specified in the Sixth Schedule to the principal enactment and any other offence committed in the course of the same transaction of any such offence
He said that it specifies the composition of the Permanent High Court at Bar
He added it enable the Minister to specify the location or locations of the Permanent High Court at Bar
He further submitted that it enable the Attorney-General and the Director-General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption to institute criminal proceedings in the Permanent High Court at Bar ;
He submitted that Clause 3 amends section 63 of the principal enactment by the insertion of the definition of the expression Director General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption.
He contended the said Bill is inconsistent with the provisions of Articles 10, 12, 13 and 14 of the Constitution, the doctrine of separation of and Article 27, and cannot become law unless passed by the special majority of two thirds of the whole number of Members of Parliament (including those not present) and being approved by the People at a Referendum, as provided for under Article 83 of the Constitution, in as much as inter alia
He pointed out the said Bill confers on the Attorney-General and the Director-General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption, the sole discretion of selectively referring, by Indictment, to the High Courts at Bar such cases.
The said Bill confers upon administrative/executive officers of the State, the power to transfer any case currently before a Magistrate or a Judge of the High Court to be tried in the permanent High Court at Bar which amounts to an interference with the Judiciary
He argued that it confers on officers who constitute part of the Executive, a discretion which was hitherto vested with the Chief Justice [in nominating a Trial at Bar], thereby eroding into and undermining the doctrine of separation of powers.
He submitted that it confers on the very prosecutors, the opposing party [of the Accused/Defence], thereby depriving the Accused of a significant and inalienable element of his right to a fair trial.
He said the criterion of nature and circumstances of the commission of such offence renders an invitation for subjectivity and discrimination based on extraneous and subjective considerations by the said prosecutors.
He said the bill-
Confers on prosecuting officers the power to select arbitrarily cases in which selected persons are accused and referring such cases to the said permanent Trial at Bar, thus discriminating between persons accused of such an offence, he alleged.
The said Bill provides for the expeditious conclusion of trials before the High Courts at Bar whereas Capital offences such as Murder, Rape and Gang Rape are not included in the proposed new sixth Schedule, and is therefore discriminatory, arbitrary, capricious and violative of Article 12 of the Constitution," he said.
There are a large number of pending cases before the High Courts, in respect of capital offences, without any special procedure being implemented for their expeditious disposal he submitted.
He said that the said Bill provides for the Permanent High Courts at Bar, each consisting of three Judges from among the Judges of the High Court, sitting together, thereby taking away a number of Judges of the High Court from the High Courts, and thereby adding severely to the already tremendous backlog of cases in such High Courts, he said and contended that therefore the said Bill is discriminatory, arbitrary, capricious and violative of Article 12 of the Constitution.
Sanjeeva Jayawardane PC appeared for Prof. Mallika Sudath Jayasumana. Manohara de Silva PC appeared for Dinesh Gunawardane. Kushan de Alwis PC appeared for Prof. Liyanage. Shavindra Fernando PC appeared for another Petitioner. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

Protest when OMP commences operations - GSLF Australia
	
The spokesman of the Global Sri Lanka Forum Australia Ranjith Soysa in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena urged the political leaders of the country to record their protest when the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) commences its operations.
The Office of Missing Persons was set up by the Yahapalana government who created an unprecedented record in co-sponsoring the OHRC resolution on Sri Lanka in 2015 as one of the four transitional justice mechanisms. The legislation to set up the OMP is one of most uncouth steps taken by a sovereign country against its citizens, in recent times.
It is not merely an office but a fully-fledged quasi-judicial institute with wide powers to compel giving evidence and producing documents etc., with untrammelled authority, with access to any premises, including Defence Services units at any time.
The OMP has the power to bring in foreign personnel to perform a wide variety of functions. It is not controlled by any accepted basic rights such as having to work within the Evidence Ordinance and can perform tasks in complete secrecy. The operational information of the OMP will not be available even to the highest court in the land.
One of the most disgusting features of the OMP is its definition of the Missing Persons when it refers to " missing in the course of conflict which took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces " It is very clear that the OMP was set up to please the LTTE supporters and the fee-paying NGOs and activists by focusing attention only on the Northern and Eastern provinces in Sri Lanka whereas the issue of missing persons can be applied to the entire island from the 1970s.
Among many other questionable as well as immoral sections pertaining to the OMP, is its power to initiate investigations of complaints received in complete secrecy and OMP officials are to preserve its confidentiality.
The OMP acting on nameless, faceless allegations, is empowered to report to the concerned law enforcement authority and is a danger to the country and its people, especially to the country's defence forces.
To add insult to the injury, one of most vocal anti-Sri Lankan NGO representatives, Nimalka Fernando had been appointed as a commissioner for the OMP. It is a well-known fact that Nimalka Fernando had been not only an avid critic of Sri Lanka's war against the LTTE terrorists but also a staunch supporter of separatism. One can gauge to what degree the foreign-manoeuverer OHRC is attempting to throttle the Sri Lankan armed forces by this blatant act of the appointment, just to add weight to the already heavily biased, uncouth OMP legislation.
In short, the jury and the judge will be one and the same authority in deciding to decimate sovereign Sri Lanka and its law institutions and the defence forces.
We request the people of Sri Lanka and its leaders who value the country's sovereignty to come forward and register their protest when the OMP commences its unlawful and underhand operations.

Quintin Dewanarayana He upholds the perennial values of Vastu Vidya
	

He has made the age old discipline, an efficient instrument to explore structural proceedings

Dewanarayana has experimented with those mystical auras in which man and woman  inhabiting
a household- leadtheir lives

Dewanarayana, is quite certain that, through a well thought out territorial adjustments, that kind of adverse fate could be got rid of

When an exceptional individual appears among us, our foremost duty is to give him recognition. Adequate appreciation of his rare talents and his sense of mission, will have to be offered to such a person of distinction. 
Quintin Dewanarayana is without any doubt, one such elitist genius, who has decided to follow a path of exploration, in a region, that may daunt many an academic and scholar because the field of his selection is highly challenging and calls for unflinching dedication and unwavering concentration.
 
He assiduously focused on the science of land, terrestrial characteristics, the structuring of buildings, both for private and mass use, and above all the mystique aura, that surrounds the habits and habitations of humans. His profound theme he opted to dwell upon, with the austere discipline of ancient Shishyas (students) possesses a far-reading tradition, that extends to the dim past of human civilization-even those mystical eras of the holy texts of the Vedas. 

He assiduously focused on the science of land, terrestrial characteristics, the structuring of buildings, both for private and mass use, and above all the mystique aura, that surrounds the habits and habitations of humans

This discipline, bearing the age-old name Vastu Vidya originated with those ancient sages (Rishis), in whose mind the past, the present and the future are strongly fused together of the lay mind attempted to interpret. This field of study merely as Architecture alone, that will not at all be adequate with due deference to the esteemed science of sophisticated Architecture, one can quite clearly see, the arenas which Vastu Vidya can make its entity. Dewanarayana, quite clearly upholds the perennial values of Architecture as a science dealing with, the central issues of structuring. 
In his approach to the mystique of Vastu Vidya, he has made the age old discipline, an efficient instrument to explore structural proceedings as they affect us in the most mysterious manner. 
Adjustments of domestic structures, probing into The mystical, that influences them, could imply a healthier and happier domestic life. 
Dewanarayana has experimented with those mystical auras in which man and woman  inhabiting a household- lead their lives. 
He has pragmatically established that the methodical and expert correction of some imbalances within human habitations will invariably yield, surprisingly pleasant outcomes. 
He possesses some views, that may startle many, because of their unexpectedness. Dewanarayana, firmly believes, that even whole lands, kingdoms and domains, could alter their destinies, through a deep probing of the influences, that they are subject to, without anyone being aware of those. 
Some countries on earth, seem perpetually, victimized either by vicious natural elements or dissensions 
Dewanarayana, is quite certain that, through a well thought out territorial adjustments, that kind of adverse fate could be got rid of. 
I have an admiration for Dewanarayana for the unshakable assurance with which he pursues, this modern Vastu Vidya concepts and principles. 
His dream is to see the domestic unit rise above being a mere shelter for a few human persons. But with the right awareness and properly guided attitudes, people can transform even the most modern shelter into a divinely inspired home.
Dewanarayana earns my blessings, for his unswerving aim, to make a mere shelter a divine abode. 
May all his wishes come true with the blessings of the Triple Gem!

As the curtain finally came down on 19th March 2017, Rukie Eheliyagoda stepped off the stage of life. She was 90 years old when she died. Love that transcended biological ties was snuffed out leaving in her trail a colourful luminescence which the passing of time can hardly diminish. 
My mother was content with herself just the way she was and allowed her soul the freedom to love, sing, dance and praise God. An exceptional feature in her character was her calm temperament taking everything with a smile, be it hard times or jubilant times and was never tremulous or ruffled. 
She was richly endowed with Joie de vivre and a radiant smile which glowed from within. Outward beauty and the beauty of the soul were both hers in abundance. She was a raconteur par excellence and together with her great sense of humour set alight a sparkle to her lively conversations. It is no secret that my mother endeared herself to anyone who met her for the first time within a few minutes. 
She had an inseparable connection with her family that was deep and symbiotic. It was characterised by an axial relationship. Her family mattered to her the most, evidenced by the abundance of love, care and giving that surrounded her happy home of spouse, five children, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren. During my junior school days, I would constantly fall ill during the time for exams and on each occasion I never failed to find my mother armed with a flask of koththamalli and Disprin waiting near the school gate, during the morning interval. She gave each of her 5 children her undivided attention, even as 4 out of the 5, came in pairs! 
Hers was a life full of selfless care for others. Kindness, compassion and altruistic generosity rained like confetti. She offered a sincere and unbridled friendship especially in the darkest hours. Her heart remained flooded with kindness to the very end. 
She possessed an indefatigable zeal for labouring in Gods Kingdom and was equipped with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of energy and enthusiasm. 
Gods blessings beyond measure were showered on this gracious and indomitable lady from the beginning to the end of her glorious life. During our growing up years, our home was filled with prayers as she would gather her family around her daily after dinner. Her faith in Lord Jesus Christ was so deep rooted that no storm in life ever succeeded in paralysing her faith. Her conversations hardly ended without her boasting of how great and good, the Lord was. 
Her well lived and fulfilled life is our legacy. Her deep and unfathomable love was her gift to us and our endless fond memories of her is the comfort in our hearts that will linger on.

## Title: Several killed in Florida pedestrian bridge collapse

Several killed in Florida pedestrian bridge collapse
	

A newly erected pedestrian bridge spanning several lanes of traffic collapsed at Florida International University on Thursday, killing four people, Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Dave Downey said.
Emergency personnel with sniffer dogs searched for signs of life amid the wreckage of concrete slabs and twisted metal after the 950-ton bridge crushed vehicles on one of the busiest roads in South Florida.
At least eight vehicles were trapped in the wreckage of the bridge and at least 10 people have been transported to hospitals, officials and doctors told news conferences.
Witnesses told local media the vehicles were stopped at a traffic light when the bridge collapsed on top of them at around 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT).
Were working our way into the pile trying to create holes that we can actually physically see, Miami-Dade Fire Department Division Chief Paul Estopian told reporters.
At one point, police requested television helicopters leave the area so rescuers could hear for any sounds of people crying for help from beneath the collapsed structure, CBS Miami television said.
Complicating the rescue effort was the uncertainty about the integrity of the bridge, parts of which remained off the ground, much of it inclined, local media reported.
The 174-feet (53-metre) long bridge connects the university with the city of Sweetwater and was installed on Saturday in six hours over the eight-lane highway, according to a report posted on the universitys website.
If anybody has done anything wrong, we will hold them accountable, said Florida Governor Rick Scott, at a Thursday night press conference, after his office issued statement saying a company contracted to inspect the bridge was not pre-qualified by the state.
The bridge was intended to provide a walkway over the busy street where an 18-year-old female FIU student from San Diego was killed while trying to cross last August, according to local media reports.

South Korea gears up for summit
	

REUTERS, 16th MARCH, 2018-South Korean officials began preparations on Friday for a summit next month with North Korea aimed at reducing tensions on the peninsula, as a report showed the North had probably begun testing a nuclear weapon.
The report by intelligence analysts at Janes by IHS Markit said satellite imagery from Feb. 25 showed emissions of non-condensable gases from a stack at the Norths experimental light water reactor (ELWR) at the Yongbyon Atomic Energy Research Centre, suggesting preliminary testing had likely begun.
The reactor could be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium, but North Korea is believed to already have enough fissile material for multiple nuclear bombs, according to Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.
