Nothing major happened - Mathews

Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews and manager Jerry Woutersz played down the alleged 'scandalous behaviour' the team has been accused of during their disastrous tour of New Zealand.
"This is not the first time it has happened, it happened straight after the World Cup as well last year. People come up with so many allegations," said Mathews at a media conference held at Sri Lanka Cricket headquarters yesterday after the team's return.
"Being the captain if somebody has done something wrong and violated the team rules they will definitely be brought to task and have no way out.
"If there is any incident during the tour we take action against a player immediately, we don't wait till the tour is over, we got to fight it then and there. Nothing major happened, the manager will tender his report and Sri Lanka Cricket will take it up from there.
"If something had happened definitely the manger will get to know and he will look into the matter very seriously. I can't really deny or accept it without knowing," he said.
Manager Woutersz stated that he had been informed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to comment on the allegations because the Sports Minister had requested for a report.
"Whatever the incidents that have been highlighted, I will be making that report in a few days and hand it over to SLC, they will take it up from there," said Woutersz.
REASONS FOR LOSS
Stating the reasons for the team's poor performance Woutersz said, "We didn't play upto our potential. The cricket we played out there was not good enough against a very good New Zealand outfit. We had some good days but didn't continue it when we should have. We came close to drawing the first Test and close to winning the second but the middle order did let us down a bit."
Sri Lanka lost the series in all three formats to New Zealand - the Tests 0-2, ODIs 1-3 and T20Is 0-2.
"We are disappointed we lost all three series. We did everything as far as preparations were concerned, but our planning nothing worked for us. If you look at our team we lacked in experience," said Mathews.
"The reason for the defeats is situation handling. If we had experienced players in the side and when they come up against such situations they know how to handle it. We have been experiencing these situations for some time. We talked about it and hope to rectify it.
"In time to come the players will learn. Because this is an inexperienced side the mistakes are showing in their numbers. (Kumar) Sangakkara and Mahela (Jayawardene) when they went out they left a big void and it is showing. But that cannot be given as an excuse. The present squad is a good one but even though they lack in experience the more they play they will improve.
"The coach cannot be blamed for our performances. It is of our own undoing. As players we need to perform in the middle, the coach can only prepare us for it," he said.
DILSHAN INCIDENT
Commenting on the incident Tillakaratne Dilshan was involved with a spectator during the second T20 international at Auckland, Mathews said, "I actually don't know what exactly happened but as players we don't play to lose. You get upset as well when somebody casts some remark. From the fans' point of view they are also hurt that we lost, so it goes both ways. I can't really comment on whether Dilshan was right or wrong."
The spectator had told Dilshan that it was time for him to retire to which the Lankan opener had reacted and replied, "Do you want to play in my place."
NO SQUABBLING IN TEAM
Mathews denied any squabbling between players including the captain and the coach as was reported by a news agency quoting the Sports Minister.
"We have been hearing so many things from the time of the New Zealand tour, but as far as I am concerned we have a very good relationship. I've known Jerome for the past 8-9 years and we never had differences or any issues. I am clueless where these allegations came from," said Mathews.
On the positive side of things Mathews said, "(Dinesh) Chandimal stepping it up and Dushmantha (Chameera) had a great tour. Chameera bowled with lots of fire and pace and he was able to go hard at the New Zealand batsmen. (Jeffrey) Vandersay bowled well in patches for a new recruit in the team and Kusal Mendis had a few good knocks. We definitely have the capacity and the capability it's just that fine tuning and to cope up with the pressure.
"It was a very difficult tour for us, quite demoralizing and embarrassing because we have had our chances and when we got them we just let it go."
Coach Jayaratne was optimistic that Sri Lanka would be able to defend their World T20 title in India.
"We have a talented unit they have the ability, it's just the adaption in those challenging moments out there in the middle whether they are able to adapt to those situations and manage and navigate their innings and see it to a finish," said Jayaratne.
"You take Milinda Siriwardana he looks great but unfortunately he couldn't finish a match for us especially the ODI series. If you don't do this day in day out in our domestic structure it is difficult. They have the talent and in the subcontinent we would be much stronger than we were in New Zealand."
