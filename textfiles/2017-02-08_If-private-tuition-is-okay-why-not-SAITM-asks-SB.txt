What was wrong in obtaining a degree from a private university if it was permissible for the medical students to enter State universities by attending to private tuition classes, Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said today.

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake told a media briefing that the students who were not eligible to enter State universities could obviously have the ability to obtain a degree through private universities, with the aid of a scholarship or a loan scheme.

“The students who are struggling on the roads against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) on the roads had studied at private tuition classes during Advance Level (A/L) by paying money,” he said.

He said he would give his complete support to establish more private medical universities in Sri Lanka like the SAITM if any investor would be interested in doing so. (Kalathma Jaywardhane)
