Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has ordered not to involve Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) or any other trade union to the ministry’s disaster management committee meeting to prevent ministry’s disaster management process shortcomings from being exposed, claimed GMOA today.

Addressing a press briefing GMOA's Assistant Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda said the ministry had decided not to involve any trade union after the GMOA exposed that there was a shortage of ‘Dextran’ medicinal drug to Dengue patients.

Dr. Samantha Ananda said during the last Disaster Management committee meeting, where all the experts met, the ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) director acknowledged that there is a shortage in Dextran.

“However, the minister is denying the fact. the Health Ministry is not prepared to act in a disaster situation. It took more than eight days for them to start the health assistance. The Health Minister and the officials have neglected their prime responsibility without keeping sufficient drugs in their medical storage facilities. June and July is anyway shows a hike in dengue patients. They were not prepared even for this situation,” he said.

Dr. Samantha Ananda said removing trade unions from the disaster committee is not an answer to the disaster situation as it was the GMOA who started giving the medical assistance soon after the disaster occurred.

He said as a professional body, GMOA has exposed the lapses in the disaster management process to the health officials, however without rectifying the situation the minister and the officials are attempting to silent the GMOA to cover their shortcomings.

Further, he said the GMOA was able to reveal the lapses of the ministry’s disaster management process as they have participated in previous meetings. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
