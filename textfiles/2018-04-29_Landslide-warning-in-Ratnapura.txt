The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) today issued a warning of possible landslides in the Ratnapura and surrounding areas due to heavy rainfall that exceeded 75 mm in the Ratnapura District.

The report issued by the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) at 8 pm today warned people living in the Kuruwita, Eheliyagoda, Alapatha, Ratnapura Divisional Secretariat areas and surrounding areas to be cautious about pre-landslide signs and evacuate the area.

It also requested people to be vigilant about slope failures, rock falls, cut failures, slanting of trees, electrical posts and ground subsidence and evacuate to safer areas if rain continues.

Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department said although it is expected to reduce the prevailing showery condition to some extent from tomorrow, it still said showers or thundershowers would occur at several places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, central, Uva and North-western provinces after 2.00 p.m. and showers may occur in the Western and Southern coastal areas during the morning too.
