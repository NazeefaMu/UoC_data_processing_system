MR's ex-security chief's case fixed for March 7


	

Counter objections by the Bribery Commission for the five cases filed against Major Neville Wanniarchchi, former security chief of former President Mahinda Rajapakse, was fixed for March 7 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Attigalle today.

The prosecution requested time to file counter objections, against the preliminary objections filed by the defence on a previous occasion.  

The Bribery Commission filed five cases against Wanniarchchi for allegedly not declaring his assets and liabilities from 2010 to 2014, while he was a major in the Sri Lanka Army. The cases were filed under the Non -assets declaration Act. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
