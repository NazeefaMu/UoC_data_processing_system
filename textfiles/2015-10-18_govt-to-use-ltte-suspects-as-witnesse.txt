The government was planning to produce former LTTE members, who are to be released from prisons in the near future, as witnesses against the armed forces for the proceedings of the proposed Hybrid Court, Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa charged today.
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Weerawansa said he was informed by reliable sources close to the government regarding the plan.
“All arrangements are being done by the Maithri-Ranil coalition government to make our forces guilty as war criminals in the Hybrid War Crimes Court proceedings. Was this the change our people wanted and what they voted for?” Weerawansa asked.
He added that prisoners, who were found guilty for involving in LTTE terrorist activities, would be released in the next few months by the government in order to prepare them for Hybrid Court proceedings.
The hunger strike launched by suspected ex-LTTE detainees had been called off after an assurance given by the President.
Opposition Leader R. Sampathan last week said that Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa had in principle agreed to the release of many prisoners and that President Sirisena had also agreed to the position of the Justice Minister. 
 
He said therefore many Tamil youths held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) could be released soon, while those implicated with serious offences would be held further to face charges and tried. (Piyumi Fonseka)
