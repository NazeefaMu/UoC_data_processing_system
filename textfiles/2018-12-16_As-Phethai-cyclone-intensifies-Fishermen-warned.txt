The Meteorology Department had warned fishermen not to venture into the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Batticaloa to Kankesanthurai via Trincomalee till December 17 following the formation of a cyclonic storm in the Southwest of Bay of Bengal.

The Meteorology Department also warned that “seawater inundation may occur in the low lying areas in the coast from Trincomalee to Kankesanthurai.”

It said that the cyclonic storm christened Phethai, over South-West Bay of Bengal would likely intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during next 24 hours while moving away from Sri Lanka.

It said that the cyclonic storm named Phethai was located on latitude 11.3N, longitude 84.4E this morning approximately 490 km east-northeast of Trincomalee.

"Under the influence of the system the possibility for heavy rainfalls, sudden roughness associated with a sudden increase of wind (speeds up to 70-80 km/ph) in the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Batticaloa to Kankesanthurai via Trincomalee is high,” the Department said.

“The Northern, eastern and the north-eastern deep sea areas can be very rough and high at times. Seawater inundation may occur in the low lying areas in the coast from Trincomalee to Kankesanthurai,” it said.

“Heavy showers can be expected in the sea areas off the coast extending from Mullaithivu to Kankesanthurai,” it said.

Fishermen were advised not to venture into the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Batticaloa to Kankesanthurai via Trincomalee till December 17.

The fishermen, who are in the warning areas, are advised to move to safer sea areas or return to the coast.
