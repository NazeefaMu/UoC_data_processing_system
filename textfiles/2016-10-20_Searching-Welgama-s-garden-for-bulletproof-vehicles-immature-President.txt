President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday told the Lankadeepa that searching UPFA MP Kumar Welgama’s garden for illegally keeping bulletproof vehicles was an immature act.

The President said the government was inconvenienced due to such immature acts.

“Whatever people say, I should say that it is an immature act,” he said.

President Sirisena said if police received information about keeping government vehicles illegally, there were ample methods and technical apparatus to search for them without engaging in immature acts.

He said such technical apparatus were available at the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau.

The President said he was not aware if it was done by the CID or the FCID and added that whoever did it, police came to disrepute for doing so.

He said what would happen at the end is people would just laugh at such acts.(Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
