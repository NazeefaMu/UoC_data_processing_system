This girl has the best possible excuse for not doing her homework

Forget "the dog ate my homework": little Maddie here has the best excuse - ever - for not doing her homework last night. In a photo quickly blowing up on Reddit, Maddie's parents wrote her teachers a note stating that she didn't get to her homework last night due to some rather big family news.
It seems her grandfather won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry! Yeah, we think she should be excused for just this time. As one Redditor commented, perhaps her punishment should be bringing her grandpa to class one day!
Try to beat that the next time your child doesn't get to his or her homework!
