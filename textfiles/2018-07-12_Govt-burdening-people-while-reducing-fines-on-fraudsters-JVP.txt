Govt. burdening people while reducing fines on fraudsters: JVP


	

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) charged today that the government had burdened the people by imposing excessive taxes and fines such as new traffic fines while reducing the fines imposed on fraudsters through the National Audit Bill.

JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti told a news conference that the government had imposed new fines and had increased fines on traffic offences so as to increase government revenue.

“The traffic rules have been strengthened not to discipline the motorists but to increase government revenue. The government is trying to sustain at the cost of the people. It has reduced the fines imposed on fraudsters engaged in massive frauds and corruption through the national audit bill while taxing and fining common people,’ he said.

He said even though the government was taxing and fining the people excessively, it was providing more privileges and benefits to MPs and ministers.

“The government is planning to provide more benefits and vehicles to newly appointed monitoring MPs. The numbers of ministers are ever increasing,’ he charged. (Ajith Siriwardana)
