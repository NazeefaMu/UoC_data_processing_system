Anunayake's sermon: Those misunderstood it make statements-Gota


	

Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said today that he could not understand why the President, the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister and others are interested in a private 'anushashanawa' by Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera.

“Those who have not fathomed the context of the sermon are making various comments. After all, I’m an ordinary person and not someone of importance. I don’t know the reason for issuing so many statements over a private anushashanawa to me at my residence,” Mr. Rajapaksa told journalists outside the FCID.

He said the statements may have been issued against the Anunayake Thera.

“I don’t think this is appropriate. Even the Buddha said the Dhamma should be preached to people who have the capacity and the wisdom to understand it. I of course understood well what the venerable monk said. Those who haven’t understood the meaning are making these statements,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.

When asked about revoking his US citizenship to contest the presidential election, Mr. Rajapaksa said he had not made a decision in this regard.

“Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has not said anything to me about this. If the need arises, it can be done within two months,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
