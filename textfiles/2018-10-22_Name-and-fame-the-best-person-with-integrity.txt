Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) last week revealed the five Idols selected by the panel of judges for Integrity Idol 2018, a first of its kind endeavour in Sri Lanka, which seeks to Name and Fame those in the public service, who go above and beyond the call of duty to serve the nation with integrity.   
Voting for Integrity Idol by SMS is open from Friday, 19 October to 12 noon on Thursday, November 1. Videos of each Integrity Idol are available on www.integrityidol.lk/   

Nominations for Integrity Idol were accepted between 12 June and 31 July 2018, following a press, electronic and social media campaign.   

As at the deadline, TISL had received over 300 nominations proposing 207 individuals from across nearly all 25 Districts in the country. 

A unique feature of Integrity Idol, which has been successfully concluded in several countries including Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria is public engagement, whereby, after the judges select the five idols, the public is provided with an opportunity to vote for their Integrity Idol.   

The title of Winner of Integrity Idol 2018 will be conferred on the Idol with the most votes from the public at the grand finalé.   

The finalé will be held on November 3, 2018, at Stein Studios in Ratmalana, under the auspices of the Chief Guest Deshamanya Dr Radhika Coomaraswamy. 
The panel of judges have retired Deputy Auditor General M.D.A. Harold, retired Supreme Court Justice and former Chairman of CIABOC Ameer Ismail, retired Deputy Auditor General and National Integrity Award winner Lalith Ambanwala, Investigative Journalist Thusitha Pitigala and Civil Activist Maithreyi Rajasingam.   
Following a rigorous selection process and in-person interviews, the judges have selected the following five serving public officials as the Integrity Idols for 2018.
