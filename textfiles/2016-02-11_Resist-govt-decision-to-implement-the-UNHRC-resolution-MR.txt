Resist govt. decision to implement the UNHRC resolution: MR


	

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today called upon Sri Lankans to unite and resist the government’s decision to implement the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.

Issuing a statement, the present Kurunegala District parliamentarian said the war was won by an SLFP government led by him and that it was a matter of profound regret the SLFP has been subordinated to the UNP which tried to sabotage the war effort at every turn.

“When the UNP’s attempts to stop the war by defeating the government at the budget vote in 2007 did not work, they ridiculed the war effort by saying that ‘any ox can fight a war’ and ‘while claiming to be advancing on Alimankada the army was actually moving towards Pamankada’. It is not surprising to see such people now trying to exact revenge from those who won the war,” he said in the statement.

He said the UNP led government accepted the Geneva resolution with the same carelessness with which they entered into the ceasefire agreement with the LTTE in 2002.

“I’m profoundly saddened to see that the SLFP has also joined the UNP in this great betrayal. The UNP may be deriving a great deal of satisfaction by thus getting a section of the SLFP which won the war to underwrite every traitorous they commit,” he said.

He alleged the government has accepted the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) report which said that war crimes had been committed by Sri Lankan armed forces and they have agreed to set up a war crimes tribunal manned by foreign judges to try war heroes for these alleged crimes.

“The OHCHR is already under heavy criticism by the UN Human Rights Council itself. The UNHRC passes every year a resolution calling upon the OHCHR to end the domination of that office by Westerners and to reduce its dependency on their funds. The government has thus agreed to place Sri Lanka under the supervision of an institution that is facing criticism by the UNHRC itself for its Western bias,” he said.
