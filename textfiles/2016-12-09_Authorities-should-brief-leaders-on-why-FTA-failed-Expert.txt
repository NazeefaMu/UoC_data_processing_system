Against the backdrop of high authorities speaking in favour of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), an international trade practitioner said yesterday that the relevant authorities should brief the country’s leadership on the reason for the current and past market access issues, and the trade imbalance under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) already in operation.

Former director general of commerce, P.D. Fernando told Daily Mirror that the Department of Commerce should do it.

He said all the Chambers of Commerce should cast aside their differences and unite to address the issues arising out of the FTA, in order that Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and consumers could benefit from the ECTA.

He said India was trying to narrow its trade gap with other nations, and Sri Lanka should follow suit. (Kelum Bandara)
