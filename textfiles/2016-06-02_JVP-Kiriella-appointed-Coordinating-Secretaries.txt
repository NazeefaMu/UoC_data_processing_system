Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday charged that Minister Lakshman Kiriella had appointed 94 persons as Coordinating Secretaries and 56 as Advisors to the Ministry of Highways.

He said all the 56 Advisors had been appointed in the Kandy District, which is the Minister’s electorate.

He charged that some of them had not passed the GCE Ordinary Level examination.

“Usually a Minister has around 15 persons as a personal staff, however he had appointed 94 as Coordinating Secretaries, we don't understand what kind of work are there,” Mr. Dissanayake added.

He said these incidents had made clear that the Yahapalanaya Government also govern the country in an uncivilized manner, as it was done by the previous regime. (Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
