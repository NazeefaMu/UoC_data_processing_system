Denying parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe’s allegations made to the media that he was a dual citizenship holder, Skills Development Minister Samarasinghe said he did not hold dual citizenship either in Switzerland or in any other country except that of being a citizen of Sri Lanka.

Responding Mr. Samarasinghe said that she had made a false statement on previous occasions as well and during his age of 61 years he didn’t have to obtain citizenship of other countries.

Issuing a press release the Minister said that any ordinary citizen had the right to become a citizen in any other country, however, cannot accept such a move by a public representative or a politician.

“I have served for my country over 30-years. Though I have deserve or capable to hold a dual citizenship, as an honorable politician I didn’t even imagine doing so. We are bound to protect our Constitution. A politician cannot accept any other country’s Constitution and could not pledge his loyalty to that country,” he said.

However, he said that if Ms. Kumarasinghe continued to make such false statements against him and try to tarnish his image, he would resort to legal action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
