A.M.A. Azeezs Agricultural Feat in the East
	
A.M.A. Azeez was born on 4th October 1911 to a traditional elite family of Vannarpannai in Jaffna. He had his childhood and entire schooling in Jaffna. He attended leading Hindu schools and was a brilliant student. He passed away on 24th November 1973.
The legacy of Dr. Azeez, I sometimes think, is like an iceberg. What is visible is miniscule and the profound part is just submerged in history, which has to be carefully extricated through time consuming and methodical research. Quite often, when we revisit the life and times of Dr. Azeez, we remind ourselves of the mature and astute political leadership he practiced as a Senator, his profound contribution for the advancement of the education of Muslims and the active role he played in the upliftment and reform process of Muslim society. He was the first Muslim to be recruited to the very prestigious Ceylon Civil Service of the bygone era.
His speeches in Senate and other speeches are erudite and have all the hallmarks of a visionary, a true statesman and a patriot. His contribution in the field of Muslim education is there for all to see even today. The grandeur of Zahira College and the Ceylon Muslim Scholarship Fund that he founded, continue to invigorate generations of Muslim youth to forge ahead in life and strengthen their role in Sri Lankan society. The YMMA movement he founded has energized the aspirations of many Muslim youth island wide, and this has over the years helped young Muslim men to play an honorable and dignified role in society.
The Dr. A.M.A. Azeez Commemoration Meeting and the Memorial Oration will be held on Tuesday, 28th November 2017 at 4.30 p.m. at the Mahaweli Centre Auditorium, 96, Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, Colombo 7. 
The grandeur of Zahira College and the Ceylon Muslim Scholarship Fund that he founded, continue to invigorate generations of Muslim youth to forge ahead in life and strengthen their role in Sri Lankan society
There is another more profound facet to Dr. Azeezs legacy which is quite often forgotten by many people. This is his outstanding achievement in introducing major agrarian reform in the Eastern Province, which has resulted over the years, in the Ampara district being elevated to the rank of a major rice bowl of Sri Lanka. As the architect of this ground breaking reform, he virtually opened the flood gates for economic prosperity of the people in the region where large numbers of Muslims live.
I was a student at Zahira College during the stewardship of Dr. Azeez. As he was my Principal, I had the rare opportunity of getting to know first hand the fine qualities of this refined gentleman. During my student days I also learned a lot about Dr. Azeezs other accomplishments. I also moved very closely with Ali, the eldest son of Dr. Azeez. Ali has been my dear and close friend for over fifty years starting from our University days.
I discovered this quite accidentally when I was given a part time teaching assignment at the South Eastern University at Oluvil. My long journey by car usually took about 8 to 10 hours. The tail end of my travel was through predominantly Muslim areas like Maruthamunai, Kalmunai, Sainthamaruthu, Sammanthurai, Nintavur, Oluvil and beyond that Addalachenai, Akkaraipattu and Pottuvil.
ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
These vast paddy lands extending over 100,000 hectares, irrigated by the plentiful waters of Senanayake Samudra at Inginiyagala, Ampara, has transformed the Ampara district into a granary of the Eastern Province. These lands are owned almost entirely by Muslims and large scale paddy production has been the source of financial empowerment of this Muslim community.
GENESIS
When the Japanese bombed the port of Colombo and its suburbs on Easter Sunday 5th April 1942, Dr. Azeez held the responsible post of Additional Landing Surveyor, H.M. Customs. The country was placed on a war footing by the Governor. The Southern region of the Batticaloa district was chosen as a key area to boost food production.
I would like to begin my narration of the pioneering efforts of Dr. Azeez by quoting from Jameels article,
Civil Servant Azeez arrived in Kalmunai and assumed duties as Assistant Government Agent on 16th April 1942. It was the period of the Second World War and all foreign supply lines of rice and other foodstuff faced blockades by the Japanese. . The Government of the day had to find ways and means of accelerating local food production .. Azeez was specially selected by Hon. D.S. Senanayake and transferred at short notice with specific orders to produce more food especially rice.
Hon. Senanayake had confessed that he selected a Muslim from the Civil Service, who would have the co-operation of the Muslims and Tamils. What he did not say but had in his mind, was that Dr. Azeez was a Tamil scholar, fluent speaker in Tamil and was well respected by the Tamil community. He went to Kalmunai within ten days and set up the Emergency Kachcheri. 
The land mass brought under Dr. Azeezs jurisdiction was vast, it stretched from Paddiruppu in the north to Kumana in the south, the entire Ampara district. As a dedicated civil servant, Dr. Azeez went into action almost immediately and placed the entire mission on, what can be termed, a war footing. 
Within a month of his arrival at Kalmunai, the new AGA convened a meeting and got into action without wasting precious time. Without even a proper office, this meeting was held at the Kalmunai Rest House. It was a marathon session which lasted almost 10 hours and many decisions were taken without much argument. 
It was resolved and action was immediately initiated to distribute large extents of state land, most of which was barren waste or just jungle, for clearance and cultivation. In the first phase of this operation more than 12,000 acres were distributed to be brought under the plough. As a result only Muslims in the surrounding areas responded to his call and were the first beneficiaries of the land allocation. The Muslim farmers did not let down their benefactor, Dr. Azeez. With a lot of help, both financial, technical and plenty of supervised guidance from the AGA, they toiled hard and gradually brought more barren, jungle and fallow land under the plough. Like the proverbial snowball, this process set in motion the organic expansion of the paddy revolution in the Eastern Province.
It was also resolved at the meeting, that cash grants be made for jungle clearance and land preparation and to release seed paddy for the next cultivation season. Small tanks and irrigation channels which had been abandoned for years, were rehabilitated. The AGA meticulously planned and developed all related critical infra structure to successfully achieve the goal of increased food production.
He also set up goat farms in Nintavur, Thirukovil and Malwatta and poultry farms in Maruthamunai, Sainthamaruthu and Palamunai and provided farmers with financial assistance and technical advice. He also established a model agriculture farm to provide technical knowhow and planting material for all agricultural endeavours in the region.
As pragmatic administrator, a week after this meeting, action commenced on all fronts. Lands were distributed, money was released and a 475 acre model farm with a labour force of 1,000 started taking shape in Nintavur.
Such was the meticulous planning of Dr. Azeez. The newly cultivated paddy fields brought forth bountiful harvests at a time of war when the country was plagued with food shortages. Ampara district had now entered the fast lane in paddy production and had also earned the well deserved reputation of the granary of the East. An overwhelmed Hon. D.S. Senanayake, as the Minister of Agriculture, applauded AGA Azeez on the great achievement and expressed his gratitude for helping to avert starvation and famine in the country.
HARVEST FESTIVAL
To celebrate the successful food production drive AGA Azeez organized a harvest festival at the model farm in 1943. It was the first of its kind anywhere in the country. The chief guest was Hon. D.S. Senanayake. The Minister wanted to showcase the success of his trusted civil servant AGA Azeez and the people of Kalmunai.
 
This was the time of the colonial administration, and the head of government of the country was the British Governor, Sir Andrew Caldecott. Impressed by the performance of AGA Azeez, the Governor sent a personal hand written note to AGA Azeez congratulating him and the farmers of Kalmunai for the rich harvest.
The road map to agrarian prosperity in the Ampara district, resolutely chartered by AGA Azeez, was now firmly in place. A few years later when the Inginiyagala reservoir was commissioned under the Gal Oya scheme, the paddy fields in the Ampara district blossomed beyond expectations when copious quantities of water became available to farming communities. The extent of land under paddy cultivation increased exponentially and this region now produces over 62% of paddy grown in the Eastern Province, with approximately 100,000 Hectares of land under the plough.
The pioneering endeavour and the yeoman service rendered by Dr. Azeez to make all this happen, must remain etched in the annals of history, as one of the finest contributions made by this legendary administrator, to the people of the Ampara district and to the country. An exemplary technocrat Civil Servant, who was deeply committed to his official duties blended with a great love for his country.
(A.I. Marikkar hails from Negombo and was a student at Zahira College during the Azeez era. He graduated from the University of Ceylon in 1965 and was a leading banker in Sri Lanka and overseas. He is an authority and a consultant in Islamic Banking)

A riddle shrouded in mystery
	
Is Astrology a science Part 3
How did ancient astronomers discover distant planets

The discovery of the cylinder seal impression believed to be 6000 years old depicting 11 heavenly bodies revolving around the Sun demonstrates two significant facts: that the ancient Sumerians knew that our planetary system is heliocentric  the Sun is at the centre and all other planets including the earth revolve around it  and they knew about the existence of six more planets in the Solar system in addition to the five planets that could be seen by the naked eye. This means that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the planetary system is heliocentric, something scientifically proved by scientists like Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, the pioneers in modern Astronomy and they also probably knew of the existence of not only distant planets such as Uranus, Pluto and Neptune, but also of the Moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
Astronomy in ancient Vedic civilization
Astronomy had flourished in the ancient Indian Vedic civilization and there is ample evidence to show that the Vedic astronomers knew about nine planets in the Solar system. They also had known that our planetary system is heliocentric. However, they have referred to the Sun and the Moon also as planets among the Navagraha. It could be concluded that the Sun and the Moon have been included among the Navagraha - nine planets as Astronomy had been linked to Indian Astrology from the very outset. The ancients had explored the Solar system  and in fact, the universe in a broader sense for the purpose of studying the influence of heavenly bodies on man and his environment and they had discovered it was the Sun and the Moon of all heavenly bodies that exerted the most influence on the terrestrial phenomena.
Navagraha or nine planets
The remaining seven heavenly bodies included among the Navagraha are Mangala (Mars), Budha (Mercury), Brihaspati (Jupiter), Sukra (Venus), Shani (Saturn), Rahu (North Lunar Node) and Ketu (South Lunar Node). There is a school of thought that the planets that the ancients referred to Rahu and Ketu are really Uranus and Neptune. This means that the existence of Pluto was either not known to them or was overlooked as a planet just as the Earth failed to be included among the Navagraha.
According to scholars, the earliest references to Indian Astronomy come in Rig Veda dated back to 2000 BC. Vedic Astronomy had developed independently while providing data support to the study of Astrology.
Suryasiddhantha, a treatise on Indian Astronomy
The Indian Astronomical work, Suryasiddhantha, a Sanskrit treatise on Indian Astronomy dating back to the 4th century CE describes the rules for calculating the motions of various planets and the Moon relative to various constellations. This work believed to have been revised by Indian astronomer -mathematician Aryabhata (476  550 AD) gives the length of the sidereal year (the duration of the Earths revolution round the Sun) as 365.2563627 days which is only 1.4 seconds longer than the result of the modern scientific calculation of 365.25636305 days.
Why did the ancient Indian astronomers who knew beyond any doubt that the planetary system was heliocentric and the planets were revolving around it did not count the Earth as a Graha Why did they count the Sun as a planet knowing well it was a star
The answers to these two questions lie in the Astronomys linkage to the other branch of Vedic knowledge, namely Astrology that had evolved simultaneously.

## Title: A small line that tells a lot

A small line that tells a lot
	

Marriage or Affection line is very small but it tells a lot about our life.The horizontal line under the little finger and above the Heart line on the Mount of Mercury originating from the percussion is called the line of Marriage, Affection or Love. This line is called the line of Union and the line of Attachment as well.
Two or more lines
There can be two or more Marriage lines on a palm. But one line is always more prominent than the others.
Location says whether you will marry
If these lines appear above the Heart line, the subject would definitely marry. If they appear below the Heart line, the subject would not marry.
If there are two or more lines, the most distinct and the longest one should be considered the Marriage line. The other lines signify attachments or strong love affairs before or after marriage.
Platonic love
When there are several `love lines in a hand where the Mount of Jupiter is prominent, the attachments of the subject are platonic or devoid of sexual attraction. Hence harmless.
In relation to Mount lines
The love lines in a hand with a prominent Mount of Saturn indicate that the subject establishes love contacts with women much senior to him in age. If there such lines, when the Mount of Apollo or Sun is very prominent, the subject makes love contacts with much premeditation. A hand with a prominent Mount of Mercury and several love lines indicates the subject has several mistresses and he fleeces them of their wealth.
Pointer to promiscuity
A subject with love lines and a prominent Mount of Moon would be lascivious and would run after beautiful women. If the Mount of Venus is conspicuously elevated and there are love lines, the subject would have sex with several women.
Nexus between heart line and Love line
The Marriage line has an intimate connection with the Heart line. The subject with a love line more or less touching the Heart line would establish love contacts early in life. If the love lines are distant from the Heart line his love contacts would take place late in life or past the prime of youth.
If the love lines are deep and distinct, the love affairs are very deep. If the lines are weak or faint, love contacts would be weak and transient.
Readers also may note the following well established facts relating to the marriage line.
1. Distinct strong marriage line: A happy and comfortable married life.
2. A strong marriage line in both hands: Married life is a great success.
3. A marriage line that bends downwards to touch the Heart line: Spouse would die early.
4. A line that curves upwards: The subject would not marry.
5. A fork at the start of the line at the percussion: A de facto voluntary separation. (It may not be a legal one).
6. A line terminating at the line of Sun: without cutting it: Marriage with a person very rich or famous.
7. Marriage line turning downwards and proceeding to touch the Head line: The subject would kill the spouse.
8. Sign of an island at the beginning of the line: Marriage takes place after much hardship.
9. An oblique line cutting the marriage line: A married life full of difficulties.
10. A cross at the point where the line bends: Wife would die. unexpectedly
11. More than one island on the line: The subject would remain a bachelor
12. Marriage line meeting the Sun line after moving upwards: Wife would attain a very high position.

Amana Takaful group records 3Q profit of Rs. 128 mn
	
Amana Takaful groups growth and profit momentum continues into the 3rd quarter netting in a pre-tax result of Rs. 128.5 million for the period ending September 2017. This compares with a loss of Rs 96.5 million in the same period last year.
With a modest 7 percent upside on Gross Written Premium (GWP) of Rs. 2.8 billion for the 9 months, the re-structured group has been able to harness a return of Rs. 285 million on its investment assets in a relatively lackluster environment. Amana Takaful PLC, Amana Takaful Life PLC and Amana Takaful Maldives have all positively contributed to this performance.
Steering a delicate balance of Portfolio restructure, a selective underwriting and prudent risk appetite, tight productivity measures together with a robust claims management ethos, the group is better positioned now to meet and exceed stakeholder expectations, says Group Chairman Tyeab Akbarally.
Amana Takaful PLC generated a GWP of Rs.1.32 billion,10 percent ahead over the corresponding period in 2016. The profit before tax out-turn of Rs.46 million compares with a loss of Rs. 111 million in 2016. A better than expected performance of 32 percent on the non-motor classes, medical and micro takaful segments totally mitigated the downside in motor revenue. Claims on account of the recent flood were disbursed on time and in full. Motor loss ratios improved significantly to 58 percent vs. 76 percent a year ago. Performance of the companys new product lines have been exemplary.The combined ratio has improved markedly to 102 percent from 118 percent a year earlier.
Following a conscious decision to re-align its portfolio strategy, Amana Takaful Life PLC, listed onthe CSE in August 2016, more than doubled its profit to Rs. 32 million in the nine months to September, from the previous periods result of Rs. 14 million. On account of phasing out a product line, the total GWP in the nine months is 95 percent of the previous year. However, the long term endowment life plans continue to grow in line with expectations, boosting the Life Fund by 11 percent.
The off-shore operation Amana Takaful Maldives PLC, the only listed entity among industry players in the Maldives Stock Exchange, chugged along steadily with 7 percent growth in GWP, 61 percent upside in profit before tax compared to the previous year, while defending its market share despite the advent of new competition. Hereto, new product lines have delivered promising performance. Productivity measures have mitigated the rise in re-takaful expenditure and an upsurge in claims cost.
Both Amana Takaful PLC and Amana Takaful Maldives PLC emerged winners of the Gold Award for single entity Takaful operators at the recent Islamic Finance Forum for South Asia.

American mercenaries are torturing Saudi elite rounded up by new crown prince
	

Saudi princes and billionaire businessmen arrested in a power grab earlier this month are being strung up by their feet and beaten by American private security contractors, a source in the country tells DailyMail.com.

The group of the countrys most powerful figures were arrested in a crackdown ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), three weeks ago as he ordered the detention of at least 11 fellow princes and hundreds of businessmen and government officials over claims of corruption. DailyMail.com can disclose that the arrests have been followed by interrogations which a source said were being carried out by American mercenaries brought in to work for the 32-year-old crown prince, who is now the kingdoms most powerful figure.
They are beating them, torturing them, slapping them, insulting them. They want to break them down, the source told DailyMail.com.

Blackwater has been named by DailyMail.coms source as the firm involved, and the claim of its presence in Saudi Arabia has also been made on Arabic social media, and by Lebanons president. The source (who asked to remain anonymous) said Prince Mohammed has bypassed the normal security forces in keeping the princes and other billionaires at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh.

- Mrs Soma Wimalasundera
Dearest Amma, 
Three whole months have gone by 
Since you bade us good bye 
Every single of those days 
Youve constantly been on my mind 
Life is strange 
We come, make bonds 
And then when the bonds are strong 
One departs, leaving others astray 
Life wasnt a bed of roses, 
You went through tough times 
But you always rose 
Stronger than before 
So many events flash through my mind 
Too numerous to put to pen and paper 
But each one of those 
Gave me the strength to be who I am. 
It is time to reflect 
All the good times 
And offer thanks 
To a memorable life 
With fond memories

Combatting diseases during the cold season
	

Its quite common for people to contract influenza throughout the year. But there are particular times of the year when there is an increase in the spread of the disease. Influenza spread rises during the months of November, December and January. This is the time of the year when the onset of seasonal influenza commences. So its important that we protect ourselves against it. Dr. Kosala Karunaratna, Consultant Paediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo, addresses the issue of influenza in this weeks issue of Health Capsule. He provides advice on how the public can take precautions to prevent ending up having to sneeze and cough. Influenza is a health issue that can be cured with medication and rest. But when the condition is prolonged and left untreated for a long period of time, influenza can lead to bigger problems.

Blame it on the viruses
Viruses are the causative factor for influenza. There are many types of influenza viruses. The most common are viruses A and B. Type A influenza can give rise to severe complications of the disease. Pneumonia is one such complication. H1N1 and Bird Flu are some examples of influenza due to Type A virus. Patients suffering from other diseases, when fallen prey to influenza, may face complications. Much of the influenza that spreads in the country is caused by Type A viruses. Influenza spreads very easily and rapidly. They can develop into epidemics. The reason for this is that these viruses undergo mutations and evolves easily. Influenza caused by Type B usually doesnt develop into severe complications, explained Dr. Karunaratna. 
Antibiotics are of no use in the treatment of influenza as it is caused by a virus. Antibiotics may even be harmful. Unnecessary use of antibiotics will destroy the bodys good bacteria which form a part of the bodys natural defence system. This leads to a secondary bacterial infection by making way for harmful bacteria that could cause other diseases. For example consider that there is a viral infection in the lungs. The good bacteria provide protection against harmful microbes that enter the body. Antibiotics have no effect against viruses. So when antibiotics are taken meaninglessly, it will adversely affect the bodys natural bacteria. This makes way for more harmful microbes to cause disease in the body, complicating the previous malady. This secondary bacterial infection can be severe, the Paediatrician explained further. 
Being in the extreme of ages both young children and the elderly population can fall victim to influenza and develop complications.
High fever, coughing, runny noses and sore throats are the infamous symptoms of influenza. Dr. Karunaratna stated that general treatment for influenza includes taking your meals on time and paying attention to the quality of nutrition in food. When having fever fluids are easily lost from the body through the skin; and even by sneezing. Dehydration can worsen symptoms. Therefore hydrate the body by constantly drinking water and other fluids. Not exerting yourself and plenty of bed rest will help you feel better, advised Dr. Karunaratna. Influenza can rarely be followed by symptoms like diarrhoea.

Prevention is the best policy
Influenza is a malady that affects the respiratory tract. Pneumonia is the infection of the lungs. Viral influenza can lead to viral pneumonia. When influenza reaches a severe state, antiviral drugs would be prescribed. They are mainly used in treatment in government hospitals under the recommendation of a doctor. Severe cases of influenza where the condition has become complicated calls for tests to confirm the type of influenza virus that has infected the patient. A nasopharyngeal swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate Test will be conducted upon the consultation of a specialist to identify the type of virus behind the infection. Vaccines against influenza and pneumonia are used in the treatment as well, stressed Dr. Karunaratna. 
Influenza is a disease that can be cured if treated on time. Complications are consequential if left untreated. Since this is the season for influenza, you are more likely to be susceptible to the disease. So the best way to avoid all the medical hassle is by taking preventive measures to protect yourself against the disease. As influenza spreads rapidly and easily, attention has to be paid to prevent any way in which the disease can spread. When you sneeze, millions of droplets spread in the air. This can infect other people easily, especially in crowded places. Covering up your nose when sneezing is important to prevent the influenza from spreading. It also spreads through the hands. Therefore hand hygiene is essential. Avoiding crowded areas can help reduce the risk of infection. There are vaccines available to treat influenza as well as pneumonia, Dr. Karunaratna said. He further added that most people are unaware of the availability of vaccines for influenza and pneumonia. Children up to the age of 5 should definitely obtain the pneumococcal vaccine. It is an important yet neglected fact, he accentuated. Other preventive measures include having nutritious meals and maintaining hydration.

If UNP commits faults, people wont approve: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today if allegations were made against him when he was taking decisions against fraud and corruption, he would give up all positions and join the people to take that fight forward.
He told a public meeting in Nikaweratiya that the SLFP candidate was defeated in 2015 because the SLFP government did several mistakes and if people from the UNP did the same mistakes while being in the government, the people will not approve it.
The President said the people elected a new government by changing the earlier corrupt regime so as to introduce a new programme and everyone should get ready to walk on the correct path to let that expectation come true.
While stating that separation is easy and getting together is difficult, he said that it is the responsibility of all to take the country forward by not getting divided by being political infants, but acting as mature and intelligent politicians. He said all should become politicians who love the country and the people and not work for political power and private agendas.
He noted that whatever anyone says, he committed his 50-year political career towards a clean and honest political culture and during that long political trek with experience, he acted with patience and equanimity. He said he was not someone who had come to learn politics.
Although allegations of postponing elections have been made, he said the SLFP wants to go for an election as soon as possible and all commitments have been done in that regard by now.
Stating that the UNP had only 47 seats when the 19th Amendment was passed in Parliament, 142 votes were given by the SLFP led alliance at that time. He said that the SLFP should be strengthened not only to win elections but also to have a good political culture in the country.
While speaking about development programmes and livelihood upliftment projects, the President said the government is spending over Rs. 6 billion a month to provide assistance to people affected by the drought.
Chief Minister of Wayamba Province, Dharmasiri Dassanayake, State Minister Dilan Perera, Deputy Minister Tharanath Basnayake, Chairman of SLFP Youth Front Shantha Bandara, Wayamba Provincial Minister Lakshman Vendaruwa, Mr. Ananda Sarath Kumara, Ananda Jayalath, Kamal Indika and Nilantha Supun Rajapaksha were among those who participated in this function.
The President also vested the newly built laboratory under Langama Pasala  Hondama Pasala (the closest school is the best school) at Rajabima School in Nikaveratiya with students.
Principal of the school B. M. H. Dissanayake presented a souvenir to the President.

Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice president sacked by Mugabe earlier this month, is set to be sworn in as president on Friday.A government source said Mugabe, who is 93, told negotiators he wanted to die in Zimbabwe and had no plans to live in exile.It was very emotional for him and he was forceful about it, said the source, who is not authorized to speak on the details of the negotiated settlement.
For him it was very important that he be guaranteed security to stay in the country...although that will not stop him from traveling abroad when he wants to or has to, the source said.

Unless when you see blood along with the diarrhea, that may be an implication that it is caused by bacteria. It can actually make the diarrhea worse by killing off the good bacteria. So what we give is probiotics. Diarrhea is also a protective mechanism that flushes the system which is why you shouldnt prescribe antibiotics.

Understanding the aspirations of customers and the need of timely endowments, the Bank has realigned the mechanics of Thilina Sayura to position itself as the best reward scheme in the banking segment that values NRFC and RFC accountholders savings whilst indulging significant events with special rewards.
All NRFC, RFC Savings account holders with a minimum balance of US$ 500 or (equivalent in any other designated currency) in savings or fixed deposits NRFC/RFC accounts now have the opportunity to avail the range of benefits offered through the Seylan Rewards scheme.

Likewise, account holders with a balance of over US$50,000 will become entitled for a two nights stay on a full-board basis for two persons.

Recognising early signs to battle Schizophrenia
	

The Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has thus far elaborated on various psychological conditions, sometimes common and not-so-common among people. One such condition is schizophrenia, which is a challenging disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others and function normally.
Speaking to the Health Capsule Dr. Ramani Ratnaweera, Consultant Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, said that schizophrenia happens as a result of increased dopamine in the brain. People have come up with various causes, but this is the biological background to it. As a result of this imbalance, medication has to be given,said Dr. Ratnaweera.
Early warning signs
In some people, signs of schizophrenia would occur suddenly. But for most people, it comes on slowly with subtle warning signs and a gradual decline in functioning long before the first severe episode. Some of the common early warning signs include :

Depression and social withdrawal
	Hostility or suspiciousness and extreme reaction to criticism
	Deterioration of personal hygiene
	Flat, expressionless gaze
	Oversleeping or insomnia, forgetfulness or inability to concentrate
	Odd or irrational statements, strange use of words or way of speaking
Symptoms
There are five symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia. These include:
Delusions - Delusions are extremely common in schizophrenia, occurring in more than 90% of those who have the disorder. Often, these delusions involve illogical or bizarre ideas or fantasies.
	Hallucinations- Hallucinations can involve any of the five senses, auditory hallucinations (e.g. hearing voices or some other sound) are most common in schizophrenia, often occurring when you misinterpret your own inner self-talk as coming from an outside source.
	Disorganised speech- Schizophrenia can cause you to encounter trouble concentrating and maintaining a train of thought, externally manifesting itself in the way that you speak. Common signs include: loose associations, neologisms, perseveration and clang. 
	Disorganised behaviour - Schizophrenia disrupts goal-directed activity, impairing your ability to take care of yourself, your work, and interact with others.
	Negative symptoms  This includes lack of emotional expressions, lack of interest or enthusiasm, seemingly lack of interest in the world and speech difficulties and abnormalities. 
But symptoms would vary from person to person, both in pattern and severity. 
Prevalence in Sri Lanka
According to Dr. Ratnaweera, schizophrenia is prevalent in about 1% of the population in Sri Lanka. I have come across quite a number of people with the symptoms. Its a debilitating illness and early intervention is a must. We have also seen that males have a slightly higher tendency to be diagnosed with this condition than females. This could be in a ratio of 1.4 : 1. This occurs mainly in the early 20s and this is their prime age where they achieve things in life. But with this illness, they will face many challenges as they progress,Dr. Ratnweera continued.
One of the major challenges we see is the stigma attached to mental illnesses in Sri Lanka, Dr. Ratnaweera said. Therefore more than 80% of this group remains indoors because they dont want to face society. If the diagnosis happens at an early stage this condition could be controlled. But if diagnosis doesnt happen on time, you will see social withdrawal as they will find it difficult to have a proper conversation with the other person,she said.
Treatments
Expressing her views on interventions, Dr. Ratnaweera further said that psychosocial intervention is a must. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is also a recommended form of therapy for these people. When done consistently, persistent hallucinations and delusions may somewhat disappear. But lack of insight is a major challenge that we face and by the time we start treating the patient they have reached a certain level of severity. In Sri Lanka, every hospital has a psychiatrist and a medical officer who have been trained. The patients can also attend clinics at the hospitals. In addition to that they could undergo Occupational Therapy where they could be trained in terms of skills development.
Hence a multi-disciplinary approach is needed to control this condition. But the dearth of psychologists and psychiatrists in the country has made us realize that overcoming these challenges will take some time. If we could increase the number of community psychiatrists, they could visit houses and treat patients at their doorstep as done in other countries. But the dearth of professionals stand as a barrier in this approach as well,concluded
Dr. Ratnaweera.

Sudaths third book titled Awrudu Walalla is scheduled to be launched on November 26 (Sunday) at the Buddhist Hall, Moratuwa at 2.30pm. The keynote address will be delivered by poet and lyricist Sri Wijesinghe. 
Its so wonderful and precious when two different fields such as Science and Art combine, said by renowned Indian writer, advocate of nonviolence and human rights Vinoba Bhave.
Poet Sudath Navindra is an ideal example who proved Bhaves statement to be true. Sudath, being a Science teacher at Moratu Maha Vidyayala for many years, is an outstanding poet.
Mentored by accomplished writer and poet, Rathna Sri Wijesinghe, Sudath published two books titled Sanda Pipuna Reya (2012) and Ehela Kinitta (2014). Both books contained collections of poems penned by Sudath on various social facts.

An old student of Nalanda College, Colombo, Sudath had his first experiences in poetry while at school. He regularly contributed poetry to Lankadeepa, Diwaina, Tharuni, Sirikatha and Widusara newspapers.

Later, he was a regular contributor to Ravaya and Randiva newspapers as well. Through his teaching of Science at school and private tuition classes he has brightened many a life. As much as his teaching his services as a poet is also commendable, Sri Wijesinghe says.

Shaping societys thinking on silver age
	

Ageing and death are things that each one of us has to experience, bringing with them their own series of challenges. But if we anticipated these challenges beforehand, and not wait for fate to make decisions for us, we will be able to embrace old age with enthusiasm. This mentality will help reap the fruits of the youths labour. We contacted Dr. Dilhar Samaraweera, Consultant Physician at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and the President of the Sri Lanka Geriatric Association, to obtain advice on how to face the great challenge that silver age presents.

Ageing
Ageing is a lifelong and inevitable process. This includes progressive change in a persons physical, mental as well as social structure, explained Dr. Samaraweera. 
When we see our children growing up and experiencing the challenges of teenage and adulthood, we remember that we passed the same phases. We then realize that we are getting old, he said further describing how we view ageing from the perspective of the society.
Close your eyes for a moment and picture an old person. How did you picture him or her Chances are, the picture at the forefront of your brain was of a frail person, bent, may be holding a walking stick and strikingly not a happy picture. But does this have to be that way Is that how you want to spend your days when you grow old The main problem lies in how our society sees old age, explained Dr. Samaraweera.

The three stages of life
Our society has traditionally divided our lives into three stages. The first stage is from birth up to around twenty years. This is the period which is accepted as the learning, training and education period. At the end of this stage comes a crisis period where you have to face adulthood and all its impending decisions like going up the ladder in life, marriage and etc. This crossover period from first to second period, though a challenge, is a sweet one. You actually look forward to these challenges.
Then the next stage in life, which is from around 20 to 50 years, is considered the most productive stage. A person contributes the most to his society and the family by way of his chosen profession, by raising kids, by holding leadership positions etc. At the end of this period is another transition period, where the challenges of retirement, children building their own nests and old age loom large. But unlike the first crossover, this isnt anticipated because its generally accepted that a persons productive years are now behind him.
The final stage of life, after around 55 years, is traditionally considered a period where a person is too frail to go outside and be a part of society. Unlike in many other cultures, the Sri Lankan culture promotes respect towards the elderly. But this has its own drawbacks. Our older generation is protected too much that they are prohibited from venturing outside the houses for their own protection, underscored the doctor.

Changing norms
But is this the ideal approach that we should take to life According to Dr. Samaraweera, in the modern world, rather than dividing life into specific stages and assigning definitive roles to each age group, life is taken as one big event which includes lifelong learning, working and security. 
Retirement gives a person the freedom to explore the unfulfilled dreams of his or her life. For an example, a doctor who was busy tending to patients will have spare time to learn playing a musical instrument that he always wanted to. A clerk who loved watching stage dramas, but couldnt afford to do so due to family commitment, can use retirement to fulfill his hearts desire, stated the doctor.

Bridging the generation gap
Two terms that are vital when talking about ageing with dignity are Interdependence and Intergenerational solidarity, according to Dr. Samaraweera. Inter dependence is when the older and the younger generations depend on each other, instead of it being a one-way street where the elders are dependent on the young to fulfill their needs. In this concept, the younger generation depends on the elders for wisdom and help in some areas like raising their youngsters, while older generation depends on the younger generation to improve the quality of life.
Inter generation solidarity is where the two generations respect each other and recognize their values. Young people are quick to scorn the older generation for their hana miti adahas or out of date ideas regarding the values, the way they view life etc. On the other hand, the older generation is quick to judge the young for their taste in fashion, music, use of modern technological devices, social media etc. If the two groups understand each other and respect their choices in life, they may be able to live with increased harmony. 
Elderly people value their independence as much as the youth. Therefore its important to let them enjoy life, travel, interact with the society, without restricting them out of fear for their health, explained the doctor. Always remember the fact that you are here because of the choices and the sacrifices the older generation made for you. In addition, remember that you yourself will get there one day, and if we shape the world now to treat the elderly as an important part of the society, giving them the due recognition, you will one day reap the benefits yourself, he concluded.
Lets talk about the specific challenges that the older generation face and how best to face them, in the next weeks issue.

Snaring children in the  sugary drink trap
	
Over the last five years, we have reduced sucrose (added sugar) in MILO Ready-To-Drink (RTD) by 32%. Currently, a MILO RTD pack contains only 8.2 grams of sucrose (added sugar)
There are so many advertisements related to malted drinks featured on television targeting young children
Not only the labelling that contains the sugar level but the advertisement campaign for such products should be regulated in Sri Lanka
The pancreas will fail to cope with the production of insulin as the frequent bouts of sugar intake increases
Sri Lanka should learn from the initiatives taken by other countries to control such issues and put them into better practice
Artificial sweeteners are chemical based compounds. Internationally, there is emerging evidence that artificial sweeteners may cause side effects, including neurological involvements
President Maithripala Sirisena recently targeted Nestles malted, ready to drink product, warning that the company reduce the beverages sugar content from the current 16.5% to less than 5%
Malted and soft drinks with the lip smacking goodness of sugar are often considered popular beverages favoured by many school children and adults alike. Regardless of the various health risks involved with high sugar intake, its a pity to observe how school children are often targeted in a heartless manner by industries promoting soft and malted drinks.
Keeping in line with the need to cut down on the sugar content in such beverages, President Maithripala Sirisena recently targeted Nestles malted, ready to drink product, , warning that the company reduce the beverages sugar content from the current 16.5 percent to less than 5 percent. Explaining his stance on the matter during a walk that was launched recently to mark the World Diabetic Day, the President was reported to have said that he would continue to oppose the product until its sugar level is reduced to meet his recommendation. 
Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, this situation is very much in disarray as such industries are having easy access to schools through lucrative sponsorships
Advertising mafia
Commenting that all malted and sweetened drinks arent suitable for children, Consultant Physician, Diabetologist and Former Head of the Toxicology and National Poisons Information Centre at the National Hospital of Colombo, Dr. Waruna Gunathilake said that such malted and sweetened drinks contain a high energy and calorie value. Stating that most beverages available in the market are concealing the sugar level contained, he said that this has become a major problem leading into the risk of developing high sugar level, high cholesterol and heart diseases in people. Furthermore, he noted that the standard of labelling such products is also not up to the markets expectation.

The issue lies in the fact that although such beverages arent suitable for children, the industry is targeting the young. The best example would be the time-frame during which cartoons are featured for children on the T.V. There are so many advertisements related to malted drinks featured on television targeting young children. This is a very dangerous trend. Comparatively, if you observe other countries, you may notice that such actions arent permitted. Most western countries dont have this practice of targeting young children using such advertisements when there is a break during a cartoon show. This is mainly because it wont help induce the children into consuming the malted products that are deemed unsuitable for them. Not only the labelling that contains the sugar level but the advertisement campaign for such products should be regulated in Sri Lanka, stressed Dr. Gunathilake. 
According to Dr. Gunathilake the second issue thats associated with the malted and sweet beverages industry is the effective business strategy that they employ to market products. He said that the malted drink industry has already invaded the schools including preschools where the younger generation resides during the larger part of the day. This is a deliberate move by the industry targeting young children where trophies, certificates and the Cricketer of the Year are promoted through malted beverage companies. This is a very strategic method through which they enter the countrys education system. In developed countries, such practices arent permitted and dangerous elements are always kept away from children. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, this situation is very much in disarray as such industries are having easy access to schools through lucrative sponsorships, he said.
He added that as a country its quintessential to have a good vision and mission to curb sugar intake. Dr. Gunathilake pointed out that the featuring of the red label alone on sweetened drinks wouldnt be effective for this purpose. This is a very myopic thinking because if we can introduce a red labelling system to cut down on the sugar content, then we should bear in mind that the other avenues leading to high sugar intake should also be curbed successfully. Sri Lanka should learn from the initiatives taken by other countries to control such issues and put them into better practice he added. 
Artificial sweeteners
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Nutrition and Dietetics Specialist Dr. Damayanthi Perera said that according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the direct sugar intake for a day should be below 25 grams for adults and children. Sugar isnt a necessary constituent of the diet. Approximately, a teaspoon of sugar may amount to five grams, said Dr. Perera. Bearing this in mind, she commented that the daily sugar intake of a child or adult, therefore depends on how many packets of sweetened beverages or sweet meats he or she would have consumed within a day. In addition to tea and coffee, if the child consumes other sugary products regularly, it would be difficult to remain within the recommended 25 grams limit. 
People should be warned that consuming artificial sweeteners may not contribute to ones health in the long run
Most of the commercial products available in the market contain a high level of sugar. However, the norm has now shifted from sugar to focusing on artificial sweeteners. For an example, when the Nutrition Month was observed in the country this year, the main focus was on cutting down on the intake of sugar. As a result, there were plenty of advertisements published in newspapers promoting artificial sweeteners as an alternative for sugar. This is obviously not a good trend. Comparatively, consuming sugar in small quantities ensures that the risk is less to ones health. 
Artificial sweeteners are chemical based compounds. Internationally, there is emerging evidence that artificial sweeteners may cause side effects, including neurological involvements. Therefore, cutting down on the sugar intake shouldnt be looked upon as an opportunity to promote artificial sweeteners. People should be warned that consuming artificial sweeteners may not contribute to ones health in the long run Dr. Perera said. 
The traditional jaggery made of treackle and coconut palms and coconut sugar (a novel product) are better alternatives to refined, white (table sugar) and artificial sweeteners. Sri Lanka should explore the commercial production of Coconut sugar she opined. 
Why control the sugar craving
Its a well-known fact that sugar is controlled within the body by the insulin hormone. Therefore, when inquired as to how excess sugar intake could affect ones health, Dr. Gunathilake explained that when an individual is frequently exposed to food and beverages containing high sugar levels, the pancreas which generates insulin will be exhausted with the passage of time. The pancreas will fail to cope with the production of insulin as the frequent bouts of sugar intake increases. This results in the pancreas failing at one point because it doesnt have a reserve for energy to develop more insulin to curb sugar levels. Hence, if an individual has a high sugar intake, the pancreas will fail to function properly thereby lowering the insulin level, eventually leading to diabetes. Also, such sweetened beverages contain fat in addition to sugar. This leaves one with the risk of developing obesity. Thus, it should be noted that a high sugar intake could also lead to obesity in an individual. On the other hand, it should also be noted that weight gain and obesity alone can lead to insulin resistance; meaning that even if the insulin is present in the body, it will not function properly resulting again in the increasing sugar levels in the body, explained Dr. Gunathilake.
 
When the Daily Mirror contacted Nestle on President Sirisenas hard hitting comment and allegation with regard to the sugar content present in the beverage produced by Milo, the company responded with statement stating that it would be subject to changes soon.
Changes in our packaging soon- Nestl
We share public concerns about the health risks associated with consumption of excess sugars. As part of our contributions to public health efforts, we have reduced the content of sugars added in our products over the years and are committed to make further progress in this regard.
Over the last five years, we have reduced sucrose (added sugar) in MILO Ready-To-Drink (RTD) by 32%. Currently, a MILO RTD pack contains only 8.2 grams of sucrose (added sugar). This is less than 5% of the total product and roughly equivalent to two teaspoons of sugar. By our own internal analyses, MILO RTD currently contains one of the lowest levels of sucrose in the local milk-based beverage category
To empower people to make informed choices about what they consume, we have started voluntarily providing clear and transparent nutrition information and labelling on our products. It is an ongoing process as it requires changes in our packaging. This has already been done for our other RTD packs and the process has begun for Milo. We expect MILO RTD with the new packaging to be in the market soon.  
 
Despite the continuous awareness programmes carried out to discourage the consumption of sugar in high quantities, especially in the form of sweetened soft drinks including malted drinks, its a pity to observe how children and adults are continuously being trapped in this venomous cycle. Therefore, its the responsibility of every conscious citizen to either completely abstain or limit the intake of sugary products such as sweetened beverages or sweet meats to ensure a disease-free nation.

Thyroid Problems explained  right on time
	

Are you one of those people who often experiences fatigue and laziness for no reason despite daily sleep requirements are fulfilled Do you find it difficult to tolerate cold like never before, wanting to wear sweaters when everybody else is sweating due to hot weather On the other hand, do you happen to experience increased perspiration, making it pretty much uncomfortable to survive the day Do you get hungry often yet dont gain weight If the answers to any one of these questions is yes you most likely have some symptoms related to Thyroxine.
To discuss more about the common conditions related to impaired quality or quantity of this hormone, we had a discussion with Dr. Vindya Wellala, Medical Registrar, Teaching Hospital, Karapitiya. 

Q What are the two common terms Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism refer to
Well, these are two medical conditions which are caused by the defective secretion of Thyroxine hormone. This hormone is secreted by the Thyroid gland, a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, responsible in producing Thyroid hormones and the hormonal secretion is regulated by the pituitary which is the center of body hormone regulation, situated in the brain.  In fact, when this gland starts working or producing hormones more or less than the normal required amount, it can give rise to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism respectively. This condition results in so many symptoms which need health care. 
It is very important to know the difference between these two terms.

QWhat is Hypothyroidism
This is a common endocrine disorder, occurring as a result of thyroid hormone deficiency and can be categorized into primary, secondary or tertiary (central) depending on the basic pathophysiology. 
Primary hypothyroidism which marks the majority of the cases (95%) is due to an intrinsic defect in the thyroid gland itself. This condition leads to reduced production of thyroid hormones. Secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism occurs due to insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH. This condition is caused by an underlying hypothalamic or pituitary disease. 

QWhat are the major causes for Hypothyroidism
Well, there can be several reasons for this hormone to result in impaired function, but inadequate intake of iodine, autoimmune thyroid disease or Hashimotos disease, drug- induced, following surgical removal of the thyroid gland or various unidentified reasons, top the list. 

QCan this condition be present from birth
Yes of course. Referred to as Congenital hypothyroidism , there is another sub-type of this condition which affects 1 of every 4000 newborns, potentially due to a congenital mal-development of the thyroid gland in the newborn. 
According to Dr. Wellala, screening of newborn babies with a heel prick blood sample is very important as congenital hypothyroidism, which is one of the commonest preventable cause of mental retardation, can be effectively treated with an early diagnosis. 

QHow would an individual with Hypothyroidism present
As far as the signs and symptoms of Hypothyroidism are concerned, most of the affected patients will present with slowed-down physical and mental activity. Some can also be asymptomatic, depending on the severity. 
Major signs and symptoms include, 
Fatigue, lethargy and inactivity 
	Weight gain despite decreased appetite 
	Unusual intolerance to cold 
	Dry skin 
	Hair loss 
	Excessive laziness and sleepiness 
	Muscle or joint pain with or without weakness in the extremities 
	Depression or low mood 
	Emotional liability 
	Mental impairment 
	Forgetfulness and impaired memory, difficulty in concentrating 
	Constipation 
	Menstrual disturbances, subfertility 
	Reduced perspiration 
	Paraesthesia and nerve entrapment syndromes 
	Blurred vision 
	Impaired hearing 
	Fullness in the throat 
	Hoarseness of the voice 
In addition, patients with Hashimotoss thyroiditis will characteristically present with sensation of fullness in the throat, painless or painful enlargement of the thyroid gland, indescribable exhaustion and transient neck pain, sore throat, or both. 
Diagnosis of Hypothyroidism mainly includes a complete history about the signs and symptoms, a thorough physical examination, and various laboratory investigations and imaging techniques, highlighted Dr. Wellala. 
In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, there will be important signs observed during the physical examination which mainly include, high Body Mass Index, slowed speech and movements, dry skin, jaundice, pallor, coarse, brittle, straw-like hair, loss of scalp hair, axillary hair, pubic hair or both, swelling around eyes, relatively large tongue (Macroglossia), decreased systolic blood pressure and increased diastolic blood pressure, reduced heart rate, pericardial effusion, lower limb swelling and difficulty in walking due to ataxia. 

Q In clinical practice how do you confirm if the person has Hypothyroidism
In most patients, Third-generation thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assays are carried out which usually become high, if it is primary hypothyroidism. This is so far the most sensitive screening method for primary hypothyroidism. Additionally, if TSH is found to be low or normal in clinically hypothyroid individuals, we look for pituitary or hypothalamic causes. 
Also Free Thyroxine (T4) or the free Thyroxine index (FTI) are measured. 

QHow do you manage a patient with Hypothyroidism
Well, it solely depends on the underlying cause. In fact, if the condition is due to thyroiditis which is a transient process we can watch and wait or depending on the causes we will offer thyroxin replacement. 
Monotherapy with levothyroxine (LT4) is the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism. In fact, exogenous thyroid hormone is administered in order to replace or increase the endogenous production as single daily dose. According to Dr. Wellala compliance is highly important for the proper improvement of symptoms and routine clinical evaluations as instructed by the clinician and TSH monitoring following the dose stabilization should be carried out. 

QWhat is Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism is a condition which occurs as a result of an increased production of thyroid hormones (T4, T3, or both) from the thyroid gland. 

QWhat are the causes for Hyperthyroidism
There are two major causes of hyperthyroidism which includes, Primary-due to glandular hyper function or central due to increased stimulation of the hormone. 

QHow would patients present when they are affected by this condition
High amounts of T4/ T3/ both can result in an excessively high metabolic rate also known as a hyper-metabolic state where the patients will present with increased heart rate, increased perspiration, elevated blood pressure, tremors, diarrhoea, weight loss despite of increased appetite, difficulty in sleeping, trouble in concentrating, restlessness, hair loss, weakness, heat intolerance and irregular menstrual cycles in women. 
Some patients will have a visible enlargement of the thyroid gland which can spontaneously develop into a goiter, either symmetrical or unilateral. There can also be a protrusion or bulging of the eyes and redness resulting in a staring look which is known as exophthalmos, a sign of Graves disease.

QIs this condition fatal
Well, undiagnosed Hyperthyroidism can result in a cardiac arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation which can lead towards a stroke or congestive heart failure.

QHow will I be diagnosed
The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is mainly made through clinical findings mentioned above revealed by a proper history, physical examination, bio-chemical alterations identified with laboratory investigations such as TSH levels, T3 and T4 levels. 
In fact an abnormally low TSH might be the first evidence of hyperthyroidism. 

QWill I need a surgery to recover
Surgery which involves the complete or partial removal of the gland is indicated in cases which do not respond to medical treatments or due to cosmetic reasons. Initially we try a trial of Anti-thyroid medications (Carbimazole, Methimazole , Propylthiouracil) or Radioactive iodine (destroys cells which produce an undue amount of hormones) to see if the patient responds to non-invasive modalities of therapy. 
In most patients, Beta-blockers (Propranolol) and Vitamin D supplements are also used. 
According to Dr. Wellala, the main out-look of Hyperthyroidism depends on the primary cause. Some causes can disappear with proper medications while underlying conditions like Graves disease can result in various negative consequences. 

Take home message
An increased weight despite of a poor appetite is a characteristic feature of Hypothyroidism while loss of weight despite of an increased appetite is a characteristic feature of Hyperthyroidism. 
Cold intolerance is unique to Hypothyroidism and in contrast to that heat intolerance is seen only in patients with hyperthyroidism. 
As far as the diagnostic investigations are considered, bio-chemical markers such TSH, T3 and T4 levels will also give different result which will differentiate these two conditions from each other.
T3 and T4 levels will reduced in Hypothyroidism where as they will be slightly elevated in Hyperthyroidism. 
Levothyroxine marks the hall mark therapy for Hypothyroidism.

What you should know  about  dehydration
	

In this day and age due to climate change and global warming, we often experience very hot weather when the rainy season is over. The busy lives people lead at present make them forget to have a regular intake of water. This can cause dehydration. According to Prof. Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, Dehydration happens when the amount of fluids required by the body to maintain normal functions are inadequate. When not addressed it can even result in death.

 
How does it happen
Speaking of how dehydration can be present Prof. de Silva said, Dehydration can happen in two basic ways, either the intake of liquids is inadequate or the loss of it is too much. When considering instances of inadequate intake, this can happen; when the patient is fasting or the patient is not taking enough fluids when training or is in the desert where there is no source of water or liquids. Secondly it could be due to the increase in loss, for instance, when you have long vomiting or diarrhea. Then you can get dehydrated. The other thing is when you have more than 70% burns (which is a rare scenario). This condition makes you lose fluids from your skin. When you experience excessive sweating you lose lots of fluids. Heatstroke and dehydration can go hand in hand, especially when youre contesting a marathon or engaged in an outdoor activity in the hot sun,he explained.

Signs, symptoms and complications
Citing the signs and symptoms that come with dehydration Prof. de Silva explained that they can vary according to the degree of dehydration the patient is in. Initially the patient will feel dizzy, will feel weak, will experience nausea, when putting the tongue out it will be dry and there will be headaches. It all depends on the degree of illness which may range from mild to severe, he said. 
Prof. de Silva further explained the complications that can occur with dehydration. When you are in the severe stages you can sometimes get heart arrhythmias which is when there is a difference in the heartbeat, you can get confused, fall into a coma or you can even die, he affirmed.
Explaining what can happen to your body when you are dehydrated he said, When there is dehydration, the cells will start to shrink, including the brain cells (depending on the degree of dehydration). It can even result in death. For instance cholera, which we dont see much of now, patients with this condition die due to severe diarrhea. And if you cant give IV fluids, you get dehydrated and you die, Prof. de Silva said.

Who is at risk
Speaking of who is at risk of getting dehydrated Prof. de Silva said, Generally it is the two extremes of age, very young infants (children who cant communicate) and the elderly because of similar reasons. And people who are engaged in outdoor activities such as farming, athletes, soldiers. They are at high risk. Therefore, you can say that it depends on your age and your profession, he further explained.
Speaking on the illnesses that cause dehydration he said, Cholera is an extreme example of an illness causing severe dehydration and death. In such an illness there are watery stools and absolute severe diarrhea. Anything that causes vomiting and diarrhea can bring about dehydration, the professor said.
He further explained that there are certain medications that can cause dehydration, If you take diabetic pills or water tablets then you pass an excessive amount of urine, hence you can get dehydrated, he said.

Treatment
Prof. de Silva continued to speak about the treatment for dehydration and said, The treatment is that the patient should take fluids. If the patient cant take fluids then you will have to give it to him/her through an IV. It really depends on how the patient is losing the fluids. If he/she is vomiting you lose water and electrolytes, so instead of pure water sometimes you may have to give something like jeevani and thambili, to replace the fluids. Water can also be used. But to chose the treatment option you must look into the cause of the dehydration first, he explained. Prof. de Silva further advised people to drink water regularly especially before engaging in outdoor activities that can cause excessive amounts of sweating.

Won't damage Ram Sethu which links SL: India
	
The Indian government has decided not to go ahead with the original alignment of Sethusamudram Shipping Canal project or any other alignment that damages the Ram Sethu or Adam's Bridge which loosely connects Sri Lanka.
The Times of India yesterday said the decision had been taken keeping with the governments political objectives while also addressing environmental concerns.
The canal was proposed by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), more particularly by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) that held charge of the shipping portfolio, and was vigorously opposed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the grounds that this will harm the Ram Sethu associated with Lord Ram's passage to Sri Lanka.
Environmentally, the project was criticised for endangering the fragile marine bio-diversity of the waters separating Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka.
Advocacy of the Ram Sethu meshes with BJP's attempts to create a Hindutva vote in Tamil Nadu and Kerala while appealing to local tradition.
The decision to file a fresh affidavit in the Supreme Court making this stand clear was taken by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday during his meeting with a few Cabinet colleagues, sources said.
"The shipping ministry will now put a detailed proposal for approval of the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) to file a fresh affidavit. Once the affidavit is approved, it will be submitted in the Supreme Court," a source said.
Shipping minister Nitin Gadkari has said in 2014 that the "sacred structure associated with Lord Ram" won't be damaged at any cost and his ministry was exploring other options.
"Very soon I will get the Namo Govt to say in SC that they will not touch Ram Sethu and will make it a National Heritage Monument," BJP law maker Subramanian Swamy has tweeted a few hours after the government decided to file fresh affidavit. Swamy is one of the petitioners.
Indian Government officials said the new affidavit would suggest alternative routes for developing the channel so that the Ram Sethu is not touched.
UPA had courted a major controversy after it had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that there was no proof of Ram Sethu being a place of worship. Later it was withdrawn.

Yemen blockade remains, Egeland calls it collective punishment
	

REUTERS, 23rd NOVEMBER, 2017-The Saudi-led coalitions blockade of Yemen, which has cut off food imports to a population where 7 million people are on the brink of famine, is illegal collective punishment of civilians, a prominent aid official said on Thursday.
Major agencies said aid was still blocked a day after the Saudi-led military coalition said it would let humanitarian supplies in.
The U.S.-backed coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen said on Wednesday it would allow aid in through the port of Hodeidah, as well as U.N. flights to the capital Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country.
We have not yet had any movement as of now, said Jens Laerke, spokesman of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance.
Jan Egeland, a former U.N. aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council, said of the blockade: In my view this is illegal collective punishment.
