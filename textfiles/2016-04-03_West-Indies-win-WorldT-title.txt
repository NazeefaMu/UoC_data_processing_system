West Indies beat England by four wickets to win the World T20 2016 at Eden Gardens Kolkata, a short while ago.


England scored 155/9 in their 20 overs, before the West Indies chased the total down in the last over, with two balls to spare.


West Indies required 19 off the last over, and four sixes off the first four balls by Carlos Brathwaite took the Windies to victory.


They became the first team to win two WorldT20 titles.
