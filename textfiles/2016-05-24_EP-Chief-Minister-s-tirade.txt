Defence Ministry Secretary Karunasena Hettiarchchi said today he had not received any complaints about an incident where Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahamed was alleged to have rebuked a naval officer at an event at the Sampur Maha Vidyalaya on Friday.

A video showing the Chief Minister allegedly scolding a naval officer at the opening ceremony of the Science Lab and Computer Unit of the Sampur Maha Vidyalaya over a ‘protocol’ issue had gone viral.

Mr. Hettiarchchi said he viewed the video and would inquire into the incident if there was any complaint.

Reportedly, the compère at the ceremony had invited Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando, who was the Chief Guest and US Ambassador Atul Keshap to the stage to distribute books to the students.

Media personnel had gathered round the stage while the Chief Minister had made his way to the stage. When the compère had told media personnel to make way for the students, the Chief Minister had mistakenly thought he was being left out and broke out in a tirade saying,

"Get out from here idiot. If you don’t know what protocol is, just get out. Who the hell are you to stop me? Even you, Governor don’t know what the protocol is. I respect the Excellency the Ambassador much more. You should know Governor, you should know the protocol," he was heard saying. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
