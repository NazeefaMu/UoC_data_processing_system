In the fourth edition of Resort Wear, CFW will showcase the iconic Galle Fort as a must-visit tourist destination of immense historical, archaeological and architectural value. Built in the 16th Century, the Galle Fort served as an important sea port to Portuguese, Dutch and British settlers in the pre-Independence era. Today, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Galle Fort is an icon of Sri Lanka's rich history and home to a colourful and diverse community as well as a myriad restaurants, cafés, museums, art galleries, boutique hotels and retail shops.
CFW introduces for the first time this season, CFW Retail Walk, an enthralling shopping experience for those who are visiting and are based in the city of Galle during the week of CFW Resort 2016. Select stores within the Galle Fort will have attractive promotions and offers. Each store will wave flags for passers-by to recognise their participation in the programme.
