A Cabinet proposal was submitted today seeking approval to absorb 980 medical students of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), after evaluating their basic qualifications, Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

Minister Rajapakshe told the Daily Mirror that they had reached this decision following consultations with President Maithripala Sirisena.

He said accordingly, the basic qualifications of all SAITM students would be evaluated and only those students eligible would be permitted to complete their medical degree at the KDU.

“We have submitted the Cabinet proposal and it will be implemented upon Cabinet approval. The proposal will be taken up at next week’s Cabinet session,” he said.

While referring to the controversial proposed Kotelawala National Defence University (KNDU) Bill, Minister Rajapakshe said the KNDU Bill had no impact on the Cabinet proposal submitted. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
