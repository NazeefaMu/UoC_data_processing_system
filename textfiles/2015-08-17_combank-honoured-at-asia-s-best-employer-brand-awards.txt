Commercial Bank’s status as one of the best employers and HR practitioners in Sri Lanka was reaffirmed recently with two international awards at the 6th Asia Best Employer Brand Awards in Singapore.
The Bank received the award for Asia’s Best Employer Brand and the award for Talent Management at this gala event hosted by the Employer Branding Institute in association with the World HRD Congress and the Stars of the Industry Group, with endorsement from the Asian Confederation of Businesses. 
The Best Employer Brand Awards event was one of the highlights of the annual World Brand Congress organised by the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Asia Council, at Pan Pacific, Marina Square, Singapore.
The awards were accepted on behalf of Commercial Bank by the Bank’s Deputy General Manager Human Resources, Isuru Tillakawardana.
Congratulating the Bank’s HR Team for winning these significant accolades, Commercial Bank’s Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said: “Our position as the largest and most stable private bank in Sri Lanka could not have been achieved and maintained without a highly professional and passionate work force. Attracting, retaining and managing the best talent are therefore crucial to our success, and these awards reflect the efforts of our human resources team in these areas.”
As a policy, Commercial Bank places emphasis on the development and grooming of its employees to rise to senior positions in core operational areas, ensuring long term career progression. The Bank has its own Staff Development Centre (SDC) which engages in-house talent and external resource persons to provide continuous training to staff as all levels, empowering employees to achieve their career aspirations and advancement. Many members of the senior management of the Bank joined as school leavers or management trainees and have built their careers at Commercial Bank.
In 2014, Commercial Bank won two awards from the CMO Asia Council, the award for ‘Support and Improvement in Quality of Education’ and a Merit Certificate for ‘Concern for Health’ at Asia’s Best CSR Practices Awards also presented in Singapore.
