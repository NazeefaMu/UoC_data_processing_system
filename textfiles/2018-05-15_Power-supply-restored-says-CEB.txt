The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said that it had restored the power interruption in the Colombo area a short while ago.

Energy Ministry Secretary Dr Suren Batagoda said as he was informed by the CEB engineers, it was identified by them as a software malfunction.

However, after five hours, the power was restored in the Pannipitiya, Dehiwela, Sri Jayewardenepura and Ratmalana areas.

Power was interrupted in Pannipitiya, Dehiwela, Sri Jayewardenepura and Ratmalana this morning due to the tripping of Pannipitiya - Biyagama 220 kV transmission line at about 7.20 a.m.
