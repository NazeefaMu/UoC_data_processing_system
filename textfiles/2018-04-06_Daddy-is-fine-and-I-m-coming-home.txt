‘Daddy is fine and I’m coming home’


	

Poisoned Russian spy’s daughter

Yulia Skripal (who was poisoned along with her ex-spy father) has spoken for the first time since she was attacked with nerve gas as she revealed her ‘daddy is fine’ and that she will be able to leave hospital within days.  


The 33-year-old said ‘her strength is growing daily’ and thanked the people of Salisbury for helping her and her father, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66.  
The attack left the Skripals in a critical condition, but it was revealed last week that Yulia was getting better, while her father was still in a critical but stable condition.  
Her statement was released during a press conference by ambassador Alexander Yakovenko, in which he repeated Moscow’s denial of responsibility for the attack.   
Mr Yakovenko said Russia had not produced the Novichok nerve agent, adding there was ‘a lot of suspicion about Britain’ over a string of deaths of Russians in the UK.  Today’s development could prove key to the investigation into the attack, as Yulia could soon be able to tell police about the moments before they collapsed in a park.  

 


I hope that you’ll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence



In her first statement since coming out of a coma, Yulia said: ‘I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily.  


‘I hope that you’ll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence.’  


It comes after Mr Skripal’s niece Viktoria revealed that she had received a phone call from Yulia at 10.30am this morning.
