Speaking about the product, Sheahan Daniel, Head of Branches, Nations Trust Bank said that, “Everyone dreams of a bright, secure future and the only definite way to achieve such a dream is to take definitive action by saving and investing in something that will give you a satisfactory, preferably guaranteed, rate of return. In addition to this, it’s important to ensure that your money is safely invested. As Nations Trust Bank is one of Sri Lanka’s trusted banking services provider, the security of your investment will never be a concern. Many people also save and invest to ensure that their families will be provided for in the event of their inability to do so in the future. With the generous, free life insurance covers that come with Nations Personal Investment Plan, that part is also taken care of.”
