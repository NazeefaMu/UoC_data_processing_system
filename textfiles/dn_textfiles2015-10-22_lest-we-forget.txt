Lest We Forget

War Pilgrimage: Gallery of Memorials
The painterly blue of the infamous Elephant Pass sky, emboldened with the raffish whites of the flagellating mushroom clouds, augur a fragile truce with the larger than life war monument below, penetrating the aerosphere. It is a muddy bronze country, the shape of Sri Lanka, a teardrop cloaked in the idiom of conquest and ideology atop a three tiered green atoll. The first tier being occupied by the four mute lions doing their solitary penance in dogmatic poise while the second tier has the sombre embrace of the open petals of four lotuses harking back to the country's great kings and the third tier with hands upholding this structure of pride.
Multifarious war memorials
Adding to the monotonous prosody of pathos is another monument further along with its splintered wall shattered by the golden bullet piercing its grey epidermis and the lively vigil of the two soldiers hovering about on one side.
The elephant has truly come to pass. These are just glimpses of the multifarious war memorials stretching across the blitzed entirety of Elephant Pass only a short drive from the hustle and bustle of Jaffna town and yet a life time away from the civilised world.
From wall sculptures showing members of the army, full of brazen machismo in jubilation with all their accumulated braggadocio on display, to wall etchings with darker overtones and undertones, like the one of prancing and stealthily skulking soldiers with their guns pointed like bayonets and muskets at a bloated hag and a burling hulk of a woman, her skull dressed with a magistrate's wig, holding a soldier's hand and a mother clutching her child tightly to her breast while a wounded man is being carried on a stretcher to his grave.
Proceed to the spikey, barbed wire riddled war machines, lying sloth like in permanent hibernation, sitting next to weather-beaten camouflage jeeps, which are alleged to have carried senior high ranking terrorist officials, but now a heap of rusting bicycle wheels with spokes and the odd flower pot signifying the white romance that is war, at least for some.
There are several tributes to fallen heroes whose legendary bad luck is immortalised on billboards and hoardings while dame victory chooses its victors out of the usual suspects, conveniently forgetting history, something made very evident by the plaque that piques with its omission of certain general names - an honest mistake one supposes.
"The Road to Elephant Pass is indeed a place that incurs in the viewer a series of visitations in the form of futile philosophical questions all revolving around that much maligned three-letter word - war, Asia's longest one at three decades."
If one does indeed think of wandering off the beaten path let it be a reminder that a humanitarian demining project is still underway in Elephant Pass and all along the roads that until 2009 were the scene of horrific fighting.
The signs, eerily symbolized by the familiar skull and cross bones set against blood red, prove that the war's roots run deep and peace is certainly not to be found in this topsoil.
After all when does a landmine know a war is over? And with the heavy rains moving them from one place to the next it is a never-ending job for the demining crews and the danger for farmers or people returning to their land is not to be underestimated.
Resort of negation
A cantankerous plateau once filled with the epochal dead lying in civility sharing their mass graves - now a site of war tourism filled with happy chatty peacetime tourists whose only war is fashion. War is indeed a fashion - a resort of negation.

Like the concentration camps in Germany, the Cuchi tunnels in Vietnam, it is clear that Elephant Pass, Mullaitivu and Killinochichi will join the ranks of war tourist attractions that bring millions of people to places where crimes against humanity are never really brought to trial.
Here, war artists have made their mark in bronze on the landscape and soldiers recount the terrifying last days against a drum roll and the Sri Lankan flag is raised on arrival. Amzar my youngest asked "why are they shooting at a mother and child?"

And it is this and many other questions that will be asked as the people of the area rebuild their homes and tourists turn up by the bus load to explore this extraordinary lunar like landscape, with its gallery of memorials scattered across an area, where elephants once roamed, until they too were obliterated in their thousands, and where life was once rich in every sense of the word.
