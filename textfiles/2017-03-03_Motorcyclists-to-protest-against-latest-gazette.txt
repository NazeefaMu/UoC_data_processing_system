The Ceylon Motorcyclists Association (CMA) today said they would organize a major protest rally at the Galle face green on Sunday against the gazette issued making it compulsory for motorbike riders and pillion riders to wear protective helmets which do not conceal any part of the wearer's face.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, CMA Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe said around 5,000 motorcyclists are expected to attend the rally.

“Facebook fans and members of other bike clubs have also confirmed their participation,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
