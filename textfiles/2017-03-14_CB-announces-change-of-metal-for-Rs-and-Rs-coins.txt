The Central Bank yesterday said a new set of Rs.1 and Rs.5 coins would be issued for circulation after changing the metal/alloy from brass-plated steel (gold colour) to stainless steel (silver colour).

The edge lettering of the Rs.5 coin has been removed in the new stainless steel coin.

All other specifications including dimensions and designs of the said coins remain the same as of Rs.1 coin and Rs.5 coin that have been issued since 2005.“The said new coins will be legal tender in Sri Lanka for payments and will be a liability of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka while in circulation,” the bank said.
