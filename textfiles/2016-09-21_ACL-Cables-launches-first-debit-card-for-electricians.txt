ACL Cables together with Commercial Bank recently launched the first ever cobranded debit card for electricians.


As an industry mover, ACL Cables has taken the initiative and commenced this innovative project on such a scale to help tradespeople such as electricians in the country, facilitating their day to day cash transactions with ease. 


This novel concept introduced by the company will benefit all registered electricians under ACL Cables PLC island-wide.


ACL Cables is the first company in the industry to launch a debit card of this form. Access to the debit card will help strengthen the standards of electricians in the building and materials industry, providing them a flexible, simple to use and totally secure transaction method.
Through the launch of the debit card, ACL Cables PLC has enabled card payments for this segment, addressing the restriction of having to pay only with cash and providing the option for these tradespeople to pay by card thus greatly enhancing the manner in which they conduct their day to day transactions.Commenting on this milestone, Suren Madanayake, Managing Director, ACL Cables PLC said, “We always have been the trendsetter in the industry where all others begin to follow us. As the No. 1 cable manufacturer in Sri Lanka we continuously strive to uplift the living standards of our stakeholders. This novel project is part of our mission.” 


He further noted, “Electricians are a vital group of partners connected with us. They have been a loyal stakeholder segment throughout using and recommending our wide and high in quality product range providing customers with wiring and electrical solutions. Therefore we wanted to take an initiative to uplift their standards in terms of transacting and bring them up the tier. We firmly believe our partnership with Commercial Bank and introducing a debit card would facilitate easier banking access for this segment.” 


ACL Cables holds a market share of 70 percent as a group whilst marketing a wide range of products including, electrical wiring (for households and construction projects), switches, sockets, trip switches, breakers, ceiling fans etc., with quality unmatched by any other manufacturer in the industry.
