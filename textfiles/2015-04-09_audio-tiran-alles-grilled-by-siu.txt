MP Tiran Alles, who was grilled by the Police Special Investigation Unit for about two hours, told media that Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka was behind all this carefully planned mudslinging effort in order to tarnish his political image.
 
He added that following the resignation of MP Udaya Gammanpila from the JHU, Mr. Ranawaka had sworn to teach the former an unforgettable lesson and questioned whether this was the best he could do.
