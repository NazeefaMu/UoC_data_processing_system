Not paying guaranteed price for tea
Dullas queries government

UPFA Matara District MP Dullas Alahapperuma has asked the government to explain as to why it has failed to implement the guaranteed price of Rs. 80 per kilo for raw tea buds as stated in the last election manifesto.
The question of MP is pasted on the order paper scheduled to be taken up on November 3 in Parliament.
"Tea smallholders have specially been faced with a severe economic crisis since the tea industry of Sri Lanka has moved towards a serious crisis due to rapid fall in prices of tea buds," the MP said.
MP Alahapperuma said the price paid at present for a kilogram of raw tea buds has dropped to Rs. 54 and all factories are facing risk of having to close down if the price paid per kilogram of raw buds decreases to Rs. 50. Yet it was stated in the last election manifesto that a guaranteed price of Rs.80 per kilo would be paid for raw tea buds.
Alahapperuma also questioned the Plantations Minister whether he could table a report on the tea factories that have been closed down during the past month due to this crisis.
He further inquired the factors that have caused and are even at the moment causing a danger to the tea industry in this manner.
The MP has also asked the measures intended to be adopted to protect tea estate owners, factory owners and millions of people who are engaged in the tea industry.
The government will respond to the query next Tuesday.
