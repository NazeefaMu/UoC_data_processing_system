SLC suspends work on indoor net projects

Sri Lanka Cricket has temporarily suspended construction of the indoor nets projects at R. Premadasa Stadium, Pallekele and Dambulla due to SLC not obtaining approvals from the relevant authorities.
The newly elected Executive Committee headed by Thilanga Sumathipala has decided to re-assess the projects based on the high cost involved in construction (Rs.248 million) and the space allocation at the respective venues, states an SLC media release.
SLC will get the proper approvals from the relevant authorities and proceed with the work on the said projects on a priority basis.
Central Engineering Consulting Bureau (CECB) has been advised to present the progress of construction carried out at R. Premadasa Stadium and a new cost estimate for the said project.
The ExCo will study the new proposal from CECB and decide on the way forward which should not be too much of a strain on the finances of SLC.
