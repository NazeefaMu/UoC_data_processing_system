Kaushal Silva’s head injury is not life-threatening, according to Prof. Arjuna P. de Silva, one of the treating experts.

Speaking exclusively last evening, Prof. de Silva said, “Luckily it was not a very serious injury. on, the delay in bringing him to Colombo would not have made much of a difference”.

“No surgery is required. He is not on medication but just under observation,” the Prof. added.  Silva was airlifted to Colombo after a head injury during training at the Pallekele Stadium on Sunday.

Sanath Jayasuriya, who was appointed as the chief national selector last week, requested the permission of Mohan de Silva, the SLC board secretary, to airlift the patient.  “Our president (Thilanga Sumathipala) is not in the country and the secretary readily accepted my request to seek Airforce services to bring Kausal to Colombo”, Jayasuriya said.

“It was not an issue. I was happy to assist the player”, Air Marshal Gagan Bulathsinghala said. (Bipin Dani)
