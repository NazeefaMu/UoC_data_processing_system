Coming events cast a shadow


	



 

Purohita Diga from the estate domain took the initiative to set up a housing scheme for estate workers in the gem-rich district. 

 


Given the general polls round the corner, the Green party madam raised to top team status, took great pains to turn the opening of the housing scheme into a grand event. She got her followers to put up pandals and festoon the area to turn it gay and colourful for the occasion. 


However, the organizers had failed to send an invitation on time to the Diyawanna member ruling the roost in the area. On receiving an invitation to the event only at the eleventh hour, an affronted Diyawanna member had returned it to the organizers and on the day of the opening ceremony, got his faithfuls to turn away those arriving for the event. On hearing that Purohita Diga and those accompanying him were prevented from attending the proposed venue of the ceremony, the Green madam too kept away in case her arrival could lead to an ugly situation.


By the way, the Diyawanna member who prevented the event from taking place is reportedly planning to open the housing scheme himself shortly.


The rivalry over ‘manape’ is the root cause for this incident, they say.
