UNP to appoint CEO to oversee 'Sirikotha'


	

The United National Party (UNP) is set to appoint a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to look after the affairs of its headquarters, Sirikotha, party sources said yesterday.

Sources said the main objective behind the creation of this post is to see that Sirikotha is run effectively and efficiently. “One of the main functions of the CEO would be to assist the General Secretary of the party in running the headquarters,” sources said.

Sources added that the appointment of a CEO was one of the main recommendations made by the Ruwan Wijewardene committee which was formed to look into the reorganization of the UNP.

The post of CEO of the party is expected to be a full-time post, therefore ministers and MPs will be prevented from taking up the position, according to these sources.

Meanwhile, several UNP back-benches are also expected to be given positions within the party. (Yohan Perera)
