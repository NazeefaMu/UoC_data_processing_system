The 16-member Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) group that broke away from the government called on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today and pledged to cooperate with the joint opposition in the future political matters.

MP Dayasiri Jayasekara told Daily Mirror that he and his colleagues had expressed their willingness to work to bridge the gap between President Maithripala Sirisena and the joint opposition.

However, he said the SLFP breakaway group would function as a separate entity inside and outside Parliament. "We will cooperate with the joint opposition when it comes to political activities. It does not mean that we will join them," he said. (Kelum Bandara)
