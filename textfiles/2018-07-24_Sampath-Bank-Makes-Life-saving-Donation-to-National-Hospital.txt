Reaffirming its commitment to give back to society, Sampath Bankrecently donated a critically needed ventilator to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. The donation was made as part of their ‘Hope for a Life’ initiative and marks the second phase in a series of planned strategic activities .The aim of the initiative is to provide some relief to the overburdened public healthcare system in Sri Lanka.

“We are delighted to have Sampath Bank reiterate its commitment to public health and well-being with this lifesaving donation,” said Dr. Himashi Kularatne, Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon, National Hospital. “These machines are invaluable in saving patient lives and we were in need of one for some time. Understanding our need and the great positive effect it would have on patient care, Sampath Bank stepped in to endow the National Hospital with a ventilator. We are thankful to them and their continued dedication to bettering the life of every Sri Lankan.”

Ventilators assist people with breathing when they are unable to do so themselves which in the ICU can be a life or death situation.

“We are proud to be able to make this donation to the National Hospital and know that it will enhance their ability to save and care for lives. As a national bank our responsibility is to the people and we believe that our continuing partnership with the National Hospital has greatly benefited the people of Sri Lanka,” said Aruna Jayasekera, Group Chief Human Resource Officer, Sampath Bank PLC.“Through our ‘Hope for a Life’ initiative we continue to look for ways to elevate the standards of Sri Lanka’s health sector and address some of its most critical issues.”

As part of the ‘Hope for a Life’ initiative Sampath Bank had previously donated a fully-fledged Neuro Navigation System to the National Hospital at a cost of Rs. 49.7 million. This was the first such system donated to a Government hospital by the private sector. It helps neuro surgeons to view the interiors of the brain accurately and identify the precise locations where nerve related surgeries should be performed. It also makes the surgery faster and less complicated.

The Bank had also undertaken a landscaping project at the National Hospital with the aim of increasing the mental wellbeing of patients. Trees and flora were planted over an acre of land thus revamping the look and feel of the hospital. This is expected to provide patients with a sense of calm during their time at the hospital. In addition, Sampath Bank also installed an ATM at the entrance of the Emergency Unit to provide medical staff, patients and visitors with access to banking facilities thereby providing them with greater convenience and reducing any added stress.

Established in 1987 Sampath Bank has become a state-of-the-art financial institution that continues to be a market leader today thanks to their constant innovation and customer focused approach to business. Their unique tailor-made solutions, superior services and convenience of access have allowed Sampath Bank to further differentiate themselves from the competition and make them the bank of choice for many in Sri Lanka.
