Unofficial fines fund the evening party!


	

There is a khaki boss at Alawpura who has hit upon a convenient means of raising adequate funding for their regular evening party at which they would empty several bottles of high-quality liquor.




He would post one or two faithful subordinates at the railway level crossing from morning hours who would collect a sizable amount of money from ‘errant’ motorbike and vehicle drivers by the time they go off duty in the afternoon. Drivers who are unable to produce some vital document or other for inspection happily offer a santhosham rather than paying a fine, they say.
