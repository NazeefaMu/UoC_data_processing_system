The government has decided to ban touting for transport, currency exchange and loading services at the arrival lobby and in the porch area of the Bandaranaike International Airport due to many difficulties being caused to passengers as well as Airport and Aviation Services officials.

Speaking at a Cabinet media briefing, co-spokesman Gayantha Karunatileke said today that a proposal had been made by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, to amend Civil Aviation Act No. 14 of 2010, to stop the touting, as the prevailing law was insufficient.
