They are to function as an independent group


	



 

The Cabal of 16 now set to sit in the opposition held a decisive powwow in the Gentlemen’s Game House the other day.  While discussing their political future, they considered the question of teaming up with Pohottuwa.

 


During the lengthy discourse that ensued most of them shared the view that though they could maintain cordial relations with the former strongman, they were doubtful whether they could be comfortable in Pohottuwa given the sway being held over the party by a certain character pursuing his own personal agenda.  So, they finally decided not to team up with Pohottuwa, they say. 


So, the Cabal of 16 is to function as an independent group in the opposition with either the former Betel leaf secretary or Uncle John as their leader.
