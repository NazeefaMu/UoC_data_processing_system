A hope-shattering prediction
	

A lady from a very prominent political family now in the opposition quietly called on a soothsayer in a city suburb with a young man in tow.

After making customary offerings and making sure there was none within hearing distance, she asked the soothsayer to name the person who would become the countrys leader following the next big poll.
The soothsayer went into a trance and uttered a name.
The lady wide-eyed, exclaimed: Aiyo!
She left the place with the young man even without saying good bye to the soothsayer, they say.

A train to be run on a track yet to be constructed
	

It is not unusual for any government in power in our country to perform magical wonders on the eve of any poll local or national.

Government politicos go through a hectic time participating in events such as the laying of foundation stones for numerous development projects, commissioning of new projects and unveiling of Buddha statues and shrine rooms which are galore in the run up to an election.
By the way. a Blue party senior who chose Uva to launch his political career was heard giving some interesting instructions to his aides the other day. We should run at least one train a short distance on our newly built railway track in the South. That will give us a chance to hold a grand ceremony ahead of the upcoming polls.
Then the engineers and other officials concerned told the purohita they had yet to lay the steel rails though they had already done the preliminaries like laying the ballast bed and sleepers.
That is no obstacle to our present purpose, the purohita told the officials. Let us lay the rails for some distance to run a train! Of course, we can resume the construction work at leisure after the ceremony.
The officials had readily endorsed this suggestion saying: Okay, Sir. Thats a good idea.

An islands  slow response  to rape in Paradise
	
Shocking incident where Swiss national fell prey to a rapist in Nuwara Eliya
As Sri Lanka topped lists as a potential tourist destination due to its post-war development strategy, tourist arrivals have shown a steady growth over the years. While the outskirts of Colombo are yet to be developed in terms of safety and other aspects, tourists are interested in exploring the greener pastures of the country. Therefore, in addition to Colombo, outstation destinations such as Ella and Nuwara Eliya are frequented by tourists. But whether these locations are safe for tourists have always remained a question with various incidents being reported. Just last week a Swiss national was raped in Nuwara Eliya and investigations are underway to identify and arrest the culprit. Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on the impact of such incidents on the tourism industry  the third largest foreign exchange earner of the country.
The incident 
An 18-year old Swiss woman who toured the Single-Tree Hill in Nuwara Eliya was raped earlier last week. According to her complaint, she was dragged into a nearby jungle and then raped. Investigations have revealed that an individual had waylaid and raped the victim. The Swiss national staying at her stepfathers house in Nuwara Eliya had visited Galle, Sigiriya, Ella, Sri Pada (Adams Peak) and Kandy and was expected to leave the country afterwards. 
By next morning, Police officers from all Police stations were deployed to arrest the suspect based on the details given by the victim. 25 individuals were taken in for questioning and investigations are currently underway. The parents of the tourist too were summoned to help in the investigations. 
According to the Police Media Unit, a drawing has been done according to the description of the rapist given by the victim. It will be released to the media by this week. 
When contacted by the , Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs palmed the blame on the female tourist instead of taking responsibility as the ministry that should ensure the safety and security of tourists. The Tourist Police Division too has vested the blame on the victim with regard to her delay in lodging a complaint.
Most incidents happen due to negligence of tourists
-Amaratunga
In the wake of this incident Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said that tourists shouldnt be travelling alone. But in most instances tourists do travel alone. Whether travelling alone or whether it was the duty of the state to ensure the safety of tourists, remains a question. In his comments to the Daily Mirror, the Minister once again reiterated the fact that the tourist was on her own. She had tried to climb Single Tree Hill in the evening all by herself.
The Police have been alerted to take necessary action. The surroundings need to be safeguarded and we are already working on it
The Police have been alerted to take necessary action. The surroundings need to be safeguarded and we are already working on it. When incidents such as these take place in isolated places the Police may not know unless they are reported. It also happens with the negligence of tourists because they too need to double check or ask a local guide before travelling on their own at night,the minister said.
Tourists shouldnt act like babies
-OIC Vidanagama
The Sri Lanka Tourist Police Division (TPD) was established in 2007 to ensure a secure and safe environment for tourists. Through this Division, teams are being deployed in Colombo and other areas frequented by tourists to identify any activities which would harass tourists. The also spoke to the TPD Officer in Charge (OIC) Prabath Vidanagama to find out what actions had been taken by the Division to fulfill its objectives in the future. A limited number of similar incidents have been reported during the past few years. One was in Kandy back in 2005, another in Tangalle and so on.
We will be expanding Tourist Police Units by another 20 in future in order to make it more convenient for tourists to report any incident they come across. But in situations such as these the immediate step they need to take is to report the incident to the Police. If a similar incident happens in their countries how would they react The same goes when they are in another country. They shouldnt act like babies. They come to my office a day before they leave and try to solve a case.
We will be expanding Tourist Police Units by another 20 in future in order to make it more convenient for tourists to report any incident
How can we do thatqueried OIC Vidanagama.
Speaking further he said that no country has robots and they deal with humans. The same precautions they would take in their countries should be taken elsewhere as well. In this particular incident we got down her parents and provided them with accommodation. Patrolling has begun and we are in the process of identifying the suspect. In future we hope to see a reduction of these incidents and the TPD is on call 24X7 in case of any emergency, he added.
People should be taught how to avoid these situations
-Dr.Udagama
In an incident such as this, it is important that the relevant authorities are informed first. Airing her views regarding this incident, Human Rights Commission Chairperson Dr.Deepika Udagama said that for any person who faces such an incident, the first step to take is to go to the nearest Police station. Rape is such a traumatizing experience.
How many women hesitate to go to the Police because of the socio-cultural factor Theres a Womens and Children Desk and theres also a Medical Desk at the Police where you can go and report what happened. Sri Lanka is a free country and people cannot be blamed. While it is true that people need to take precautions when travelling, you are also entitled to your own freedom. Public education is a must and it has to be done immediately.
Rape is such a traumatizing experience. How many women hesitate to go to the Police because of the socio-cultural factor
People should be taught how to avoid such situations. Women are not highlighted in this issue. Its not a question of wearing revealing clothes anymore because we also see elderly women being raped. In moving forward, stringent actions need to be taken in safeguarding citizens as well as tourists who visit the island. Unsafe locations should be patrolled, lighting systems should be installed and made more user-friendly. said Dr. Udagama.
Speaking further Dr.Udagama said that a proper service needs to be put into action. This should include counseling services and the involvement of community and civil society organisations. As at now, the law needs to be protected and psychosocial support has to be extended immediately, added Dr. Udagama.
Ensuring ones safety is everyones responsibility
-Swiss Embassy
The also contacted the Swiss Embassy of Sri Lanka to inquire into the matter. In her comments Deputy Head of Mission / Head of Chancery at the Embassy Stphanie Prillard said that travel advisories have been issued and are updated when necessary. The interview with Prillard is as follows : 
Q Has the Embassy issued a travel advisory for Swiss tourists 
A : The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with Swiss Embassies abroad issues travel advisories for all countries in the world. They are available online 24X7 and are updated when necessary according to the current situation. 
Q How will the Embassy ensure the safety of tourists 
A : The Embassy recommends its citizen to consult travel advisors who can provide information on security/safety in the country. Ensuring ones safety is everyones personal responsibility. The Embassy will provide consular protection in case of problems. 
Q What actions are being taken from the side of the Embassy in incidents such as these 
A : The Swiss Embassy in Colombo provides consular protection. For reasons of data and personal protection, no further information can be given. 
Q A message to Swiss tourists travelling to the country 
A : Before travelling, Swiss tourists should inquire about the countrys situation and follow the travel advice published by The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. 
We will strengthen the TPD to prevent such incidents in future
-Ratnayake
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayake said that the SLTDA takes such matters very seriously. The incident involving the 18-year-old Swiss tourist is an isolated incident. But we, as the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, take it very seriously. We are working hand-in-hand with the local Police authorities to bring the culprits to book and constantly monitoring the progress of the ongoing investigations.
Also, we are in the process of strengthening the Tourist Police Division and have already given them infrastructure and guidance to prevent such incidents, said Ratnayake adding, We have identified 18 main tourist destinations across the country and the TPD has been instructed to adopt measures to ensure safety of tourists visiting these areas. This doesnt mean that other areas will be neglected, but priority will be given to main tourist destinations during the initial stage.
The moment this incident was reported, we got in touch with the victim and her family. Her parents immediately visited Sri Lanka and we extended our fullest support to the family
These are long-term solutions that will prevent crimes against tourists visiting Sri Lanka and I believe all industry stakeholders will extend their fullest cooperation to us when implementing these measures. It goes without saying that strong punitive action should be taken against those who commit crimes against tourists and we constantly work with the law enforcement mechanism of the country to ensure that justice is meted out without delay. 
Stressing on the incident, Ratnayake said that another area of focus is its emergency response mechanism. The moment this incident was reported, we got in touch with the victim and her family. Her parents immediately visited Sri Lanka and we extended our fullest support to the family in every possible way. We will also facilitate their visits to Sri Lanka throughout the trial stage.
The Tourist Police Division has already taken action to make the tourists aware of ensuring their personal security during their stay in Sri Lanka.
We will use every opportunity to caution them about potential threats to their personal safety and prevent them from making mistakes that will jeopardize it. A complicated problem of this nature should be battled on all fronts. It is unwise to leave everything to the Tourist Police and wash our hands off. That is why we have decided to pursue the community approach as well. 
If you encounter any inconvenience during your visit to Sri Lanka, please contact the TPD on 0112 421 451.

## Title: Central Bank bond scam was a shock to us all

Central Bank bond scam was a shock to us all
	
In an interview with Daily Mirror, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne expressed his views on the bondscam, the Presidents term and the way forward for the government. Excerpts:
We came to root out corruption in all its manifestations
	I asked right at the beginning not to appoint Arjun Mahendran as CB Governor
	I know his negative track records
	PM agreed to remove if there were any wrongdoing
	By the time of his removal, Govt. was bogged down in a quagmire
	There are no financial experts in Sri Lanka to evaluate the economic loss of this transaction
Q President Maithripala Sirisena sought to stay in power for six years. What is the way forward for the government in the wake of the Supreme Courts opinion that the President can serve only up tofive years
Some lawyers told the President that the 19th Amendment did not have retrospective effect. We formulated this piece of legislation in 2015 taking into consideration all these aspects. I do not know why the lawyers could not see it. It was made clear that the 19th Amendment had retrospective effect. Therefore, the term is confined to five years.
Nevertheless, the President had ambiguity. If he were to relinquish office after five years, he will have to accomplish the planned tasks by next year. If it were a six-year term, he will have one more year to attend to these. He wanted to have clarity in advance rather than to wait for the eleventh hour so that he could pre-plan his work. He followed the proper constitutional procedure in making a reference to the Supreme Court in this regard.
Q The UNP, which is the main ally of the government, raised concerns over the Presidents move. How will it affect the future of the government
It is absolutely unwarranted for anyone to panic over such a move. If the President sought to increase his term from five years to six, it would have been serious. He only asked how long his term spanned. It is only the Supreme Court that can give its opinion. Why should one get alarmed when the law of the country is followed by another
Q It is clear that the relationship between the President and UNP has been strained over the appointment of the Presidential Commission to probe the Central Bank bond scam. What is the way forward for the government now
I am not aware of any such relationship being strained with the UNP. Be that as it may, I know for a fact that the understanding between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is still intact.
Whenever there is any difference in opinion, the Prime Minister asks me to contact the President to secure his consent and vise versa. Other than that, the two leaders always sit together and discuss matters. Before every Cabinet meeting, they meet for a while. The other MPs are not aware of this understanding because both leaders are non-committal.
Q The President took steps to revoke the Gazette notification that sought to remove the ban on liquor sales for women and to extend the time for liquor sales. How does it happen if there were a proper understanding between the two leaders in common decision-making
If the President did not revoke the Gazette, then it would be the problem. I too stood for revoking it. I asked him to annul it. The President contacted me immediately after the Gazette notification was released. One should bear in mind that this is Sri Lanka. This is not the United States or England. We do not want to make Sri Lanka such a country. We do not want to live in such a country. That is the reason why we live here. We have our civilized culture that is unique from those countries.
None knew liquor sales for women were banned in Sri Lanka before this Gazette note. We knew it only after it was announced. This is inviting unnecessary problems. We came to power with the promise of creating an alcohol-free country. As the Health Minister, I have the greatest role to play. In the world, 70 per cent of deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases. It is the same in Sri Lanka. In 2017, some 138,000 people died of such diseases. We have achieved a lot in curbing the spread of communicable diseases.
Smoking and consuming alcohol are the main reasons for non-communicable diseases. Lack of physical exercise is yet another matter. The World Health Organisation (WHO) invited me to its main session after recognising the initiatives taken by me to eradicate such diseases in 2017. Today, smoking has dropped by 16 per cent due to high taxation.
Our approach is used as a model for the entire world today. The world credits the President and me for it. When taxation on tobacco products was increased, some ministers argued against it in the Cabinet. They said the industry would collapse.
Q Anyway, wont the Presidents cancellation of a Gazette issued by another minister lead to resentment within the government
The President has the power. He contacted Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera who is abroad.
Q You said the President and Prime Minister are in great understanding with each other. Yet, the UNP backbenchers are harsh on the President. How does it happen then
Even the members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) do the same to the other side. Actually, the SLFP started it. This is retaliation for what they initiated. Some SLFP members are having double standards. They remain with the government, but are critical of it. They do not mind whether this government survives or not. People are scornful of these MPs who spurn the government while enjoying its benefits. If they are critical of the government, they should leave it.
Q If the President and Prime Minister are in good terms, they can simply ask their members to keep their mouths shut. Why doesnt it happen
There was a time like that. The Prime Minister asked UNP MPs not to be provoked by criticism from the other side. Yet, they questioned the Prime Minister at the parliamentary group meetings. He asked the Prime Minister to engage the President in this regard. They said they were not ready to remain quiet in the face of mounting verbal attacks from the other side.
If it is countered, things will take a turn for the worse. Both sides should stop it. This is a national government. Two forces that harboured enmity and bitterness have been brought under one umbrella. What is impossible has been achieved. Total reconciliation is impossible overnight.
It is a dream for some that this government has been elected. Some electoral organisers became MPs and MPs became ministers overnight. We made a huge compromise in defecting from the previous government. We risked it. What we aspire is not what these MPs want. Those who sacrificed a lot for the formation of this government conduct themselves properly. They know how arduous it was for them.
The UNP and SLFP alone did not form this government. There were a lot of apolitical forces that were at work. In fact, they wrote the manifesto. It is not the UNPers or SLFPers who did it. There were university academics, youth, women representatives, Bhikkhus and others involved in it.
Q Along with the President, you were the first to defect from the previous government. The main allegation against the former regime is fraud and corruption. You came to power with the promise of rooting out corruption. What did you feel when you learnt about the Central Bank bond scam
This is the only allegation to be made against our government. We have taken action against that as well. We are not confronted with hundreds of allegations, unlike the former rule.
At that time, even a person who murdered one man and raped his girlfriend was at large. The Prime Minister referred the COPE report to the Attorney General. He took steps to appoint someone from the JVP to the COPE. On the other hand, the President appointed a commission to evaluate the loss to the national economic. There are no financial experts in Sri Lanka who can do it.
What is important is not who paid whose rental and who phone called whom. It is important to estimate the economic loss of this transaction and to work out modalities to recover it. I asked for it.
The commission should have brought foreign financial experts. The commission says there has been a loss of Rs.11 billion. Yet, we have frozen financial assets worth Rs.12 billion of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. It means the amount frozen is one billion higher than the amount lost.
This commission says Rs.4,000 billion was lost in the past. Another commission has to be appointed to look into it.
Q There are reports that you have been assigned to whitewash the UNP. Is it true
No. I studied this in my own. Nobody has given me any assignment to clear the name of the UNP.
Q How did you feel when you heard about this financial crime
It is a major problem for us. It is a shock because we came to power on the plank of eliminating all forms of fraud and corruption. I objected the appointment of Arjun Mahendran as the Governor at the very beginning.
I pointed out his negative track records when he was in the Board of Investment. He was with me in Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya at that time. I asked what would happen if a person like this were appointed as the Central Bank Governor. The Prime Minister said, This is my ministry. Let me handle it!
Besides, the Prime Minister said he would sack Mahendran if found guilty of any offence. When he was removed, it was too late and the entire government was bogged down in a quagmire.
Q There is a huge gap between the first fraud and the second. Why didnt you take action when the first fraud took place
That is why the Prime Minister said Mahendran misled him. The premier made inquiries about this. There is one thing. Mahendran is a qualified person. The Prime Minister would have trusted an internationally qualified person. That is where the fault is.
Q There are media reports that a new Prime Minister will be appointed after the election on February 10. What is your view
It is fiction.
Q Do you think the incumbent Prime Minister should serve in office further
What matters is not what I believe. He is the one chosen by the people of this country. We have parliamentary democracy. We cannot make ad hoc decisions. The Prime Minister made a huge sacrifice to form the government. I know it as the person who was involved inpreliminary talks.
Initially, he wanted to contest the Presidential election. In fact, he asked me to become the common candidate. I insisted that someone who could get a chunk of Sinhala-Buddhist votes should be fielded. I proposed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for it. The Prime Minister asked me not to propose anyone from his party.
Then, I asked for 24 hours to find another candidate. I informed President Sirisena at that time. Then, the President sought some more time to consult his family members to decide on the offer.

Committed to reform age of marriage for Muslim girls: SL
	
Sri Lanka remained committed to reform the minimum age of marriage for girls under the Muslim law, with the active participation of the concerned community, the government told the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in Geneva yesterday.
The Sri Lankan delegation expressed these views as a response to the concerns raised by the experts of the Committee which concluded its consideration of the fifth to sixth periodic report of Sri Lanka under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
When questioned about reforming the minimum age of marriage under the Muslim law, Sri Lanka said a committee had been set up under the aegis of the Justice Ministry to carry out the necessary legal reform. 
The Government is following a two-pronged approach to the issue, namely sensitization of the concerned community and discussions with community leaders, while respecting the Conventions provisions, the delegation said.
In a statement, the UN said experts also voiced concern that the amendment to remove exception for Muslim girls to the statutory rape provision in the Penal Code seemed to be planned only after the amendment to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act was completed. 
They asked whether it would be possible for the Government to take a comprehensive approach to rectify all existing discriminatory laws against Muslim girls as a package.
Meanwhile, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Sri Lanka Kirsten Sandberg commendedthe positive steps taken by Sri Lanka with respect to childrens rights
However, she inquired about general measures of implementation of the Convention, noting that children were not really understood as rights holders and fully prioritized in Sri Lanka.

Course of love is to lead to a political marriage
	

A whirlwind romance due to culminate in nuptials amidst the local polls tumult is going to pave the way for a marriage between two rival political parties active in the upcountry estate sector, they say.

This political marriage is expected to bring about a major change in the complexion of the estate sector politics.
The hero of this love story is the son of a purohita in yahapalanaya, a prominent advocate of co-existence. The heroine is the daughter of a leader of a political alignment in the hills.
These two parties have already decided to merge into one political party after the local polls, they say.

Essaying on  Sri Lanka-China relations
	
Extracts from a foreword to the collection of essays by academics onSri Lanka-China Relations The Island of the Lion and the Land of the Dragon published by Pathfinder Foundation and edited by HMGS Palihakkara
The Cold War and its aftermath were marked by interesting contrasts as well as parallels. Only history will tell us if the risk of bipolar nuclear conflict of the Cold War was more or less dangerous than the reality of the widespread non-nuclear armed conflict and nuclear proliferation of the post-Cold war period.
The latter of course happened and will happen among States as well as non-state actors. The nuclear aspirant States include the rich and the poor as well as democratic and undemocratic ones. The wanton assault on our finite resources, especially the non- renewables and on our ecological life support system in the name of a good life for those who can afford it, has made life untenable and unsustainable for many. Globalization has swept the world. It has brought about breathtaking progress in many areas for many people.
It is nevertheless, alleged to be responsible for marginalizing many vulnerable populations. Economists are already talking about de globalization. In seeking greater good and well-being for their peoples, some nations and even continents had integrated into Unions blurring the hitherto sacrosanct attributes of sovereignty and nationhood. Some of these advanced Nations now seem to experience countervailing waves of nationalism and even exclusion as was evident in the Brexit affair and in some elections in the Americas and Europe.
In this complex situation of change and volatility, one constant that stood out has been the rising power of China. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer commenting on the impending Trump era laments the ending of what is known as the (trans-Atlantic) West led by the United States. He bemoans the probability that China will fill this gap.
The cause and effect of this change and volatility is of course the subject of wide ranging on-going debates. What is beyond debate is the ascendency of what the United States Admiral Harry Harris called the Indo- Region in general and the Sino-Indian power in particular. The region the Admiral referred to has some remarkable attributes. Its key players India and China, especially China will have the lions share of the world GDP totalling trillions of dollars; possibly the largest middle-class population; the largest purchasing power/production capacity and possibly the largest capital export potential in the world. Henry Kissingers words several decades ago and long before Joschka Fischers pronouncement were therefore not surprising. Given a decent system, China with 800 million workers will provide world leadership Kissinger said.
With Deng Xiaoping inspired reforms, what China has progressively and meticulously built up turns out to be quite a decent system indeed. The country now has nearly double the population that Kissinger was talking about. No single country in recent times has alleviated poverty of so many in as short a time as China has. Given their formidable capacity to produce and consume as well as to create and export, China and India hold decisive stakes in sustainable global growth and development. That of course requires secure and well serviced East-West trade routes including Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs).
Sri Lankas quest for strategic prominence
Has Sri Lanka, located as it is at a strategic pivot on this trade route, prudently and optimally exploited the national interest benefits that we can derive from this enormous potential to produce and consume, especially by these two giant economies Some analysts have also speculated on Sri Lankas quest for strategic prominence in the Indian Ocean and the possibility of carving out a role for itself (Sri Lanka) among the South Asian Littorals.
The challenge for Sri Lankan diplomacy has been and will be to show that we are after commercial/ economic benefits and not strategic manipulation and that Sri Lanka will aggressively exploit the full investment and trading potential of the Belt/Road initiatives of China for that purpose. In doing so, rather than having demarcated zones for investing powers, the whole of Sri Lanka can become a venue supporting multinational investment and multilateral cooperation for growth and development, without ruffling geopolitical feathers of anyone, regional or extra regional.
The cause and effect of this change and volatility is of course the subject of wide ranging on-going debates. What is beyond debate is the ascendency of what the United States Admiral Harry Harris called the Indo- Region in general and the Sino-Indian power in particular. The region the Admiral referred to has some remarkable attributes.
Thus, the country will not be the ground zero for a zero sum strategic power play that could give rise to the doomsday scenario of the kind conceived in the latest geo political flourish from the Indian analytics industry viz, the possibility of Sri Lanka becoming a (hostile) aircraft carrier parked just fourteen miles off the coast of India.
The Belt/Road potential can of course be projected and used as an opportunity for everyone and a threat to no one.
Widening relationships
Despite the fact that China and Sri Lanka have deepened and widened their relations building on the everlasting friendship, to a platform of strategic cooperation, critics say that the former Government in Sri Lanka had unwisely placed most, if not all of their eggs in the Chinese basket entailing serious debt management issues at home and troubling strategic concerns abroad involving India and the US.
The current Government drew its share of criticism for the clumsy handling of relations with China at the outset of its tenure. The new Government appeared too pre-occupied with making course corrections to Sri Lankas relations with the United States and India that became sour during its predecessors tenure.
The Government has since embarked on what seemed to be successful diplomatic negotiations to iron out differences with China, especially with regard to two key projects--the Port City and Hambantota. But residual irritants continued to linger.
Another unconventional facet in this interesting phase of Sino Sri Lanka relations had been the way in which the two major parties in Sri Lanka had used or misused the real or contrived state of Chinese assistance and bilateral relations in what was a bruising election campaign early this year.
This contrasts with a long-standing Sri Lankan tradition of working towards a bipartisan foreign policy, so that foreign relations do not get enmeshed in local politics which is an enterprise where no quarter is usually given! Since of late, this important principle seemed to have wilted against political expedience. Perhaps in reciprocity, China on its part also resorted to rather aggressive public diplomacy in Sri Lanka in order to justify/explain its position on the nature of the so- called controversial projects and on the terms and conditions of the assistance provided.
It is in this context that the present collection of essays dealing with ChinaSri Lanka relations focus on a broad range of challenges and opportunities the two countries are faced with.
The authors include academics, researchers, diplomats and senior officials from Sri Lanka and China, who have had close association with the issues at hand or the relevant policy processes. The essays bring out some interesting contrasts. The Sri Lankan side seems to be still grappling with residual politics of issues thrown up by the last election campaign in the country, while the Chinese side is eager to bring out real life business matters beneficial to both side e.g. shifting the excess industrial capacity in China to Sri Lanka, help Sri Lanka to link up with global value chains exploiting the comparative advantage of the two countries in a complementary manner through the Belt/Road process.
These points to hard-nosed business advice to the Sri Lankan Government as well as to our private sector regarding clear and present opportunities, which we have yet to seize fully. The Chinese authors also have no qualms about being blunt on the need for China to project power and create front power centres in the Indian Ocean region in order to protect Chinese citizens and properties. While China takes a considered note of the Indian perceptions about its sphere of influence, it dismisses as baseless, the Indian fears that China is up to strategic mischief in Sri Lanka.

Fond memories of DSS Honorary Doctorate
	
The first Prime Minister D.S.Senanayake left behind his Honorary Doctorate certificate, presented to him at the Convocation in 1948. This certificate was found three years ago among other similar documents, all were in a bundle, at the Academic Registrars office. Now it hangs at the University of Peradeniya Library. The reasons for why he left it behind still remain unknown. 
In this Jubilee year, it is a happy augury that a Graduate of the University of Peradeniya is the New Chancellor of this university. He is Prof. K.M.de.Silva. 
There was a problem regarding a place for a second University to be established in the hill country. There were arguments regarding the establishment of this University elsewhere. However, after the site was selected, World War II broke out. A few years had to pass before the actual planning was done for this project. 
During this time the University College in Colombo needed a Vice Chancellor and Sir Ivor Jennings arrived in 1941. He became the Principal of University College in Colombo. However his appointment was for a short time and he later became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Ceylon in Peradeniya. 
But he had to wait until the buildings were constructed at the site, which once had rubber and tea trees. But the trees were uprooted during World War II to build a camping ground for soldiers. It was the South East Asia Command of which Lord Louis Mountbatten was the head. He lived in Polgolla and had his offices at Peradeniya Gardens.
Because of this arrangement it was easy for the planners and constructors to plan and construct the buildings. Behind the planning was a prominent name: Shirley de Alwis. The main architect was Sir Patrick Abercombie. 
The constructors had an easy time constructing the buildings. This was because the area was cleared by the soldiers to build their billets.

Gampola Zahira to celebrate 75 years with walk
	
Gampola Zahira College completed 75 (1942-2017) years of serving the nation through education. Gampola Zahira College has been one of the leading schools for many years not only in the Central Province, but also in the entire country. It has a proud history and has made a name in many fields. 
Gampola Zahira College was founded on 15th May 1942 by late T. B. Jayah with just 185 students and four teachers using a make shift hut. The start was small because of World War II. The bombing by the Japanese in Colombo forced T.B. Jayah to take some students from Colombo Zahira to Gampola. With the support of a few Muslim educationists and philanthropists, who were living in Gampola, he was able to establish a school in Gampola. 
At present this school has been transformed into one of the leading Institutions in the hill capital. This is a mixed school and offers an education in three mediums ( English, Sinhala and Tamil ). The population of the school is over 3000. All these successes have been possible due to the untiring efforts of the schools founders. Special mention must be made of the founder architect Dr. Al Haj Badi-Ud-Din Mahmud who was the Principal at the very early stage of the school. He later became the Minister of Education and took the schools development into his hands.
The school has planed many activities and projects to marks the 75th Anniversary. All these worthwhile projects will be held throughout 2018. The biggest event is the Anniversary Walk which is scheduled for January 20 (Saturday) in Gampola. Students, teachers, parents and most importantly thousands of past pupils are eagerly awaiting to witness this event. 
The Past Pupils Association of the college was established in 1967. The association, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, has contributed immensely towards the development of the school. It has grown in numbers and many branches have been opened during the past 11 years. Gampola Zahira College Union in Colombo, Past Pupils Association Qatar and the Past Pupils Association UAE are some of the branches. Efforts are being taken to establish branches in Australia and UK too. 
As members of the Past Pupils Association we have been an integral part of the college for the last 50 years and supported in the development activities of the college. The past few years have been marked with great progress. This is true with every field at the school. The school has excelled academically, in sports and extracurricular activities and much has been done in terms of infrastructure development. The present principal A. L. Siraj, who assumed duties two years ago, is working very cordially with the Past Pupils Association, Parents and well wishers to develop the college President of the Association Ameer Ahamed said.
It gives me great happiness to say that we have been able to produce good results so far at the Grade 5 scholarships, GCE O/L, GCE A/L exams. There have been achievements at football, cricket, netball, rugby and indoor games. A big thanks should go to our dedicated teachers, parents and most importantly the Past Pupils, the schools principal A. L. Siraj said. 
He also noted that due to these achievements the demand for admission to the school has increased by almost threefold.
January 20th is going to be a day to remember for all Gampola Zahirians. They will flock together from all around the world to take part in the Anniversary Walk. There will also be a fellowship which is organized at the college on the same day as the walk. Arrangements have been made to have a sports meet for past pupils.

Grand Hotel receiving orders for Rs.3.8 Mn dessert: Chef
	
The Grand Hotel in Nuwara Eliya is already receiving orders and positive feedback for Marry Me, the Rs.3.8 million dessert, Chef Viraj Jayaratne told Daily Mirror.
Chef Jayaratne, who created the dessert, told Daily Mirror that many Sri Lankans living abroad had praised the efforts of the team of chefs at the Grand Hotel to promote the hotel and Sri Lanka.
He said the dessert was the result of a joint effort made by the hotel's chefs, the General Manager and other staff members.
Mr. Jayaratne said the concept was to promote Sri Lanka and the Grand Hotel in an era where hotels were mushrooming.
Our hotel is one of the oldest in the country. The General Manager came up with the concept to grab the worlds attention and to promote tourism in Nuwara Eliya. This is why we decided to invite star cricketer Kumar Sangakkara because he has done so much to promote Sri Lanka. There have been desserts in the past but nothing like this, he said.
Chef Jayaratne said the dessert was not a simple piece of chocolate but rather a number of add-ons and acute traditional carvings made using rare and expensive ingredients.
The basis of the main dessert was Madagascar chocolate imported from France. A pistachio sauce and a jelly made from fine Nuwara Eliya strawberry. We made an ice cream from French Champagne, Dom Prignon. This champagne was also served to the guests. Chocolate sauce was served in the form of Kandyan dancers and it was made using a pin. A replica of the lotus tower, one of the upcoming icons of the country, was created purely from moulded sugar, he said.
The dessert comes with a naturally untreated or non irradiated blue sapphire, one of the rarest and expensive gems, found in Sri Lanka. The gem, he said, was certified by the Gem and Jewellery Authority of Sri Lanka as well as the gem certification authority of England. The gem was placed on top of the lotus tower.
All these ingredients together completed the dessert which was served on a stand purely made out of parchment icing. The stand embodied with carvings which depict our heritage. Using parchment icing to create the stand made the task more challenging. At the end, no one can name a price on the effort put by the team and on the creativity. It took us seven days to put this dessert together. However, we are now confidant enough to undertake orders with a three-day prior notice, Chef Jayaratne said.
He did admit that there were criticisms by a few apart from the positive responses. When we weigh responses, we have more positive feedback than that of negative. Even the negative responses, which were not many, helped promote the effort, the hotel and Sri Lanka, he said.
With the orders they have received, Chef Jayaratne said they will officially start making more Marry Me desserts this year. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

He might not be with the Greens if they were to go it alone
	

There is a fringe party leader in the fray for a much coveted local body chair campaigning these days under the close watch of an elite security detail. The threat to his life is believed to be emanating from a high-up of the very alliance he is representing, they say.

A Green party purohita handling a secretarial job the other day asked this fringe party leader whether he would throw his weight behind the Greens if by any chance they were compelled to go it alone.
This query riled the leader facing the death threat. His answer to this query was a counter-query: Why dont you first discipline the big one in your own party who is out for my blood
He added: If you fail to take action against my enemy  who by the way has become a problem to your party itself  our party may have to take a serious decision which you may not like!

A Blue party state purohita often seen hobnobbing with Number One rang up a gabby Pohottuwa colleague the other day.

The state purohita hails from Gampaha area and the Pohottuwa one from the hill capital.
They immediately got down to talking about the treasury bond report. The state purohita told the gabby one from the hill capital. Machang, you must appreciate that we bowled a full toss for you to hit a six.
Yes! yes! Pohottuwa one readily agreed, but waited for the other to go ahead with what he proposed to say.
Machang, what on earth are doing Instead of going for a smashing hit, you are targeting the bowler! Now that you have got a fine chance to come out with all guns firing at our common enemy! Dont spare any one of them I ll tell you more things when I meet you at Diyawanna! With that promise he rang off, they say.

JO criticizes giving Ravi a bond report copy but not Parliament
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said the move to give former minister Ravi Karunanayake, an accused of the bond fiasco, a copy of the bond report but not Parliament was absurd.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said giving a copy to MP Karunanayake would give him enough time to prepare for upcoming legal proceedings.
This has enabled him to prepare for whats coming in the future. What is the objective of giving Mr. Karunanayake a copy and not Parliament If a copy was given to him, can anyone make sure that another copy wont end up with Arjuna Mahendran or Arjun Aloysius This is all a part of a plan to create the background. Thats why it is taking time to present it to Parliament, he told a news briefing.
He said there was a deal between the UNP and the SLFP. UNP supports President Maithripala Sirisena to continue as President even with criticisms and in return the SLFP to continues to protect UNP thieves, he said.
He went on to note that no action has been taken so far to bring back Arjuna Mahendran from Singapore.
Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardana said Central Bank Governor, Monetary Board or the Public Debt Department should immediately make a statement whether there has been bond transaction frauds since 2008 to 2014 as claimed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made a special statement in Parliament and said Rs. 4,702 billion worth bond transactions during 2008 and 2014 were not transparent. Therefore, the Central Bank should clarify this, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Kabul cant support army without US money: Afghan President
	

Afghanistan, (rt.com), - Without American assistance, Kabul cant fight the many militant groups active in the country after 16 years of US involvement. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says the national army wont last longer than six months on its own.

American taxpayers, who contribute around 90 percent of Afghanistans defence budget, are bankrolling a war against terrorists in the county, which the government would not be able to continue without the US funding, Ghani told CBS News on Sunday.
We will not be able to support our army for six months without US support and US capabilities Because we dont have the money, Ghani said.
Saying that at least 21 international terrorist groups are operating in his country, Ghani warned that terrorists can strike at any time... We are under siege, Ghani told the 60 Minutes program. 
This continues the 16-year incursion that has seen over 2,000 US servicemen lose their lives and over $700 billion spent on military assistance, lined with repeated promises of a soon-to-come victory from three successive US presidential administrations

A Sri Lankan maid, who stole her employer's gold necklace and was caught after she posted a photo on Facebook that showed her wearing it, has been jailed for six months.
The Sharjah criminal court also ordered her deportation at the end of the prison term.

During her interrogation, she denied stealing the necklace. The police later found the necklace in the trash bin.
The defendant told the prosecution that she did not steal the necklace and that her sponsor's wife had gifted it to her. She claimed she did not know it was gold and that was the reason she threw it in the trash bin. (Khaleej Times)

Only  Muslims who assimilate into Hindu culture will stay in India : BJP MLA
	

In a controversial remark, a BJP MLA from this district has said that once India becomes a Hindu rashtra, only those Muslims will stay in the country who assimilate into the Hindu culture. 
There are a very few Muslims who are patriotic. Once India becomes a Hindu rashtra (Hindu nation), Muslims who assimilate into our culture will stay in India. Those who will not are free to take asylum in any other country, Bairia MLA Surendra Singh told reporters here last night. 
He also claimed that by 2024, India would become a Hindu nation. Describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an avatar purush (reincarnation of a deity), Singh said, As the RSS completes 100 years in 2025, by 2024, India will become a Hindu rashtra. By the grace of god, India is going to be a global superpower thanks to the leadership of Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Not only will India become a vishwa guru, it will also become a Hindu rashtra by 2024. 
Taking a jibe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the BJP MLA said, There are two sets of values in Rahul Gandhi -- one is Italian, while the other one is Indian...He can never become the torchbearer of the Indian thought. He said the Gandhi scion could coin any slogan to become the prime minister of the country, but he lacked the strength and values to make India strong.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed UNP Ministers and MPs not to make controversial statements dragging President Maithripala Sirisena anymore.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had given the instruction at the UNP Working Committee meeting at the party headquarters Sirikotha this morning.
Party sources said the Prime Minister had also informed the UNP MPs and Ministers to take on the SLFP Ministers directly and settle whatever issues which they may have with the other main ally of the Government.
Some of the Ministers, including Harin Fernando have then responded saying the UNPers were merely responding to the critical statements made by some SLFP Ministers drawing the Bond Commission report.
MP S. M. Marikar had informed Prime Minister that his statement with regard to President was misinterpreted or misreported.
He had denied calling President Sirisena 'Pickpocket President. He said that the UNP Pickpocketed Mr. Sirisena from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Mr Wickremesinghe had then cautioned the Ministers and MPs saying the Bond Commission report would not have any negative impact on the UNP as the report had not faulted any member of the party.(Yohan Perera)

Sour grapes
	

A kid brother from the gem-rich district who got set for a pole-vault called on Number One to strike a deal first.

The man put forward two demands to be met before he could throw in his lot with the Betel leaf faction of Yahapalanaya. One demand was that be offered a purohita office at some level and the other that be provided with an easy way out of a pending court case against him. Number One who gave him a patient hearing expressed his regret that he was not in a position to grant either demand.
Highly disappointed by the negative response, the kid brother left the place wondering as to how he could make the best out of a bad situation.
Soon after, he made a statement scotching rumors that he was about to join yahapalanaya. I would rather go to jail than join this this corrupt and utterly inept regime, he said in his statement.

A bigwig holding a deputy post in the party who had to step down from high office figured prominently in their discussion and it was their consensus that it was high time for the party to throw overboard the big man now a big liability to the party. They finally decided to take up the urgent issue with the party leadership.

Trump business accused of financial misconduct
	

Hindustan Times/AP, Washington, Jan 16, 2018 - An attempt to oust President Donald Trumps hotel business from managing a luxury hotel in Panama has turned bitter, with accusations of financial misconduct. 
Trump Hotels is contesting its firing, and its staff ran off a team of Marriott executives invited last month to visit the property during a search for a new hotel operator, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
After the owners association accused Trump Hotels of mismanagement and financial misconduct in a $15 million arbitration claim, the company owned by the president fired back with a $200 million counterclaim and refused to turn over the propertys financial records. When a team from Marriott International Inc. came to the property at the invitation of the hotels majority owner, Trump staff asked them to leave, according to the two people, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what happened behind the scenes. 
The head of Trump Hotels, Eric Danziger, also called Marriott chief executive Arne Sorenson to complain about the visit, the two people said.
