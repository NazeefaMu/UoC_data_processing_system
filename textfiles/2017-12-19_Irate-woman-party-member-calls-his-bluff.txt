Irate woman party-member calls his bluff


	



 

A senior purohita from the central hills, who once got into hot water because of his wagging tongue, had recently got a full blast from a woman party-member.

 


The purohita in the thick of party reorganizing activity in his home turf had been waxing eloquent on the government’s achievements in the development field and providing employment opportunities when the young woman party member had flared up. “Stop bragging about your achievements, amethithuma, what development work have you done or what jobs have you given?  As I am utterly helpless, I begged of you to find me at least a peon’s job! How many times have I come on my knees to you?  Now stop talking about your employment-generating projects!”


Pin-drop silence had reigned at the meeting and the purohita had looked stunned. However, he had soon recovered himself and resumed his address, they say.
