  Private bus strikes have been reported today in several areas including Panadura and Kandy.
 
Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) said the strike in Kandy has been launched by employees of long distance services against a proposal made for conductors and drivers to wear uniforms.
 
“They are refusing to wear the uniform. However, the strike will not affect the commuters,” LPBOA President Gemunu Wijeratne said.
 
Meanwhile, private bus employees of Panadura have launched a strike against the lack of facilities at the Panadura bus terminal.
