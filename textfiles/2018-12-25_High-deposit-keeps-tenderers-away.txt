High deposit keeps tenderers away!


	



 

Equipment and appliances worth Rs.20 million purchased for the state of the art canteen of a new provincial building complex are lying idle inside a room of a provincial office for the last six months.

 


Tenders for selection of a caterer for the operation of the canteen had been called, but no tenders had been received so far.


Making a cash deposit of Rs. 5 million by the selected tenderer required by the tender notice has deterred the interested parties from applying for the contract, they say.
