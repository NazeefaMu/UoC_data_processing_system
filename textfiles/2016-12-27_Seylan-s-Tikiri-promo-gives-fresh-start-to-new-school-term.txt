The beginning of a new academic year provides a fresh start for students to reignite their love for learning - and starting the first day of school with new school supplies is a wonderful feeling for children. 
Keeping this in mind, Seylan Bank once again infuses excitement and expectancy for the new academic year amongst students ranging from Montessori upto Grade 5, by introducing the exciting ‘Tikiri New School Term Promotion’, which offers brand new stationery pouches and sports bags to make the first day of school an eagerly awaited one. Valid from 1st January to 28th February 2017, the promotion invites parents to visit any Seylan Bank branches island wide and open a new Tikiri account or to make deposits in their existing Tikiri accounts of Rs. 2,500, making them instantly eligible for a free ‘Seylan Tikiri pouch’. A free ‘Seylan Tikiri sports bag’ will also be gifted to every new Tikiri account opened or for new deposits in existing Tikiri accounts of Rs. 5,000. ‘Seylan Tikiri’ offers definite, guaranteed gifts which are not dependent on competitions. 
Exciting ‘Tikiri New School Term Promotion’ is proven irresistible for children, parents, guardians and teachers, as it offers guaranteed useful gifts to them while simultaneously encouraging them to save. 
Commenting on the promotion, Tilan Wijeyesekera – Deputy General Manager – Marketing and Personal Banking for Seylan Bank says, “It gives us great pleasure to introduce this scheme for the third time, spurred by the overwhelming response we have received from existing and new customers in the past. While we are delighted to inject a spirit of positive anticipation and excitement by offering gifts for the students, we would like to highlight the objective behind this promotion, which is to encourage parents to put aside a slice of their earnings as savings for the financial security of their children. 
Education is a powerful enabler for children and being financially secure by saving, is the best way that customers can ensure their children achieve their full academic potential in the future. ‘Seylan Tikiri’ habituates children and parents to saving, which will also empower the children’s financial management skills as they grow and build greater academic aspirations. As the country’s premier minor savings account, ‘Seylan Tikiri’ has pioneered promotions that reflect out-of-the-box thinking in an effort to extend maximum value to children and their families as a token of our appreciation for their loyalty.”
Seylan Tikiri’s tradition of generous gift-based schemes for minor savings accounts has rendered it the most popular children’s savings scheme in the country. Over a period of 23/24 years, ‘Seylan Tikiri’ has pioneered numerous fun promotions to attract children and their parents to save and win gifts. The Bank prides itself on having inculcated the savings habit in thousands of children over the decades through its attractive schemes.
