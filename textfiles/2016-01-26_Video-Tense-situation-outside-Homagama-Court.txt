A tense situation continues to prevail outside the Homagama Court premises after a large number of Buddhist monks and some youth protested against the Homagama Magistrate’s order to remand Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera.
The people who had gathered in the court premises turned unruly soon after the Court ordered that Ven. Gnanasara Thera be remanded until February 9. Monks belonging to the BBS, the Ravana Balaya and several other organizations have blocked the road leading to the Court and are preventing the the Black Maria from leaving the premises.
A large number of policemen from more than ten police stations had been deployed in the area to maintain law and order while the Police Anti-Riot Squad and Special Task Force personnel have been deployed to quell any emergency situation. (Muditha Dayananda)
