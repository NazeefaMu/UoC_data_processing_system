The United Nations Human Rights Council’s investigation into Sri Lanka and the current political situation in the country were the main topics focused on during a meeting held between President Maithripala Sirisena and Venerable Elle Gunawansa Thera at Dharmayathanaya in Colombo on Saturday (6).
President Sirisena and the thera had exchanged views on how Sri Lanka would face the human rights session of the UNHRC scheduled to be held soon. However, the thera had declined to reveal any of the contents of their discussions on current political situation in the country.
"The President did not inform me prior to his visit which took place at around 3.00 pm yesterday (6) at the Dharmayathanya,”the Thera said.
They had also discussed the national economy. Ven. Gunawansa Thera had asked the President to prioritise agriculture while developing the national economy. Accordingly, President Sirisena had agreed to help kick-start this effort by gifting a land of 1000 acres where the thera had already taken the initiative to establish a farm in Ekala with the help of disabled soldiers.
