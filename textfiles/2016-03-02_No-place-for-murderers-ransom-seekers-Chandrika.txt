“There is no camp of Sarana Gunawardene in Attanagalle now. Murderers, ransom seekers and rogues and those who were engaged in illegal activities have no place now in the SLFP,” said former president, the chief SLFP organiser for Attanagalla Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga at a seminar held at Sangabodhi college Nittambuwa.

She said there weren't two factions in the SLFP. "There is no SLFP of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Only the SLFP under Maithripala Sirisena exists now," she said.

"The rule against the people ended on January 8, 2015. There was a time when two ministers could not speak to each other. The ministers lived in constant fear. Now it is not there. People are now able to breathe freely and there are no white vans. We should not forget that we ended the terror regime of Rajapaksa and good governance was established by all the forces that rallied round to usher in a country that would safeguard the future. Despite certain shortcomings, the state institutions, police, courts and other establishments are functioning according to the requirements of the people," she said. (Warana Ananda and E.
