Dispensing street justice!


	

This traffic cop on duty between Miriswatte and Belummahara the other day promptly whistle-stopped a limousine on seeing the driver using a mobile phone. 




When the driver pulled up, the cop asked for his driving license. Instead of producing the license, the driver asked the cop to have a look at a sign stuck on the left side of the windscreen.


“I don’t want to look at this and that,” the cop retorted.  


“You ought to know that it’s an offence to talk over the mobile phone while driving!”


Then the driver introduced himself and proceeded to give the cop a tongue-lashing for not having recognized him. 


The cop who cringed said humbly: 


“Sir, please excuse me…I didn’t recognize you…” After tendering his apology, he saluted the driver. 


The driver, thereafter, resumed the journey with the mobile phone held against his ear as before.


It later transpired that the driver of the vehicle was a member of the justice dispensing gentry!
