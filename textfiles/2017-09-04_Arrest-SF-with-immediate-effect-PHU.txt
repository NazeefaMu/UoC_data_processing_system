Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday Minister and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka had appeared to have withheld evidence regarding war crimes charge for the past eight years and such suppression news warranted his arrest.

He told a news conference the government should arrest Mr. Fonseka for withholding evidence in connection with the war crime charges levelled against former army commander (Rtd) General Jagath Jayasuriya.

He said Mr. Fonseka betrayed the Army for the second time and therefore could be known as the biggest traitor in the world.

“The first time he betrayed the army was the events related to the white flag case. He has tarnished the image of the country and the army by his statement,” the MP said.

He said if Mr. Fonseka admits that there were war crimes during his term, there was no need for further allegations to arrest him. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
