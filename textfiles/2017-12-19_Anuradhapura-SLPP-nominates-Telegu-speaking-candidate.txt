For the first time in Sri Lanka, a representative of the Telegu-speaking community in Sri Lanka will be fielded as a candidate at the local government elections.

He is being fielded by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to the Talawa Pradeshiya Sabha in Anuradhapura.

Rajarata University’s Prof. Channa Jayasumana told Daily Mirror he had garnered the support of this community to the SLPP at the election.

Prof. Jayasumana who works closely with the SLPP said this community was influential in four electoral wards in the Anuradhapura district and another four in Kurunegala because of their concentration in these areas.

“This is the first time this community is getting political recognition,” he said.(Kelum Bandara)
