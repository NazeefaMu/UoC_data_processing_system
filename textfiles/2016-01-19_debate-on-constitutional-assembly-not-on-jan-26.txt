Debate on Constitutional Assembly not on Jan.26


	

The resolution on setting up a constitutional assembly will not be debated in Parliament next week, informed sources said today.
The party leaders decided to postpone the debate fixed for January 26 pending further engagement among the MPs.
Meanwhile, the joint opposition that met at the residence of former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris decided to stick to its stance that the constitutional process should be carried out only in keeping with lawful procedures and under parliamentary Standing Orders.
This position was communicated to the government at the party leaders’ meeting by opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane. Initially the resolution sought to convert the Parliament into a Constitution Assembly but subsequently amendments were proposed both by the joint opposition and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).(Kelum Bandara)
