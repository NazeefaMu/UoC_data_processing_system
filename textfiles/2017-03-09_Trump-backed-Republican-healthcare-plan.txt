President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed Republican legislation to replace the Obamacare healthcare law but the measure faced a rebellion by conservative groups and lawmakers, complicating its chances for passage in the U.S. Congress.


Republican U.S. House of Representatives leaders on Monday unveiled legislation to do away with Obamacare, eliminating the requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance and creating a system of tax credits to coax people to purchase private insurance on the open market.


Speaker Paul Ryan said he could guarantee that he had enough votes to win passage of the measure in the House, adding that conservatives should be excited about the plan to repeal and replace Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement.


But conservatives slammed the proposal, with Republican Senator Mike Lee calling it “exactly the type of back-room dealing and rushed process that we criticized Democrats for.”


Trump said the plan was open to negotiation, but said it had already earned support “from everybody.” Vice President Mike Pence described it as a “framework,” signalling the measure was far from its final form. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price called it “a work in progress.” The proposal represented a key step toward carrying out pledges by Trump and congressional Republicans to dismantle Obamacare.


But lawmakers face pressure from constituents not to throw America’s healthcare system into chaos. Democrats denounced the proposal as taking away health insurance from millions of Americans and benefiting the rich.


Some conservative Republicans complained the bill did not go far enough in removing government from the healthcare industry.


In the Senate, where Republicans can afford to lose only two votes from their razor-thin majority, Republican Senator Rand Paul called the plan “Obamacare Lite” and said he wanted a repeal-only option.
