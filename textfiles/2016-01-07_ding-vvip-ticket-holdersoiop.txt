	Live Events (Pvt) Ltd has still not arrived at a conclusive decision regarding compensating VVIP ticket holders who were inconvenienced at the Enrique show held in December 20, 2015 in Colombo.
	When contacted by Daily Mirror, CEO of Live Events (Pvt) Ltd Mr. Riyaz (Shaq) Shah Jahan refused to give a comment concerning the company’s stance on refunding the VVIP ticket holders.
	“We cannot give a comment on the matter right now. A comment concerning this issue can be made only after having a word with the board members of the company” Mr. Jahan said.
	When inquired about the thirty million tax due to the Colombo Municipal Council, Mr. Jahan refused to comment citing the same reason as mentioned above. (Sarah Muiz)
