He repeats the same excuse


	


This white collar high up is a director of a certain state institution handling matters relating to the country’s economic development. He held his current office even under the previous regime. 
This worthy recently attended a high-powered conference on the government’s development projects. Two point men of a very high government authority too were among the participants. During the deliberations, the director pointed out that the development activity underway in the country was not getting sufficient publicity. 
One of the participants who took exception to the director’s remark said: “You were saying the same thing in the days of the previous regime. You are parroting it under this regime too. Why on earth are you playing the same tune over and over again?” An altercation between the director and his ‘challenger’ had ensued. But the other participants who intervened made peace between the two, they say.
