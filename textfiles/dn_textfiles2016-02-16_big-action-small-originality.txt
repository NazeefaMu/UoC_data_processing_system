Big in action, small in originality

 
Based on William Joyce's book 'The Leaf Men And The Brave Good Bugs' Chris Wedge brings the novel into 3D as 'Epic' in an entertaining and unique manner.
This forest-set fantasy opens with teenager Mary Katherine aka M K visiting her scientist father to rekindle the father-daughter bond. However she soon discovers that he has no time for her since he is obsessed with finding an advanced race of tiny men who live in the forest. Disappointed M K decides to leave home when she is suddenly shrunk down to insect size. She encounters the wee forest folk that her father has been searching for through the years.

Meantime the little folk are faced with problems of their own when the evil Mandrake and his gang spread rot and life-sucking substances into the forest. Traveling to a pond to choose a pod that will spawn her heir, the leafmen's leader, Queen Tara, is carried by a flock of dragonflies in a leaf-like ship, which gorgeously unfolds into a water lily when it hits the pond's surface. Talking mushrooms, flowers, and insects are everywhere. Two insects a snail and a slug named Mub and grub provide humour to the tale. Ozzie, M.K.'s blind, three-legged, lovable pug too adds a smile to our faces during his ventures. M K is brought to this set up with a reason. She must help the forest folk keep the Earth's ecosystem working.
Heroine centric
Some of the scenes from 'Epic' remind you of those from movies like 'The Wizard of Oz','Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Avatar'. Therefore the movie is big in its action but small in originality. The scenes in which the evil forces battle with the good remind us strongly of the orcas in 'The Lord of the Rings'. At times the plot is confusing since so many characters make it to the scene.
However the movie is heroine centric since the two main characters which lead the troupes, Queen Tara and M K - forest dweller and human being - are female.
Epic is a green themed flick that follows along the footsteps of 'The Lorax'. It has a simple yet powerful theme. Throughout the movie the underlying message that one should never lose hope since the tables can turn is highlighted. It is also a coming of age production for characters like Nod. The visuals are stunning and the backdrop where the action takes place is busy. The film is astonishing in its 3D effects but could have been equally enthralling without them. Wedge's expertise in the 'Ice Age' franchise has helped him in presenting this visual treat for animation fans. It is also fascinating to look at the world through the leafmen's eyes.
Smart move
The voice cast has some of the top names in the business among them. Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, Colin Farrell, Christoph Waltz, Beyoncé Knowles, Pitbull, Steven Tyler and Jason Sudeikis have lent their voices for 'Epic'. It is a smart move by the team to hire big names like Knowles to voice Queen Tara, a miniature Mother Nature, since this too will enhance the fans' interest towards 'Epic.'However the team has made little use of her vocal skills.
'Epic' is sure to win the hearts of everyone who are into animation movies. It provides pint-sized thrills in wit and charm for the whole family.
