A leading political authority in yahapalanaya is said to be simmering with anger over the tactless move of presenting a supplementary estimate in the council for the purchase of limousines for the official use of purohitas in the wake of two national calamities.




“It’s sheer callousness to present a supplementary estimate for a purpose like buying cars for political bigwigs when a section of the population are undergoing immense hardship and misery in the aftermath of the floods and the explosion of the ammo dump,”  the political authority had pointed out.
