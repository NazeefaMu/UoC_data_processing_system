Fast and infuriating!

 
Just when you thought that you will give the series a break, 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' return with its fourth installment: 'Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip'. A mouthful of a title, 'The Road Chip' adds nothing new to the series except for more trouble for Dave.
'The Road Chip' sees Dave inviting his date, Samantha, an attractive ER doctor, to take a trip to Miami with him for an album release party. It is a rude shock for Alvin, Simon and Theodore especially since Samantha's tyrant son Miles is hell-bent on standing oppose to the chipmunks. With the nightmare of the two families merging together hanging over his head, Alvin leads the other two boys to the road.
One of the themes which are explored in the movie is the importance of having a father. Miles who has been parentally abandoned realizes this fact towards the end of the movie. Dave even goes to such length as to adopt his chipmunk kids legally as a token of proving his devotion towards them.
Common grounds
Another fact that comes to light is that with the right understanding and devotion even the most unlikely relationship will find common grounds. This is signified when Miles and the chipmunks act as a team after a few hiccups on the way.

'The Road Chip' touches familiar territory when the chipmunks encounter a villain in the form of Tony Hale's vengeful air marshal.
This leads the chipmunks to unite with Miles sooner than expected. Any screenwriter would not have recommended such a fast union.
It seems such a waste that the concept of rebelling against the proposal was brought up in the first place. Naturally chaos is caused for their long-suffering guardian Dave when the boys engaged in their madcap mission. This as well as Miles' instant dislike to the furry vocalists brings on a few laughs. But a movie of this genre which basically relays its success on comedy needs to fine-tune this element.
Vocal talents
Another problem with this movie is that the chipmunks are not given apt space to showcase their vocal talents.
They are up against the rising stars of America, the Chipettes. Unfortunately the girls too do not get to sing much in this series.
'The Road Chip' is suitable as a children's movie except for a few scenes which project women in skimpy clothes.
In one such scene Alvin grazes at some bikini clad beauties in Miami Beach and drools out, "If this is grounded - ground me for life!" There are a few women who also don short skirts and cleavage baring tops at a party.
Jason Lee, Josh Green, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Tony Hale, Jennifer Coolidge, John Waters, Bella Thorne, Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, Jesse McCartney, Christina Applegate, Anna Faris and Kaley Cuoco act as well as render their voices for the animated characters.
The forth 'Chipmunk' movie does not hold much surprises. It doesn't enlighten the audience either. It is best suited if you are in the mood for light entertainment.
