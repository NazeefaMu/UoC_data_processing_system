Is he courting more trouble?


	



 

A yahapalanaya purohita has made plans to lease out the racecourse in Nuwara-Eliya to an investor of a neighbouring country.

 


Under this arrangement, the Nuwara-Eliya racecourse is to be developed while another racecourse in Katunayake is to be laid out anew under the proposed direct foreign investment project. The purohita has already submitted the project proposal to the highest decision-making body on economic development, they say.


However, the initiative taken by this purohita to promote a racecourse project which has nothing to do with the subject assigned to him has come under fire from several of his colleagues including the one handling  sports at the national level.  This purohita is already in hot water over his controversial move to award a multi-million house construction project to an investor in a neighbouring country. His colleagues predict that the purohita would run into worse trouble over the latest racecourse project.
