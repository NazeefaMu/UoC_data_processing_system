The case against retired Supreme Court Judge Sarath De Abrew, on charges of sexually abusing and assaulting his domestic aide, was fixed for hearing on May 23 by Colombo High Court Judge Prithi Pathman Soorasena after the accused pleaded not guilty.
The Attorney General indicted Mr. De Abrew under Clause-365 of the Penal Code on two counts of sexual abuse and assault in June last year at Ratmalana.
Meanwhile, on the basis of the bail application submitted by defense counsel Rienzie Arsakularatne to the High Court, Mr. De Abrew was released on a cash bail of Rs.100,000 with two sureties of Rs.100,000 each.
The High Court Judge acceded to the request by the prosecution that the authorities be directed to transfer the case productions to the HC from Mount Lavinia Court and summon the first witness on the list.
The Judge also directed the police to fingerprint the accused.
This is the only occasion of a Supreme Court Judge being indicted on criminal charges.(MG & SCS, TFT)
