The Hindu/ JANUARY 26, 2017-India’s 68th Republic Day was celebrated in the capital on Thursday with a display of military strength and cultural diversity in the presence of Chief Guest Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.  


Early morning rain and an intermittent drizzle at the Rajpath failed to dampen spirits as the elite “Black Cat” commandos of the National Security Guards (NSG) and the made-in-India Tejas aircraft made their debut at the parade. A 149-member marching contingent from the United Arab Emirates led by a band comprising 35 musicians was unique to this year’s celebration.  


India’s ceremonial boulevard was filled with myriad colours and music with 17 Tableaux from States and Union Territories, six Central Ministries and departments and cultural performances by schoolchildren.
