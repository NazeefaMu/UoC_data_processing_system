Waiting for Saturn’s exit


	

A certain state purohita is said to have gone into ecstasy following a strong rumour that a reshuffle of the top team is in the offing.




“We are about to be rid of Saturn; it is to move into a new sign,” the state purohita would tell all his friends coming to see him these days, rubbing his hands with glee. 


His Saturn - the purohita at the top team level has not only failed to delegate any powers and functions to the state one, but also is said to be giving him the cold shoulder at every turn. Not to be outdone, the state one also never misses a chance to lash out at him, they say.
