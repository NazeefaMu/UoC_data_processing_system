Mr. Janz, Chairman, DFCC Bank receiving the award

DFCC Bank has been included in the Top 10 list of the ‘Most Admired Companies of Sri Lanka’ competition conducted by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL), selected from over 180 applicants. 

These awards recognize companies that not only demonstrate outstanding financial performance but also have built a strong corporate reputation over the years, creating value for shareholders, customers, employees and the general community. The companies within the Top 10 ranking are those that have proven their mettle through consistent, ethical, significant and sustainable growth, resulting in excellent business performance. Furthermore, the stringent criteria in place to select the Top 10 ensured that these awards are in line with reputed International Rankings.

Starting with over 180 companies named as most admired by employees, competitors, and stakeholders through a public survey run via Dialog, the judges selected the top 10 companies using a rigorous selection and interview process based on eight financial and seven qualitative criteria such as valuing human relationships, teamwork, fighting complacency and attacking big social problems, etc. 

Mr. Ravi Abeysuriya who chaired the Panel of Judges in his speech at the event stated that the differentials in the scores received by the top ten companies were waferthin. As a result, after much deliberation, the judges decided not to rank the top 10, as the 10 companies emerged from many industry sectors and sizes.

Speaking at the event, Mr. Jawahar Vadivelu, President of ICC India said, “It is a great and deserving recognition for this evening’s 10 awardees to be chosen by the ICC Sri Lanka and CIMA to be amongst the most admired companies. In the context that companies operate in today, where the operating environment is in a constant state of flux, where the dynamics of competition are so severe, and in a world that is constantly being disrupted by the forces of technology, climate change, customer preferences and geo-politics, the pace at which companies need to keep evolving to sustain themselves and keep themselves relevant, is by itself great challenging. So, for these companies, to have remained on top of the constant forces of disruption, and to be regarded as admirable, is a singular honour, that deserves to be recognized and applauded.”

It is their attitude towards the performance of their duties, placing the customer above all, caring about the environment, their colleagues and fellow citizens that sets DFCC apart.

I am proud to say that DFCC's core values closely identify with the practices of transparency, credibility, trust and value creation. The DFCC of today is progressing on a foundation based on capital strength and an agility fostered by four pillars – its employees, its financial technology, its franchise and a mindset of being a pioneer, a pathfinder and a trailblazer. Many of these traits are intangible ones, but they are understood and appreciated by our ever-widening customer base. I am committed to taking DFCC forward and to ensure that it keeps growing!"
