State Minister for Defense, Ruwan Wijewardene today assured that the probe on the alleged abduction and killing of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda would be carried out in a manner which would not affect any intelligence officers.
He gave this assurance in response to a question asked by opposition MP Jayantha Samaraweera in Parliament. The state minister said he had already spoken to the intelligence officers and they had informed him that they were not at all affected by any inquiries.
The state minister said several suspects arrested in connection with the case had been released while four security personnel were still in custody.
Mr. Samaraweera said the intelligence officers were frustrated with the probe on Eknaligoda. He said fate of this case would be similar to that of the Millennium City controversy where valuable information was leaked out to the LTTE.
Minister Wijewardene said the MP should not compare the Eknaligoda case with the Millennium City incident. (Yohan Perera)
