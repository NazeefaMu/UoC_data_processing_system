The air traffic controllers had suspended their work-to-rule campaign, which commenced yesterday after the Subject Minister assured a favourable response for their issues within a week, Air Traffic Controllers’ Association Vice President Tharindu Gajadeera said.

He said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva had admitted that there was an anomaly in the payment of allowances and promised to provide a favourable reply within a week.

 “The interim committee appointed by the Minister will meet tomorrow to discuss the issues. If the Minister failed to provide positive solution we will continue our campaign again,” Mr. Gajadeera said.

He also said the affected services had returned to normal this evening. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
