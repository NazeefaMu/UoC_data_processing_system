Trade Union action would be taken again after the GCE O/L examinations if the Presidential Committee failed to provide solutions to their demands, Railway Operations Supervisory Union (ROSU) Convener Lal Ariyaratne said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror today he said a discussion was held at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday morning with the committee.

Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam were present as committee members to discuss the issues with the Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA).

“We have confidences in the Committee members. Somehow if they fail to provide solutions that they have promised due to any external influences, we will definitely continue our strike after the O/L examinations,” Mr. Ariyaratne said.  

The RTUA resorted to strike from Thursday (7) midnight demanding the Government to abolish the Act under which Assistant Engine Drivers are recruited at a higher salary scales.

The RTUA said it went against the existing Railway Department’s recruitment procedures. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
