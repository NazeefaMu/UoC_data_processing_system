Britain’s Daily Mail, Newsweek and German business magazine ‘Manager Magazin’ reported the Germany’s Deutsche Bank had evidence of suspicious transactions related to Jared Kushner’s -President Trump’s son-in-law- family accounts and was prepared to hand it over to Russia Probe Special Counsel Mueller.   


Newsweek quoted German business magazine Manager Magazin reporting in its print edition on Friday that Board Chairman of the banking giant Deutsche Bank, Paul Achleitner, had called for an internal investigation and found troubling results.   


The report said “... Deutsche Bank—a major lender to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law and senior White House advisor Kushner, according to Mother Jones—provided the results to the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which is Germany’s bank regulatory agency and referred to as BaFin”.   


The bank gave Kushner Companies a $285million loan last year, and has extended a line of credit valued at up to $25million to Kushner and his mother, the New York Times reported before Christmas. Deutsche Bank has also loaned entities associated with the Trump Organization around $300 million, according to reports published in the Mail on Sunday.   


Earlier this month, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon predicted Mueller would go after Kushner (Compiled by Daily Mirror)
