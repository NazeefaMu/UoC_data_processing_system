Full Statement

Colombo, November 06 2016:  Honouring its commitment to absorb many as possible of Mihin Lanka employees, SriLankan Airlines recently inducted two batches of Mihin Lanka cabin crew comprising more than 50 employees. The visibly overjoyed young men and women were presented their letters of appointment in Katunayake recently.

SriLankan will continue providing opportunities to as many Mihin Lanka staff as can be accommodated, giving due consideration to the operational requirements of SriLankan, up to the time that Mihin Lanka’s business operations come to an end on 31st December 2016.

The induction of Mihin staff to SriLankan is being carried out according to SriLankan’s recruitment processes with constant dialogue between SriLankan’s management and Mihin employees. All Mihin Lanka staff members who are not offered the opportunity to join SriLankan will be provided a service severance package according to specified government guidelines, details of which have already been shared with all employees of Mihin Lanka.

The Government of Sri Lanka took a policy decision to discontinue the services of the lossmaking budget airline, as part of its long-term strategy to restructure Sri Lanka’s aviation industry and strengthen SriLankan Airlines’ new strategy of focusing on travel markets in Asia and the Middle East.

Mihin Lanka operated its last flight on 29th October 2016, with all of its 10 routes being upgraded by SriLankan to full service operations, as opposed to budget flights. SriLankan thus added Seychelles, Bahrain, Muscat, Jakarta, Madurai, Kolkata, Lahore, Dhaka, Varanasi and Bodh Gaya to its global route network. With a new service to be launched to Gan island in the Maldives on 2nd December 2016, SriLankan’s route network will span 101 destinations in 47 countries. Its membership in the prestigious global airline alliance oneworld also connects it to the oneworld network of more than 1,000 destinations in 160 countries.
