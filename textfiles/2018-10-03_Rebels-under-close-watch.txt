Rebels under close watch!


	



 

The former Green party secretarial one, reduced to a nonentity following his miscalculated somersault, however, is not a politico prepared to go into oblivion.

 


He is reportedly busy these days meeting like-minded people and holding discussions to launch a new political party. He is said to be making overtures to his former Green colleagues, especially those known to be carrying a chip on their shoulder.


The Green high-ups who had received intelligence about the former secretarial one’s persistent bid to hook a few unhappy Green bucks have now deployed several spies to monitor the movements of the party rebels, they say.


Meanwhile, the Green backbenchers who have come to know that they are under close watch are nowadays being careful not to answer a call from the former secretarial one or to be seen anywhere he is present for that matter. Among these wary backbenchers are also the radicals who had once looked set to wage a do-or-die battle against the party chief, they say.
