Provincial Councillor Hirunika Premachandra who attended the hearing of the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra case said filing the case in the High Court was a great achievement.
Ms. Premachandra said she would not rest until those responsible for her father’s death were brought to justice.
“We didn’t have faith of anything happening under the previous government, but I believe justice will be meted out,” she said.
