The B Sample of cricketer Kusal Janith Perera had also tested positive for banned substances and therefore, he might face a 4-year suspension from cricket, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said Kusal might face a maximum of 4-year suspension if the ICC decided.
“However, the government will make a plea to the ICC to reduce the time period of suspension, if it decided to suspend Kusal,” the Minister said.
Kusal was recalled from New Zealand by the SLC in early December after a sample he provided for random drug testing had yielded a positive result for a banned substance.
