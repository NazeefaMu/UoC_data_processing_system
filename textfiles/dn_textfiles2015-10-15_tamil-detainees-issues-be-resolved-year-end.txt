Tamil detainees' issues to be resolved before year end

Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa yesterday promised to resolve all issues of Tamil detainees, including those of some LTTE suspects before the end of this year. The Minister made this promise after meeting with a group of inmates at the New Magazine Prison in Welikada, Rajagiriya.
A prison officer said that the hunger strike by Tamil detainees including some LTTE suspects is continuing for the fourth day urging the government to facilitate their release.
He also said that around 150 detainees at the Colombo Magazine Prison, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Jaffna and several other prisons are engaged in the hunger strike.
