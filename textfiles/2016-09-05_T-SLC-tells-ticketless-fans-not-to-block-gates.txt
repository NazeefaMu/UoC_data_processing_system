Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said today the tickets for tomorrow’s Sri Lanka vs Australia 1st T20 game in Pallekele was sold out.

It advised fans, who did not have tickets for the match, to avoid crowding the gates as there were no more tickets for sale.

“No tickets will be available at the gate on the day of the match. Only ticket holders will be allowed into the stadium,” SLC said in a statement.

Earlier, a group of cricket fans who failed to purchase tickets for the fourth ODI between Sri Lanka and Australia behaved in an unruly manner outside the Rangiri- Dambulla International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.

Police had to fire teargas to disperse the angry fans.
