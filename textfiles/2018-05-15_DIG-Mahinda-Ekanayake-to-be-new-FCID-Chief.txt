Central Province DIG Mahinda Ekanayake will be promoted as a Senior DIG and be appointed as the Head of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) for a period of two months, the National Police Commission (NPC) said yesterday.

NPC Chairman P.H. Manatunga told Daily Mirror that Senior DIG Ravi Waidyalankara retired from service yesterday and would be replaced by DIG Mahinda Ekanayake.

“DIG Ekanayake is also due to retire from service in about two months will be promoted Senior DIG prior to being appointed as FCID Chief,” he said.

It is learned that a Cabinet paper had been submitted seeking approval to employ Mr. Waidyalankara on contract basis.

NPC Chairman said Senior DIG Waidyalankara could be reinstated on a contractual basis to his previous position if cabinet approval is granted for such an appointment after the retirement of DIG Mahinda Ekanayake.

Earlier, the NPC turned down a recommendation by IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the Law and Order Ministry to send the SDIG Waidyalankara on retirement subject to disciplinary inquiries.

The Ministry and the IGP also recommended that he be paid pension benefits upon conclusion of disciplinary inquiries.

There is presently an ongoing inquiry against the FCID head by the Special Police Investigative Unit in addition to a probe by the Bribery Commission. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
