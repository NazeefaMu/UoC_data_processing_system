Three unidentified men on motorbikes pretending to be Special Task Force (STF) personnel are reported to have robbed Rs.1.2 million from a businessman in Weligama yesterday, Police said.   

They said the 49-year-old businessman was robbed at a lonely spot while on his way home.

The fake STF personnel had told the businessman they had come to check him after receiving a tip-off that he possessed narcotics.

They had later fled the scene of the crime with the cash. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)
