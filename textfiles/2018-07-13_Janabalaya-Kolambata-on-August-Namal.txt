‘Janabalaya Kolambata,’ a massive anti-government protest campaign organised by the joint opposition, will be held on August 17 in Colombo, MP Namal Rajapaksa said today.

Addressing a news briefing, MP Rajapaksa said the joint opposition, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the Podujana Youth Front would gather a large crowd and bring them to Colombo on August 17.

“The protest will be held against the government’s arbitrary actions, selling of national assets and weak fiscal policies which have resulted in the collapse of the economy. We will voice against the lawless nature that has allowed the underworld to thrive. Fishermen as well as farmers who cultivate pepper, cinnamon, tea, rubber and chena have become victims of this government’s arbitrary actions. More details including the venue and time of the protest will be notified soon,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
