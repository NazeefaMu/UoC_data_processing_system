Combating corruption, improving governance

Corruption and Governance was uppermost in minds of most during the two elections held in the country last year. Whilst responses have been seen, perceptions on the success is subject of mixed reviews. In some quarters there is now growing impact of corruption on the country.
Corruption has debilitating and corrosive effects on progress, stability and development of the continent. It impedes economic growth by discouraging foreign investments, creates distortion in resource allocation and competitive markets, increases the cost of doing business, and reduces the net-value of public spending. It also reduces the quality of services and public infrastructure and the volume of tax revenues, and encourages the misappropriation and misallocation of scarce resources. In the political realm, it undermines the rule of law, respect for human rights, accountability and transparency and weakens government institutions. This in turn erodes public legitimacy in government and compromises good governance.
The public sector is often vilified as being inept, corrupt and inefficient and the private sector regarded as the most efficient, reliable and implicitly less corrupt sector of the economy. However, this assumption is not necessarily correct. The private sector can also be a haven of corruption, and in some instances, even worse than the public sector. The private sector also often times is in league with the public sector on corruption in the latter sector.
Features
Definitions of corruption abound, but the most commonly used one refers to the abuse of a public position for private gain. Corruption is facilitated by bribery, embezzlement and theft but also by nepotism and cronyism. Corruption affects both the private and public sectors and is often subdivided into grand and petty corruption which ranges from the provision of small 'gifts' in the former to the misappropriation of public assets at the highest levels in the latter. Further classifications distinguish between incidental, institutional and systemic corruption and between political and bureaucratic corruption.
The size and incidence of corruption might be attributed to four key factors:
(i) the level of public benefits available; (ii) the discretionary power of officials; (iii) the level of risk associated with corrupt deals; (iv) the relative bargaining power of the corruptor and corruptee (Rose-Ackerman 1997).
In terms of the causes of corruption, experts representing higher and lower income countries are unanimous on the three most important causes of corruption and in general agreement on the importance of a number of other factors. These are: norms and values of politicians and public servants; lack of control, supervision, auditing; interrelationships - business, politics, state.
It is argued that corruption is in fact largely self- sustaining as a result of the action and reaction of certain elements within a given society. Key elements include payments to political parties and control over appointments which can increase the number of civil servants on lower salaries.
Responses
First, interventionism, in which the relevant authorities wait for the corrupt action to occur and then intervene to capture and punish the offender. This school stimulates retribution, rehabilitation and deterrence but there remain a number of obstructive variables including: the harm has already occurred and cannot be undone; the majority of crimes remain unreported;the demand on finite resources will inevitably be infinite given the degree of supervision necessary to ensure that the deterrence effect operates.
Second, managerialism, in which those individuals or agencies seeking to engage in corrupt behaviour can be discouraged or prevented from doing so by establishing appropriate systems, procedures and protocols. In essence, managerialism advocates the reduction or elimination of opportunities such that those who generally benefit from them cease to be able to do so. There are limitations with this school of thought also, key amongst which are the fact that individuals do not necessarily operate according to the predetermined principles of managerialism.
Organisations contain three broad categories of people who will react differently to corrupt influences:
Category I: people who want to do the right thing and require guidance on how to achieve this
Category II: people who are too timid to take the risk of operating outside set rules
Category III: people who are corrupt and will operate outside of the rules entirely.
Managerialism attempts to provide one set of rules to deter a number of differently motivated individuals. The consequences of this approach are that the success of the anti-corruption effort is fragmented, intercepting the less scheming corruptee but not the more damaging highly planned exploits of others. Equally, managerialist control of corruption ignores market forces. If, for example, public officials are approached to provide confidential information in exchange for money, some may deem the risk too great and refuse. Those who are willing to engage in the activity however, will be able to raise the price of that information which will increase the attractiveness of corruption and sustain its existence.
Finally, organisational integrity which involves the integration of an organisation's operational systems, corruption control strategies and ethical standards so that a norm of ethical behaviour is created. This school of thought presupposes that deviance stems from the organisation rather than the individuals of which it is comprised, as if the breach of ethics involved in corrupt practices occurs almost by osmosis from the malfeasant organisation to the innocent individual within it. Arguably, targeting individuals in anti-corruption efforts is likely to be less successful than targeting the organisational context in which individuals operate. Equivalent examples of individual malfeasance within an organisational dynamic can be seen in corporate crime cases. It has been suggested that the organisation must provide a structural framework that removes the possibility of corrupt practices. In short, the ability of the individual to interpret the rules or to decide whether to apply a particular protocol should be circumvented by a system which cannot be manipulated (Larmour and Wolanin 2001)
Strategies
Huberts (1998) has distinguished six strategies:
Economic - emphasises the need for the economic stimuli for corruption to be reduced and suggests that such might be achieved by, inter alia, paying higher civil service salaries;
Educational - aims at altering the attitudes and values of the populace and civil servants alike via training and education campaigns and engagement of the media;
Cultural - ensuring that the behaviour and attitudes of those in power are subject to stringent codes of conduct and their behaviour filters down to civil servants;
Organisational or bureaucratic - strengthening internal control systems such as auditing to detect corrupt activity, and staff rotation to reduce the propensity for individuals to establish themselves in entrenched corruption;
Political - increasing in transparency in terms, for example, of the monitoring of party finances and more broadly, a clearer and more definite separation of powers in terms of the judiciary and the state;
Judicial or repressive measures - advocates harsher penalties for corrupt practices but also the creation of independent anti-corruption agencies.
There is a gap in the response of Government to fight corruption on a broad front. For example when public institutions make losses due to corruption it is the Treasury which ultimately bears the losses. Practically one wonders the challenge of the Budget division to foresee losses whilst estimating growth in the country.
Whether we have institutions who would crusade for change which eradicates the menace is left to be soon. The malaise is deep seated and corrosive. If we are not careful money will ultimately takeover our systems. It does not have too much to do given current indications.
