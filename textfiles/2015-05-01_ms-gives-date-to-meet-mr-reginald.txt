SLFP MP Reginald Cooray said President Maithripala Sirisena had given a date to meet former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to resolve differences between them.
Speaking at the SLFP May Day rally at Hyde Park, Mr. Cooray said the marriage between Maithri and Mahinda will be a success. 
“We are not slaves of the UNP. The Next May Day will be celebrated under a SLFP government,” he said.
SLFP MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said it was a joke for the UNP which removed SLFP appointees from government institutions to celebrate May Day.
“We should use this May Day rally as a turning point to form a SLFP government at the next election under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and the support of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
