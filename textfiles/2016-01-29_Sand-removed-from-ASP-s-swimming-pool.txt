The sand placed in the swimming pool at Sri Lanka Labour Party Leader and Businessman A.S.P. Liyanage’s residence in Rajagiriya was removed this morning under the supervision of Colombo Crime Division (CCD) Chief Vijith Gunaratne and the Rajagiriya Police.
Mr. Liyanage had on an earlier occasion complained to the police about reports that gold and cash bags were hidden under sand.
He requested the IGP to investigate whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had hidden the gold and cash packed in polythene bags before placing them in the swimming pool. However, no gold or cash bags were found from the pool today.
