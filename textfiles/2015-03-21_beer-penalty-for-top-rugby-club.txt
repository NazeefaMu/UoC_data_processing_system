The Colombo Excise Department City Office yesterday raided the CR&FC Club in Colombo and seized a large stock of illicit beer worth more than Rs.90 million.
The Excise sleuths operating on a special directive of the Excise Commissioner General L.K.G. Gunawardena to check all licensed liquor sellers conducted a random search on this well-known club on Wednesday.
 
A decoy sent by the Department found that several bottles of a foreign brand of beer being openly displayed at the club’s bar and when inquired a large stock was found inside the liquor storeroom.
Excise Department Spokesman Prabath Jayawickrama said 8,758 bottles of 49 brands of Belgium beer were discovered making it the largest ever detection of beer by the Sri Lanka Excise Department.
Cases contained bottles of 330ml and 250ml under the brand name La Trappe, Leffe and Bar Bar which had been sold defying the license regulations of selling unauthorized imported beverages.
The club management had said that they had no idea whether the selling of this particular type of beer was illegal because they attracted a number of European tourists. A bottle of beer had been sold at between Rs.900 to Rs.1,100.
The department has identified the supplier of the illicitly imported beer to the country and a special team had been deployed to arrest the responsible parties.

Tillekaratne and Keerthi Ariyapala, Excise Sergeant Ranura Najith Singh, Excise Guards Danuka Sampath, Malinda Suriarachchi and Damith Dissanayake made the detection under the instructions of Crimes Excise Commissioner Wasantha Dissanayake and Assistant Excise Commissioner B.A. Dayaratne.
