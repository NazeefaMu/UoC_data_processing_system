Seya Sadewmi’s mother yesterday requested all media outlets to refrain from publishing Seya’s photographs in the future as the court proceedings for the murder of her daughter had concluded.


She spoke to the media at the Negombo High Court yesterday, after the court ordered the suspect Saman Jayalath, who was found guilty of the charge of murdering five-year-old Seya, was handed a death sentence.
