	Trade Union action scheduled to be launched tomorrow will not postpone ongoing GCE O/L exams Examinations Commissioner General Jayantha Pushpakumara said today.
	However, he requested candidates arrive as early as possible.
	Pushpakumara admitted that several trade unions in the education sector had requested he postpone the exam due to action that was to be taken.  
	“It is not possible to postpone the examination as everything has been finalized. Aesthetic subjects will be held tomorrow morning as scheduled following literature in the evening,” he said.
	Mr. Pushpakumara said he had informed the SLTB Chairman to deploy buses to examination centers in the event there was a bus strike in the morning. He said most of the centers were situated in close proximity to where students lived. “Therefore, I think transport will not become an issue,” he said.
	Meanwhile, he said that no official engaged in examination duties had informed him that they would join the strike tomorrow. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
