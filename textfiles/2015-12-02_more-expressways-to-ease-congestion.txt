	Several expressways had been proposed to be built in the Western Province to bypass the Colombo city to ease the day-to-day traffic congestions, the City Planning and Water Supply State Minister Sudarshini Fernandopulle said today.
	“An expressway from Borella to Kaduwela had been proposed to be built to ease the traffic while another was proposed from Kelaniya connecting the Colombo Katunayaka Expressway,” she said.
	“The number of vehicles on the road had increased during the past six months. Public transportation system had not been developed as development occurred in the country’s middle class.
	“Old transportation systems are still operational in the country with old trains and old buses. That is why most of the people are trying to drive their own vehicle which adds to the heavy traffic on the roads.
	“The government is also thinking ‘Park and Ride’ concept again while developing the public transport system in the Colombo city,” she said.
	“As the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) we request the government to remove the tax on zero emission electric vehicles, which had been proposed in the budget 2016. That is because it is essential to protect the environment pollution.
	“Meanwhile several proposals have been launched to develop selected hundred towns in the country’s Pradeshiya Sabha and Urban Council areas,” she said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
