Debate on Judicature (Amendment) Bill on May 9


	

The debate on the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will be taken up in Parliament on Wednesday, Deputy Chief Government Whip Ajith Perera said yesterday.

He said this at the opening of the new auditorium of the Divisional Secretariat Office in Milleneiya last morning.

“We will enact the Judicature (Amendment) Bill which provides provisions to set up a trial-a-bar despite whatever the obstacles that might come our way. The legislation will make the judiciary efficient as the new trial-at-bar will sit daily and hear cases on corruption. The Judiciary in this county is inefficient and the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will takes this inefficiency away,” Mr. Perera said.

Commenting on the arrest of the President’s Chief of Staff by the bribery commission on Thursday, he said this government had created a culture where action was taken even against high level government officials who are corrupt.

“Only politicians were known for corruption earlier but the arrest of the President’s Chief of Staff had clearly shown that even government officials are corrupt,” Mr. Perera said.

“Corruption in this could be stopped only if the old thieves and the new ones are brought to book. We will penalise the old thieves and the new alike," he added. (Yohan Perera)
