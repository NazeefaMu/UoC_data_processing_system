The Sri Lanka Air Force said its Mi-17 helicopter, which was forced to land in a flooded area in Baddegama on May 29 after a technical failure, during rescue and relief operations will be removed from service.

An SLAF source said the Air Force usually did not operate helicopters which had crashed or forced to land on water.

It had deployed seven Mi-17 helicopters, three Bell-212 helicopters and one Bell-412 helicopter for relief and rescue operations during the recent landslide and flood disaster.

However, no casualties were reported in the accident and all crew members on board the helicopter escaped unhurt.

The helicopter was dismantled and the parts removed to the Koggala Air Force camp for repairs.

Meanwhile, SLAF Spokesman Gihan Senaviratne said he could not comment on the matter because of an ongoing inquiry.

Mi-17 is a medium twin-turbine Russian transport helicopter designed for troop transport and supply operations and was inducted to the SLAF in 1993. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
