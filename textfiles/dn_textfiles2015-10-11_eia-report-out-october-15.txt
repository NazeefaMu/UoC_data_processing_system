Colombo Port City Development Project
EIA report out before October 15

The crucial Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report of the Colombo Port City Development Project will be released on or before October 15, Coastal Conservation Department (CCD) Director General Prabath Chandrakeerthi said.
He said the department has been informed that the EIA was nearing completion.
“When we get the report, we will refer it to a Technical Committee of the Department, and with their recommendations will forward it to the Special Committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister appointed to review the project,” he said.
Chandrakeerthi observed the Terms of Reference (ToR) that laid the guidelines as to what should be included in the EIA was compiled by the CCD jointly with the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).
He pointed out they would specifically look for areas which were not covered by the previous EIA report, adding that the CCD is the authorised agency to issue the permit for the project.
“The previous EIA had only covered an area of 200 hectares, whereas the entire project site extends to 270 hectares. A separate environmental assessment should be carried out for the area where they will obtain sand for the project. We have been informed that sea sand would be used for the purpose. The impact of the breakwater to be constructed near the port city will also be analyzed,” he said.
Chandrakeerthi said the CCD has given instructions to the Urban Development Ministry as to how the EIA should be carried out, adding that the ministry has forwarded it to the Chinese company undertaking the project.
“As we know the EIA was carried out by the company with the consultation of Moratuwa University,” he added.
Chandrakeerthi said the high level review committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister also includes the Secretaries to the Environment and Mahaweli Development Ministry and Urban Development Ministry, Urban Development Authority Chairman and Director General, and representatives of the Attorney General Department and CEA.
Meanwhile, the Chinese government’s Special Envoy and Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Liu Zhenmin called on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe among others during an official visit to Sri Lanka last week.
The agreement for the Colombo Port City Development Project signed between the Sri Lankan government and the relevant project company was extended by another six months from September 15 with the approval of the Cabinet.
