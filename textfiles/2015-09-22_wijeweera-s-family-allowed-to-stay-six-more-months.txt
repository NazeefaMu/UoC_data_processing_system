Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) founder Rohana Wijeweera's family has been allowed to stay at the naval quarters for another six months following President Maithripala Sirisena’s directions.
The family was asked to hand over the navy quarters from October 1 following the Security Council’s decision in February saying that there was no security threat and situation in the country had returned to normalcy.
Navy spokesman Indika De Silva said Mr. Wijeweera's family had been living in Trincomalee and Welisara Naval Quarters from time to time since July, 11, 1992.
Commander De Silva said as per the decision the family would be allowed to stay till March 31 next year.
