Joint opposition visits Yoshitha and four others at Welikada


	

At least fifteen members of the joint opposition including Dinesh Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Gamini Lokuge, Bandula Gunawardana, Dallas Allahapperuma and Johnston Fernando visited Yoshitha Rajapaksa and the four others remanded at the Welikada prison.


They were remanded on Saturday on charges of a financial fraud at Carlton Sports Network (CSN).


Parliamentarians Pavitra Wanniarachchi, Rohitha Abeygunawardana, Udaya Gammanpila, C.B. Ratnayaka and Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene were also among those who visited them.


Speaking to the media outside the Welikada prison, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the current regime is taking revenge from Yoshitha and the others because it was unable to hurt former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.


“The five in remand custody can be described as political prisoners because they were remanded for political reasons and were arrested according to a political plan,” he said.


Mr. Weerawansa said Yoshitha was innocent because he did not hold any post in the CSN. “Even Yoshitha’s name is not mentioned in any official document,” he said. “He has been remanded on false allegations to keep Mahinda Rajapaksa out of politics.”(Darshana Sanjeewa)
