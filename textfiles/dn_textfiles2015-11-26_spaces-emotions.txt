Spaces with emotions

"The importance of creating is evoking emotions. If you can make a space that can evoke a person's emotions and you can feel it in your five senses, that is where an architect becomes successful."
Evoking emotions through architecture got into her blood relatively late during her education. Initially, her parents wanted her to become a doctor. However, Peshali Perera had other ideas. In doing so, the field of architecture gained a fine and wise architect. Arch World features Peshali Perera, who has provided us with insights into the art of making spaces.
The first and second years at the University of Moratuwa Architectural Faculty seemed a little lax. Campus life was not ideal as the attention one gets is less. But Perera received the much needed confidence and encouragement from very good tutors who lectured her batch in the third year. With her designs being appreciated, she felt sure of herself and felt great about her work. Since then she has never looked back.
A person's religiosity can play a great role in creating spaces. One's beliefs about the human spirit or the soul can have an impact on architecture. Architecture can be secular and it can be spiritual. The next life has a bearing on the architecture in this lifetime. Call it Karma or call it God - the answers humans search in their journey of self- discovery must also be incorporated in the designs of his or her earthly abode.
"A spiritual space is subjective to a person's personality. He or she may want a spiritual space where he or she can experience certain things. An architect has to understand what a person needs to experience in a particular space. A person may need a space to contemplate or be calm. He/she may want dim lighting or require fresh air. Accordingly, we research to provide the required environment or ambience. You don't have to invent the wheel. There are certain things that we can look at and be inspired. We study those things and create that space for the client," Perera said.

Spirituality aside, if you are lackadaisical about architecture, you won't make it to the top.
"If you don't have the passion, you can never do architecture. It is a tedious course and a tedious way of life. Throughout your education and practice, you need a lot of involvement. This is because it has to do with someone else's taste. You need to respond to people, the climate and community. It is personal, climatic and social," Perera added.
Getting into someone's shoes seems to be something that she is adept at. "People have different aspirations and lives. Personalities differ. You have to understand somebody personally and get into their shoes to understand what they need. There are buildings which need to respond to the climate, social context and community. But the building will be used by people. If the buildings do not address the issues of a person, they won't work. If it doesn't evoke the emotions of a person, that building might not work," Perera pointed out.
The idea of learning architecture is to learn things related to people. This can be challenging and is a never-ending process of learning because the world is constantly changing.
"The spaces are always related to a need. This is necessary for the building to function. If I am designing a house, it needs to feel like a house. It should not feel like a spiritual space. Some people can come up with the idea that they want the house to be a spiritual space. But primarily, you respond to a function. If it is a house, it needs to have the proper privacy. It needs to have the proper spaces so you can feel relaxed. Spaces are all created in accordance with the necessity of that moment," Perera said.
If it is a community building, we want people to come and interact with each other. Therefore, you need to create a comfortable space where a person can come and interact freely. It should not be forced.
When you build a house, you build a secure future for those dearest to you. You build an enclosure that protects your loved ones. It is more than walls and a roof. It contains memories. Above all, it is trust and unity. It is sacred to you and your family.
"Most people have all kinds of ideas when it comes to building houses. Either they have seen it in a magazine or they have come across similar creations in another house. These ideas are a part of their lifestyles. You have to understand their lifestyles. You are not designing a house but you are designing a lifestyle. That is what we believe in. The little things they say are a part of their lifestyle. Therefore, it is important to identify their lifestyle to recreate into the design," Perera said.
