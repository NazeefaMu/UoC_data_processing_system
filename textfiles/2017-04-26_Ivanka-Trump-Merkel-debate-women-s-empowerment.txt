DPA, 25th APRIL, 2017- White House adviser Ivanka Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were among delegates discussing women’s economic and professional empowerment and notions of feminism at the Women20 Summit in Berlin on Tuesday.


The panel brought together Trump and Merkel for the second time since the 35-year-old’s billionaire father, Donald Trump, took office as US president in February and comes at a time when many are still trying to gauge Washington’s foreign and domestic policy stance.
