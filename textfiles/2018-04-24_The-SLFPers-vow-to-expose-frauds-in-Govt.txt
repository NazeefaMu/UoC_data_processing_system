Former Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today the 16 former SLFP ministers, state and deputy ministers who quit the yahapalana government would soon expose the frauds and misdeeds of the members of the government.

When asked why they were now going public with these allegations, he said they were earlier bound by collective Cabinet responsibility and the concept of decency and therefore were not in a position to expose the wrongdoings of the SLFP and UNP members in the Cabinet.

The MP said the SLFP Central Committee was expected to meet last night at the official residence of President Maithripala Sirisena and approve their stance on this matter.

When asked why these 16 SLFPers voted for the no-confidence motion having been members of this government for more than two years, he said it was the SLFP that made every effort to highlight the Central Bank bond scam.

“It was the UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera who first complained to the Bribery Commission about the bond scam. Then we were instrumental in urging the President to appoint a 11-member parliamentary committee to probe the scandal. The no-confidence motion was based on the recommendations of that committee,” the MP said.

He said the meeting between the President and three members of the group of 16 SLFP MPs in London was a success, the MP said the discussions were focused on the future of the SLFP and that of the 16 former SLFP ministers, state and deputy ministers.

He told a media conference the three SLFPers had informed the President that they would sit as an independent group in Parliament from May 8 when it is re-convened.

“The 16 of us will sit in Parliament as an independent SLFP group under the President. Despite speculation by certain media groups, none of us would join the UNP or the SLPP. But I hope a number of UNP members will join us on the 8th,” the MP said.

He said the sole objective of the SLFP rebel group was to topple the yahapalana government before 2020 or form a SLFP government after the 2020 general election. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
