A grateful citizen gifts a house
	
	
	The deposed Big Boss has yet to get an official residence in the city or a suburb. As he has no residence of his own in the city or close to it, the deposed Big Boss had been staying in the official residence of his elder brother presiding over the Diyawanna House whenever he had occasion to visit the city.
Given that his elder brother is the holder of a highly respected non-partisan top office in the country, using his official residence for political powwows is against tradition. Taking cognizance of this fact, the deposed Big Boss has been looking for a suitable house to be taken on rent.
Meanwhile, a leading medical doctor who had heard about the deposed Big Boss hunt for a house on rent had soon called him. Sir, I have a well-furnished bungalow with all amenities, located in an ideal environment for you to stay whenever you visit the city, he told the deposed Big Boss. This bungalow is yours as long as you want. I am making this offer as a citizen grateful to you for assuring us of the most precious freedom  freedom from fear.
The deposed Big Boss will shortly move into this bungalow in Nugegoda area, they say.

Battle he started is doomed to fail
	
	A section in the Blue party proposed to the new Big Boss that the aggressive Doctor be considered for a key office in the party.
The new Big Boss had no reason to take exception to this proposal. After all, he could not forget how hard the Doctor campaigned for his victory. The proposal was duly presented, but it drew a howl of protests from a group of seniors in the party. They charged that the Doctor, going on his past record could switch to another party at the drop of his hat and therefore was not reliable.
Meanwhile, a Diyawanna member, a former holder of the fisheries portfolio who had occasion to clash with the Doctor had decided to fish in troubled waters. He prepared a long list of past acts of commission and omission on the part of the Doctor to be handed over to the new Big Boss.
The latest reports say that the Doctors rival from Gampaha has started a losing battle.

Cannot ignore hands of affection-MR
	
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a message to those who attended the massive rally in Nugegoda on Wednesday urging him to return to active politics said he could not ignore the hands of honour and affection extended to him by the people and the leadership forces of the UPFA led by the SLFP.
	
	The message read out to the applause of a large crowd by former ambassador and academic Dr. Dayan Jayathilaka said: I would like to emphasise that I cannot ignore the aspirations of the people who think about the country and had dedicated themselves for the country. I would like to state again that I would embrace with honour and comradely the hands of comradeship extended by the people and the leadership forces of the UPFA led by the SLFP.
	The message said that the thing he told the people who came to meet him was that what he suffered was not a defeat but the result of a conspiracy.
	I do not hesitate to accept the defeat as a defeat because it is not new to me and disgrace is not new to me either. Even jail is not new to me. All of you know that I have undergone all of them for your sake, he said in the message.
	He said that what the country was experiencing today was not a defeat but the outcome of the conspiracy against the country.
	This is clear when you consider the two-thirds majority of the Opposition in parliament. I challenge the opponents of the country to state that they had obtained a great victory with their heads straight. I emphasise to them that enjoying the benefits of a shrewd agenda is not a victory, he said.
	Meanwhile, speaking at the rally, National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said they called on the people who were disgusted by voting for the Swan to come forward to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the prime minister to save the country from the clutches of the Western forces.
	The creation of a federal government is imminent in the country and the unitary state of the country is in danger under the present government. We must make Mahinda Rajapaksa the prime minister to save the country. We will go to every city with this national struggle to achieve that goal, he told some thousands of supporters.
	Due to the rally, the roads passing through Nugegoda junction were closed for few hours, as the thousands of supporters filled the roads.
	The rally was organised to promote former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as the UPFA prime ministerial candidate at the next general elections.
	Mr. Weerawansa said what existed the country today was not a national government but Ranils government, where Maithripala Sirisena was president in name only.
	If this is Sirisenas government why are SLFPers being attacked and transferred This is not a Sirisena government, he said.
	He said that for country to be properly governed and developed, Mahinda Rajapaksa should be made the prime minister, adding that he did not lose and would never be defeated.
	Mr. Weerawansa said the government had deceived the government servants by promising to increase their salaries by Rs. 10 000 but had failed to do so while reducing the prices of inessential items even though they had promised to reduce the prices of essential items.
	No one will be able to stop this peoples force by mudslinging campaigns and insults. Mahinda Rajapaksa is living in Medamulana.
	He has no place to live in Colombo. He did not earn property but he earned people. people have lost faith in the government in 30 days how will things be after the next 40 days he asked.
	Mr. Weerawansa said the government was making false allegations against the previous government regarding corruption but had not been able to prove any of them.
	Where are the helicopters, Lamborghinis and golden horses they spoke of They keep on saying my wife would be arrested but they have not even taken a statement from her, he said.
	Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Western Provincial Councillor Udaya Gammanpila said it was the day when Provincial Councilor Azath Salley would leave politics as he had promised to do so if 5000 people came to the rally.
	Mr. Gammanpila said a separatist agenda was in operation under the pretext of 100 day programme and said they had predicted before the election that if Maithri won it would be the victory of the LTTE.
	He said that they pressed the government to accept that the LTTE was raising its head again.
	Mr. Gammanpila said the country which was rescued from the LTTE were being looted by the Western forces and the LTTE was raising its head again and requested Mahinda Rajapaksa to return to politics to protect the country.
	MPs Vasudeva Nanayakkara andDinesh Gunawardane, along with Provincial Councillor Udaya Gammanpila and number of UPFA MPs (including T.B. Ekanayake, C.B. Rratnayake, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Vidura Wickremenayake and Jayantha Ketagoda) had come to attend the rally. Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga and WP-PC members, including Upali Kodikara and Roger Seneviratne, were also present.(Ajith Siriwardane)

Corrupt high officials to get their just deserts
	
	
	Many people complain these days that the wheels of justice in the country are turning so slowly that they can no longer believe that the corrupt politicos and high officials who are said to have looted public funds under the previous regime would be brought to book within the 100-day interim rule of the government in office. 
However, an informed source says that plans are now being fast-tracked to haul several top bureaucrats who held key positions under the previous regime before a high-powered anti-sleaze commission of inquiry.
One-time big guns who helmed the Central Bank, the CEB and the Highways Ministry are among the officials due to face the inquisition.
The kingpin of the power sector mafia has skipped the country.
An owner of two mansions among other properties Down Under, the official is not likely to return here on his own in the foreseeable future, they say. However, the authorities are determined to get him extradited with the assistance of Interpol.
Meanwhile, the Highway Ministry bigwig in hot water is said to be seeking the refuge of a young sibling of a VVIP. The sibling was a beneficiary of a lucrative contract awarded for the supply of ornamental stones for road construction. The present indications are that the maxim: one good turn deserves another will work to his benefit.

	UN Chief Ban Ki-Moon is aware that the new Sri Lankan administration is planning to set up a domestic accountability mechanism and will be carefully assessing developments, his spokesman said.
	In response to a question, Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General Farhan Haq said that the Secretary-General is also aware of reactions from various communities to the decision by the Human Rights Council, and the Secretary-General will positively engage with the new Government and support its efforts.
	Transcript
	Question: On the deferral of the Sri Lankan report, what are the details of the Government agreement Is it going to be new access Will the OISL [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Investigation in Sri Lanka] be able to interview senior officials in the army Are they going to be able to examine mass graves And secondly, if these new levels of access yield information implicating Shavendra Silva, will the Secretary-General encourage the Credentials Committee to recommend the General Assembly to reviews General Silva's credentials
	Deputy Spokesman: First of all, in terms of the next steps, the Secretary-General is aware that the new administration is planning to set up a domestic accountability mechanism and will be carefully assessing developments. The Secretary-General, as you're aware, met with the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka last Friday, 13 February, and stressed the importance of Sri Lanka to show firm and clear commitment to accountability, reconciliation and human rights. He also encouraged the Government to engage continuously with the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Advancing accountability, like other parts of the post-war agenda in Sri Lanka, will lay the basis for the country to make further progress on peace, democracy and development. The UN remains committed to support Sri Lankas efforts to address the postwar agenda. The Secretary-General is also aware of reactions from various communities to the decision by the Human Rights Council, and the Secretary-General will positively engage with the new Government and support its efforts. Regarding your question on Mr. Silva, at this stage, that remains hypothetical. We'll have so see what the results of the next steps will be.

	In a media statement the Prime Ministers office said this particular interview would not pose any threat to national security.
	The Customs Department was also advised to contact the Government Information Department in case such a situation arises in the future.

He is to beat a retreat for the second time
	
	This politico better known for his skills legal than for those political was a deputy under the previous regime. He sensed that the tide was turning against that regime and he had his own reasons also to quit the regime. Meanwhile, he suddenly disappeared from the political scene adding new grist to the rumour-mill.
Later it transpired the politico was taking a rest in the City of the Lion. In fact, the politico was trying to make up his mind about his next political move while the ding dong battle for the throne was raging back home.
He returned home to join the winning camp and was later appointed a Minister of State. He felt affronted when his nominees to helm the national airlines and the aviation services which came under his Ministry were overlooked by the Minister at the Cabinet level. He resigned his portfolio by way of giving vent to his chagrin.
The latest reports say that this politico is poised to beat a retreat for the second time. The author of his new trouble is a Deen with a first name that rhymes like wizard. Of course, this one is a political wizard of sorts who made the right political move at the right time unlike the sulking politico who took long to make up his mind.
Deen, the wizard is planning, they say, to encroach the sulking politicos electorate in the city with a view to entering the fray at the coming polls from the Colombo district. And instead of digging in to fight back, the sulking politico has opted to leave the ring, they say.

Lankan molested sleeping girl on flight
	
A Sri Lankan salesman has admitted that he molested a 12-year-old Singaporean girl who was sat next to him on a plane.
On Wednesday, the Criminal Court heard that on November 5 last year, the girl, S K, was on a flight from Singapore to Dubai.
When the cabin lights were dimmed, she fell asleep but soon woke up to find A N was touching her thigh.
I pushed his hand away and told him not to repeat it, then fell asleep again, said the girl.
She said she then awoke again to find him touching her chest and private parts.
He even tried to unbutton my trousers but couldnt. I felt so scared as I was alone on the plane, she said.
I didnt know what to do, especially as he kept repeating what he did all the way to Dubai, she said, adding that he only stopped when the cabin lights were turned on. After this, he tried to start a conversation with her.
When the flight landed at Dubai International Airport, the defendant stalked her. She spotted a police officer and told him what happened.
When the man was arrested, police found he had 1.97 grams of marijuana on him.
He was charged with molestation, consuming alcohol and possessing drugs.
The girls father was waiting for his daughter and said he was surprised to see his daughter accompanied by police.
She was crying and I got scared, said S P, 52, an engineer. I asked the police officer with her what had happened and he said soon I would soon know.
Then on the way to the police office he told me a man had molested my daughter.
He confessed to all charges in court and requested the courts mercy. The verdict will be announced on March 11.(UAE)

Lankan murder suspect eligible for protection visa in Australia
	
	A Sri Lankan man who came to Australia by boat has been found to be eligible for a protection visa, although he is suspected of murder in his home country.
	The man, 36, who fled Sri Lanka while on bail, lied in his protection visa application, saying he was not aware of any investigation that could lead to him being charged.
	Sri Lankas Criminal Investigation Department wrote to the Australian Federal Police in April 2013, saying he was a murder suspect and a warrant had been issued, a tribunal heard.
	The man, a Sri Lankan Tamil, initially claimed he had fled Sri Lanka after being in hiding for a year, after being tortured and beaten by members of the Criminal Investigation Department.
	But he gave another account after he became aware Australian authorities knew of criminal proceedings against him in Sri Lanka, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal heard.
	The man had been arrested, accused of the murder of a pregnant woman who disappeared in 2009, held in custody for weeks and then released.
	The man, who denied committing the murder, said he was being implicated in the murder because of his past complaints about the alleged illegal takeover of his land.
	He said he was tortured by the CID for four days before he was forced to sign a confession in Sinhalese, which he could not understand.
	He said he then spent 18 months in jail before being granted bail and had reported daily for almost two years before leaving Sri Lanka illegally by boat in May, 2012.
	After his arrival in Australia he was held in detention and during two interviews he did not tell Immigration officials he had been held in custody and tortured in Sri Lanka.
	He feared if he was sent back he would be tortured, given an unfair trial and executed.
	Immigration refused his protection visa application in 2013, finding serious reasons for considering he had committed a serious non-political crime before coming to Australia.
	But Tribunal Deputy President James Constance said he was not satisfied that the man had actually been charged with murder and he accepted his claims about his treatment in Sri Lanka.
	He said the mans lies did not prove he had committed the murder and there had been no evidence of murder since the woman disappeared.
	In my view, the evidence falls far short of establishing serious reasons for considering that the applicant committed murder, Mr Constance said.
	He set aside the refusal of the protection visa and sent his application back to the Minister. (couriermail)

Move to form a political troika backfires
	
	Moves are afoot to form a powerful political troika comprising the former Madam, the deposed Big Boss and the new Big Boss with a view to leading the Blues to an easy victory at the general elections round the corner.
A small group of Blue Diyawanna members harbouring fears about their political future is backing this move launched by a motley band of politicos who look on the deposed Big Boss as their saviour.
However, this troika concept has run into a snag at its very outset with the former Madam putting her foot down that she would have nothing to do with any affair where the deposed Big Boss is involved in any way.
The troika advocates were not prepared to take no for an answer from the former Madam. They decided to use their persuasive powers to the maximum possible to win the former Madams consent. So a select group of emissaries called on her at her residence.
The former Madam quietly listened to all their arguments and supplications and opened up when they eagerly waited for her response. I spent ten years confined to home giving a wide berth to politics. Ask your Boss to take a rest for at least five years before making a bid to win back his lost glory. Her response carried an unmistakable tone of finality.

	The CID today informed Court that details pertaining to 44 vehicles belonging to the presidential secretariat were not recorded in the documents at the presidential secretariat.
	The CID, which is investigating the missing vehicles belonging to the presidential secretariat informed Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage and said following Court action initiated soon after the presidential election detectives were able to recover seven other vehicles for which the former Presidential Secretariat Transport Director was accountable.
	The CID said it was unable to find any document in respect of 44 vehicles because they were not listed in the inventory.
	Meanwhile, former Presidential Secretariat Transport Director Keerthi S. Dissanayake who was arrested in connection with three missing vehicles belonging to the presidential secretariat was yesterday remanded till February 25 by Magistrate Thilina Gamage.
	The CID alleged that the suspect had served as the transport director at the presidential secretariat from 2008 to January 9, 2015 and had to account for three vehicles including a bulletproof Benz car, a kyron jeep and a motorcycle which had gone missing.
	The CID said the suspect had failed to take necessary action regarding a report issued by an accountant in December 2010 where he was asked to take action regarding eight missing vehicles belonging to the presidential secretariat.
	Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for the suspect said there was no evidence to prove that his client had misappropriated the vehicles.
	He cannot be charged under criminal misappropriation because he has no criminal responsibility, the defence counsel said.
	However, the Magistrate observed that the suspect had allegedly allowed others to misappropriate the vehicles and thereby he too was accountable for misappropriation even though not directly involved. The suspect was remanded till February 25 and the CID was directed to file a report on that date. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

Appachchi will never leave the party even if expelled
	
	"The arrest of the former Secretary of the UNP Tissa Attanayake created a sensation recently. He was enlarged on surety bail of Rs 2 million, and his daughter Dulmini who was interviewed thereafter said that her father was unjustly treated by those in authority. She said that despite the presence of thieves, drug addicts and gangsters her father was the first to be remanded by the present regime."My father was the former Secretary of the UNP, and no sooner the UNP won the election my father was taken into custody and jailed. I have a great respect for the Judiciary and hope that justice would prevail. After protecting the party leader over a long period this had been a great humiliation for him. Q Have you ever met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe Yes, he was a family friend. I have met him on several occasions but not recently. He had wished me on my birthdays as well. Even my brother had met him. My Appachchi had been a tower of strength to the party leader during the times the party went through difficult times. Q Didnt you speak to the Prime Minister It was pointless speaking to him after my Appachchi was remanded. I am happy that the Court had released him, and I have much faith in our Courts.Q Did your Appachchi discuss with you about the last minute cross-over he made My Appachchi continued to remain in the UNP with much heart burn. He was mentally upset about the way he was treated by colleagues. He had lot of patience, which I greatly admire. Despite these indifferences he made many sacrifices towards the development of the UNP. He strived hard to bring about peace and reconciliation, and he wanted to re-unite every one and bring back the party to power. My Appachchi will never leave the party even if he is expelled.Q But your father left the party. No he did not leave the party. He always spoke of the party. He was chased out from the party, and was not allowed to work for the party. I saw how shaken up he was at the last stages. I do not wish to mention the names of those who were responsible for my fathers plight. They were very few and most others loved my father. These few obstructed him and stood in his way. So as there was no alternative Appachchi decided to support Mahinda Rajapaksa.Q Had it ever occurred to you to discuss politics with your father I am the eldest and whenever there was some issue of a crucial nature involving him, he had discussed it with me.Q Have you ever advised him I looked up to him as a leader who stood to serve the country. I express my sincere thanks to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he treated Appachchi well and gave a helping hand to overcome the mental agony he was faced with. He helped him get over the stress.Q Is your Appachchi aiming to continue in politics Yes. He had faced similar ups and downs in his political career. This is not the end of his political life. From the time I remember he was away from home attending to the needs of party members. He was very much attached to them and always served them. There was mud slinging, even by those who knew the truth. He was abused. Our house was attacked and we suffered a lot - these we faced bravely. My mother, brother and myself stood by him and gave him all the encouragement together, as a family.Q What have you got to say to the youth of this country Take lessons from those of the earlier generation. Emulate them. Begin to think about the country in a new way. Do not stoop to low levels by slinging mud at your opponents. If you think of entering politics always put the country first and be determined to serve the people. Politics had become a joke in our country, unlike in UK or US where politics play a dominant role in developing the lives of the citizens.Q How long have you been abroad About five years.Q What have you got to say about the period your father was in prison. Only Mr Nimal Siripala De Silva spoke on behalf of my father. Mahindananda Aluthgamage and some opposition members too spoke in favour of him. I felt sorry about the party my father served for about 35 years. Some MPs of the present government Wijedasa Rajapakse and Sujeewa Senasinghe visited my father in jail.

Reluctant young man to make his political debut
	
	
	Political circles for some time have been abuzz with the rumour that the only son of the former Madam was planning to enter the political arena here.
Meanwhile, it had been widely publicized that this young son of illustrious parents was due to make his first public appearance at a certain function organised in the Attanagalle area. However, he failed to turn up at this function much to the disappointment of the organisers and many well-wishers.
The interested parties who made inquiries had learnt that the family astrologers had advised him to wait for a more auspicious time to make his public appearance.
However, sources close to Horagolla, say that his entering the fray at the general elections round the corner is a cinch.

Report on SL must be published by Sep-UK
	
While urging the new Sri Lankan government to use this time to work with the UN Human Right Chief and his Office, Britain today said that OHCHRs report on Sri Lanka must be published and discussed by September 2015 and would stick to that.
The UK wants to see reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Thats why we argued last year for a UN investigation into alleged war crimes and it is why we supported the deferral of this report for six months, UKs Foreign & Commonwealth Office minister Hugo Swire said in a statement.
Hugo Swire urged all sides to continue to work together to ensure that the OHCHRs report on Sri Lanka, now due in September, is thorough and consistent.
Speaking the day after the UN Human Rights Council agreed to defer publication of the report from March to September 2015, Mr Swire welcomed the opportunity for contribution from the Sri Lankan government and restated the UKs commitment to seeing this report published.
Mr Swire said:
The UK wants to see reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Thats why we argued last year for a UN investigation into alleged war crimes and it is why we supported the deferral of this report for six months.
We believe that the extra time will create an opportunity for the new Sri Lankan government to deliver on its commitment to engage with the UN investigation, potentially generating additional material to inform the High Commissioners report. And it will allow the Sri Lankan government to establish their own credible accountability processes.
The UN investigation is a vital part of the process of addressing the grievances of those affected by the conflict and of achieving lasting peace in Sri Lanka. And we recognise how important this report is for many communities in Sri Lanka and around the world who are looking for answers. Thats why we, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have made clear that the report must be published and discussed by September 2015 and we will stick to that.
In the meantime, the new Government of Sri Lanka must use this time to work with the High Commissioner and his Office, and to engage with the broadest possible spectrum of civil society groups within Sri Lanka in order to make progress on reconciliation, accountability and human rights. They have a real opportunity to build a successful, inclusive and prosperous future for their country. But achieving that potential is all about reconciliation. Its about bringing justice and closure and healing to Sri Lanka and we encourage the Sri Lankan government to take this path to a brighter future.

They are poised to do a pole vault!
	
	Certain Diyawanna members who hedged signing the No-Confidence motion against the bellicose John are poised to do a pole vault, they say.
Among these prospective pole-vaulters are a foursome who were known to have been once highly critical of the new administration.
One of the foursome, a mouthpiece of the former royal regime was often caricatured as the laundryman of the deposed Big Boss. Two others happen to be a young politico appointed to oversee the affairs of a Ministry, as a sop to his ego and a former Green one-turned Blue during the Green winter hailing from the Puttalam district. The other Diyawanna member, a former Green buck hailing from the capital of the South used to vigorously defend the Big Boss and his regime at TV political debates.
Intrigued by the seemingly unfathomable political turnaround by these one-time diehard loyalists of the deposed Big Boss, some inquisitive ones made discreet inquiries and they uncovered the reason for their new twist: they have struck a deal to turn Green.
So after all, how can they express no-confidence in a Green leader

Treatment after a fall from a great height
	
	This young Diyawanna member was a powerful person about two months ago. On the final day of the debate on the mini-budget presented by the new administration, this young flamboyant member met the Blue stalwart now leading the opposition in the House to make an earnest request to him. 
The dialogue between them proceeded as follows:
Young member: Will you please allot a few minutes for me to participate in the debate today
Blue stalwart: Sorry. You are a little too late. Time allotments have already been finalized!
Young member: A few minutes would suffice for me. I hope you can make some adjustment to accommodate me!
Blue stalwart: You havent been listed as a speaker from the opposition. There is hardly any time to make an adjustment.
Young member: O! I see. If that is the case, there is no purpose in my remaining in the House. Ill go. I have got a few urgent matters to attend to in Tangalle
Blue stalwart: OK. Ill arrange five minutes for you!
Young member: Five minutes is quite enough for me!
(The young member walks away)
A senior politico who overheard the conversation quips: What a quick comedown from a great height!

Video: We didnt ask for 100-day plan-Sobitha Thera
	
Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, one of the key activists in President Maithripala Sirisenas election campaign, today said that they didnt ask for the 100-day programme.
We in fact suggested six months to deliver promises given to the people, he said.
Holding a news conference at Naga Viharaya in Kotte, the Head of the National Movement for Social Justice, Ven. Sobitha Thera said their movement's opinion was to make the reforms within six months of time but the political parties including the UNP opted for the 100-day programme.
"We didnt ask for 100 days. The government could take until next April to deliver its promises as it seems it is running out of time. An election is not the priority at this time. People voted for reforms, which the government should deliver at any cost," he said.
The Thera said the government should do away with the Preferential Vote System and bring in a new electoral system before a general election. This is a must, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
