RUKIE EHELIYAGODA Her fragrance will remain in our memory


	

As the curtain finally came down on 19th March 2017, Rukie Eheliyagoda stepped off the stage of life. She was 90 years old when she died. Love that transcended biological ties was snuffed out leaving in her trail a colourful luminescence which the passing of time can hardly diminish.   


My mother was content with herself just the way she was and allowed her soul the freedom to love, sing, dance and praise God. An exceptional feature in her character was her calm temperament taking everything with a smile, be it hard times or jubilant times and was never tremulous or ruffled.   
She was richly endowed with “Joie de vivre” and a radiant smile which glowed from within. Outward beauty and the beauty of the soul were both hers in abundance. She was a raconteur par excellence and together with her great sense of humour set alight a sparkle to her lively conversations. It is no secret that my mother endeared herself to anyone who met her for the first time within a few minutes.   
She had an inseparable connection with her family that was deep and symbiotic. It was characterised by an axial relationship. Her family mattered to her the most, evidenced by the abundance of love, care and giving that surrounded her happy home of spouse, five children, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren. During my junior school days, I would constantly fall ill during the time for exams and on each occasion I never failed to find my mother armed with a flask of koththamalli and Disprin waiting near the school gate, during the morning interval. She gave each of her 5 children her undivided attention, even as 4 out of the 5, came in pairs!   


Hers was a life full of selfless care for others. Kindness, compassion and altruistic generosity rained like confetti. She offered a sincere and unbridled friendship especially in the darkest hours. Her heart remained flooded with kindness to the very end.   


She possessed an indefatigable zeal for labouring in God’s Kingdom and was equipped with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of energy and enthusiasm.   


God’s blessings beyond measure were showered on this gracious and indomitable lady from the beginning to the end of her glorious life.  During our growing up years, our home was filled with prayers as she would gather her family around her daily after dinner. Her faith in Lord Jesus Christ was so deep rooted that no storm in life ever succeeded in paralysing her faith. Her conversations hardly ended without her boasting of how great and good, the Lord was.   


Her well lived and fulfilled life is our legacy. Her deep and unfathomable love was her gift to us and our endless fond memories of her is the comfort in our hearts that will linger on.
