For the second consecutive year, Fairfirst Insurance, the market leader for health insurance, won the title of Excellence in Medical Insurance, at the Fintelekt Insurance Industry Awards held in Mumbai recently. 


Supported by a strong underwriting team and leading customer servicing team, Fairfirst continues to deliver market-beating growth and exceptional service standards. 


Providing protection for employees of large corporates and individuals alike, Fairfirst is among the top general insurance companies of Sri Lanka today. This is further accentuated by the backing of one of the largest property and casualty insurers of the world – Fairfax, which has operations spread across geographies.


Driven by disciplined underwriting and streamlined claim operations, Fairfirst has displayed consistent and healthy growth in revenues, client base and segment profitability for the financial year 2016. 
“With an ageing population and a rise in non-communicable diseases, we are seeing an increase in demand for inpatient and outpatient care services as well as laboratory services,” stated Head of Surgical Insurance Thushara Edirisooriya.


“And now with medical costs on the rise, people are beginning to understand the value of having a medical coverage to counter their health contingencies.” 


Fairfirst is continuously reinventing itself in terms of product offerings and strategic partnerships. This was confirmed with its recent tie up with the Sri Lanka Pensions Department and the subsequent launch of ‘Buhuman’, a unique health insurance policy specifically aligned with the evolving insurance needs of pensioners.  Also, the company has successfully secured partnerships with leading financial institutions and telecommunications partners as the insurer of choice in order to further 
its reach. 


“We are thrilled to win this award that recognizes the efforts of our sales, underwriting and claims teams, who have been working tirelessly to service our customers,” stated Fairfirst Insurance CEO and Managing Director Dr. Sanjeev Jha.
