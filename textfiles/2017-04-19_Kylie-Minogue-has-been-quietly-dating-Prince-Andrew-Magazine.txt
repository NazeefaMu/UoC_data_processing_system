DAILY MAIL, 18th APRIL, 2017-An Australian magazine has made bizarre claims that Kylie Minogue has been ‘quietly dating’ Prince Andrew for ‘several weeks’.

 
New Idea have alleged that the ‘close friends’ got in touch after Kylie’s relationship with fiance Joshua Sasse ended in February.  


‘At the moment they’re inseparable - Andrew is 100 per cent smitten,’ a palace source apparently told the magazine.  


The magazine goes on to claim Andrew, 57, reportedly contacted Kylie, 48, and offered his condolences after her relationship ended with Joshua, 29, earlier this year.  


Since then the pair have been ‘inseparable’, with Kylie reportedly spending several nights in the past two weeks with Andrew.  


Daily Mail Australia has contacted both Kylie and Andrew’s representatives for comment.  The magazine also claims that all eyes will be on the guest list for Kate Middleton’s sister Pippa’s nuptials and whether Kylie will attend as a guest of Andrew.   


Earlier this year, Kylie was presented with the Britain-Australia Society Award for 2016 by Prince Phillip, a private ceremony at which senior royals are alleged to have given their approval to the match.
