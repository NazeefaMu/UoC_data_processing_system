Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe hit out at Government MP Ashu Marasinghe describing him ‘as a NGO write-off’, who entered Parliament on the national list with no voter base. He said Mr. Marasinghe was attempting to erode the Sinhala Buddhist vote base of the United National Party (UNP) by criticising Buddhist monks.

The minister said this MP had referred to his meeting with Buddhist monks as an interaction with men in robes.

“Individuals without any standing can refer to monks disrespectfully as men in robes. But, we cannot do it,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
