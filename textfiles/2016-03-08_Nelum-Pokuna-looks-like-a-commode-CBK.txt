Nelum Pokuna looks like a commode: CBK


	

Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga today said that the Nelum Pokuna performance theatre, in Colombo was an ‘eyesore’ that looks like a ‘commode’ (Kakkussi Pochchiya) and blamed the former Rajapaksa government of changing the initial concept she had of creating a public cultural centre.

“The Nelum Pokuna constructed looks ugly like a toilet commode. Sorry for saying it. Every day when I come out of the house I see it. It is a real eyesore. The initial idea was very beautiful. We created a public cultural centre there. Now there’s no people or anyone there. Even the toilets cannot be used properly,” she said addressing the International Women’s Day Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as the Chief Guest.

Claiming that no one was allowed to rob public funds during her tenure, she said today the country was now facing an economic crisis because of the robbing and corruption committed by the Mahinda Rajapaska’s regime.

“The country’s economy has broken down because of the blatant robbery by the previous government. I initiated six development projects including the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Colombo-Southern Expressway. The Coal Power Plant launched by my government with a reputed Chinese Company at an estimated cost US$240 million but the agreement was changed after my exit from office. The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime demanded commissions from the Chinese company. But because it was disagreeable the contract was signed with a little known company.

Ms. Kumaratunga said this was the first time after ten years that she addressed the SLFP women's gathering because Mr. Rajapaksa had not allowed her to interact with SLFP members.

“During past ten years, party members including ministers and deputy ministers of his government had to face various problems when they maintained links with me,” she said and added that CID officers visited some SLFPers the following day if they had met her for any reason at all.

“I am not greedy for power. I never dragged Mahinda’s leg after he became the President. Despite many circumstances where I should raise my voice against them, I had to remain silent for ten years. The freedom under this government is palpable, which was the wish of the majority of the citizens’ regardless of political affiliation,” Ms. Kumaratunga said.

Meanwhile, she said Sri Lankan women should be more knowledgeable to compete with the Sri Lankan men in every field especially in politics.

She said 25% representation for women in local government bodies is insufficient and hoped the present government would increase it to 50%. (Piyumi Fonseka)
