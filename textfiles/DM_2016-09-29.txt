Magistrate says to name ex-DIG as suspect if involved in abduction
	
Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Pieris today directed the CID to name former DIG Anura Senanayake - who is now in remand over the killing of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen - as a suspect into the abduction of two persons at Kotahena if the CID investigations reveal his involvement in the incident.
The Magistrate made this direction to SI Sunil Saranapala of the CID following his submissions made in connection with the abduction of Vadivel Pakkilisamy Loganathan and Ratnasamy Paramanandan of Bloemendhal Road Kotahena.
SI Saranapala submitted that they initiated investigations into the incident on a complaint made to the CID by Laganandhan Chitradevi on June 6, 2016.
He said it was revealed that before the CID took charge of the investigations, the Police Special Investigation unit, Borella Police, Western Province Intelligence Division, the Army Intelligence Division, Air Force Intelligence Division and the Navy Intelligence had investigated the incident.
Therefore, the CID had written to those units for reports on their investigations to peruse them and to elucidate whether the two missing persons were LTTE cadres or those involved with the movement.
SI Saranapala said the CID had so far not received any response from any of the units.
Mr. Saranapala said however they had recorded statements from the investigation officers of the units who conducted investigations into the abduction.
He said according to ASP M.A. A. Senarath Jayathilaka of the CCD, the ASP had seen the Van allegedly involved into the abduction going towards the Welisara Navy Camp and had sought the permission of the then Director of the CCD DIG Anura Senanayake to arrest the van.
Mr. Senanayake had refused to give permission to the ASP to arrest the van and ordered the ASP to only carry out orders given by him (Mr. Senanayake).
The ASP had stated that Mr. Senanayake did so due to his involvement with the then Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Head of National Intelligence Unit Kapila Hendavithana and some naval officers.
Further investigations are being conducted by the CID and the case will be taken up again on October 27. (T. Farook Thajudeen and Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Many politicians, officials haven't identified their duties: President

Many politicians, officials haven't identified their duties: President
	
Many politicians and public official in our country have not identified their duties and responsibilities properly and in many instances they do what is unnecessary while ignoring what is necessary, President Maithripala Sirisena charged yesterday.
He added that though we always promote and embrace spiritual upliftment which is promoted and augmented by religious leaders of all faiths, in building good governance, we have given priority to unwanted things.
Addressing the inauguration of the two day forum entitled International Conference on RTI (Right to Information) Sri Lanka and Media Reforms yesterday at the JAIC Hilton, President Sirisena went on to say that though the RTI was a right of each and every citizen, the previous regime did not introduce legislations to make it law despite continuous demands by civil organizations, NGOs, political parties and the public.
This government was able to bring RTI Bill as a Constitutional provision when we introduced the 18th Amendment to the Constitution consolidating the concept of good governance among officials and politicians and strengthening the fight against corruption, embezzlement, mismanagement, nepotism, waste and frauds. Therefore, it is an unquestionable commitment in the governance that all those concerned must perform their duties and responsibilities with utmost care, responsibility and in time with a set target, President Sirisena stressed.
The right to information not only strengthens good governance and transparency, it also invigorates human rights, fundamental rights and State machinery. It helps to prevent financial misappropriations and create efficiency in governance.
President Sirisena said though we talked much and debate constantly about Right to Information, media barons and owners of print and media institutions that hold the final say in all aspects of media whether it is print or electronic. This is the trend all over. The ultimate decisions makers, policy makers and dictators in the print and electronic media are then owners of media institutions. In that sense, we all must ask ourselves how much space we have given to media freedom and to the independent media, President Sirisena emphasised.
The politicians are obliged to ensure that there is ample space for media freedom. The officials have the right to monitor the media. Many Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) that register or pretext to protect media freedom and independent media do not engage in what they are expected to do. As a result of this action by certain NGOs, the government faces many challenges, obstacles and difficulties. That is why we all must maintain that the public has the right to access to information of NGOs as well as all government functions.
President Sirisena said thousands of Acts, laws and legislations have been introduced in Sri Lanka since independence in 1947. But the question is how many of these legislations have been put into practice and how many are inactive or put into the back burner. A big majority of our people do not have an iota of idea about these legislations. Therefore, making the public aware of the RTI is the best way to lead them to reap the benefits of this piece of legislation.

MCs say no collection of garbage unless segregated
	
All Municipal Councils in the country have decided to refrain from collecting garbage from November 1 unless they were segregated, the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry said today.
The ministry said the decision would affect all residences, shops, schools, hospitals and state institutions.
The decision was taken during a discussion held with all Municipal Commissioners and other officials last morning with the participation of Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha and Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri.
Disposed waste should be segregated under three categories as biodegradable waste, non-biodegradable waste and plastic or glass. Some of the Municipal Councils are already collecting segregated garbage, the ministry stated.
During the discussions, the Municipal Commissioners pointed out that Municipal Councils had to face various difficulties with waste management due to irregular waste disposal.
Minister Musthapha said that steps would be taken to strengthen the Environmental Police to strictly implement the law against individuals who dispose waste on roadsides. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

No room for special treatment for doctors' children: Mujibur
	
It is in no way possible to grant the demands made by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) that doctors' children be admitted to popular national schools, United National Party (UNP) MP Mujibur Rahaman told a media briefing yesterday.
He said if this demand was met then other professionals including teachers would ask for similar benefits for their children as well.
In that case the children of ordinary citizens will be debarred from being admitted to such schools. Such preferential treatment to a certain section of society violates all norms of fair play and justice, he said.
He asked whether the GMOA was planning to create a class of super-rich people at the expense of the poor and the helpless by holding patients to ransom. (Yohan Perera)

Pakistan says SAARC summit still on
	
Unfazed by the decision of India and three other SAARC member nations not to participate in the groupings summit in Islamabad, Pakistan on Wednesday said it would go ahead with the event in November.
Pakistan Foreign Office Spokesperson Nafees Zakaria said that they would host the 19th SAARC summit in November, Radio Pakistan reported on Wednesday.
Mr. Zakaria was quoted as saying that it was learnt from the External Affairs Ministrys tweet that India is not going to participate in the SAARC Summit.
Mr. Zakaria called the decision unfortunate. While we have not received any official communication in this regard, the Indian announcement is unfortunate, he said.
Pakistan was committed to regional peace and would continue working for the broader interest of the people of the region, according to the report.
Adviser to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz said India is making propaganda to foil the conference that was scheduled to be held in November, according to Pakistan Today newspaper.
Meanwhile, Geo TV quoting official sources said Pakistan has been forced to postpone the summit due to Indias refusal to participate in it. The TV channel quoted Mr. Aziz as saying that SAARC secretariat has not yet informed officially about postponement of the conference. He said chances were that SAARC Summit will be postponed, according to the report.
Mr. Aziz has added that whenever the conference takes place, it will be held in Pakistan. He said that it was not the first time India was not attending the regional summit and that earlier also, it caused the summit to be postponed four times. He added that even if one of the members pulls out, the conference cannot go on as per schedule.
The conference was previously scheduled for November 9 and 10. Besides India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan have pulled out of the summit, indirectly blaming Pakistan for creating an environment that is not right for the successful holding of the meet, the Hindu said.
There were also reports that Nepal, the current chair of the SAARC, is trying to move the conference out of Pakistan in an effort to salvage the summit.

Ravi denies reports on gazette discrepancies
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday denied reports of discrepancies in the gazette notification pertaining to the Value Added Tax (VAT) amendment.
Quoting a statement from the government printer, the Minister said the gazette was never printed before putting the proposal to the Cabinet as alleged by joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardene.
A gazette notification is usually issued on a Friday while supplements are issued thereafter till the following Friday. Accordingly, the VAT Amendment was included in the supplement on September 13. Therefore the Minister said the government printer had informed him that September 13 should be considered the date when the gazette had been issued.
Mr. Gunewardene earlier alleged that the gazette notification was issued prior to being tabled to the Cabinet of Ministers. He alleged that the VAT amendment had been gazetted on the 9th and then submitted to the Cabinet on the 13th. (Yohan Perera)

Sampur coal project: India looks at other options
	
Following the governments decision to terminate the Sampur Coal Power project as an Indian investment, Indian Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said her government was looking at other options in Sri Lankas ambitious plan to move towards renewable energy sources by 2020.
The Attorney General informed Court recently that the government would not proceed with the coal project that was to be executed under a joint venture between the Ceylon Electricity Board and the National Thermal Power Corporation of India.
Ms. Sitharaman, in her press conference on Tuesday, said Sri Lanka wanted to move to use gas as the basis for renewable energy
Indian side is looking at it. We have the option of the Joint Working Group to look at the nitty-gritties of this - the supply of gas from Kutchi in Kerala,". There are various things to be looked into. Sri Lankas energy requirement is growing. It is important for us to respond to it in time, she said.
She said national priorities should be reconciled with international commitments made.
Obviously, nations talk about changing priorities and norms. If Sri Lanka chooses to move out of coal for renewable energy, we, in India, have to sit and engage with Sri Lanka although with difficulties, to get over this, she said.
She added, India fully appreciated the fact that national priorities should be reconciled with international commitments. (Kelum Bandara)

SLFP asks Wigneswaran to withdraw statements
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) today while condemning Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswarans Eluga Thamil campaign, asked him to withdraw the statements made by him and called on the TNA to take disciplinary action regarding the matter.
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva who is also a Senior Vice President of the SLFP said that statements made by Mr. Wigneswaran have made them rethink about the powers that should be devolved to the Chief Ministers. In the concept of devolution of power we have to think about what sort of situations that would arise if this sort of Chief Ministers come. My personal opinion is that we have to give thought to these when formulating a new constitution, he said.
Mr. Wigneswaran led the 'Rise up Tamils' protest held last Saturday in Jaffna.
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva told the weekly SLFP news briefing that Mr. Wigneswaran had overstepped his mandate as Chief Minister to incite ethnic tension and thus empower the extremists in the North and the South.
He must not make this kind of remarks which will inflame extremists in the North agitating for a separate state and those in the South who are attempting to create a fear psychosis among the people about the resurgence of LTTE separatism in the country. This government will not tolerate these, he said.
The minister who is also a senior deputy president of the SLFP said his party urged Mr. Wigneswaran to withdraw these remarks and urged the TNA to take disciplinary action against Mr. Wigneswaran and urged TNA leader R. Sampanthan to make a statement on the damage caused to reconciliation and inter communal harmony.
"The SLFP has committed itself to protect the victory secured in 2009 and the peace which dawned thereafter," he said. This political drama being enacted by Wigneswaran to collect a few points and satisfy LTTE sympathizers goes against the government's reconciliation efforts. I dont understand why a man of his calibre who retired as a Supreme Court judge and appointed Chief Minister providing ethnically destructive weapons to extremists in the North and South. In the wake of these damaging utterances, the pro-LTTE website Tamil Net has said that both President Maithripala Sirisena and D.S. Senanayaka were both doing the same thing by attempting to resettle Sinhala people in the North and East.
We as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will never allow any attempt to divide the country or bring in a Federal Constitution. The President has also said that he would not allow foreign judges to hold probes in Sri Lanka, the minister said.
Commenting on various reports regarding a new constitution he said the Constitutional Council (CC) has not even started to draft the new Constitution.
The minister said six Parliamentary Sub Committees must first hand over their reports with recommendations to the CC and only then would the drafting process begin and thereafter Cabinet approval had to be obtained and the draft submitted to the Supreme Court for its determination. The draft Constitution would have to be approved with a 2/3 majority in Parliament and if necessary be approved by the people at a referendum.
"The final say on the new Constitution lies with the people and without majority approval, the whole exercise will be in vain and there will not be any new Constitution. The new Constitution has no shape or form and is still in the fetus stage," he emphasized. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Sandun Jayasekera)

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said today that the discussions held with President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to their school admission issue ended on a positive note on Wednesday with the President assuring them that he would mediate to find a solution to the issue.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the President had assured them that he would arrange a meeting between Education Ministry officials and the GMOA next week to find a solution to the issue.
The discussion between President and the GMOA was successful. The government has provided medical officers with pensions and schools for their children as an act of motivation for the duty they rendered throughout the country, he said.
Dr. Ananda said the President admitted the fact that privileges given to doctors for school admissions was a policy decision and not a special privilege given to a particular sector.
He said they pointed out to the President that there were no equal opportunities in education whereas it was so in the health sector and added that the President promised to formulate a mechanism to enhance primary education in collaboration with the Presidential Secretariat, the GMOA and other relevant institutions.

Tapping of HC Judge's phone/JO calls for inquiry
	
The Joint Opposition yesterday urged the government to investigate the alleged tapping of a mobile phone belonging to a senior High Court judge who was a member of the Bench that tried Duminda Silva and others for the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.
At a media briefing yesterday, Opposition MP Sisira Jayakody said some media sources had reported on Tuesday that the mobile phone of this judge was tapped by the CID.
It was said that Presidents Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya had complained to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) about the phone tapping.
Mr. Jayakody said such acts were unacceptable and a broad and transparent inquiry should be launched.
When Daily Mirror contacted BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya, he said the BASL had received a letter from Presidents Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya informing them of the incident.
He had asked the BASL to look into the issue and take appropriate action, Mr. Randeniya said.
While declining to name the judge, he said he said he was a member of the Bench that tried Duminda Silva and eleven others.
He said the BASL's Executive Committee would decide on the action to be taken.
Meanwhile, BASL President Geoffrey Alagaratnam said at a media briefing yesterday that some tapping incidents of mobile phones belonging to judges and magistrates had been reported during the previous government and also after the present government took over. (Piyumi Fonseka)
