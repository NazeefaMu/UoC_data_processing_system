Credit Management Institute launches programme targeting marketers
	
The Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management (SLICM) announced the launch of the second batch for the Executive Certificate in Marketing Credit Instruments programme.
The focus of the programme is primarily upgrading skills of marketers in the credit markets. The three months-long programme including two weeks of case study preparation intends to make marketers focus on selling sustainable credit according to SLICM. Enrolments are currently on for the new intake.
The course available in Sinhala and English covers subject areas such as fundamentals of marketing credit, basic principles of marketing for marketing credit instruments, concept of societal marketing, marketing planning process for credit markets, customer relationship marketing, new product development, executive development and legal aspects pertaining to marketing credit. The assessment mode is an examination based on a pre-seen case study.
HDFC Bank CEO and Council Member Nimal Mamaduwa elaborating further said, Any successful business enterprise requires an efficient system of evaluating and managing credit. And the role of marketing becomes even more significant taking into consideration these macroeconomic changes. The new Executive Certificate in Marketing Credit Instruments programme fills this void in the market place.
Lanka Orix Finance PLC MD and SLICM Secretary Brindley De Zylva said, Marketing credit is different to marketing any other product or service. Due to the uniqueness of the product and the market competition the importance of selling sustainable credit becomes vital. As SLICM we developed this programme to provide the credit marketers in the industry with necessary skills and competencies to sell sustainable credit.
The programme is facilitated by practitioners in the industry who have decades of experience including, Jithendra Gunathilake of LOLC, Thusitha Ediriweera of HNB, Lohika Fonseka of CAL Finance and Chandana Jayanath of LOLC.
Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management study centre Asian International Academy (AIA) Chairman R. Muralidharan stated, Credit management is an essential tool and it is important for any business to adhere to a proper evaluation, dispensation and monitoring process when it comes to granting of credit. The knowledge of how to handle credit and manage credit is the difference between the success and failure of a business. Proper and effective credit management optimises the growth of any business enterprise.
He further added, The partnership of AIA gives the council of management of the institute the opportunity to focus its attention on improving and restructuring the syllabi and planning on future development strategies to enhance the scope and quality of the programmes offered - resulting in a more practical academic qualification in Sri Lanka.
The SLICM was started in 1988 as a pioneering education project by the leading finance companies intending to fill a vacuum in the leasing and finance-related companies in Sri Lanka. In the year 2000, it was enacted by the Parliament of Sir Lanka and cited that the Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management be incorporated under Act No. 07 of 2000. The SLICM has over 25 years of experience in delivering educational programmes in credit management specifically designed to uplift the credit management skills of the Sri Lankan professionals.

Fitch maintains Ceylon Income Fund on Rating Watch Negative
	
Fitch Ratings has maintained the (A(lka)) National Fund Credit Quality Rating of the Ceylon Income Fund on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The National Fund Volatility Rating is V-NR.
The maintenance of the RWN is driven by an increase in the proportion of the fund rated only by Lanka Rating Agency (LRA) following redemption activity in the fund. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka issued a statement in July 2015 saying that LRA is not entitled to assess, evaluate or review the creditworthiness of listed securities or securities to be listed.
The funds Weighted Average Rating Factor was previously consistent with a National Fund Credit Quality Rating in the A(lka) category. The fund primarily invests in corporate debt instruments and is managed by Ceylon Asset Management.
Fitch will resolve the RWN with an affirmation if the assets that were previously rated by LRA reduce materially or if these assets are rated by another rating agency, in accordance with the plan communicated to Fitch by the manager. Conversely, should the proportion of assets rated by LRA only remain high and efforts to exit these LRA-only rated securities in the short time-frame expected by the manager prove unsuccessful, then Fitch will likely withdraw the rating due to insufficient information to maintain the rating.
In accordance with Fitchs policies the issuer appealed and provided additional information to Fitch that resulted in a rating action which is different than the original rating committee outcome.

I dont have dual citizenship: Geetha
	
Rejecting reports that her parliamentary seat was being annulled, Geetha Kumarasinghe told Daily Mirror today that despite obstacles, she would definitely take oaths as a Member of Parliament on September 1.
Losers are in a futile attempt to sling mud at me saying I am a Switzerland citizen. According to the 19th Amendment Sri Lankan politicians with a citizenship in another country are prevented from holding high posts. I obtained the Switzerland citizenship through my husband. But, I cancelled it a long time ago. I do not need to talk about it now, she said.
Ms. Kumarasinghe said this had become a topic of discussion at social events after some contestants who lost the election had spread this kind of fabricated news in a gossip website claiming that she would not be eligible to take oaths as a parliamentarian.
She said the people had voted for her because of the manner in which she interacted with the people and none of her opponents would be able to snatch that kind of support from her. (Piyumi Fonseka)

LIC buys 86% of Indian Oil Corp shares on offer
	
State-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India bought 86 percent of shares on offer in state-run Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) this week, salvaging a US $ 1.4 billion government sale as the market took its biggest tumble in more than six years.
LIC, Indias biggest investor, has in the past dug into its pockets to prop up government sales, buying up state banks and government mining firms.
It heavily supported the sale of Coal India (COAL.NS) shares in January and the sale of shares in Steel Authority of India (SAIL) last year.
The investments have sometimes proved fruitful for LIC, with stock in the State Bank of India, which it invested in January 2014, up more than 60 percent.
However, the extent of its bailout on Monday, according to an exchange filing published after market hours on Tuesday, may revive debate in some quarters over the governments divestment plans and the extent to which sales can continue to be heavily backed by LIC and its quarter of a billion customers.
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co Chief Investment Officer Aneesh Srivastava said it would not be easy for the government to meet its US $ 10.5 billion divestment target, but said the fact it has already carried out four sales would help.
The way the government has structured the sales so far they are on target, unless the market conditions really deteriorate. In that case even LIC cant save them, he said.
Having announced a move on Indian Oil on Friday, hoping to capitalise on strong refining margins, the Indian government had little choice but to press ahead with the sale of a 10 percent stake in the refiner and fuel retailer on Monday.
The sale was undermined by the sharpest fall in the Indian stock market since January 2009.
We have to rethink our strategy, Divestment Secretary Aradhana Johri said after the sale. Basically, we have to look at which are the stocks we need to put on the market and where the appetite in the market lies.
Next on the stump for the government are sales including a 10 percent slice of Coal India and stakes in NTPC (NTPC.NS), Bharat Electronics (BAJE.NS), Hindustan Copper (HCPR.NS).
Officials at LIC, whose stake has risen to 11.11 percent in Indian Oil from 2.52 percent, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Its officials have said in the past that it carries out its own due diligence and checks, but sees itself as a long-term holder and is not concerned by short-term market fluctuations.

## Title: Sri Lankas banks eye market-driven consolidation: Oxford Business Group

Sri Lankas banks eye market-driven consolidation: Oxford Business Group
	
The coming year looks set to bring further consolidation to Sri Lankas financial sector, with market forces expected to drive the trend, in lieu of the government-led policy of the previous administration.
Last year saw the industry regulator, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), take steps to bolster the sectors operating environment by promoting consolidation amongst the countrys banks and non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs).Measured progress
Unveiled in January 2014, the Central Banks blueprint for consolidation required larger lenders to identify potential partners  with a particular focus on smaller NBFIs  and initiate mergers and acquisitions (M&A), setting deadlines for each step of the process.
The CBSL had targeted a sector of around 20 NBFIs upon completion, roughly one-third of the 58 operating when the master plan was published.
The roadmap also outlined higher minimum capital requirements for commercial and specialised banks, with a focus on the adoption of risk management best practices.
Progress thus far has been fair, with seven NBFIs completing some form of consolidation as of the end of last year; however, most of the benchmarks set out in the plan have yet to be achieved.
A planned merger between DFCC Bank and National Development Bank (NDB), agreed to in early 2014, was called off in May, and most other consolidation has been limited to small NBFIs or subsidiaries of larger banking groups.Change of tack
After presidential elections early this year, state pressure for lenders to consolidate was largely replaced by market momentum  an approach favoured by many analysts  with the victory of the United National Party in the August parliamentary elections expected to reinforce this more hands-off approach.
Officials from the CBSL told local media in May that the consolidation process would be part of the new administrations long-term economic policy, to be carried out in a more systematic manner.
Many industry players agree that while consolidation is needed, the sector will be better served if market forces dictate the process. In particular, market-driven consolidation could help avoid accumulation of weak assets amongst non-banking institutions forced to merge. However, others in the industry see a place for guided consolidation, especially if the interests of stakeholders are not being protected by the market.The not-so-invisible hand
Signs that market forces are already at work are in evidence, with DFCC Bank and DFCC Vardhana Bank announcing plans in May to combine their operations. The news came just one week after the lenders called off the planned merger with NDB.
Indeed, a sector update from ratings agency Fitch, issued in the first quarter, found that Sri Lankas larger and more mature banks were better placed to leverage opportunities, with their established franchises granting them a competitive advantage over smaller or newer rivals.
Fitch urged medium-sized banks in the sector to find a niche or clear competitive advantage to reinforce their position in the market, though smaller lenders would likely continue to face challenges in sustaining and developing their franchises, the report noted.Good standing
Sound growth metrics and healthy levels of reserves have already earned the financial industry a solid position in Sri Lankas economy, with Fitch reaffirming its stable outlook for the banking sector in early July, in line with its sovereign rating.
According to Fitch, the sectors credit profile is unlikely to deteriorate materially despite the possibility of downside pressure on asset quality and profitability, though significant capital impairment risks or a broader deterioration in the countrys macroeconomic position could warrant negative rating actions. The agency also maintained its previous ratings on nine of the countrys banks.
Financial sector consolidation is expected to further improve the credit profile of Sri Lankas financial institutions, Fitch noted, strengthening franchises and reducing supervisory burdens. Consolidation would be beneficial to the sector in the long term, while being credit neutral in the short to medium term, the report found.
Although the in-coming government is expected to formulate a new policy to encourage M&A activity early next year, the new initiative is likely to be more laissez-faire than its 2014 predecessor.

Oil contamination; water supply disrupted again
	
The water supply to Colombo, Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte and Dehiwala-Mt Lavinia was disrupted today after the water in the Kelani River was found to have been contaminated with oil, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said.
The contamination had resulted in the Ambatale water treatment plant being forced to limit the supply of water.
The NWSDB said it hoped to resume the supply of water as soon as the contamination of the river was cleared up.
Meanwhile, NWSDB Deputy General Manager Ranjith Perera said the pumping of water from the Ambatale water treatment plant was stopped at 9.45 a.m. until 1.30 p.m. because of oil patches detected in the Kelani River.
He said the water board in collaboration with the Navy and Army was taking measures to flush out the oil patches.
The oil patches appear to have surfaced again following the heavy rainfall. We are trying to figure out the origin of the oil patches, he said.
