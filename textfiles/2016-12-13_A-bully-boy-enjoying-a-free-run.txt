A bully boy enjoying a free run


	



 

This story is about the shenanigans of a local politico hailing from a village off Galle who is well known as a bully boy in the area.

 


This bully boy is a loyal follower of a deputy purohita who too has made a name for similar antics. 
If a celebration is held in a house in his area without inviting him to it as ‘a distinguished guest’, the bully boy would send his goons to wreck the place and reduce it to shambles. 


If the politico comes to know that there are two trucks carrying sand loads on the way to a construction site, he would order that one truckload of sand be unloaded at a place he specifies.


Some people in this area make it a point to invite the bully boy to ceremonies held in their houses against their conscience for fear of being attacked when the ceremony is in progress, they say.
