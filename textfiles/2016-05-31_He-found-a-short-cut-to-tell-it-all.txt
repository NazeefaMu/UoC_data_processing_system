He found a short-cut to tell it all


	



 

A purohita from the South was seen walking up and down the House during the sittings on a day last week in a state of great agitation.

 


 He kept on telling the members in general: “I didn’t take him! I didn’t take him! I know nothing about this appointment!”


From the moment this purohita stepped into the House, his colleagues   had started asking him about a controversial appointment made to a high post in his Ministry. Tired of explaining matters to all inquisitive members individually, the purohita had walked back and forth announcing his position in regard to the issue for the benefit of all interested in it.
