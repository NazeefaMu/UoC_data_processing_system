The Central Committee (CC) of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will certainly take strict disciplinary action against SLFP MPs who would refuse to attend the Party’s May Day rally at Galle, a Minister said today.


Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told the media at the Information Department that the SLFP had invited all SLFP Parliamentarians to attend its May Day rally.


Responding to a journalist who recalled the SLFP Central Committee’s failure to take any action against those who participated in the joint opposition’s public rally at Hyde Park on March 17 despite warnings to do so, Minister Samarasinghe said President Sirisena did not take action against them for the love of the party.


“Failure to punish them must not be taken as a weakness. President’s position was that those detractors of the party should be given another opportunity to follow party instructions. But the situation is different this time. The MPs have been given ample time to behave themselves. The CC will definitely take action against those who attend the proposed joint opposition rally at Kirulapone,” Minister Samarasinghe said.


Asked whether action would be taken against Mr. Rajapaksa if he attended the Kirulapona meeting, he said, yes and added the final decision on him will be taken by President Sirisena because Mr. Rajapaksa is a former President and one of the patrons of the party at the moment.
