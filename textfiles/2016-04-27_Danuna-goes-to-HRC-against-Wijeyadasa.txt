Danuna Thilakaratne, the son-in-law of Minister Sarath Fonseka, today lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) against Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, claiming that the minister had refused to release the monies that were contained in his bank accounts that were frozen as a result of him being named as a suspect in a case brought against Hi-Corp, even after he was acquitted.

Mr. Thilakaratne said he had made a request from Minister Rajapakshe to release the funds that were contained in his personal bank accounts that were frozen as he had been acquitted from the case but the minister had not responded to his request so far.

“The case in question was filed against me by the previous regime on false charges and it went on for five years during the time the previous government was in power and went on for one year after that. I have been acquitted from the case now but my personal bank accounts are still frozen. I have requested the Justice Minister to release them on several occasions but he has not responded. As a result it is my position that my fundamental rights have been violated,” he said.

Danuna Tilakaratne was acquitted from the controversial Hi-Corp case last year. (Ajith Siriwardana)
