Shadow cabinet: Lohan wants out


	

Kandy District UPFA MP Lohan Ratwatte, who was named City Planning and Water Supply Minister of the Joint Opposition’s shadow cabinet, has requested his name be removed from the list.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the MP said he was neither aware of the appointment of a shadow cabinet nor who made the appointments.

“I requested MP Dullas Alahapperuma (the national organizer) to remove my name from the list. I have no idea who made the appointments. This is a joke. As the joint opposition, this is not what we should be doing. A shadow cabinet is not the need of the hour,” he said.

However, he said appointing monitoring MPs to each ministry was more appropriate. “I think former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had also expressed similar sentiments regarding the shadow cabinet,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
