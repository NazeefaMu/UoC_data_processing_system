They agreed to disagree


	



 

A senior purohita shouldering a heavy responsibility in respect of the country’s economy met a certain state purohita the other day.

 


The purohita is a Green party heavyweight, a recipient of honours for his ‘performance par excellence’.  The state purohita, once Green-now-turned-Blue held key portfolios in the previous regime. He has now become a faithful follower of the Compassionate One. This state purohita hailing from the South has been in the forefront in the campaign against the Hambantota port deal. 


The purohita asked the state one why he was attacking the Hambantota port deal through the media.
“We are opposed to it on a matter of principle. We cannot agree to the idea of conceding the pound of flesh… The policy of our party is to create something new for the country, not to concede part of our territory to foreigners,” the state purohita replied.


“We belong to the same government and it’s wrong for you to take up such a stand,” the purohita pointed out.


“No. We have taken up the correct stand,” the state one asserted.


Having realized there was no purpose in pursuing the argument, the duo proceeded on their separate ways, they say.
