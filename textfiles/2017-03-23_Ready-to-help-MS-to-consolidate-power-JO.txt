The Joint Opposition (JO) today said it was ready to support President Maithripala Sirisena to topple the ‘Wickremesinghe government’ and consolidate the powerdrawing together all anti-Ranil UNPers.
At a press conference held in the office of the Democratic Left Front, JO member MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said they were geared up to break the unity government and know how to rule the country.

He claimed during the period of the unity governance, most of the people’s fundamental rights were torn down. He said they would not act under the UNP rule and will topple the Prime Minister and the UNP power that is unhealthy to the country.

MP Nanayakkara said they don’t wish to topple the whole government however; they are against Ranil Wickremesinghe’s moves towards the country.

“We are prepared to topple the government. If the anti-people acts (such as postponing elections) continue, we certainly would group the people and create a mass national force,” he said.

Further, he said the JO can paralyze the unity government if the authorities failed to hold the election before the end of the year.

“The unity government is moving towards its down fall. Ahead of the national election we are ready to form an interim government. If the government listened to our demands and hold the elections in the right time we would not have to do this,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
