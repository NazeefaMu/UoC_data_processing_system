President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday questioned those who criticize him and the government what would have been the situation of our country if the January 8 transformation had not taken place.

“Without experiencing that eventuality, some people criticize the actions taken by the government to face the critical economic crisis and the issues raised by the international community”, he said. He invited them to present possible solutions for these issues instead of criticizing.

The President expressed these views at the launching ceremony of the book ‘Ma Dutu Janavari 8 (The January 8 witnessed by me), written by the Member of Parliament Malith Jayathilaka, held yesterday at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo.

“It is the responsibility of those who gave a helping hand to that victory, to ensure that the country is benefitted by it,” he emphasized. He invited those who contributed as well as did not contribute to the January 8 victory to fulfill their responsibilities for the country today.

President Sirisena said that the very true and correct facts on January 8 transformation were still hidden. He commended the attempt taken by Mr. Malith Jayathilaka to report such facts without any fear.

The President said all those who know regarding the transformation that took place on January 08 have an understanding how complex and how far it has to be studied. Hence, it is necessary for them to talk openly about that pure transformation of January 8 and today it is very important to speak regarding that transformation by persons who involved to make that change, he said.
