The Chairman of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), Dr. R.M. K. Ratnayake has tendered his resignation to Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen.
Dr. Ratnayake said that he had decided to resign for personal reasons, and his resignation letter had been submitted to the ministry last week.
When asked about media reports that a dispute with Mr. Bathiudeen had led to his resignation, Dr. Ratnayake said, “I have decided to resign because of my health. I have to undergo several medical tests. I have no issue with the minister.” .
Mr. Ratnayake said he was informed that the minister had received his letter but he had not yet received a reply.
Media reports said the Industry and Commerce Ministry’s publication of the new Maximum Retail Prices (MRPs) of six essential consumer items, bypassing the Consumer Affairs Authority, had led to the resignation of the chairman.
The previous chairman of the Authority, Rumy Marzook resigned in June. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
