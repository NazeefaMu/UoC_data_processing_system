Australia beat India to reach final


	

Australia powered into the World Cup final with a 95-run victory over defending champions India in Sydney.
Steve Smith struck a fluent 105 from 93 balls and Aaron Finch 81 as Australia posted 328-7, the highest score in a World Cup semi-final.
India made a solid start to their reply but lost four wickets for 32 runs and fell well short on 233 despite captain MS Dhoni making 65.
Australia will meet fellow co-hosts New Zealand in Sunday's final in Melbourne.
They will do so looking for their fifth World Cup crown - no other team has more than two - and on the back of a seventh semi-final win in as many attempts. (BBC)
