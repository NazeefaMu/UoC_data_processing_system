Mahela and Sanga trail blazers...again!

The two god given cricketers to the nation MAHELA JAYAWARDENE and KUMAR SANGAKKARA are without doubt trail blazers. They were like conjoined twins, each complementing the other on or off the field and setting new highs.
Jayawardene and Sangakkara performed magnificently in their chosen fields and their mind boggling deeds, Jayawardene with bat, Captain and fielder, especially at slip and Sangakkara as batsman, gloveman and Captain are all writ in the books and will not be equaled or surpassed that easily.
Both led the country to World Cup finals. In addition Jayawardene led the country to the Twenty20 finals too. But that they could not achieve the ultimate was not the cricketing god's wish.
Both are out of the game
Both are now out of the game for the country. The writer makes bold to say that they did not over-stay their visas in the game, which is insensible thinking in certain quarters which want to avenge, alleging that the twosome scuttled the hurriedly arranged tour of England that crash landed. Both went out of the game when everyone was asking 'WHY' and 'WHY NOT'.
England it is said gave the game of cricket to the world. They bossed over it and dominated it for long. But with other countries taking to the game in earnest, England's fortunes tumbled and they were struggling to keep their greatness in the game alive. Now with their fortunes dwindling, comes the news that England have signed on Jayawardene as their Batting Consultant. Now all Sri Lanka must be proud of Jayawardene's achievement. Jayawardene was a rare straight playing batsman that the Sri Lankan game has produced.
Whoever thought that England would need a Sri Lankan to show them how to bat correctly. But that is how the game goes --and that shows the renown with which Jayawardene is held. He will surely show them how to play straight to achieve success.
Jayawardene technically sound
Jayawardena was one of the technically sound batsmen in world cricket. Batsmen who wield a straight bat don't come dime a dozen. In the past Sri Lanka had many technically sound batsmen who were treats to watch and rare examples. To name a few there was Michael Tissera, Anura Tennekoon, Roy Dias, Sidath Wettimuny, and Marvan Atapattu.
But sadly now with the 'hit out, or get out' game of limited over cricket given precedence over the established game - Test cricket - technically correct batsmen don't come that easy like beautiful damsels.
England seem to be raving over the signing of Jayawardene as Batting Consultant. The man who seems over the moon for this bit of good thinking by England is Ian Bell. Bell it must be stated was England's most technically correct batsman playing a straight bat. But of late his batting has been flawed and has been in a run drought.
First fling with England
Jayawardena's first fling with the England team will be in the United Arab Emirates where England is slated to play Pakistan in a Test series. Here's how Bell described the signing of Jayawardene- 'Brilliant' and I would badger the newly retired batsman for advice.
'The one thing we need to do is get better on the subcontinent, and he's one of the best ever. To have his input leading into the series and all the preparations, is going to be huge for us. I am really looking forward to that.
'He was certainly hard to get out in those conditions, so I'll be picking his brain all the way through if I can, probably badgering him a bit too much, but trying to get everything I can out of him to make my game better'. Great pride and honour for Sri Lanka, England's signing of Jayawardena as Batting Consultant.
SANGA propping up Surrey
While England are raving over the signing of Jayawardene, Sangakkara went great guns with English County Surrey, scoring tons of runs and taking the club's cricket to a new high.
With his retirement from the hard grind of Test cricket for the country, which is mental torment and physically taxing, the leftie seemed to be much relaxed as his approach to batting was showing and runs and centuries for Surrey came naturally.
He justified the confidence Surrey placed in signing him on and after a long time Surrey entered a 50-over final riding on the back of magnificently carved out 160 in the semi-final against Nottingamshire which attack included Stuart Broad who tormented Australia during the Ashes series. He made 60 in the final against Warwickshire and that they could not win the final, losing by a few runs was a travesty of justice.
Jayawardene and Sangakkara who are supremely fit cricketers have shown that they could have played and served the country for at least another couple of years if they wished. But being the caring players they went out early. Jayawardene and Sangakkara are still continuing with Jayawardene playing in Windies bash and now being signed on by Central Districts to play in Kiwiland.
Mandela - Gandhi Test series
'Two proud nations', 'Two super powers'. That is how 'STAR SPORTS' is forcefully advertising the South Africa Test series against India on TV due to begin shortly in India.
But what is heartening, welcome and an example is that the series has been labeled the Nelson Mandela - Mathama Gandhi series, with the Cricket Boards of both proud nations breaking away from the stereo type of playing Test series in honour or memory of past cricketing greats.
Australia and India play for the 'Border-Gavaskar Trophy'. Sri Lanka and Australia play for the 'Warne-Muralitharan Trophy'. Australia and West Indies play for the 'Benaud- Worrell Trophy'. England and Australia play for 'The ASHES URN'. And now West Indies and Sri Lanka will play for the Sobers-Tissera Trophy.
Heroes of democracy
Great that the heroes of democracy are being remembered. Gandhi helped India gain Independence from colonial rule without shedding a drop of blood. He is the father of India with Ahimsa as his hallmark. Gandhi is best remembered for his ideals of truth and non-violence and his philosophy of Satyagraha
Mandela (AKA) 'Black Pimpernel', suffered long in a jail for fighting to deliver his black people from the cruel, inhuman and dreaded Apartheid. That he finally succeeded in bringing the whites on their knees was great triumph and an example to the world. I can only guess that both these world leaders had sports in their DNA for all that they did was underpinned by the ideals of sportsmanship
Congratulations then to the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the South African Cricket Board for remembering these two freedom fighters and great statesman who were examples to world leaders. The world of today needs more Gandhis and Mandelas. India and South Africa are fielding two of the most formidable teams in world cricket and as such an electrifying series is on the cards for cricket fans. That spectators will flock all venues to watch these champions at play there will be no doubt. We hope there will be no bottle throwing incidents.
By the way enjoy life now. It has an expiry date on it.
