Science faculty of Jaffna Uni. closed after student clash


	

A clash between two student fractions on Saturday closed the Science faculty of Jaffna University until further notice.  

The National University Teachers’ Association (NUTA) said the fight had erupted due to a cultural performance at a welcome party held for freshmen at the Science faculty.

The Association said that students of the Arts Faculty had opposed the event and later attacked the students of the Science Faculty, during the programme.

Close to 20 students were hospitalized with injuries. NUTA Secretary Dr. Channa Jayasumana said several students had returned to their homes under police protection.

“After some students of the Science Faculty performed a cultural event in welcoming the new comers, some students of the Arts Faculty suddenly came and attacked them. A few minutes later, some outsiders who are said to have been called by the Arts Faculty students, entered the university premises with helmets and clubs. That group consisting of about thirty men attacked the students of the Science Faculty and the students who performed the cultural event,” he said.

He also said the Science Faculty students had agreed to hold two cultural events at the welcome party, therefore the intervention of the students from the Arts faculty was irrational.

Dr. Jayasumana said the students from the Arts Faculty had also threatened the Science Faculty students.    

“We strongly condemn the violent actions of some of the students. We urge the authorities to look into this very serious matter and take immediate action to defuse the situation so that students can resume their studies,” he stated.

He also said the academic staff of the Jaffna University had been informed of the issues developing between the student fractions but no action had been taken. (Piyumi Fonseka)
