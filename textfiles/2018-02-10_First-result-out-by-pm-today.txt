The Elections Commission said it expected to announce the first result of today's local government elections by 8 pm today.

Ballot papers will be counted at 10,675 polling centres including 3,852 counting centres for postal votes.

Under the new electoral system, votes will be counted at the polling station itself. However votes of two or three polling stations will be counted at one centre in some areas due to lack of utility services, the Elections Commission said. (Ranjan Kasthuri)
