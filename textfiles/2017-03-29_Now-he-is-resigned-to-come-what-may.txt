A bigwig of an establishment handling public security among other things has resigned himself to saying adieu to his job, they say.

 


The high authorities had occasion to pull up this high up time and again for his antics ever since his elevation to new office. In a bid to get back into the graces of his bosses, the man had suddenly gone highly religious, but only bringing the sublime to the ridiculous in effect. 


Feeling uneasy about the situation he is placed in, the high-up had confided in his confidants that he would look for an alternative job after the national New Year should there be no change of heart on the part of those above him.
