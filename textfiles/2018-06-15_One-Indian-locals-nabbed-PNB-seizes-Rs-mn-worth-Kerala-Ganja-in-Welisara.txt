An attempt to transport a large stock of Kerala Ganja worth over Rs.24 million from Mannar to Colombo was thwarted by Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) sleuths in Welisara this evening.

The PNB on information searched a small lorry that was transporting the cannabis in the pretext of carrying fish from Mannar and apprehended three men who were also in the vehicle.

Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily Mirror the stock was believed to be containing over 200 kilogrammes of ganja, which was still being weighed at the time this edition went to press.

Amongst the arrested suspects were an Indian national and two locals residing in Pesalai in Mannar.

The suspects had reportedly left Mannar today early morning and were bound for an unknown location in Colombo, where the narcotics were suspected to be delivered to a secret third party.

SP Gunasekara said the bundles of neatly wrapped ganja had carefully been concealed among Rigifoam boxes containing fish immersed in ice.

The stock of Kerala Ganja is suspected to have arrived in the country through a sea route connecting between a South Indian location and Talaimannar, where mostly the drug smuggling is carried out.

Kerala Ganja, which is considered as an Indian variety of cannabis is presently holds a underground market value of Rs.120, 000 a kilo, SP Gunasekara said.

PNB is conducting investigations on the instructions of Police Chief IGP Pujith Jayasundara and Senior DIG M R Latiff in charge of Range Police Special Task Force (STF), Crime and PNB.

All three suspects are being detained for further interrogation. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
