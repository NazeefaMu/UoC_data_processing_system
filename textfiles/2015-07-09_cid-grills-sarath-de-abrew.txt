	Supreme Court Judge Sarath De Abrew had been quizzed by the officers of the CID for nearly four hours on Wednesday over the allegation that he had assaulted and sexually abused one of his domestic aides.
	Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said a CID team that arrived at the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court premises, questioned the judge from 3.30 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. at a special chamber.
	The CID had to come to court premises since Justice Abrew, who was asked to report to the CID for a statement, refused to do so.
	His special request to give the statement at court premises instead at the CID was allowed by Mt. Lavinia Magistrate on Tuesday.
	The Magistrate ordered the judge to hand over his service pistol to the courts, which he had obeyed afterwards, the ASP said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
