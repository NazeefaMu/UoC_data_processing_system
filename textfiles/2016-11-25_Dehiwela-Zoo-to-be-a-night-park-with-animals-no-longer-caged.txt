Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said today plans were afoot to upgrade the Dehiwala National Zoological Garden into a night park before the 2017 National New Year.

He said the development of the Zoological Gardens would be completed in three stages with the animals being allowed to roam free and no longer confined to cages.

The minister said the proposals for this purpose would be presented to the Cabinet today.

 “The Zoological Garden is more than 100 years old and the manner in which it was operated during colonial rule will not be applicable in this day and age. The practice of caging animals must be discontinued and they should also be allowed to enjoy their freedom,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
