The main suspect of the Rathgama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Manoj Pushpakumara Mendis’s killing, Janith Madusanka de Silva alias Podi Lassiya, had surrendered to the Kalutara Magistrate Court today, the Police said.
The suspect, who was evading Police since last Monday (23), surrendered to the courts through his attorneys, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Kalutara Magistrate who ordered to remand the suspect until April 06 ordered the Prison authorities to produce him before Galle Additional Magistrate on the same day for further proceedings.
Podi Lassiya surrendered just two days after the Police arrested another suspect named Lakshan de Soyza from Hikkaduwa on Sunday.
Police said that he had driven the vehicle used to commit the crime.
The Police have also identified two other suspects, who were in the same vehicle and also looking for several other suspects, who were in the same gang that had come to assist.
Chairman Mendis and two others came under gunfire by a gang at a hotel in Hikkaduwa last Monday night, where the former succumbed to injuries soon after being admitted to the Karapitiya Hospital.
Hikkaduwa Police are conducting investigations under the instructions of SSP Galle Division. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Sanath Desmond)
