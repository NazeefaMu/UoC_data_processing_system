Failure to get O/L admission leads to suicide attempt

 
Three students consumed poison on Thursday after the Vice Principal refused them the G.C.E. O/L admission, as they had not obtained sufficient marks at the term test.
The three students who consumed poison in Kotmale-Ramboda area were admitted to the Gampola Hospital on Thursday.
It is reported that the girls aged 16 from the Ramboda- Keminithenna area are students of Ramboda-Hindu High School.
