Making a killing by cooked up billing


	



 

Government for some time had been buying ‘bada-irungu’ (sorghum) from the farmers in Rajarata as a relief measure.  The authorities instructed a certain State-run enterprise to purchase ‘bada-irungu’ harvested during the last season as usual after releasing the required funds for the purpose. 

 


According to reliable information, only 30 metric tons of the grain has been purchased by the State-run enterprise, but billing figures are being cooked up to show that 51 metric tons of the stuff – the ceiling stipulated for buying -  has been purchased from the farmers, they say.


The high-up of the state-run enterprise responsible for manipulating the billing is expected to make a killing at the rate of about Rs.8 a kilo of the grain, employees who have got wise to this swindle say.
Meanwhile, some employees of this enterprise which has long been known to the public as a hotbed of corruption, are set to expose the fraud.
