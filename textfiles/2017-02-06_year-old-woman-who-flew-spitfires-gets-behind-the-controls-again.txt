UK, (Daily Mail, London), 4 February 2017- Tearing through the skies above the South Coast, two Spitfires evoke powerful memories of Britain’s wartime resilience.  


But this stirring image holds a further poignancy –in the cockpit of the lead aircraft sits Mary Ellis, celebrating her 100th birthday by recreating her time as one of the ‘Ata-girls’, the select gang of female pilots who flew Britain’s fighters during the war.  


‘Wizard, this is wizard!’ yelled the delighted centenarian through her intercom.  


Mary was handed the controls of the 275mph twin-seater as it swooped over West Sussex. After about 15 minutes, she turned for home, and told her co-pilot Matt Jones: ‘Goodwood on the nose, you have control…’. Then she settled back to enjoy the ride back to base.
