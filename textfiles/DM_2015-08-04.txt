A welcome suspension of membership!
	
Five close loyalists of the Yahapalanya Big Boss were suspended from their Blue party membership by the Big Boss himself for turning against the party. Meanwhile, a politico from the Betel leaf rebel group called one of the suspended Blue members to express his regret over the punitive action.
I feel that they should not have taken this step at this time, the sympathetic rebel told the suspended member. We are not at all concerned over this, replied the suspended member. In fact, we knew this was coming!
Dont you think that this action at this stage has placed you at a disadvantage the surprised rebel asked.
No, not at all. On the contrary, it has come to us as a blessing. So far, the voters did not know for sure whether we were Blue or Green. Now the suspension of our membership sends out in clear terms the message that the Blue party door is closed on us. This means the Green party supporters hereafter will have no second thoughts about voting for us!
Does it mean that this suspension is something preplanned 
The suspended member only guffawed.

Coal Tender: PAB refuses to sit
	
	The fifty billion rupee per year tender to supply coal to the Lakvijaya power plant into Norochcholai for three years has run into a yet another controversy with the members of the Procurement Appeal Board (PAB) refusing to sit following allegations made in the media against the PAB by Power and Energy Ministry Secretary Dr. B. M. S Batagoda and a member of the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC).
	An authoritative source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the Daily Mirror that due to the allegations made by Dr. Batagoda without evidence, the appeal process of the controversial tender had come to a standstill.
	The PAB was due to meet on Monday at 1 pm to present its report but the meeting did not go ahead as planned due to the PAB members refusing to sit following the allegations against them.
	The tender was referred to the PAB after at least four bidders complained about the tender being granted to Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd after it had initially been awarded to Noble Resources Pte Ltd.
	In an earlier report, the Daily Mirror revealed that the tender to obtain over 2.2 million tonnes of coal for a period of three years  said to be one of the biggest tenders of recent times  was awarded to Noble Resources International Pte Ltd after careful scrutiny by the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) on June 13. The tender was awarded following a competitive bidding process in which 7 Companies competed to obtain the tender after the bids being opened on June 11.
	However, on June 29, Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd which had not been granted the tender had written to the SCAPC calling for a re-evaluation of its bid. The communication was against the code prescribed to bidders. The SCAPC on the very same day had written to Lanka Coal Company and ordered them to re scrutinize the tenders and to disregard two vital criteria previously imposed with regard to the size of the coal. Thereafter on July 3 SCAP received the reevaluation report of the TEC and on July 6 the Tender was awarded to the complainant resulting in the other bidders crying foul and appealing the awarding of the tender.
	Pointing out the sequence of events, the source questioned the actions of Dr. Batagoda.
	The arbitrary actions and the statement of the Secretary just before the PAB was due to meet and present their report raises serious questions. It seems that it was his intention to jeopardize the whole tender procedure. With his statement to the media, he had managed to keep the PAB from issuing their report. He also called for a spot tender removing the size specification which was exactly the condition that Swiss Singapore wanted to be omitted. So, whose tune is the Secretary dancing to he questioned.
	Until new members are appointed to the PAB by the President, the matter cannot be resolved. This means that there is a risk of the power plant running out of coal to function which could result in massive losses.
	However, when contacted by the Daily Mirror, Dr. Batagoda denied issuing such a statement to any media.
	Nobody from this particular newspaper contacted me regarding this issue. I dont understand how they could have quoted me in this manner. Everyone, including the PAB, thinks I have given an interview but I had nothing to do with the article that appeared quoting me. The letter that they are talking about is a detailed observation I made as the Secretary of the Power and Energy Ministry. In that I simply gave my observation because I thought that would be helpful. This is a confidential letter and I dont know how it was leaked to the media, he said.
	When contacted by the Daily Mirror earlier regarding the issue, Dr. Batagoda stated the company which had initially been granted the tender was a company that had always obtained this tender for the past five years. There was nothing wrong in their communication to the SCAPC and we have chosen the most suitable bidder. (Shihara Maduwage)

Colombo might become a Chicago : UPFA
	
	TThe UPFA yesterday charged that the Colombo city which recorded a high development rate would soon become a city like Chicago where there are frequent clashes because of the UNP administration.
	UPFA Colombo District candidate Wimal Weerawansa said the city was developed at a high rate due to the action taken by the previous government and alleged the actions of the UNP administration were detrimental to the city because the UNP had allegedly involved with underworld figures.
	The city developed under UPFA government and the security measures were taken to make sure that the underworld would not be operated. Many underworld figures left the country back then, he told a news conference.
	Addressing the news conference, UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said Minister Ravi Karunanayake was attempting to put the responsibility of Fridays Kotahena shooting to the accounts of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the UPFA.
	It was the habit of the UNP to assign underworld figures to carry out their election campaign and seems they have re started the gun culture in electioneering. UNP candidates had promised to release individuals arrested for grave crimes to gain more votes, Mr. Premajayantha alleged.
	He said there were also reports that some ministers were influencing Police investigations on the Kotahena incident where two supporters electioneering for Minister Ravi Karunanayake, were killed due to gunshot injuries. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)

Golden Key reinstalling depositorsconfidence with compensation
	
		 		 
		 
			
A compensation payment plan is currently underway to pay depositors of the Golden Key Credit Card Company.
This plan was initiated following a request made by representatives of the Golden Key Depositors Association and Golden Key All Depositors Association, to President Maithreepala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, to interfere in this matter and extend the support of the government in working out a solution.
Measures were taken to resolve the issue by recovering and paying money back to the depositors, and consequently the repayment process has been conducted since 2009.
Accordingly, the depositors were paid under four phases. A total of Rs. 791 million was paid to 8,052 depositors under phase one, while Rs. 685 million was paid to 7,036 depositors under phase two. Phase three saw the payment of RS. 574 million to 5,777 depositors, while under phase four, which was concluded last January, Rs.11 million were distributed among 457 depositors who had made investments of less than Rs. 1 million.

However, following the fourth phase, the payment plan was halted due to Supreme Court orders pertaining to the Golden Key Credit Card Company case, and the Company faced legal restrictions in liquefying its assets, in order to attain the necessary finances to pay the depositors.
Due to legal restrictions, after January, Golden Key did not have funds to pay the depositors, and the depositors too were facing numerous economic hardships. Taking this into account, representatives of the two associations met the President, Prime Minister and Minister Ravi Karunanayake and requested them to interfere in the matter and provide a solution. Then under the instructions of the President and the Prime Minister, Minister Ravi Karunanayake got involved. His efforts regarding the solving this issue should be greatly appreciated as he was very keen on resolving this issue immediately, said Dushanthi Hapugoda, President of the Golden Key All Depositors Association and Director, Golden Key Credit Card Company.
Accordingly, under Minister Ravi Karunanayakes instructions, the Treasury and the Central Bank will be providing funds worth of Rs. 8.5 billion to the Company to settle the payments to depositors. Hence, the payment plan was resumed from July 24th where the rest of the depositors will be paid back in groups. As such a portion of 41 percent from their total deposit will be paid under this plan.
The first group of depositors, which included people who had made investments less than two million are to be paid within one month starting from the date of resumption and the Treasury has provided 544 million rupees to settle these payments. Depositors who deposited funds from two to 10 million rupees will be paid in two months and the depositors whose deposits exceeded 10 million rupees will be paid in a year.
Wasantha Gunathilake, President of the Golden Key Depositors Association and Director of Golden Key Credit Card Company opined that this solution, which is a significant achievement in terms of getting justice for depositors, was a result of not giving up the fight for justice.

He explained in the language that the investigator understood!
	
This veteran white collar bigwig once functioned as the secretarial one of the main office in the state sector, recently was summoned to a Police probe unit for questioning regarding a certain tender affair.
The inquiring officer, a young man in uniform began asking questions. The technical report says that the project could be completed at a cost not exceeding Rs.35 million. But a Rs.40 million tender has been picked toward the contract!
The veteran bureaucrat explained that there were a number of other factors than the Technical report to be taken into reckoning in the matter of selecting the most suitable tender. And he proceeded to explain all other factors to the young inquiring officer.
However, the officer looked unimpressed. So you gave the contractor Rs.5 million in excess in order to get it back as your cut he asked the former secretarial one.
The veteran bureaucrat with a clean record felt highly affronted by the question, but he held his anger under check.
OK, officer. Place on record my answer to your question: A contractor is required to offer a bribe to mine sand from the river. He has to bribe those on the road when transporting the sand. He has to bribe to fell trees. He has to bribe again when transporting the logs. You ought to know whom the contractor has to bribe. Therefore, no contractor would seek a contract at the estimated cost. Have you any more questions to ask

However, this official came in for flak for giving the Green party a clean slate at a media briefing held at the Green party headquarters.
Meanwhile, informed sources of the Dangerous Drug Control Board say that the names of the Drug and ethanol barons appear mostly on the Colombo, Gampaha, Puttalam, Kurunegala and Matale district nomination lists and some of them are former Ministers! The black-coated gentry with ties to the Betel leaf had asked the Board Chief why he was not making public his list of drug and ethanol barons, and the latter had replied that he would go to town with the names after handing over the list to the new Big Boss. Meanwhile, the Board Chief has found himself boxed in by what he least expected: the Green politico who took him to his party head office for the media briefing, they say, is pressing for disciplinary action against him while the opposition politicos accuse him of carrying out a Green party contract!

High fliers lavish lifestyle at public expense
	
This Diyawanna member with dubious educational qualifications was hand-picked by the former strongman to oversee a key Ministry, which was in the charge of a learned professor. The overseer contributed liberally towards making the previous regime unpopular.
The lavish lifestyle led by this member at public expense while being a blue-eyed sycophant of the former royal family is a main topic in political circles these days.
This one-time high flier was a leading member of the entourage that accompanied the deposed strongman to the annual UN sessions last year.
The bills on wining and dining he ran during his stay in an exclusive hotel in New York would put to shame even a king used to an extravagant lifestyle, they say. According to the hotel bills submitted to account for his expenses, this worthy had helped himself to meals priced in the range of US$ 90.57 to US$292.20.
The expensive meals and wine alone could not make the man happy. He had wanted expensive adults only films too to keep himself entertained, they say.
It is a strange twist of fate, this Diyawanna member who once enjoyed life to his hearts content in expensive hotel suites, of course at public expense, is today languishing in a state-run lodge.

HSBCfirst-half profits up 10% on China investing frenzy
	
REUTERS: HSBC Holdings said its first-half profit climbed a better than expected 10 percent, driven by a strong performance in Hong Kong that comes as the bank considers moving its headquarters to the Asian financial hub.
HSBC also announced yesterday the sale of its Brazil unit to Banco Bradesco SA, the countrys second-biggest private-sector bank, for a higher than expected 17.6 billion reais ($5.2 billion), as HSBC seeks to cut underperforming businesses.
Europes biggest bank reported that pretax profits in the six months to the end of June were $13.6 billion, up from $12.3 billion a year earlier and well above analysts average forecast of $12.5 billion according to a poll conducted by the bank.
HSBC has become increasingly reliant on its former headquarters of Hong Kong for profits as its businesses in Europe, the United States and other emerging markets slow.
The banks improved profits were driven by an investing frenzy in Hong Kong among individual customers amid Chinas soaring markets earlier in the year, the bank said.
HSBCs wealth management revenues in Hong Kong from equities, mutual funds and asset management increased significantly, Chairman Douglas Flint said in the earnings statement.
Chinas stock markets have been a boon for the lender, driving profits for the banks broking business in Hong Kong via the Stock Connect trading link with Shanghai as mainland shares soared prior to their June crash.
The market turmoil in recent weeks could mean a gloomier outlook for the second half for the bank, however, if investors souring on Chinese stocks curbs their buying of shares and related investment products.
The banks profits benefited from the boost from Stock Connect before the market turned, so I wouldnt extrapolate the same level of performance into the third quarter and beyond, said Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec Securities in London.
Asia now accounts for two-thirds of HSBCs profits, and Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver has pinned the lenders fortunes on a pivot to the region and its fast-growing economies.
The bank is speeding up a cull of unprofitable units and countries by cutting almost 50,000 jobs - half of them from selling businesses in Brazil and Turkey.
HSBC also said it had increased to $1.3 billion from $550 million the sum set aside to cover costs from various regulatory probes into banks rigging of foreign exchange markets worldwide.
The lenders shares were unchanged in Hong Kong early afternoon yesterday, against a 1 percent drop in the citys benchmark Hang Seng index.

The new Big Boss did not attend the launching of the Betel leaf  election manifesto although he is the chair of that party. The Betel leaf seniors later decided that if the mountain does not come to Mohammed, Mohammed should go to the mountain. So they called on the new Big Boss armed with a copy of the manifesto.
The new Big Boss who warmly welcomed the Betel leaf seniors had also laid out a table with milk rice and kavum for them. And they were gaily chatting while enjoying milk rice and traditional sweetmeats.
One of the visitors suddenly said in jest: If you, Sir, make a statement like the one you made earlier he could not finish what he was going to say as everyone burst into laughter.
Pleasantries over, the new Big Boss received the manifesto formally presented to him and as the visitors waited for him to say something, he articulated the pithy Sinhala phrase that expresses ones resignation: Ohoma yang! Ohoma yang!

A few Yahapalanaya bigwigs and a number of stalwarts of the previous regime are brazenly misusing their official vehicles for electioneering, they say.
Election monitors have complained to the Elections Commissioner that certain bigwigs of both main parties, disdaining the example set by their party leaders and continue to misuse their official vehicles.
Some politicos are said to misuse their official vehicles even for activity that constitute serious violations of the election law, they say.
Election observers say law enforcing authorities appear to have turned a blind eye to numerous election law violations being committed in the North, North Central and the Western provinces in particular.

The former strongman had at his disposal helicopters to campaign around the country at the previous elections. Alas! At this election he is compelled to go round by car. And he has complained that he finds it difficult to attend election rallies in far-flung areas as a result.
This transport problem had come up for discussion at a meeting of the Betel leaf rebel group held at a Buddhist temple that is being used as the operational headquarters of the deposed strongman. A Buddhist prelate on hearing about the travails of travel that the former Boss was undergoing had launched a fund raiser then and there to enable him to reach distant places by air. 
There had been a prompt response to the appeal for funds from the attendees and the collection that amounted to nearly Rs.1.2 million was sufficient to meet the cost of helicopter rides for two days, they say.

Tiger Diaspora backs Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam
	
By D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Valvettithurai is a place that has figured prominently in the politics of Sri Lankan Tamils. Valvettithurai is a coastal town along the Vadamaratchy littoral region of the northern Jaffna peninsula.VVT as Valvettithurai is generally referred to acquired a notorious reputation at one time as the hotbed of smuggling. In later years Valvettithurai became known as the nursery of Tamil militancy. A very large number of VVT youths have been at the forefront of the Tamil armed struggle launched to achieve the secessionist ideal of Tamil Eelam. Chief among these was Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader Thiruvengadam Velupillai Prabhakaran.
The Tamil armed struggle was crushed conclusively in May 2009 with the military debacle of the LTTE at Mullivaaikkaal in the Mullaitheevu districrt. Prabhakaran himself was killed along the shore of the Mullaitheevu lagoon known as Nanthikkadal. Even Prabhakarans ancestral abode in Valvettithurai has been razed to the ground and the property is now overrun with vegetation. Nevertheless, Valvettithurai continues to retain an inexplicable aura within Tamil ultra-nationalist circles.
Crafty politicians have kept nourishing this VVT mystique even after the LTTEs eclipse as part of playing to the gallery politics. One of the most disgusting spectacles of this type of politics was the Volte  face by former Supreme Court Judge Canagasabai Viswalingam Wigneswaran, while addressing propaganda meetings in VVT for the Northern Provincial council elections in 2013. Wigneswaran delivered a thundering speech to an audience consisting mainly of people from VVT and neighbouring areas in which he stated that Prabhakaran the son of VVT soil was a great hero and not a terrorist.
Pirapakaran oru payangaravathiyalla. Avar Thamil Inathin Viduthalikkaaha Poaradiya oru Maha Veeran(Prabhakaran was not a terrorist. He was a great hero who fought for the freedom of the Tamil people) re-iterated Wigneswaran on Valvettithurai soil.
The latest Tamil political stunt on Valvettithurai soil was staged by the Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF) which was contesting the 2015 Parliamentary polls under the cycle symbol of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC).The TNPF contesting as ACTC continued with the practice of pandering to VVT sentiments by unveiling its election manifesto in Valvettithurai on August 2nd 2015. The date coincided with the 26th anniversary of the VVT massacre of 1989 where over 30 civilians were killed by the soldiers of the Indian army after an LTTE attack was launched from the VVT hospital premises. The TNPF paid homage to the victims of the 1989 VVT massacre and the LTTE Great Heroes or Maaveerargal before commencing their rally at the VVT Revady Sports Club grounds. The manifesto was released at the TNPF rally.Tamil National Alliance
The ACTC/TNPF is contesting all five electoral districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces. The ACTC list for the Jaffna electoral district comprising the Jaffna and Kilinochchi administrative districts is headed by Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam. The Wanni electoral district consisting of the administrative districts of Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullaitheevu is headed by Sivapatham Gajendrakumar.
The Trincomalee, Amparai and Batticaloa district lists are headed by Iraa. Sreegnaaneswaran, Chelliah Rasaiah and Nagamuthu Panneerchelvam respectively. According to political observers the ACTC/TNPF does not have much support south of Elephant Pass. Yet it is fielding candidates in all the Tamil areas in a bid to challenge the political supremacy of the dominant Tamil National
Alliance (TNA).
Sri Lankan Tamil politics in the years between 1949 to 1971 were marked by the rivalry between the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) contesting under the cycle symbol and the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), which had the house as its symbol. In an interesting re-play of the past, the Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF) contesting under the ACTC cycle symbol is battling the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) contesting under the ITAK symbol of house. The political competition of the past between cycle and house has taken on new forms in the present scenario.
The acknowledged supreme leader of both the ACTC and TNPF is Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, whose qualifications as stated in media advertisements are  LLB London and Barrister at law. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam is both the President of the TNPF and General Secretary of the ACTC. Gajendrakumar who spends considerable periods of time in Europe is perhaps a shining example of dynasty in the Sri Lankan Tamil political sphere. He belongs to the third generation of Ponnambalams in politics. (Not to be confused with Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan or Arunachalam).Ganapathy Gaangaesar Ponnambalam
Gajendrakumars paternal grandfather Ganapathy Gaangaesar Ponnambalam known as GG Ponnambalam (snr) was the founder president of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress. He was a brilliant lawyer who appeared with distinction in some of the most controversial cases of his time. GG Ponnambalam was the uncrowned political leader of Sri Lankan Tamils for nearly two decades before and after Independence from the British. He represented Point Pedro Constituency in the State Council from 1934 to 1947 and the Jaffna electorate in Parliament from 1947 to 1960 and 1965 to 1970.
Ponnambalam served as Minister of Industries and Fisheries from 1949 to 1953 in the UNP led Governments of D.S. Senanayake and Dudley Senanayake. GG became famous for espousing the political claim of balanced representation referred to as fifty  fifty in popular parlance. GG wanted a balanced legislature with 50 % seats for the Sinhala majority and 50 % for all the minorities together.
GG Ponnambalams son and Gajendrakumars father was Kumar Ponnambalam or GG Ponnambalam jnr. Kumar Ponnambalam was also a leading lawyer who appeared for many youths charged under the draconian prevention of terrorism act(PTA).Kumar was heavily involved in politics leading the Tamil Congress after the demise of his father. Though Kumar made waves in politics he was never elected to any political office
during his lifetime.
Kumar Ponnambalam contested Jaffna electorate in 1977 under the earlier first past the post winner system and was defeated. He led a list of ACTC candidates at the Jaffna electoral district under the proportionate representation system in 1989 and lost again. In 1994 Kumar led an all - Tamil independent list in Colombo but was unsuccessful again. GG Ponnambalam (jnr) shot into national prominence in 1982 when he contested Sri Lankas first ever Presidential election. Kumar came fourth out of six candidates ahead of LSSP leader Dr. Colvin R de Silva and NSSP chief Vasudeva Nanayakkara.Kumar Ponnambalam
In later years Kumar Ponnambalam became a shameless sycophant of the LTTE. He kept issuing provocative statements supportive of the LTTE while living in Colombo. Kumar was assassinated on January 5th 2000 in Colombo. His bullet riddled body was found in his vehicle on a lane off Ramakrishna Road in Wellawatte.
A few days prior to his murder Kumar Ponnambalam had written an open letter to then president Chandrika Kumaratunga. He prefaced it with the lines -I write as a Tamil Eelavan. But more importantly, I write as an unalloyed, unrepentant supporter of the political philosophy of the LTTE and as one who, with that conviction, lives in the South. I write as one who has publicly stated this position of mine not only within this island but also without, and both verbally and in writing. Tiger supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran conferred the posthumous honour Maamanithan (Great human) upon Kumar Ponnambalam.
GG Ponnambalams grandson and Kumars son Gajendrakumar Gangaser Ponnambalam was born on January 16th 1974.After completing his primary and secondary school studies at Royal College, Colombo and the Colombo International school, Gajendrakumar went to London for tertiary studies. He read law at the London Universitys School of Oriental and African Studies and obtained a LL.B degree. He then enrolled at the Lincolns inn to be a Barrister-at-law. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1997. Thereafter he was admitted to the Law College in Colombo to be qualified as an Attorney-at-law in Sri Lanka. He took his oaths in 1999.
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam entered active politics after the death of his father. In 2001, four Tamil organizations namely the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC), the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) came together as the Tamil National Alliance. Gajendrakumar contested in Jaffna and was elected to Parliament. In 2004 he contested from Jaffna again on the TNA list and won. He was for a time regarded as the blue eyed boy of TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan and many predicted a bright political future for Gajendrakumar within the folds of the TNA. This however was not to be.Preference Vote Tally
Though the TNA came into being independently it was later under the control of the LTTE. In 2004 the LTTE finalised the TNA lists of candidates and also rigged the elections. The TNA won twenty two seats including two on the national list in 2004. Among the TNA (described by Douglas Devananda as tiger nominated agents) Parliamentarians, two were identified as being very close to the LTTE hierarchy. They were Mr. Selvarajah Gajendran and Ms. Padmini Sithambaranathan.
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam was affiliated to this duo. Interestingly Gajendran, Padmini and Gajendrakumar were first (112,077), second (68,240) and third (60,770) respectively in the preference vote tally for Jaffna in the LTTE rigged 2004 poll.
Things however changed after May 2009 and when polls were announced in 2010 the situation was different. When Selvarajah Gajendran and Padmini Sithambaranathan were close to the LTTE hierarchy earlier, they used that influence to undermine and defy the TNA leadership. Like the cobra around Lord Shivas neck inquiring the well-being of the Karudan or Kite bird this duo had disregarded the TNA leaders due to their tiger clout They had disrespected several other academics and professionals in Jaffna too. Both Gajendran and Padmini had also been involved with Jaffna university politics. They were instrumental in politicising undergrads to unacceptable pro  tiger levels and were instrumental in organizing a series of Pongu Thamil (Tamil Upsurge) demonstrations. They were also involved in inciting students into violent demonstrations on the lines of the Palestinian Intifada. But after Mahinda Rajapaksa became President and his brother Gotabaya the Defence Secretary the State began striking back. Fire was met with fire.
A massive crackdown through both routine channels and unorthodox methods was launched against tiger and pro-tiger elements in Jaffna. Naturally sections of the student population had to bear the brunt of this anti- tiger offensive. But Gajendran and Padmini who had played a major role in instigating these students were not there to stand by the victims to whose misery they had contributed. Instead they took refuge first in the Wanni and later in foreign countries. After exposing the student community to danger and hardship, this couple was nowhere to be seen during troubled times.Gajendran and Padmini
However, when elections were scheduled both Gajendran and Padmini returned home and prepared to contest again. But the long-suffering TNA leadership was not prepared to oblige. Furthermore, substantial sections of the Jaffna student population as well as Jaffna academics and professionals indicated quietly to the TNA leaders that nominating the couple would not be welcomed.
Thus the TNA leadership took the bold decision of denying nomination to both. But Gajendran and Padmini Sithamparanathan latched on to Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam. Earlier Gajendrakumar had some disputes with the TNA leadership about the 2010 Presidential election. Egged on by some Tamil extremists in the Diaspora, Gajendrakumar had wanted a boycott. Now the same Diaspora elements played a huge role in cementing an alliance between the discarded duo and young Ponnambalam.
In Quixotic fashion, Gajendrakumar began tilting at windmills to rescue imaginary maidens from imaginary dragons. He canvassed intensely for nominations to be given to both. When places on the nomination list were offered to Gajendrakumar and Tamil Congress president Appaputhurai Vinayagamoorthy, Gajendrakumar spurned them and instead requested that those places be given to Gajendran and Padmini Sithamparanathan. This led to the parting of ways between Vinayagamoorthy and Ponnambalam. Vinayagamoorthy, who had been a Jaffna district MP from 2000 to 2004 threw in his lot with the TNA leadership and accepted nomination. He was elected in 2010.Tamil National Peoples Front
The Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam  Padmini Sithamparanathan  Selvarajah Gajendran trio struck out separately. Gajendrakumar along with Gajendran and Sithamparanathan broke ranks from the TNA and formed the Tamil National Peoples Front. They filed nomination under the ACTC symbol of the cycle in Jaffna and Trincomalee districts. Then began an election campaign in which Gajendrakumar viciously attacked the then TNA leadership consisting of Sambanthan, Senathirajah and Suresh. He declared that what the TNPF wanted was the defeat of Senathirajah and Suresh Premachandran in Jaffna and Sampanthan in Trincomalee. When results were announced the TNPF contesting as ACTC was trounced. In Jaffna the TNPF polled only 6,362 votes. In Trincomalee it got just 1,182 votes. Gajendran, Sithamparanathan and Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam who were the first three in terms of preferences in 2004 were totally demolished in 2010.
In what was perhaps a fatal miscalculation Gajendrakumar had hitched his wagon to the Padmini-Gajendran star and seriously damaged his political future. 
But as Talleyrand said of the restored Bourbons of France, Gajendrakumar too had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. He continued along the same TNPF track with Selvarajah Gajendran. The tall Gajendrakumar and the short Gajendran with their similar sounding names became the terrible twins of Tamil politics. The politics of the ACTC/TNPF deteriorated into venomous hatepolitics. The target was the TNA in general and parliamentarians R. Sampanthan and MA Sumanthiran in particular. The deplorable personalised manner in which Gajendrakumar attacks Sumanthiran is reminiscent of the pathological hatred displayed by his father Kumar towards Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam.
The ACTC/TNPF is strongly backed and heavily influenced by LTTE and Pro-LTTE elements in the Global Tamil Diaspora. These tiger and pro-tiger elements are strongly opposed to the TNA and its current political approach of working towards an acceptable political settlement within a united but not necessarily unitary Sri Lanka. The LTTE may have been destroyed in Sri Lanka but its overseas structures remain. Slightly eroded and extremely low key but in working condition still.
The overall objective of these elements is two  fold. Revive the LTTE in some form and engage in violence in Sri Lanka. Undermine the political process and disrupt all positive political engagement between Tamil representatives and the Governments in power in Colombo.Vicious Political Attacks
In order to achieve this objective the TNA has to be weakened, divided or converted to the Diaspora tiger cause. So these tiger elements in the Diaspora have been attacking the TNA from within and without. Some TNA constituents and members are working as fifth columnists and diminishing the TNA from within. At the same time vicious political attacks are launched from outside on the TNA. The TNPF is a ready, able and willing tool in this tiger Diaspora backed onslaught against the TNA. Among the TNPF candidates contesting in Jaffna are former TNA parliamentarians Padmini Sithamparanathan, Selvarajah Gajendran and of course Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam.
The TNPF/ACTC refrained from contesting local authority or Provincial Council elections saying they were of no use to the Tamil people. It also wanted the Tamils to boycott the Presidential poll of 2015. The TNPF/ACTC was merely voicing the wishes of the  tiger Diaspora in this.
However, the Tamil people living in Sri Lanka snubbed the TNPF/ACTC by voting in very large numbers at these elections. Moreover they supported the TNA strongly in the local authority and provincial polls. They also voted for the TNA backed Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential poll instead of heeding the boycott call of the TNPF. Now the TNA seems poised for victory at the forthcoming Parliamentary elections.
It is against this backdrop that the TNPF is contesting the polls under the ACTC. The aim is to cause as much political damage to the TNA as possible. If one were to strip away the convoluted verbiage of the TNPF manifesto and bare it down to the essentials, one may be compelled to emulate the Dravidian movement patriarch Eevaeraa Periyaar(Dravida Kazhagham leader E. V. Ramswamy Naicker) and shout
Vengaayam (Onion).
When you peel away the layers of an onion you end up with nothing but tears in your eyes. Likewise when you distil the TNPF manifesto you end up with nothing but tears in your eyes for the predicament of the Tamil people in having to put up with a political outfit of this nature.Two Countries in One Country
There is a saying in Tamil Oru Paanai Soatrukku oru Soaru padham meaning one morsel of rice will indicate whether the rice in a pot has been cooked well or not. In similar vein I shall make reference to just one point in the TNPF manifesto that is illustrative of the partys politics. The TNPF says it is for Irandu Thesam, Oru Naadu. When translated into simple English this means two countries in one country because both Thesam and Naadu are two different words with the same meaning - country.
The word Thesam is Sanskritised and derived from the word Desh, while Naadu is of pure Tamil origin and rooted in Classical Tamil. If one were to be charitable in interpreting the manifesto it could be inferred perhaps that what the TNPF seeks is confederation. If so the manifesto text should be very definite and not vague but in this instance there is deliberate ambiguity.
What the TNPF recommends as a political solution to the Tamil national question is the demarcation of the Island into a Tamil Thesam comprising the Northern and Eastern provinces and a Sinhala Thesam consisting of the other seven provinces. Thereafter the two Thesam countries can form one Naaducountry.
Apart from the hilarity caused by terminology, the political philosophy articulated in this demand gives rise to two fundamental questions. Firstly how does one merge the North and East into one Tamil country when the non  Tamils in the Eastern province are more than 60 % of the population. Secondly how can the provinces outside the North and East be lumped together as a Sinhala country when 48 % of the Tamils and two-thirds of the Muslims in the Island of Sri Lanka are living in those seven provinces
The TNPF/ ACTC manifesto further states that a political settlement recognizing the concepts of Thaayagam,(Homeland) Thesiyam (Nationhood) and Suya nirnayam (self  determination) should be evolved. If such a solution is not possible within a specific time frame then the TNPF would demand a referendum for the Tamil people in the Island. The TNPF would consult the Tamil people and mobilise their support towards this objective. The manifesto does not outline the purpose for which the referendum is to be held.Sixth Constitutional Amendment
The ambiguity and confused terminology of the TNPF seems to be deliberate. Despite the rhetoric of being faithful to the Tamil Eelam cause and the lambasting of the TNA as having sold out, the reality today is that anyone wanting to contest Parliamentary elections has to disavow separatism or run the risk of being disqualified. The sixth Constitutional amendment has ensured that. Hence the TNPF too is playing it safe by being vague and ambiguous wherever and whenever necessary. The candidates may wax eloquent about being prepared to sacrifice but the reality is that they are not ready to sacrifice a chance to become an MP.
Meanwhile, the Tiger Diaspora backs the TNPF/ACTC to the hilt. Unlike his grandfather and father, Gajendrakumar does not have to spend the family wealth to contest elections. The benefactors from abroad will see to all such mundane needs. Reports from the election front suggest that the ACTC/ TNPF is running a well oiled election campaign this time. The voters are not being wooed by campaign rhetoric alone but also through a bountiful personal touch that is of benefit to both the receiver and giver.
Political music is being played by the TNPF in the North and East. Those who pay the piper call the tune. The determination of Diaspora elements backing the TNPF is almost unbelievable. It is a high stakes gamble for these tiger and pro-tiger elements. A movement called Maatrathukkaana Kural (Voice for change) was launched overseas by the Diaspora many months ago. Meetings and discussions calling for a change from the TNA to TNPF were continuously held. People were pressured to contact their relatives and friends in Sri Lanka and ask them to vote for the cycle. Tiger controlled and tiger influenced media organs have been repeatedly extolling the virtues of Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam.Fascinating and Frightening
It is both fascinating as well as frightening to witness this unfolding phenomenon. Here is an influential Diaspora group of a particular political persuasion with ample resources at its disposal striving to change the political equation in the land of their birth. The ultimate objective being to pave the way for the creation of two states in the Island. The facetious euphemism of two countries in one country should not let this grim reality be overlooked. The tiger and pro-tiger Diaspora wants a political change among the Tamils of Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka through this election. The ACTC /TNPF is the instrument being utilised to bring about such a change. What would happen if such a change were to occur Many years ago when the United Front led by Sirima Bandaranaike swept the polls the veteran Tamil political leader SJV Chelvanayakam observed Only God can save the Tamil people now. Let me conclude by saying that if the change envisaged by the tiger Diaspora is brought about by a TNPF victory in Sri Lanka Even God cannot save the Tamil people now!D. B. S.

UN assistance to NE only through Govt. Mahishini
	
The government today said that if any project is being done by the United Nations as assistance for the resettled people in Northern Province, it would be done through the Ministry of Resettlement of the central government not through the Northern Provincial Council.
Foreign Ministrys Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said this while commenting on a statement by UN Spokesman Stephane Dujarric at a UN briefing that United Nations was exploring provision of technical and financial assistance including the support to the Northern Province on a request made by the Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran.
There are no major projects except one where only immediate assistance for the resettled people is provided by the United Nations. According to the normal procedure, it will be done through the Ministry of Resettlement. They do not directly deal with the provincial councils,Ms. Colonne said.
UN spokesman Dujarric had said it was considering the practicality of a broad package of technical and financial assistance including the support to the Northern Province to bolster citizen confidence in the peace process.
Responding to a question posed by a journalist, he had said that UN would support to advance the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka by resettlement of internally displaced persons, strengthening human rights mechanism, and ending impunity.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Video: UNFGG denounces Kotahena shooting
	
The United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) today denounced the Kotahena shooting incident in which two people lost their lives and said no candidate should be involved with underworld figures during their election campaign.
UNFGG Kalutara District candidate Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said if any candidate sought the assistance of underworld figures, the act should be denounced completely.
Strict legal action should be taken against incidences involvement of the underworld. What happened at Kotahena was unfortunate whether or not the underworld was involved, he told a news conference.
However, he rejected the claims of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) that the underworld remained inactive during the UPFA government and had raised its head again today.
Mr. Warnasinghe said the previous government had given an official status to underworld figures and had made them political leaders. Therefore, it seemed the underworld was inactive but it was clearly intact, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Video: UPFA wants Ranil et al to take poison
	
	The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) said today it was illegal for the Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone of the Central Expressway.
	This is the Northern Expressway that we planned and wanted to implement. They have instead changed the name and called it the Central Expressway," SLFP Spokesman Dilan Perera said.
	He said that having been informed of the plans to lay the foundation stone, the UPFA had complained to the Elections Commissioner, who had thereafter issued a directive banning speeches.
	"Ranil Wickremesinghe is a candidate and it is illegal for him to lay the foundation stone. We brought this to the notice of the Elections Commissioner, who in turn had directed that no speech could be made, although the Prime Minister could be present. The Prime Minister disregarded this directive and went ahead and made a speech," he said.
	He said that the estimated cost for the construction of the expressway was full of fraud.
	"If you look at the numbers it just doesnt add up. This government has gone beyond the bond scam and are now engaged in highway robberies," he said.
	Flanked by Bandula Gunawardena, Udaya Gammanpila and former Secretary to the Ministry of Media Charitha Herath together with the rest showed bottles depicting poison and called for leaders of the government to consume it.
	"Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera had said that anyone who robs public money has to swallow poison and I call upon the leaders of this government to drink poison because they have continuously robbed public funds," he said.
