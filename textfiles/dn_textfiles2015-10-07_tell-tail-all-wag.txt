Tell 'Tail'! All in a wag!

What do your dog's tail wags mean? Emotional sensor could help owners understand their pet's feelings
$90 sensor attaches to dog's tail and measures movement and speed
Dubbed TailTalk, device relays data it collects to an app via Bluetooth
Left wagging indicates aggression and right wagging suggests happiness
Creators hope sensor will help owners understand what upsets their pets
Now a new gadget claims to translate these wags into emotions so that owners can record the highs and lows of their pet's day.
Dubbed TailTalk, the sensor attaches to a dog's tail and works in a similar way to a Fitbit to measure both movement and speed.
The way dogs wag their tail can tell you a lot about how they're feeling. Now a new gadget claims to translate these wags into emotions so that owners can record the highs and lows of their pet's day
The way dogs wag their tail can tell you a lot about how they're feeling.
Left wagging (when facing the direction the dog is looking) suggests negative feelings such as anger or aggression.
Right wagging is indicative of happiness or excitement, according to recent research.
Broad wagging suggests a dog is happy and isn't threatening you. A slight wag-with each swing of only small breadth is often a tentative 'hello'
A slow wag with tail at 'half-mast' shows the dog is feeling insecure. Small, fast movements suggest the dog is about to either run or fight. Left wagging, according to its creators, often suggests negative feelings such as anger or aggression. Meanwhile, right wagging happiness or excitement.
But because dogs move around so much, this bias in direction often goes unseen by humans. The gadget, invented by New York-based firm DogStar Life, is designed to pick up on these subtle cues from a tail wag.
'It basically combines an accelerometer and a gyroscope much like the Fitbit, but it's picking up on the way the tail is moving,' DogStar Life COO and co-founder Mike Karp told Yahoo News. 'The idea is to capitalise on all the research that's been done in the last two to three years on what tail movement means, and translating that into emotion.'
Its creators say the speed of the wag indicates how excited the dog is and, the breadth of each tail sweep can also reveal the dog's emotional state. -Daily Mail, UK
