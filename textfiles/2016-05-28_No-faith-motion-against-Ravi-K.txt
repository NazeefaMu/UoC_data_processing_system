No-faith motion against Ravi K


	

The no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is expected to be taken up for debate in Parliament on June 8.

The joint opposition handed over the motion to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and has been listed for debate. The no-confidence motion alleges that the minister had misrepresented facts about the current state of the economy.

The minister will have to relinquish his portfolio in case the motion is approved at least with a simple majority. Incidentally such a situation had not arisen in recent parliamentary history.(Kelum Bandara)
