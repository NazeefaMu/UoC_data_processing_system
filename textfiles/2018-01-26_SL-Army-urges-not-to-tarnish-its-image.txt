Disgruntled elements were attempting to spread fabricated stories about the Sri Lanka Army with malicious intent, Sri Lanka Army Headquarters said in a media release today.

“It has been observed that certain elements with malicious and hidden agendas are currently engaged in criticizing the Si Lanka Army with the motive of demoralizing and misleading soldiers and tarnishing its image,” it

“In the recent past, some disgruntled elements have been attempting to spread or publish unfounded and fabricated stories in media with regard to incidents like foreign allowances, rations, payments for disabled War Heroes of the Sri Lanka Army," the media release said

“It is also regretful to note that some politically-manipulated elements with vested
Interests are found to be behind the regularly organized street protests by disabled War Heroes or members of their families, although their issues have been resolved to a large extent with 100% increase in their pension and disabled payments,” it stated.

It further said the Sri Lanka Army had fully committed to the national security and nation- building roles as the most sought after service provider with strict focus on concerns of reconciliation and development.

The SLA appealed to all segments of society to keep the Army off from their machinations and all acts of intentional vilification and public ridicule for the greater benefit of the country. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
