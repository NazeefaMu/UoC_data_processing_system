Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara today issued warrants on National Freedom Front (NFF) leader MP Wimal Weerawansa and MP Jayantha Samaraweera as they have failed to appear in Court when a case, which was filed against them, was taken up for hearing.

The case was filed against the MPs on charges of causing disturbance to the public by holding a demonstration outside the UN office in Colombo.

The demonstration was held against the visit of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein on February 6, 2016. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
