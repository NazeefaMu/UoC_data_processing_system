This former purohita from Pasdun Korale is a senior Diyawanna member now sitting in the opposition.
 He was a member of a team of Betel leaf stalwarts who recently visited Anuradhapura to oversee the preparations being made to mark the former strongman’s birthday. 
During this visit the team of Betel leaf stalwarts had held deliberations with a group of prominent local leaders of the party on the question of winning the upcoming local government elections. The collective view of the local politicos was that they were sure to suffer a debacle at the polls unless the two rival factions in the party united to face the elections as one strong entity. 
At this stage the senior Diyawanna member from Pasdun Korale spoke up: “I have won at every election I contested on the party ticket for the past 34 years.  Even my son won at provincial polls. But I am sure if I contest on our party ticket at a coming election, I will have to go home. Therefore, let us lose no time in working out a strategy that can ensure our victory.”
