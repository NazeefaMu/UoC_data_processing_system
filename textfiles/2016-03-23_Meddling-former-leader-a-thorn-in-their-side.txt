The leadership of the Betel leaf party has begun appointing new electorate organizers to fill the existing vacancies. The Selection Committee already functioning will first make replacements for the organizers expelled from their positions in the recent past for breaching party discipline. 

 


Meanwhile, a certain former leader of the party interfering to have favorites appointed as electorate organizers has become a thorn in the side of the Selection Committee, they say. Some of the politicos that this person wants to be appointed as organizers are such nonentities incapable of mustering at least 500 votes in their respective constituencies, they say. 


Meanwhile, the new boss of the Betel leaf party has given strict instructions to the party secretariat not to allow the meddling former leader to have any say in the selection of party organizers especially where the Gampaha district is concerned.
