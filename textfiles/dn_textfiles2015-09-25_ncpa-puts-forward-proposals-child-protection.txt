NCPA puts forward proposals for child protection

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), in the wake soaring incidents of child abuses cases in the country, yesterday said the authority submitted proposals which address shortfalls in the legal system and social issues underlying the current situation.
The NCPA said child protection is the responsibility of civil society at large. "If fathers are given more responsibility for the day today care of their children, it less likely that they will view children in a sexualized way", the NCPA in a press release said.
The authority stressed the need of having a fast track court system at the High Court level to try cases of child abuses expediously. The release:
"The NCPA is deeply saddened by the brutal abuse and murder of the five year old girl in Kotadeniyawa and the number of cases of child sexual abuse reported throughout the years. We propose a long term response to the disturbing incidence of child sexual abuse which addresses both the serious shortfalls in our legal system and the many social issues underlying the current situation.
"In terms of the legal system, the priority is the effective and expeditious implementation of the law. First, it is necessary to establish a fast-track court system at the High Court level, to try cases of child abuse expeditiously; currently these cases can take eight years or more.
"Second, it is necessary to clear the large backlog of cases stuck at the High Court and the Attorney General's Department, possibly by establishing additional High Courts per province and providing additional resources to the Attorney General's Department.
"Third, sentencing policy for child abuse cases has to be re-evaluated to ensure the mandatory imposition of the minimum punishment prescribed for cases of child abuse in terms of the Penal Code and sentencing policy guidelines have to be developed. It is necessary to review the provisions of the Bail Act and consider amending it to make child abuse offences non-bailable.
"Fourth, all services dealing with children - including the police, probationary and child care services, the Attorney General's Department, and Courts - should have professional, specialized, and independent child focused divisions free from undue political influence. For example, the Women and Children's Bureau of the Police Department should be restructured by converting it into a Division, under a senior DIG at Police Headquarters with branches at Provincial, District, and Divisional levels with non-transferable officers.
"Officers should speak the language of the area in which they are stationed and be highly trained in collection of evidence, investigation, engaging with women and children, and have affiliated medical personnel who will assist with examination of the victim and be equipped with technology tools like DNA collection and analysis kits.
"We have to find effective ways to address the many social issues that cause or contribute to the incidence of child abuse. We have to deepen our understanding of how sexuality operates within our socio cultural context and refine our interventions to have more impact. The NCPA intends to commission research on this. There has to be a co-ordinated effort from all sectors ofthe government to ensure that the most disadvantaged children and those most at risk are identified and monitored and that they, their families, and communities have access to necessary education, health, social, protective, and other services.
"We have to move away from cultural norms that view child rearing as a woman's responsibility. Most child abuse happens at the hands of a male family member, friend, or acquaintance. It is important that we change the way that men view children. If fathers are given more responsibility for the day to day care of their children, it is less likely that they will view children in a sexualized way. As a society, we must be willing to devote more financial, human, and other resources to strengthening communities, reducing violence and drug and alcohol addiction, introducing relationship and sex education into our school curriculum, to name a few actions, and thus ensuring the protection of our children."
