The case against seven suspects in the killing of TNA Jaffna District MP Nadaraja Raviraj, was today fixed for January 4 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Nirosha Fernando, including three suspects in absentia, who were under open warrants.
Senior State Counsel, Dilan Ratnayake, who appeared for the Attorney General’s Department, sought permission to hear the case in the absence of three suspects, Palana Sami Suresh, Sivakanth Vivekanandan and Fabian Royston Toussaint, under clause 148 Criminal Procedure Code.
Meanwhile, after getting the opinion of the Attorney General, the Magistrate discharged two suspects in the case, Nalaka Mathakadeera and Aruna Shantha.
Seven suspects, Palana Sami Suresh, Prasad Hettiarachchi, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda, Sivakanth Vivekanandan, Fabian Royston Toussaint and Sampath Munasinghe were charged on five counts over the killing of former MP Raviraj.
Two suspects, Roystan Tussaint and Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan were not in country while another suspect, Palana Sami Suresh was said to be missing. The Prosecution told the magistrate that steps had been taken to track down the three suspects who were absconding with the help of Interpol.
The Magistrate noticed the JMO to produce the autopsy report in Court and summoned four witnesses, including one who had turned State witness, Sampath Prithiviraj, who was earlier a suspect in the killing of the TNA MP.
The Magistrate ordered the remand extension of the four suspects for December 22. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
