Aung San Suu Kyi hints at big victory in poll

MYANMAR: Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has hinted at victory in Myanmar’s first free elections for decades despite an unexpected delay in the release of the results. In her first comments after Sunday’s elections, Suu Kyi told a crowd gathered at the National League for Democracy (NLD) party headquarters in Yangon that the results would not be announced as soon as had been expected, “but I think you all have the idea of the results”.
“It is still a bit early to congratulate our candidates who will be the winners,” she said. “I want to remind you all that even candidates who didn’t win have to accept the winners, but it is important not to provoke the candidates who didn’t win to make them feel bad.”
The south-east Asian nation’s election commission had been due to reveal preliminary results at 9a.m on Monday morning but delayed. The final result is expected today.
A big crowd of supporters of Suu Kyi’s NLD party had gathered on Sunday evening at the group’s headquarters in Yangon, formerly Rangoon under the British empire, to cheer, dance and wave red flags.
As many polling stations counted into the early hours of Monday morning, there were signs that the NLD was set for a convincing victory.
House speaker and former ruling party chair Shwe Mann conceded defeat in the central Bago region. Other districts showed NLD gains although it was hard to tell if they represented the rest of the country.
The official Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper ran its Monday headline as “Dawn of a New Era” and said turnout was estimated at 70%, with 30 million eligible voters.
“We’re leading the race but we can’t say for sure we’ll win two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. That would enable us to form an independent government without forming a coalition,” said NLD senior official and spokesman Han Tha Myint. The once-outlawed NLD is expected to win the popular vote, although the Nobel peace prize laureate, who spent much of the past quarter-century under house arrest, is barred from the Presidency by a junta-drafted Constitution.
Yet a key concern, that the army generals would annul the vote as they did when Suu Kyi won a landslide in 1990, was rebuffed in the capital, Naypyitaw, where military commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing said there was “no reason not to accept the election results”, according to the media.
The 2015 polls were observed by around 10,000 election monitors, including many from the European Union and United Nations, and early indications from monitors suggested a largely transparent process.
The Army has also enshrined its power in the constitution – reserving 25% of Parliament seats – keeping the most powerful ministerial portfolios and banning Suu Kyi from the presidency as she has foreign family members. Her late husband was a British academic and she has two British sons.
Jason Carter, grandson of former US President Jimmy Carter and an international election observer, said monitors would release a full evaluation “including the political context in which this election is occurring” on Tuesday The incumbent Union Solidarity and Development Party would need far fewer seats as it backed by of the military. Some 91 parties have contested the election in a country of around 51 million people. - AFP
