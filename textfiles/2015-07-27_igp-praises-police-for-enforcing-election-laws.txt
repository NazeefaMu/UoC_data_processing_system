	In the run up to the 2015 General Elections, IGP N. K. Illangakoon yesterday praised police officers countrywide for conducting their duties without bias and enforcing election laws.
	Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the IGP had issued a special note of appreciation addressed to policemen of all ranks, commending the service they had rendered so far in enforcing election laws and maintaining law and order prior to the polls.
	The special message which was said to be a rare appreciation from the head of the Police Department was meant for each and every policeman in the 438 stations and posts countrywide.
	The message had been issued by the IGP’s Office at Police Headquarters under the IGP's signature, and subsequently broadcast over the radio from the IGP's Command Room in Mirihana, Nugegoda.
	The IGP had lauded the efforts of the police to minimise violations of election laws by preventing the pasting of posters, and removal of posters, banners and cutouts.
	“I wish to thank each and every officer for their commitment and best efforts to keep the violations of election law at a minimal level which is a highly commendable,” the IGP had said.
	Police have received 58 complaints of election related violence and made 24 arrests in connection with them.
	Police have made 65 detections related to violations of the election law and arrested 156 persons between the conclusion of nominations on July 13, and yesterday, the spokesman said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
