There is a young Diyawanna member who shines as an outstanding orator both in the august assembly and on the political stage.

 


A story that broke out at a lobby gossip session the other day said that his poetical skills are not second to his oratorical ones.


The story also said that the member is in the habit of sending regular phone messages carrying romantic lyrics and poems to his girlfriends and such compositions are so evocative of deep feelings, the recipient-girls are moved to tears.


Some girls, they say, wonder how could a person who uses such vitriolic language to lash out at his opponents, write such beautiful lyrics which could bring out such tender feelings of love and romance.
However, this Diyawanna poet turns very bashful when his girlfriends come to meet him, they say.
Referring to this Diyawanna member, a colleague of his quipped:


“He is a poet and a lover in the night, a hard-hitting orator in the day and a bashful sissy when he meets his girlfriends!”
