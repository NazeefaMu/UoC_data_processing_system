UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today he had sent the official invitation to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the SLFP May Day Rally to be held in Galle.

Mr. Amaraweera said they hoped to meet Mr. Rajapaksa shortly to discuss his attendance at the rally.

“Some people are trying to separate us and divide the party. We need to begin the victorious trend with the May Day rally,” he said.

When said that Mr. Rajapaksa had earlier said he would not join SLFP May Day rally, Mr. Amaraweera said they were trying to get his support even at the last minute.

He said this to the media after meeting the members of the Delimitation Committee headed by its Chairman to discuss about the Local Government elections today.

Mr. Amaraweera said they had discussions with other parties to get their support at the elections.
 He said 14 political parties would join their alliance in the coming days to contest the upcoming elections. (Ajith Siriwardana)
