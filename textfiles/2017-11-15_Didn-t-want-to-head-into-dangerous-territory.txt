Didn’t want to head into dangerous territory


	



 

A news-piece that went viral recently said Number One and Number Two held a one-on-one, four-hour deliberation behind closed doors in an evening a few days ago at the former’s official residence and the views they exchanged on several serious issues generated much heat leading to a fiery verbal duel.

 


Two days after the reported meeting of the Big Two, the former strongman had met ‘Rugger Wikrama’ the purohita of the Green party at a rugger match and while engrossed in small talk, the former strongman had asked the purohita whether it was true that his party boss had a right royal row with the yahapalanaya boss the other day. 


The query had ruffled the purohita so much he had immediately looked around as if to search someone and then blurted out: “There’s no truth in that story!”


After giving this reply, the purohita had left the place in a hurry as if to avoid any further discourse on the matter, they say.
