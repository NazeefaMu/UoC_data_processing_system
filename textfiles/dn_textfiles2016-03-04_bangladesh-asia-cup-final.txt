Bangladesh into Asia Cup final

 
Bangladesh made a sensational entry to the Asia Cup final when they beat Pakistan by 5 wickets at the Shere Bangla National Stadium yesterday.
Bangladesh will now meet India in the final on Sunday. This is the second time that Bangladesh has entered a final in the tournament in 2012, and were beaten by Pakistan on that occasion.
In a game filled with full of twist and turns Bangladesh who were cruising at one stage at 104 for 5 in the 18th over, suddenly slumped, but two no-balls bowled by paceman Mohammed Sami in he penultimate over helped the hosts to make their task easy.
Bangladesh chasing a victory target of 130 achieved it in 19.1 overs.
Souyma Sarkar (48) and Mushfiquar Rahim put on 37 runs for the third wicket in 5.1 overs while Muhammedullah and skipper Mashrafe Mortaza put the finishing touches to give them the dramatic win.
Pakistan won the toss and decided to bat first in a game resembled a semi- final, a win would take them into the final. They were unable to get their required start. As they lost opener Khuram Manzoor early in the second over, Mohammad Hafeez, Sharjeel Khan and Umar Akmal in the ninth over at 28. Mohammad Hafeez should consider himself a trifle unlucky when he was ruled out lbw to a Mushrafe Mortaza delivery which appeared to be a bit high. But the dismissal of Umar Akmal who stepped out to drive Taskin Ahmed mistimed, Shakib Al Haasan took a good catch at point which definitely had Pakistan in a spot of bother at 28 for 4 in 8.4 overs. Credit should go to the Bangladesh bowlers for restricting job as they were most of the time on the spot. Umar Akmal with Shoib Malik were the batsmen in terrific form in their last game against the UAE.
Shoib Malik in the quest of scoring quick runs was in charge, he played some cracking shots and with Sarfraz Ahmed added 70 runs for the sixth in 8.2 overs. Shoib Malik was finally out for 41 facing thirty deliveries with five fours and six. Skipper Shahid Afridi followed suit without scoring, but Sarfraz Ahmed who was engaged in the partnership with Shoib Malik remained unbeaten on 58 with Anwar Ali, last man out for 13. Al Amin Hossan who got the early break through took 3 for 25 and Arafat Sunny was the second best with figures of 2 for 35.
