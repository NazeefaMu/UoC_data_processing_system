Police panic as drone flies over Lasantha’s grave


	

Police today panicked when a drone attached with a camera flew over the grave of murdered Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga, when it was being exhumed.

Even though the Policemen at the scene searched the assembled journalists at the scene they were unable to find the drone or its handler.

Wickrematnga’s body was exhumed at the Borella cemetery today following a request by the CID to the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court earlier this month.

The Sunday leader Editor was shot dead at Attidiya, Dehiwela on January 8, 2009.
