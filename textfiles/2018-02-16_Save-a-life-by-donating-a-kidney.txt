Save a life by donating a kidney!


	

In the circumstances where 8 out of 10 kidney patients are dying without resources to undergo Dialysis, or a related donor to undergo a transplant, our Foundation
‘Kidney Transplant Support Foundation’ is proud to announce its latest project in its continuing endeavour to save human lives, by inviting Sri Lankans across the country to be
Organ Donors.   Our 1st project was a National Organ Donor Programme in 2009 where every citizen across the country was invited to be a kidney Donor while alive, or a Donor after death. This programme still exists.   
Our 2nd project was working with the Ministry of Transport, and its Departments. The project got the Department of Motor Traffic and the National Transport Medical Institute to insert an ‘Organ Donor Symbol’ into all new or renewed Driving Licenses. Over 12,000 have been issued so far.

Our 3rd and latest project is an ‘SMS’ campaign. This will be done with the approval of the TRC and the support of the 3 leading Mobile Operators, Dialog, Mobitel and Etisalat. An SMS will go to their databases across the country inviting Millions of users to step up and be an organ donor while alive, or registering to be an organ donor after his/her death. Subscribers are invited to visit our website www.ktsf.lk to make live donations, while after death registration will be carried out in conjunction with the Human Tissue Bank. This will be done by directing them through our site, to the Tissue Bank website: htb.mobitel.lk.   
We invite all of you to visit our website www.ktsf.lk and obtain further details of our work and projects and also to go through what the print and electronic media about what we’ve been doing during these past years and support our cause.
