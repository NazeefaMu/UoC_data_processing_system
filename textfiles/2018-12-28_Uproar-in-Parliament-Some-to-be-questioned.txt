Statements will be recorded from some 400 people including parliamentarians in connection with the uproar and the unruly behaviour in the Parliament chamber last month. The police team investigating the incident had yesterday informed the Parliamentary Select Committee appointed to look into the incident.

Informed sources said the police had conveyed this message when the PSC headed by Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri met in the Parliamentary Complex to discuss this matter.

They said the special police team had already recorded a statement from Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and that statements would also be recorded from the members of the parliament staff and media personnel who were present inside Parliament at the time of the incident.

Meanwhile, the Deputy Speaker said the PSC investigations into the incidents were almost over and the final report would be handed over to the Speaker sometime next month. He said the report would then be referred to the Attorney General for further action.

The PSC was appointed by the Speaker to investigate the uproar and the unruly behaviour that took place on November 14, 15 and 16.

The other members of the committee are Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara, MPs Chamal Rajapaksa, Bimal Ratnayake, Chandrasiri Gajadeera and Mavai Senadhiraja. (Sujith Hewajulige)
