Both criminal and civil laws had been violated  by IGP Pujith Jayasundara during the Hambantota Protest and it would be brought to the notice of foreign missions in Colombo, former external affairs Minister G.L. Peiris said.

He said violation of laws were carried out by the IGP out in the open and the Police clearly safeguarded the thugs and launched the attack on innocent protesters.  

“The entire country knows what happened. An elderly woman who became a victim of teargas passed away the next day of the unfortunate incident. This is not practiced in a democratic country. The Joint Opposition will inform the embassies, high commissions and international organizations in this regard,” he told a news conference today.

He said they would also lodge a complaint with the National Police Commission over the issue. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
