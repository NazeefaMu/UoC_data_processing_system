Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne maintained that it was he and a few others that had helped form this government and therefore asked how Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne could call for his removal from the post of Cabinet spokesman.

Dr. Senaratne said that he did not believe in double standards.“I do not have double standards. I am loyal to the government,” he said making his remarks to the media in Anuradhapura.

He said Mr. Seneviratne had been critical of him during the last Cabinet meeting in his absence. “If I were there, he would not have said it. I speak with responsibility. I spoke with the blessings of the President,” he said.(Athula Bandara)
