Chinese scientists may have solved the mystery on being able to grow food in the desert. Trials in Dubai recently proved to be successful with a strain of rice that is able to grow in saltwater with the added bonus that it can also provide higher crop yields.  While the jury is still out on genetically modified food, due to lack of freshwater on the planet it becoming increasingly hard to grow enough rice to feed the demand. 

The next step for the researchers at Qingdao Saltwater Rice Research and Development Center is launching an experimental 100-hectare saltwater rice farm in 2019 that will evaluate the costs of production and different farming techniques – their long-term goal is to cover 10% on the United Arab Emirates with saltwater rice paddies, essentially being able to feed the entire Arab world.
