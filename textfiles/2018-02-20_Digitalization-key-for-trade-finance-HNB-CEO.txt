Digitalization will be a key factor. Technology transformation with a priority for trade finance. The benefits of new technology have not been fully realized. Convergence of physical, financial and document chains, the automation of key processes, due-diligence checks, streamlining Customs procedures in order to reduce costs and complexities and improve working-capital management
The concerns that need to be addressed are; the large fiscal deficits. Inflationary pressure. The large import content, strain on the trade balance and balance of payments and high foreign debt servicing costs. Hence we must; prioritize infrastructure investment which should lead to higher export earnings.  Reduce import expenditure and improve ports and transport infrastructure.
