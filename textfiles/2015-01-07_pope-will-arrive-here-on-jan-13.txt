The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka yesterday called for a peaceful post-election environment to enable a smooth papal visit next week.
Fr Cyril Gamini who is the secretary of special secretariat set up for the pope’s visit made this appeal on behalf of the Catholic Church told a media briefing that the visit would not be cancelled or postponed for any reason.
He denied reports published recently particularly in the social media that there were divisions in the Church with regard to the Pope’s visit.
"There are no divisions in the church as suggested by some," he said and urged all Catholics to pray for a memorable and successful papal visit.
Visitors from Goa and other states in India, Thailand and even from Europe are expected to arrive in the country for the papal visit. In addition 1,000 journalists from foreign countries including a team from the Vatican print and electronic media and a large number of cardinals, bishops and priests are also expected in the country.
Fr. Anthoney Fernandopulle who gave a description of the special mass that will be held in the Galle Face Green said 1,200 special guests will participate in it while 500 physically challenged persons have also been given the opportunity to participate in the mass following a request made by the Pope to meet such people.
The Pope will arrive on January 13 and will pay a courtesy call on the President later in the afternoon and meet all religious leaders at the BMICH later in the day. He will say mass at Galle Face Green on January 14 where he canonise Blessed Fr. Joseph Vaz as the first Sri Lankan saint. On the same day he will visit Madhu and is expected leave for the Philippines on January 15.(Yohan Perera)
