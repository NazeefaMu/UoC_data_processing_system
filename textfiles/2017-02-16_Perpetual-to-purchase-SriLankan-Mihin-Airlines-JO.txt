Joint opposition recently claimed that there was a plan to purchase State owned institutions such as SriLankan and Mihin Air by Perpetual Treasuries Pvt. Ltd.

Addressing a press briefing Prof. G L Peiris said that they had reason to believe that the company was attempting to take over several large-scale State institutions.

Prof. Peiris claimed that Perpetual Treasuries, that was currently embroiled in a major controversy surrounding the Central Bank bond issue, was attempting to purchase these State institutions by using another company as a cat’s-paw.

Recently, State Enterprises and Entrepreneurship Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne had told the media that three companies, namely Peace Airways, Texas Pacific Group (TPG) and Super Group Partners were those selected from among 10 companies to compete for the right to engage in the process of restructuring the SriLankan and Mihin Lanka.

From the selected companies, the deputy minister had said that the Texas Pacific Group was the most qualified to restructure the two airlines. However, it was reported that the TPG, which is a US based group, was connected to Perpetual Treasuries Pvt. Ltd. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
