Two iron rods that pierced through the face and the left arm of a 72-year-old retired military official were removed by a panel of surgeons at the Peradeniya Hospital in a surgery that lasted three hours today.  
The iron rods had pieced through his left arm and cheek when he fell face down on a broken concrete slab with iron rods while sweeping his garden.  
His relatives with the help of residents rushed him to the Peradeniya Hospital with the iron rods still in his body.  
A spokesman for the hospital said the patient was out of danger and recovering.(Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
