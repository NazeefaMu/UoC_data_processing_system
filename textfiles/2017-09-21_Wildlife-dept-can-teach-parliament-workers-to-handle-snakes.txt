We are prepared to educate parliament workers how best to act in case they come across snakes and other venomous reptiles in the parliament premises, <U+200E> Department of Wildlife Conservation Director General G.C. Sooriyabandara told Daily Mirror.

He said they would do so if the authorities make a request.

"We have read reports of snakes and venomous reptiles being frequently sighted in the vicinity of Diyawanna Oya and will teach the parliament workers how to act in such circumstances,” Mr. Sooriyabandara said.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
