Baby elephant rescued from drain dies at Uda Walawe
	
The elephant calf that was less than a month old and had been rescued from an uncovered drain in Hambantota died last night at Elephant Transit Home in Uda Walawe.
The calf had been suffering with diarrhea, because of which it was treated by a veterinarian from the Embilipitiya Hospital, Wild Life Health Management Director Dr. Tharaka Prasad said.

## Title: CDS well placed to meet evolving stakeholder needs: chief
## Section: Financial News

CDS well placed to meet evolving stakeholder needs: chief
	
The breakthrough for Central Depository Systems (Pvt.) Limited (CDS) was made in 1991 when it was established by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). 2016 marks a corporate milestone for CDS, as it is the 25th year of operation since inception. In this in-depth interview, CDS Head Nalin Fonseka speaks on operations at CDS and future plans. 

Could you speak on the role and significance of CDS over the years
When first launched in 1991, CDS was the first depository in South Asia and among the first few depositories globally. We are to date the only depository for the shares of companies listed on the CSE and are licensed as a market intermediary and clearing house by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC).
It is a known fact that an efficient and dynamic depository contributes to a proficiently functioning capital market. In that regard, we have played a crucial role in the Sri Lankan capital market by minimizing risk, reducing costs, ensuring safety of investor assets and by providing value-added services to investors. Over the years, we have evolved to meet the changing dynamics of the Sri Lankan capital market where we have embraced technology, built on our foreign relations and maintained focus on our stakeholders. We will continue this crucial role as the Sri Lankan capital market grows.

Can you comment on how CDS has embraced technology to offer value to your stakeholders
Expanding on value offered to our stakeholders by embracing innovation has continued to be a key objective of CDS over the years.
In 2015, we launched the Settlement Schedule Digitization Solution DS3, which was an innovation entirely driven by CDS. This solution provides a mechanism to digitally sign settlement schedules using digital signatures embedded in a USB Crypto token, which can be downloaded by the settlement banks through a web portal. Currently we are performing live operations through DS3 with three settlement banks.
In the perspective of our account holders, we recently launched SMS alerts and eStatements, adding a new dimension to information dissemination. The SMS alert service offers investors the ability to verify their account activities on a daily basis and this service will enhance the transparency in the order execution process of the stockbrokers. The CDS eStatement on the other hand, offers account holders the ability to access their statements at the click of a button. These endeavours encourage investors to take an active role in the management of their investment portfolios and illustrate the value technology offers in the business that we are in.
We will continue to use technology to offer value and efficiency to the various stakeholders of CDS, including brokering firms, CDS accountholders, company secretaries, registrars of listed companies and various other parties that engage with us. 

Elaborate on the importance of bridging the gap between investors and CDS using eConnect.
I believe that ease of connectivity always matters when offering value to customers. Bridging the gap between investors and CDS has long been an objective of ours and the CDS eConnect facility will play an important role in that regard.
eConnect will take accessing of CDS account transaction details to a new level because of the accessibility through personal computers, tablet PCs or mobile devices. We will be able to enhance client security, offer convenience and create immediate awareness on changes to the CDS account details through this service. Especially from the perspective of the foreign investors, this would provide a platform for them to verify both their account information and portfolio information, which simplifies the process to a large extent.

You mentioned that CDS was the first depository of South Asia. Speak about your partnerships and presence at a regional level. 
Our history and credentials built over the years offer us the leverage to actively contribute in the international stage. Being an active member of the Asia-Pacific Central Securities Depository Group (ACG), which is an association of securities depositories and clearing organisations in the Asia-Pacific region, is one such key partnership. On the other hand, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with National Securities Depository (Pvt.) Ltd of India (NSDL) in May 2015 is another linkage through which we hope to achieve operational benefits. 
Hosting the 17th ACG Cross Training Seminar in Sri Lanka in 2015 and being recognized for our innovative approach to depositary operations at the 18th ACG Cross Training Seminar held in Ho Cho Minh City Vietnam this year, I could say, were a couple of highlights for CDS in recent times.
One of the initiatives presented by our head of operations who participated at the 18th ACG Conference was the e-Dividend concept, which is an initiative of the e-Payment arm of CDS. This was highly commended by the member depositories of the ACG for being an innovative product aimed at serving both foreign and local investors. Some member depositories were even so keen to study the concept further because of its potential to fast-track the current dividend payment process, making life easy for foreign investors, fund managers and custodians.
Interaction and collaboration fostered through regional affiliations help us in ensuring that our current operational model corresponds to internationally accepted practices followed by other Asia-Pacific counterparts, which is an important part of the CSEs bid to develop into a truly world-class exchange.

What other process improvements are you looking at
Upon the successful implementation of the state-of-the-art depository system, CDS is currently working on a project to upgrade the investor account opening process. This initiative will decentralize the account opening process and enable broker firms to open client accounts from their offices without sending the documents to CDS. With this decentralization, both investors and brokering firms can enjoy more flexibility. This will also bring CDS to be in par with other depositories in the region.
We have also taken steps to expedite the process of opening accounts for foreign funds, as the CSE makes a conscious effort to increase foreign investor participation in the Sri Lankan capital market. We have worked under the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) when implementing this improvement. Foreign applicants (funds) can now open CDS accounts within a period of two market days upon the submission of the relevant documents. 

Are you looking at expanding the services offered through CDS going forward
As I mentioned earlier, the improvements we make in the future will be strictly stakeholder focused and will be in line with the vision of the CSE. We are looking at introducing a fully-fledged E-IPO system. This system will facilitate inward and outward payments from investors efficiently and will offer other benefits such as facilitation of allotments for different categories of investors. The overall initial public offering (IPO) handling process would be short cycled with the implementation of the E-IPO system.
E-Voting is another new project which is underway and has been planned to be implemented during this year. This system will address the problems faced by investors who are unable to attend and vote in more than one meeting held by listed companies on the same day.
All-in-all, I believe that we are well placed to provide a full range of post-trade services to meet the evolving needs of our stakeholders while maintaining a strong focus on operational efficiency. Our intention is to drive continued growth in the Sri Lankan capital market through the
provision of world-class custody and settlement services.

## Title: Guardian Acuity money market funds offer option to take advantage of current interest rates outlook
## Section: Financial News

Guardian Acuity money market funds offer option to take advantage of current interest rates outlook
	
The Guardian Acuity Money Market Fund, which is more than four years old, has returned 48.44 percent to its investors. This is an annualized return of 11.37 percent. The fund invests in government securities, fixed deposits and commercial papers and provides for easy withdrawals with no penalties for withdrawals.
The Money Market Gilt Fund, which was launched in March 2015, has returned 7.94 percent since inception for its investors and invests purely in government securities and related products. Both funds are tax-free funds for investors.
Guardian Acuity Asset Management is a joint venture between Acuity Partners Ltd and Ceylon Guardian Investment Trust PLC. Acuity Partners is a joint venture between Hatton National Bank and DFCC Bank. Ceylon Guardian Investment Trust is the fund manager of the Carson Cumberbatch group managing over Rs.35 billion in both public and private wealth.
Guardian Acuity Money Market Fund offers investors the opportunity to take advantage of the current high interest rates environment. Guardian Acuity Money Market Fund and Money Market Gilt Fund Fund Manager Sashika Wickramaratne said, The interest rates have elevated and will remain at prevailing levels if the government can attract foreign funds into the planned bond issues.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved US $ 1.5 billion under its Extended Funding Facility (EFF), which will provide temporary relief for the foreign debt repayments falling due in the next few months. As the IMF funds will come in tranches, the government will be compelled to go for a sovereign debt issue.
Currently the government has a plan to go for a sovereign debt issue for US $ 3.0 billion with four banks selected as lead managers. The issue should be successful given the global market conditions. In this case the government can safely meet the foreign debt repayment obligations due for the rest of 2016. Also, the pressure on rupee will ease off, given the expected dollar inflows and import tariff increases.
According to Wickramaratne, even though the government could meet the debt repayments with further foreign borrowings and manage the fiscal pressure with recent tax increases, there is a lower probability for rates to trend down if inflation picks up in next couple of months given the recent tax increases and rupee depreciation.
In this context we are of the view that interest rates will remain at these levels in the next 12 months and have realigned our portfolio by investing in money market instruments of longer tenure, thus locking in funds so that the fund yields remain attractive for current as well as new investors. The current yield of the Money Market Fund is 9.8 percent, while that of the Money Market Gilt Fund is 8.7 percent, said Wickramaratne
Guardian Acuity Asset Management Limited General Manager Mohandas Thangarajah reiterated the fact that this was the best time for investors to enter the Money Market Fund.
The fund is locked on longer term money market instruments such as treasury bills, fixed deposits, securitizations and commercial papers. Ordinary investors dont always have access to some of these instruments and the fund will provide them with access to markets that are not easily accessible but higher yielding.
He went on to say that with interest rates being elevated presently, clients can either lock in their liquid money in fixed deposits (FDs) or place them in savings accounts.
In the case of locking in FDs the client loses easy access to their cash and will have to incur penalties in case they wish to pull out. If they wish to take out only part of their money, they face both a penalty and will also be compelled to reinvest the balance at rates prevailing at the time. If that money was in a Money Market Fund, they will have easy access to it, whilst being able to withdraw part of their monies without having incur any penalties or take the risk of having to reinvest at low rates.
So it is ideal for money people keep for contingencies and security purposes.

He added that the document of the national policy on drug prevention would be handed over to the President at the ceremony.
When asked, the chairman said they were going to get information from the courts how the seized drugs were being destroyed so as to ensure the transparency of the process of destroying the seized drugs. (Ajith Siriwardana)

PM disputes borrowings doubled
	
With reference to the report that the Government had borrowed in excess of the limit approved by Parliament, Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that the Auditor General's observation contradicted against the reports of the Treasury and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
As a result, the Prime Minister said an explanation should be sought from the Auditor General in this regard, and the Public Finance Committee would do it.
The Auditor General, in his report submitted to the House said though Parliament endorsed Rs. 1,780 billion to be borrowed, Rs. 3,349 billion had been obtained.
Yet, Mr. Wickremesinghe said it could not be realistic as the interest rate should have risen much higher by this time, if such colossal borrowings had been made.
"I, as the Minister in charge of the Economic Affairs, looked into it," he said.
He noted that the reports submitted by the Treasury and the IMF were in contrast to observations made by the Auditor General.
"If a different auditing method were adopted, we should know whether it had been done with Parliamentary approval. The Treasury, and IMF give a different picture. We have to check it out. Otherwise, it is bad for the country," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Thajudeen murder: CID to get CCTV report in August
	
Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake today told court that the CCTV footage relating to the inquiry over the murder of Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen, has been sent to the British Columbia Laboratory- Canada for expert examination and the progress of the examination would be received by the CID by the first week of August.
Counsel Anil Silva who appeared for the suspect former SDIG Anura Senanayeke, said that according to the medical examination held by the specialist Dr Chula Herath on the suspect; the former SDIG had been diagnosed with the initial stages of cancer and has to be further examined under the supervision of his specialist doctor.
However, the report submitted by the specialist doctor had not mentioned any particular cancer symptoms of the suspect, and informed the court on hypertension, diabetes and kidney ailment of the suspect.
Considering the report submitted by Dr Chula Herath on the suspect, Colombo additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris directed the Prison Authority to send the suspect before a JMO to clarify his medical condition.
The prosecution held that the suspects were charged under sections 113, conspiracy', and 32, ' Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention, of the penal code and according to the provision in section 13 of the Bail Act, a person suspected or accused of being concerned in committing or having committed an offence punishable with death or with life imprisonment, shall not be released on bail except by a Judge of the High Court.
The Magistrate rejecting the bail application submitted by the counsel on behalf of the suspects, further remanded the suspects, former Crimes OIC Sumith Perera and Former SDIG until July 7.
The former SDIG and the former Crimes OIC were remanded on charges of causing disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, touching it to screen the offender and conspiring under clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code.
The CID filing a further report informed the court that the mobile details of the Wasim Thajudeen between March 01 and May 19, 2012, had been taken from the Dialog Company under the instructions of the former director of the Colombo Crimes Division, SSP Ranaweera, by the CCD after the incident in 2012.
The CID revealed that the court order to peruse mobile details was taken using some other case (B 6802/01/1) in Colombo Magistrates Court by the CCD.
The alleged details of the victim, Wasim Thajudeen were taken by the CCD to be sent to State Intelligence Service head, Major General, Kapila Hendrawithana to investigate on the incident happened on May 17, 2012, said CID.
The CID suspected that statement made by the police later over the incident as only a fatal accident, questions the credibility of the investigation that held on the accident of Wasim Thajudeen.
The CID also told the court that it had recorded statements from three policemen including the one who found the wallet of the victim on May 17, 2012 at a time between 6 a.m. to 6.30 a.m.
Over the inquiry conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council against Former JMO Ananda Samarasekara and two others on the allegation of missing body parts of the victim, the counsel appearing on behalf of the SLMC told the court that the suspect had filed objections to the council on June 4 over the allegations and the further inquiry would be taken up on July 23.

Ulterior motives behind arrest of Govt.s opponents: Wimal
	
Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) MP Wimal Weerawansa today charged that the government was imprisoning its opponents at a rate as it intended to hold a referendum to adopt its new Constitution which was aimed at dividing the country.
The government is planning to implement a new constitution by obtaining a two thirds majority at a referendum and is doing the utmost to prevent a free and fair referendum. Any shortfall for the special majority at the referendum would be met by the pro-government Sri Lankan expatriates, Tamil Diaspora and Sri Lankan Tamils in refugee camps in India as they would be allowed to visit Sri Lanka under special arrangements, he told a news conference.
The public would be debarred from knowing the right to information and the media would be suppressed until the proposed constitutional reforms are passed. Any individual who protests against it would end up in jail and this diabolical plan is already in progress, Mr. Weerawansa alleged.
Now we can imagine why the Local Government elections were postponed," he said.
Due to failures in meeting people's aspirations the government cannot go to villages and seek votes from the people and that is why the government is trying to postponed the Local Government election, he claimed. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
