Locomotive Engine Operators' Union ( LEOU ) Secretary Indika Dodangoda said today they had decided to launch a two-day strike action from midnight tomorrow if the scheduled talks with Transport Minister Arjuna Ranatunga tomorrow morning do not yield positive results.

He said they were seeking favourable solutions to their issues relating to salary anomalies, that was promised by President Maithripala Sirisena.

Train engineering operators, regulators, station masters, supervisors and officials of the Control and Rail Supervision Management Services will be joining the strike, if there was no favourable response to their demands, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
