Greeting the festive season with exciting calendar of events

Residence by Uga Escapes will herald the festive season at its popular restaurant and bar, Rare at Residence, through a line-up of exciting events.
The spirit of celebration is already in full flow at the hotel following the recent ceremonial lighting of its Christmas tree.

However, the festivities are poised to kick off in earnest with Mixologist Evenings, which will be held in partnership with JWT at Rare's bar, where world cocktail champion Australian Dula Lorenzo will concoct several festive beverages from December 21-23. Lorenzo clinched his world cocktail title after beating out several leading foreign mixologists in Sophia, Bulgaria. He has also claimed top honours at many other national and international competitions, a fact which bears testament to his deep knowledge and unique style.
The audience in attendance at Mixologist Evenings will also be serenaded by a three-piece band which will keep guests entertained throughout the event. Next up on Residence's event calendar is a 5-course Christmas Eve dinner which will feature diverse delicacies cooked up by a team headed by Group Executive Chef Holger Joost. There will also be a broad assortment of wines, cocktails and mocktails on offer.
Gourmands present at the dinner can look forward to a menu housing a wide selection of dishes such as homemade graved salmon, wild mushroom consommé, poached local lobster, seared Black Angus tenderloin and a Christmas pudding. Once again the band will be on hand to enliven the experience with a vibrant musical performance.Diners can then further indulge their taste buds the following day by tucking into a 5-course Christmas lunch bearing numerous seasonal staples like butter roasted turkey, risotto butternut squash, an eggnog shooter and orange & masala pudding which will be served from 12.30pm to 3.30pm. Sheranga and her band will add to the celebratory.
Bringing the curtain down on the festivities at Residence by Uga will be a 6-course NYE dinner embellished with chef Joost's finest creations, which will be accompanied by a variety of beverages.
Some of the items that will adorn this menu comprise a Black Angus beef tartar, a truffle blue cheese tart, a chocolate mille-feuille and a 'rare style' Eton mess.
This varying cuisine, expertly prepared with the freshest and finest ingredients, will present diners with a fitting end to yet another eventful year.
