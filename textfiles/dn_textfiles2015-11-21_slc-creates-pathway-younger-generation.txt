SLC creates pathway for younger generation

Sri Lanka Cricket has drawn up a carefully thought out international cricket calendar for our cricketers in the post Mahela-Sanga era so that by 2017 the national team with the exposure they will get should have reached maturity.
"We have drawn up the matches in such a manner that the national team gets every opportunity to mature into a strong unit by 2017. A lot of thought process was gone through keeping in mind that the team was going through a period of transition,"said Sri Lanka Cricket's Head of Cricket Operations Carlton Bernadus.
"The pathway for the younger generation of youth has been set on course consideration the retirements of senior cricketers envisaged," he said.
"With a view in mind of the T20 World Cup in India, the Sri Lanka Cricket management has provided the opportunity by arranging T20 against Pakistan and West Indies and moving forward New Zealand, India and Asia Cup as a prelude to the World T20 in India."
"In addition it has provided Test and ODI opportunities thus covering all three formats. This could be a springboard for the younger generation of cricketers stepping into the shoes of senior cadres keeping in mind the Champions Trophy in 2017 and the Cricket World Cup in 2019 both in England," Bernadus said.
The preparation for the ICC Champions trophy in England in 2017 also has a carefully thought out schedule.
Sri Lanka will play a series of five ODIs in New Zealand which will followed by a further five ODIs in England, five at home against Australia, a tri-series in India and then 3 ODIs in Zimbabwe and 5 ODIs in South Africa.
The Test schedule where Sri Lanka will be really tested will see the national side playing a total of 13 Tests within a period of 12 months " 2 v New Zealand, 3 v England, 3 v Australia, 2 v Zimbabwe and 3 v South Africa.
Following Sri Lanka's tour to New Zealand that will take place from December 3 to January 10, Sri Lanka Cricket has drawn up an intense program for the national, 'A'team, Development Squad and the Under 19 cricketers for the calendar year 2016.
Meanwhile the Sri Lanka under 19 cricketers will play a one-day triangular with England and India next month in preparation for the ICC under 19 World Cup in Bangladesh in January.
