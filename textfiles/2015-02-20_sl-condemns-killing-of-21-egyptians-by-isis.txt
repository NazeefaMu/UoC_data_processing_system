	The Sri Lankan government vehemently condemned the gruesome killing of twenty one Coptic Christian Egyptians by the terrorist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Libya last Sunday (15).

“The barbaric manner in which these killings were carried out has outraged the collective conscience of the world, and is a crime against humanity. Sri Lanka firmly believes that the international community should take concerted and decisive action to eradicate the growing menace of terrorism, which is a threat to human civilization, in all its forms and manifestations,” a statement issued by the foreign ministry said.
The Government and people of Sri Lanka convey their profound condolences to the Government and the people of Egypt, as well as to the bereaved families on this terrible national tragedy, it added.
