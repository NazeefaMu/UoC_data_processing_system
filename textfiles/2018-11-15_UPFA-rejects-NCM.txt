The United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) said yesterday it would not abide the Speaker’s ruling as the vote of No Confidence was taken up through an unlawful procedure.

UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane told the Daily Mirror the Government would continue despite the motion.

“We will carry out our work as usual,” he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
