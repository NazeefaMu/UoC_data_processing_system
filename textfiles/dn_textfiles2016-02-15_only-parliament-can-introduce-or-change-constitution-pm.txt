Only Parliament can introduce or change the Constitution - PM

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that Chief Justices cannot be allowed to introduce or change the Constitution as they wish, as, it is a duty of Parliament.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a ceremony organized to mark the 100th birthday anniversary of late President D.B.Wijethunga in Kandy yesterday.
He added that late President Wijethunga, who became the Executive President after the untimely death of President Ranasinghe Premadasa was an exemplary Executive President. The way he exercised his duties as Executive President is praiseworthy.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that after the 1994 election defeat, Wijethunga had to appoint a Prime Minister. Without violating the tradition or the opinion of the party, he appointed Chandrika Kumarathunga as the Prime Minister.
He said that the country's destiny took a different path in 2003, with a decision taken by the Supreme Court.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he was on a foreign tour as that time and does not know from where that decision came.
