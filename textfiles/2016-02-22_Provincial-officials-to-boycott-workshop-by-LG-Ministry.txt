At a meeting of Chief Ministers and Provincial Education Ministers it was decided that provincial officials could not be used like puppets by the government and as such a decision was taken not to allow them to participate in discussions and workshops arranged by the government without obtaining the consent of the Provincial Council concerned.

This was decided at a discussion that took place on Friday (19).

Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said the work of provincial councils would be disrupted as a result of provincial officials being called to attend discussions and workshops without obtaining prior consent of the provincial council.

Accordingly it was decided that the secretaries of provincial ministers and chief ministers and local government commissioners would not participate at the discussion to be held on February 26 in Negombo that has been convened by the Local Government Ministry.

The Chief Ministers also discussed matters related to the improper allocation of funds to provincial councils for the year through the Local Government Ministry as the matter had not been solved.

They also expressed their displeasure at attempts by the government to implement several projects that come under the purview of the provincial councils in accordance to the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. He assured those present that the chief ministers would meet President Maithripala Sirisena to get a solution to these issues facing the provincial councils. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
