When a Walmart cashier Ebony Harris saw a customer get turned away from the store’s nail salon, she took matters into her own hands. According to reports Harris has said that she watched the nail salon, located next door, refuse to do the woman’s nails because her hands shake quite a bit due to cerebral palsy. So, she in turn decided to make this customer’s day a special one.

The Mirror For Hope asked some well-known faces about things that make them happy, or why the media should focus on positive news happening around them : 

 

 


It’s great that the Daily Mirror has come forward with this new unique idea creating a platform for people to share ideas about positive stories that happen around them. At a time when people go behind various possessions not knowing from where to find true happiness, I think it’s timely for such details to be shared especially to discover from where one could discover inner happiness and peace.”

 “I am happy to see the growing movement of Sri Lankans who are committed to mindful living. This includes social entrepreneurs working to address social and environmental problems, responsible business leaders who choose to prioritize people and planet over short term profits, and the artists and storytellers who inspire us and help us envision a better world. It also includes the broader community of people making changes in their day to day lives: refusing plastic straws, plastic bottles and plastic bags, planting trees and home gardens, reducing waste and recycling, volunteering and contributing to causes they care about, asking where products came from, and supporting businesses that share their values. I am happy and proud that Sri Lanka is in the top 10 in the Global Giving Index.”
