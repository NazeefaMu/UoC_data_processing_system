Power disruption to continue


	

Less than one-hour power cuts would be inevitable until Wednesday, in several parts of the country due to the shutdown at the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant (LCPP) at Noraichcholai, the Power and Energy Ministry said.

Secretary to the Ministry Suren Batagoda said that the Lakvijaya Power Plant at Noraichcholai had automatically shut down yesterday due to the unexpected explosion of a major transformer yard at Biyagama.

However, he said since the Noraichcholai Power Plant was still not operational, it would take three more days for the repair work to complete. (Piyumi Fonseka)
