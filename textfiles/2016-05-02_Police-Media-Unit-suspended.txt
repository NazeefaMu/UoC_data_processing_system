Police Media Unit had been suspended with effect from today, the Ministry of Law and Order said.

A Spokesman for the Ministry told the Daily Mirror that the decision to suspend the Media Unit was made by IGP Pujith Jayasundara following an action by the officers of the Media Unit, which had given a verbal statement to media on the recent haul of arms in Chavakachcheri.

According to Ministry sources the Media Unit had defied the orders given by the IGP to issue only written statements on the Chavakachcheri incident.  (Yohan Perera)
