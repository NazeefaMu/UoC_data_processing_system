There is a certain politico from Wayamba who once closely moved with the former strongman. He took everyone by surprise when he suddenly threw in his lot with the yahapalanaya.

 

A former purohita at Cabinet level, he is now only a deputy due to his late entry. 


According to a story doing the rounds in political circles these days, this politico had a tryst with the former strongman triggering speculation that the man is set to do a pole-vault back to the JO camp.  
Asked why he wanted to meet his one-time boss again, he had told two close colleagues of his, “After all, he is not only our former big boss, but also a district leader for us now.”
