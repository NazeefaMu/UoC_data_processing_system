Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today the government was taking steps to reduce taxes and that the increase of VAT was to pay back the loans obtained by the Rajapaksa regime.

“The VAT was increased to pay back the loans obtained by the Rajapaksa regime. The loans cannot be used to pay back loans that had been obtained. They can be used only for the future development projects. We use these taxes to pay back the loans obtained by the previous regime,” he said.   

Minister Karunanayake said the short term target of the government was to stabilize the economy of the country before reducing the taxes.

“The economy we were given was full of loans and the statistics had been distorted. Our short term plan is to strengthen the economy before reducing taxes,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
