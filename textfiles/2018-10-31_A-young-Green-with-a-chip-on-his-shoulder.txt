A young Green Diyawanna member is said to be in a sulk these days for failing to get the electorate organizer post he had been asking for, for a long time.

 


This young Colombo District member had long been aspiring to be the Chief Organizer of an electorate North of the Metropolis, which had once been a stronghold of his father. However, the party leadership has reportedly turned a deaf ear to his persistent request.


Adding insult to injury, an organizer from another electorate had recently opened with much fanfare a road stretch he himself had developed utilizing his budgetary allocation.


The party leadership, according to him, had even ignored the complaint he made to them regarding this ‘injustice’. 


Now the Diyawanna member is said to be going around telling all and sundry, that he would have been a happier man if he had stuck to his profession, the practice of medicine.
