	Rejecting the allegations levelled against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son Yoshitha linking SriLankan Airlines, his brother MP Namal Rajapaksa said the allegations were mere attempts of tarnishing the image of the Rajapaksa family.
	Citing the findings of Attorney J.C. Weliamuna into the SriLankan Airlines, UNP Assistant General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam alleged Yoshitha had carried out a motor spare parts business through the Airline abusing his father’s influence.
	“There is no basis for these allegations and are mere attempts of tarnishing the image of our family,” MP Rajapaksa told Dailymirror.
