Kayts Divisional Judge M. Riyaz on Tuesday ordered to take into custody the Sub Inspector who released Swiss Kumar, the main suspect in the gang rape and murder of Vidya, the student from Jaffna.

The Judge made this order when the case against Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe, who had been under custody and enlarged on bail over the incident was taken up. The evidence surfaced at this hearing detailed that while six suspects including Swiss Kumar were been taken to Kayts Police Station, a sub inspector identified as Gajan had arrived and taken away Swiss Kumar and another to the Jaffna Police Station and released the two suspects and remanded the remaining four.

As this was stated in the Jaffna High Court, as an action taken on the orders of the DIG, the concerned DIG was taken into custody and later released on bail. With the DIG submitting to the courts that he had not issued any orders or instructions to release Swiss Kumar, and he has no connection whatsoever in this regard, the Judge ordered the immediate arrest of the SI and production in courts.

The suspect SI had gone missing ever since the case on the murder of Vidya was being heard. However, on been confirmed that the SI was connected to this incident, IGP Pujith Jayasundera who visited Jaffna in July took steps to interdict him from service.

When this case was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, the Kayts Magistrate postponed the hearings to February 28, 2018. (Romesh Madushanka)
