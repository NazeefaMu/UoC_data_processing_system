The best-in-class home loan offering ‘Siri Medura’ is now available for Bank of Ceylon (BOC) customers in the Sabaragamuwa Province with the opening of the bank’s eighth regional loan centre in Ratnapura.
The opening ceremony was held with the patronage of the bank’s Chairman President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera and General Manager D.M. Gunasekera recently. 
This best-in-class housing loan offering is aimed at providing superior customer experience while obtaining housing loans. Siri Medura is becoming the popular housing loan scheme among time strapped customers seeking financial assistance. The product has many unique features that provide convenience to customers to obtain hassle-free financial assistance such as only two visits to the bank to get the housing loan, loan disbursement within 15 days, SMS alerts at each stage of the loan processing. 
The bank also provides assistance to obtain the necessary local authority documents without the customer having to liaise with multiple agencies. All these features are provided while maintaining attractive interest rates and flexible repayment terms for loan facilities. BOC has made this product live in seven provinces across the island as part of project ‘Wenesa’ in collaboration with The Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
In addition to housing loans, the regional centres have reenergized commercial loans and loans for small and medium enterprises (SME). 
“Bank of Ceylon continuously strives for excellence, and adding value to our customers is our main focus in this journey. Launching best-in-class products such as Siri Medura is a step in the direction of adding value to our customers through superior customer experience,” stated Perera.
“We have launched Siri Medura in seven out of nine provinces. We want to make it islandwide very soon. Enhancing customer experience through best-in-class products such as Siri Medura is a major step towards retaining our position as the No 1 bank in Sri Lanka,” stated Gunasekara.
