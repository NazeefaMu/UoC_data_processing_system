The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has no intention to increase electricity tariff in the foreseeable future despite coal and fuel prices going up dramatically in the last few months in addition to sharp increase of operational cost of the CEB, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.

Responding to various media reports to the effect that the CEB was in a move to increase electricity bill, Minister Siyambalapitiya said the CEB was regularly interacting with the  Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on electricity tariff and related issues and consult it if and when tariff is reviewed.
