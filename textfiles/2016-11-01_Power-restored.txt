Power failures were experienced in several parts of the country this evening, including the Southern, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces. Power has now been restored in the areas, CEB Spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardana said.

He said the power had failed due to lightning striking the 132 power transmission line and tripping Laxapana complex.
