The recent statement by President Maithripala Sirisena on the manner in which the FCID, CID and the Bribery Commission function indicates that the country was not governed by the democratically elected President but by someone else, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said.

PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said the President was not only the head of the State but also head of the government and the Cabinet.

“People’s mandate was given to the President so he could rule the country. But the President says he is not aware of what is happening in the government unless he reads the newspapers. This means the country is governed by someone else and that is why we say the current government is a puppet of the US and India,” he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
