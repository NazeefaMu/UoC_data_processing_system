Marking a decade of supporting the nation’s senior citizens, Sampath Sanhinda Saver is awarding Rs.120 million in medical benefits to accountholders, the highest value of benefits being offered in a single year by the Bank under this account.

Right from its inception, Sampath Bank has continued to be intently awareof the evolving needs of businesses and consumers around the island and strived to offer financial solutions that are aligned to them.Hence, going beyond offering higher interest rates to senior citizens, twice a month, the Bank seeks to assist them with the growing medical expenses that they tend to face through the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account and the medical rewards in particular.

Credited directly to theirSanhinda Medical Benefit cards, accountholders can use these funds to make payments for all services at Rajya Osusala (State Pharmaceuticals Corporation), Asiri Group of Hospitals, Durdans Hospital, Hemas Hospitals, Nawaloka Hospitals, Lanka Hospitals, Nawinna Medicare Hospital, Northern Central Hospital, CDEM Hospital, Singhe Hospital, Matara Co- Operative Hospital,Pannipitiya Private Hospital,Metropolis Laboratories, Harcourts Pharmaciesand Vision Care Opticians.

Furthermore, accountholders can avail special discounts at select partner hospitals on their Sanhida debit cards.

“Drawing inspiration from Sri Lankan society’s regards for elders and our tradition of caring for them, we dedicated the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account to the nation’s senior citizens in 2009. And it has been our privilege to continue to serve them through it,” said Ms. Nadi B. Dharmasiri, Head of Marketing, Sampath Bank PLC. “Staying true to its motto of “thepromise of a better tomorrow”, every element of this account has been purposefully designed to meet the unique needs of customers over the age of 55 and we have been adding more features and benefits to it over the years to suit their evolving lifestyles. Thanking them for placing their trust in us, we are delighted to reward our Sanhinda Saver accountholders with close to Rs.120 million in medical benefits this year.”

The Sampath Sanhinda Saver account is yet another means by which Sampath Bank seeks to offer greater value and convenience to its customers through the golden years of their lives. The medical benefits, being offered based on the annual average account balance for 10 consecutive years now, are just one of the many privileges accorded to accountholders.Accountholders also receive a higher rate of interestfor their foreign currency (USD) Sanhinda Saver savings accounts.Thus, the Bank continues to go beyond its call of duty to stand by its customers in every step of their lives, through its path breaking services and outreach efforts.
