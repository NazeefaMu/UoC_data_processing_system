The water levels of the rivers, including the Kalu Ganga, had not receded due to the continuing showery weather, the Disaster Management Centre said today.

The DMC yesterday advised people downstream in Kalutara and the Ratnapura Districts to evacuate to safer locations, as the water level in Kalu Ganga was rising.

DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili told the Daily Mirror that prevailing rains in the South-Western parts of the country were expected to continue

“Four spill gates of Thabbowa Reservoir in Puttalam had been opened as a result of the continual rains,” he said.

“More than 124, 000 individuals had been affected,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department said showers or thunderstorms would continue to occur at times in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and the North-Western Provinces.

“Showers or thunderstorms will occur elsewhere, particularly after 2.00 p.m. Heavy falls, about 100-150 mm can be expected at some places in Sabaragamuwa, Western, Central and Northwestern Provinces and in the Galle, Matara Districts,” the Department said.

It also said that windy and rainy conditions would be intensified in the Western and Southern sea areas from today.

“The sea area extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Puttalam, Colombo, Galle and Hambantota can be rough or very rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 km/h at times. Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be vigilant in this regards,” it said.

Meanwhile, the Police confirmed that the number of deaths reported due to prevailing adverse weather conditions had increased to 13, while one had gone missing. (KJ)
