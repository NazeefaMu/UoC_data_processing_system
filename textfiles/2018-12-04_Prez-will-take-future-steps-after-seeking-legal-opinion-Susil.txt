President Maithripala Sirisena would take future steps after seeking necessary legal opinion since the Cabinet has been suspended, UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said yesterday.

Addressing a news briefing, he said the Court of Appeal’s stay order issued restraining the Prime Minister and the Cabinet from functioning had no impact on the President.

“The order has no impact on the Executive President or his functions. Accordingly, he will seek necessary legal opinion and take future steps,” he said.

When asked about the remarks made by UNP MP Rajitha Senaratne that a new government led by a UNP Prime Minister would be appointed, MP Premajayantha said it won’t happen. “He can say whatever he wants but they won’t come true,” he said.

Meanwhile, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said as far as they know, no order has been given in the history of Sri Lanka or the world like the one which was given by the Court of Appeal yesterday. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
