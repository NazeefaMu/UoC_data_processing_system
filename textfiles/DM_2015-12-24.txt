25 killed, over 100 injured in Saudi hospital fire
	
An overnight fire at a hospital in southern Saudi Arabia had killed at least 25 people and injured more than 100 others, the BBC reported a short while ago.
The blaze had broken out in the intensive care and maternity departments of the Jazan General Hospital, the Civil Defence Agency tweeted.
The fire is now over and those injured have been transferred to other hospitals in the area, it added.
An investigation is under way to find out the cause of the blaze. Some 21 civil defence teams helped extinguish the fire, according to the agency.
Photographs published in Saudi daily Okaz showed rooms inside the hospital charred deep black, debris hanging from the ceiling.
Jazan is near the border with Yemen, which has seen months of fighting between Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed forces.

HIV positive cases on the rise
	
The National STD/HIV Control Programme today said the number of HIV positive cases were on the rise with 2,241 HIV such patients and 21 AIDS related deaths reported in the country as at October this year.
Health Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala today warned that Chronic Kidney Diseases and HIV infections could become one of the biggest national health problems in the country before long if action is not taken to curb them.
Addressing the monthly progress review meeting of health institutions in the Hambantota District, Dr. Mahipala said 12,000 people were referred for HIV tests and 45 kidney patients were found this year alone from Hambantota.
He told the heads of healthcare institutions of the Hambantota District that Anugunakolapelessa had been identified a risk area for kidney diseases with 45 new cases detected this year.
"With proportionately a higher number of people turning up at the Hambantota District Hospital for HIV tests, we have also found that there has been a sharp rise in cases of Asthma and pneumonia in Hambantota. The Health Ministry will conduct a health survey to find the factors that have contributed to increase cases of HIV, CKD, Pneumonia and Asthma and determine whether there was any connection to fertilizer, pesticide or weedicide used by people in Hambantota as the majority are farmers. Special attention will be paid on the quality of drinking water in the district," Dr. Mahipala stressed.
He said the Health Ministry would provide all necessary human and material resources to Hambantota to keep non communicable diseases like kidney ailments and communicable diseases like HIV, Pneumonia and Asthma at bay in addition to disease control and prevention programmes that are in place.
The Hambantota, Tangalle and Walasmulla Hospitals will be expanded with more facilities and infrastructure to face these challenges. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Is Hirunika following her father's footsteps"
	
	Nava Sama Samaja Party Leader Vickramabahu Karunaratne yesterday raised doubts whether MP Hirunika Premachandra followed the footsteps of her father who he identified as a hoodlum in Kolonnawa, as she attempted to resolve disputes among mobs.
	He mentioned that late Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra was a reputed hoodlum who settled disputes among people in Kolonnawa.
	It looks like the daughter has taken up the same task of solving peoples issues, he said.
	Commenting on the recent incident where a man was allegedly abducted by six supporters of Ms. Premachandra, he said no one could take the law into their own hands.
	Prof. Karunaratne, a key activist of President Maithripala Sirisenas election campaign, pointed out that it was solely the police who had the authority to take action against illegal activities. We wonder if this government is too practicing the previous governments habit of abducting people. We have a police department to deal with crimes, and today the department is more independent than what it was in the past, he told a news conference.

PCB finally rules out Indo-Pak series in SL
	
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Shaharyar Khan has told the media in Lahore today that he had finally given up hope of organising the bilateral series against India in either UAE or Sri Lanka in December-January.
"It is impossible to hold the series now as valuable time has gone. But we will now wait and see when the Indian Board tells us they have got clearance from their government to play with us," Khan said.
"If the clearance comes from the Indians, then we can look at finding a window to play a bilateral series sometime in 2016," the PCB chief said.
According to PTI, Khan has said that the PCB believed that it was important for Pakistan and India to resume bilateral ties. "If not this year, we can do something in 2016 but it will all depend on the Indian board telling us when they are ready to play," he said.
He said whenever the Indian Board got the clearance from its government and a series was planned, it would be Pakistan's home series as per the MoU signed between the two countries.
The PCB chief has faced a lot of flak for his insistence that the series with India would be held in December-January.

Polythene use banned from Jan. 1
	
	The law on use of plastics and polythene bags less than 20 microns of gauge would be strictly implemented from January 1, on a Presidential directive, Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Director Anura Jayathilaka.
	He said, this during an inspection of several shops and shopping malls in Colombo.
	He said, laws would be enforced strictly from January 1 to minimise the use of polythene, which was a major threat to the environment and the health of the people.
	According to the Gazettee notification No. 1466/5 issued under section 23W of the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, the use of polythene less than 20 microns in thickness will be banned. Violators will be charged in courts and fined Rs. 10,000 as a penalty or face two years imprisonment or both, he said.
	The legislation was brought in to combat the indiscriminate use of shopping bags and food wrappers in shopping malls and the home environment, resulting in its haphazard disposal polluting the environment.
	Instead it was recommended that people use environmentally friendly paper bags, and jute bags for shopping purposes.
	However, the law to all intents and purposes was only on paper and died a natural death, Anura Jayathilaka said.
	The regulation was also Gazetted under the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) Act No 09 of 2003 by Gazette numbered 1588/18 and dated February 11, 2009, he said.
	According to the Act, the name and address of the manufacturer, date of manufacture, generic name of the product and Number of Environmental Protection License and other manufacturing details should be labeled on the packet or bundle of polythene food wrappers and garbage bag since August 15, 2009.
	We request shop and shopping mall owners to obey the rules and help to protect the environment by minimising the use of polyethene, he said.
	The inspection would be conducted in the Colombo City area and the Greater Colombo area as well.
	The inspection was conducted yesterday under the supervision of CMC Chief Medical officer, Ministry of Health, and Central Environmental Authority (CEA) and with the support of the environmental Police. (Chaturaga Pradeep)

Rs.30mn fraud in Enrique concert
	
The Treasury Department of the Colombo Municipal Council has filed a case yesterday against the organiser of the live concert by Latin music idol Enrique Iglesias held last Sunday at the CR&FC Grounds -- for failing to pay nearly Rs. 30 million in taxes.
Entertainment tax amounting to Rs. 29,125,845 has allegedly been unpaid by the organiser of the event.
Rs. 88,200,000 had been paid to Iglesias as his fee.
The organiser had paid Rs.6.4 million to the CMC as tax on the income from the sale of tickets.
All the tickets had to be approved and sealed by the CMC. But only a few tickets had been given to the CMC for approval and sealing.
On investigation, it had been found out that the organisers had sold tickets that had not been taken from the sealed packets -- and that the real income from the concert was higher than the amount given in the accounts submitted to the CMC.
Tickets had been priced at Rs. 5000, 10,000, 25,000 and 35,000. Ten thousand tickets had been sold. (Jayantha Samarakoon)

Importers welcome tax reversion on electric cars
	
	The Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka (VIAL) today welcomed President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to withdraw the 2016-budget proposal to increase the import tax on electric vehicles by 50 percent.
	Thus the import tax on electric vehicles would remain at five percent.
	During a cabinet meeting on Wednesday (23), the president had rejected the tax increase.
	VIAL president Indika Sampath Merenchige said the decision to withdraw the proposal was advantageous to the vehicle import industry.
	He said, however, that the prices of electric cars would increase slightly because of the revised valuation system. Therefore an electric car would cost at least Rs. 2.8 million, he said.
	Co-Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said the government had decided not increase in the import tax on electric cars because of numerous requests by various persons.
	As a responsible government which considers people's opinions, we decided to withdraw the proposal, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Water board workers threaten TU action
	
	The Water Supply Joint Trade Union Alliance today threatened to launch a trade union action from December 26 to 28 for not paying their annual bonus payment.
	We demand the government and the authority to pay the balance of our bonus payment immediately, the alliance said.
	Alliance leader Upali Ratnayaka alleged the annual bonus had been paid continuously for forty years but this year it had been deducted arbitrarily by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
	This has been approved by the Cabinet on the recommendation of the management of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, he said.
	He charged that their bonus of Rs. 37,000 had been arbitrarily reduced to Rs.25, 000 and that too had been remitted to the employees accounts only on Wednesday night. No one was informed about this. We will have to wait till next Monday to collect the amount because of the long holiday, he said.
	Mr. Ratnayaka said essential services such as water purification would not be interrupted during the trade union action, to avoid difficulties to the consumers.
	However, all other emergency services and breakdown services will come to a standstill, he said.
	Meanwhile, he said an island wide three-hour protest would be launched by the Alliance on December 28 from 9.00 am to 12.00 noon.
	Mr. Rathnayaka said, if the authorities didnt pay the deducted bonus payment even after the three-day trade union action, they would launch another island wide strike.
	In such a situation, the government and the President should take the responsibility for the inconvenience caused to the consumers , he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

We could have saved Rizana: Ranjan
	
	Rizana Nafeek, the young housemaid who was executed in Saudi Arabia could have been saved if the current government was in power in 2013, Deputy Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
	He said the appropriate measures taken by Yahapalana government had saved the life of the Sri Lankan woman who was to be stoned to death in Saudi.
	If the country had the current government back then, or the former UPFA government had adopted the proper legal measures, we could have saved Rizana back then. The former government didnt ask for support from powerful countries or take suitable legal measures in the previous case, he said at a media briefing.
	On account of the appeal made by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Foreign Employment Ministry, the Saudi Arabian Al Dawadmi Court had commuted the sentence of the Lankan woman who was to be stoned to death, he said.
	He described the present case as a sensitive issue and said the current government had dealt with it in the proper manner.(Yoshitha Perera)
