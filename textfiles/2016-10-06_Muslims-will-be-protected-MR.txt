Former President and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, who initiated engagements with leaders of the Muslim community after the defeat at the Presidential Election last year, said Muslims would be protected and given all their rights.

Addressing a gathering of Muslims at his office in Battaramulla recently, he said the bulk of Muslims voted against him at the last election and it was one of the main reasons for his defeat .

“I have never been a communalist nor can I be one in the future. My association with Muslims runs right upto our family artery-ancestry. My father and forefathers largely helped Muslims to be settled down in various places in the Hambantota district and provided them with all facilities to build up a robust life,” he said.

He said during the last Presidential election campaign the vicious propaganda was unleashed by his opponents political power, and Muslims were unfortunately believed them.

“It was a well-orchestrated foreign conspiracy. Those elements who unleashed mayhem in Aluthgama are now happily enjoying Ministerial positions in the present government.

He said he was abroad, and on arrival at the airport he went straight to the areas, and took speedy action to rebuild the houses and business premises, and restore normal life. The Western conspirators never rested; they carried on various attacks on.

Former Minister AHM Azwer Muslims had begun to rally round Mahinda Rajapaksa.

“There is a massive cry from Muslim quarters demanding him to form a new government. When Bandaranaike broke away from UNP it was Dr. Badiud-din Mahmud, who realizing the plight of his people in the future, with foresight and wisdom, joined hands with him and helped him to bring to power the SLFP – led by the pancha balawegaya. Leaders like CAS Marikar, Seyed Alavi Mowlana, Haleem Ishak, IA Cader, AL Abdul Majeed, Senator ARM Hameem, MC Ahamed, Galagedera Abdul Jabbar, Faleel Hajiar, Nowfel Hajiar and a host of others rallied round under Badiud-din’s leadership and brought about a great political change. The immense services of Dr. Badi rendered for the Muslim community is still spoken in all quarters," he said.
