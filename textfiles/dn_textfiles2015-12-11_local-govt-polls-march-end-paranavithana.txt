Local Govt polls by March end - Paranavithana

The government aims to hold the Local Government elections by March end as scheduled, Provincial Councils and Local Government Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said.
However, he said, a large number of complaints had been received to the five member Committee to look into the grievances of delimitation, adding that those must be looked in prior to the elections.
He was responding to a question by a journalist at the Cabinet press briefing at the Parliamentary complex yesterday.
The deputy minister said Minister Faizer Musthapha would analyse the report of the Committee and make a decision pertaining to the matter.
Paranavithana added the government was doing its best not to delay the Local Government Elections. Meanwhile, responding to a question on the clearing of reserved forest land near Wilpattu national park, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne opined the resettlement in this area was not a matter that must be opposed.
"Minister Rishad Bathiudeen earned stiff opposition to this activity because he was a Muslim. However, these people who were chased away by the LTTE had been residing in Puttalam for a long time and now they are returning to their original lands," he said.
"There is a similar problem in Kolonnawa. About 30,000 families have settled in the marshy lands in Kolonnawa which is a reserved area. The Cabinet yesterday discussed how these families could be relocated under the Megapolis project of the government," the minister said.
"While releasing land for human settlements, the government is also taking measures to increase the forest cover," he concluded.
