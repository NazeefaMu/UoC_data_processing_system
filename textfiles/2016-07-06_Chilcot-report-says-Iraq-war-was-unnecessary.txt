Chilcot report says Iraq war was 'unnecessary'


	

The UK went to war in Iraq even before all peaceful options for disarming Saddam Hussein were exhausted, the long-awaited official report has concluded.

According to the BBC, Sir John Chilcot’s report has said the invasion was not the "last resort".

The 2003 invasion was based on "flawed intelligence and assessments" that "were not challenged", it argues.

Tony Blair underestimated the impact it would have on Iraq and the wider region despite "explicit warnings", it adds.

The former Labour prime minister is expected to face fresh calls to apologise from political opponents of the war and the families of the 179 British service personnel and civilians killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009.

The report, which has taken seven years to complete, has been published on the Iraq Inquiry website.
