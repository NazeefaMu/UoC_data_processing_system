The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) would work together with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to prevent private medical school graduates registering as doctors, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.

He said that his party had decided to work together with the GMOA in fighting against South Asian Institute of Technology and Management (SAITM), when they met the medical officers’ association leaders this morning.

“We have made a decision to work together, while we will continue a dialogue to see how we could work together and counter the negative effects of the Supreme Court Ruling, which said SAITM students should be allowed to register themselves with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) so that they can practice,” Mr. Dissanayake said.
