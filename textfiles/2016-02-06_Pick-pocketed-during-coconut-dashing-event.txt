Several politicians including MP Dinesh Gunawardane, who took part in the joint opposition’s coconut-dashing event against the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), at the Seenigama Devalaya this morning, reportedly had their pockets picked during the event.

Later the organizers used the public address system (Loud Speakers) appealing that the stolen wallets be returned. Later the MP’s wallet was found near the temple only with some Identity cards but sans any cash.
However, after the news spread, MP Gunawardane in his tweet account claimed that the story was a rumour.
 “LoL news not true! But not surprised of rumours at a time when the present regime has pick-pocketed an entire nation!”, he tweeted.
