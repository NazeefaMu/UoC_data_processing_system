The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the Government and the other provincial councils should also respond to the resolution adopted by the Northern Provincial Council just as was done by the Western Provincial Council which passed a resolution opposing the NPC resolution.

JHU leader Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera asked why other provincial councils could not oppose the resolution adopted in the Northern Provincial Council and asked whether they were acting to please western forces and Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran.

“We must appreciate the move taken by the WPC members and the Chief Minster for reacting to the NPC resolution. We request members of other provincial councils and Chief Ministers to show their protest on separatist moves by the NPC,” he said.

The Thera asked the government to immediately react to the resolution adopted by theNPC and added that silence might suggest the tacit approval of the resolution.

Ven. Sobitha Thera said it was not the Tamil people who nurtured separatist ideologies but it was the power hungry Tamil politicians who were trying to promote separatism and that it was not being done for the benefit of the Tamil people.(Ajith Siriwardana)
