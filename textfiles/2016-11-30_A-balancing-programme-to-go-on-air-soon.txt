A ‘balancing’ programme to go on air soon


	



 

The country’s ‘palace’ has received a plethora of complaints from a cross-section of the society saying that a certain state-owned media institution is airing programmes calculated to denigrate certain deities being worshipped by a large of number believers in the country. 

 


Comments considered derogatory of the Kataragama deity made by a group of academics featured in a recently aired programme  in particular had come in for flak from political heavyweights as well as some intellectuals and scholars in the country. 


On being asked as to why programmes insulting and ridiculing some popular deities were being aired, the head of the media institution concerned had said apologetically that he had already instructed the producers to televise a ‘balancing’ program me as well. “A programme with kapuralas from the Kataragama Devalaya as resource personnel will be aired,” he had promised. That programme was aired last week.
