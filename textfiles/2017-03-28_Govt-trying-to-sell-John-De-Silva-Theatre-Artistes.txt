Govt. trying to sell John De Silva Theatre: Artistes


	

The Society for Socialist Art said today the Government was planning to privatize John De Silva Memorial Theatre claiming that it did not have the Rs.1000 million needed for the renovation of the theatre.

Veteran actress Deepani Silva told a news conference that President Maithripala Sirisena promised them soon after he was elected President that he would take steps to expedite the renovations of the theatre but that now the government was planning to sell it to the private sector.

She said John De Silva Memorial Theatre was the only theatre which was available for the dramatists, who were not financially well off, to perform their arts at a reasonable price.

“This theatre should be taken over by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. We as artists urge the government to protect the John De Silva Memorial Theatre,” she said.

Dramatist Premaratne Tennakoon said John De Silva Memorial Theatre was demolished during the previous regime without consulting the artists and those who were in the field and when we protested, the first phase was completed at a cost of Rs.322 million.

“When we demanded that it should be re-built, the first stage was completed but the government is claiming it does not have required funds to carry out the second stage. When the cabinet paper was presented to the cabinet, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management has recommended that the theatre be sold to the private sector to develop it saying that the Finance Ministry is unable to provide Rs.1000 million,” he said.

Mr. Tennakoon said the Nelum Pokuna Theatre was built without consulting those in the field and added that dramatists were unable to go there even to watch a drama today.

“The Elphinstone Theatre has been closed down for four years now. The Lumbini Theatre also does not have required facilities. We request the President, the Prime Minister and Cultural Affairs Minister to look into this matter,” he said.

Several artists including Wasantha Wittachchi, Chandrasoma Binduhewa, Lalith Rajapaksa, Upul Mayadunne and Kosala Silva addressed the news conference. (Ajith Siriwardana)
