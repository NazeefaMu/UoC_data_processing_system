This former Diyawanna member had to spend most of his time at  Police divisions, the Bribery and Corruption Commission, law courts and remand jail  ever since the defeat of his mentor, the former strongman at the January 8 poll. In fact, for the past few months he received much more media publicity, though negative, than he did during his entire political career. 
However, according to reports, his winter of despair has more or less ended and the spring of hope and cheer is fast approaching him.  According to a political observer, “the politico is making a slow but a steady comeback to the scene.”
Lady Luck has been smiling on him again, ever since he threatened to expose the misdeeds of his former mentor, they say. 
Meanwhile, this one time high flyer is said to have teamed up with a businessman sibling of a family that acquired royal status in the recent past. 
The duo are now planning to purchase helicopters to enter the tourism industry in a big way, they say.
