The Maldivian Police have enough evidence to detain the 27-year-old Sri Lankan arrested on charges of conspiring to assassinate President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, the Maldives Legal Affairs Minister Azima Shakoor told a media conference in Colombo today.
“The investigations are continuing. We have suffecient evidence with regard to his involvement in the assassination attempt and therefore he will be detained in the Maldives,” she said.
The Maldivian Police had earlier said in a statement that the Sri Lankan who was arrested on charges of conspiring to assassinate President Abdulla Yameen with firearms was hired by some Maldivians to carry out the operation. (Piyumi Fonseka)
