He refuses to be a nonentity!


	



 

The madam occupying the city chair and the big swarthy one still trying to fly high despite his wings being clipped are said to be embroiled a big row, they say.

 


The madam has incurred the wrath of the big swarthy one for distributing development allocations among her favorite members without consulting him or other party’s Diyawanna members representing the city constituencies.  


He had charged that the madam had reduced him and the other Diyawanna members from the city to nonentities by bypassing them in the matter of distributing development allocations. 


He had also complained that the madam had consistently disregarded requests made to her to convene a meeting of stakeholders to iron out the issue.


All indications are that this row will take a turn for the worse soon. However, the party leader has so far turned a blind eye to this situation, they say.
