Remanding of JO MP unacceptable: Speaker


	

The remanding of joint opposition MP Sarath Nishantha is unacceptable and unreasonable, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament today.

He said this when joint opposition MPs raised the matter in the House this morning.

JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said nothing has been done about this even though his party had raised this matter thrice. “We are highlighting this matter pertaining to Mr. Nishantha because it affects all members of Parliament."

The MP was arrested on a complaint made by the government with regard to the construction of a a Daham Pasala building in a temple.

The Speaker said he discussed this matter with the Justice Minister and the Attorney General and assured he would look into it again.

"I contacted Mr. Nishantha and inquired about his health. I informed the Justice Minister and she also said this was unreasonable. This incident has happened about four or five years ago. I do not accept this procedure. It is unreasonable," he said.

Mr. Gunawardene said the remanded MP had not been granted bail yesterday because the judge was absent.

MP Bandula Gunawardene said this government had gone down history for jailing the most number of members of Parliament.

MP Wimal Weerawansa said Mr. Nishantha has been held for violating bail conditions and the Court should finish up the matter in a reasonable manner, without keeping him in remand.

MP Lakshman Kiriella said Parliament could not influence the Judiciary to act in any particular way. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
