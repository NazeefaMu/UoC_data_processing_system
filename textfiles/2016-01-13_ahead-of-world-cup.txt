SLC sack U19 manager ahead of World Cup


	

In an unprecedented move, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) yesterday sacked Under 19 team manager Shane Fernando just three days ahead of the team’s schedule departure to the U19 World Cup in Bangladesh.
The Youth World Cup will be held from February 27 to March 14 in India with the participation of 16 teams, including seven associate teams.
Fernando has been replaced with chief junior selector Ranjith Madurusinghe who will act as the selector cum manager during the all important tour.
Fernando, a former SSC cricketer, was appointed as manager of the U19 team till the World Cup in Bangladesh in January 1, 2015 but the new cricket administrators have felt he was not good enough to hold the position during the World Cup.
“Since we have Madurasinghe touring with the team, the Executive Committee decided to give him the manager’s responsibility as well,” said Mohan de Silva, Secretary of SLC
However Daily Mirror reliably learns that the Ex-Co decided to remove Fernando as he had openly supported the Ranatunga camp during the recent Sri Lanka Cricket election.
Fernando was a close associate of the Ranatungas having played under Arjuna for SSC and also had a brief stint as Media Manager when Arjuna led the SLC as interim head in 2008.
However, Fernando will join the team as assistant manager, in charge of team’s logistics.
Meanwhile, SLC is likely to remove Vanessa De Silva as manager of the national women’s team for the forthcoming India tour. Vanessa is the Manager Women’s Cricket, overlooking all affairs of women’s cricket at SLC, and the new cricket administrators believe a paid employee should not be appointed to any other paid position within the system. Her name was recommended by the interim committee whose term ended on January 3.
“There are number of changes we have mooted in every sphere at Sri Lanka Cricket. It’s too early to comment on this matter since there’s time for the tour,” de Silva added.(Champika Fernando)
