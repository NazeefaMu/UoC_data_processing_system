DAILY MAIL, 2 August, 2017 - The US Air Force has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile just days after North Korea tested its latest rocket which could potentially hit NYC.   An unarmed Minuteman III missile was fired from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base at 2.10am local time on Wednesday.   


Military chiefs said the launch had been ‘long-planned’ and was not directly in response to North Korea’s rapidly accelerating nuclear programme.
