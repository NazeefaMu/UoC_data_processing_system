State-owned Qatar Petroleum announced Tuesday it has signed a deal with Abu Dhabi to operate a shared offshore oil field, despite a bitter diplomatic rift between the Gulf neighbours.   


The United Arab Emirates confirmed the contract had been renewed with the Japanese operators of the Al-Bunduq field but said it had not had any contact or dealings with Qatar on the issue. 

 
 “We are delighted to sign this concession agreement, which will ensure the continued development and operation of the Al-Bunduq oil field for many years to come,” Qatar Petroleum president and chief executive Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said in a statement.   


The company added, pointedly, that the deal showed it was a “trustworthy” energy provider “at all times and under all conditions”.   


The small oil field, located on the maritime border between Qatar and Abu Dhabi, is managed by a Japanese oil consortium.
