UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera today assured that no politician had been given the bond commission report before it was submitted in Parliament.

"Even we as government members did not receive it beforehand," he said.

The minister said the President and the government were ready to publish all the reports and added that they would not allow anyone to suppress or hide anything connected to the report.

He said revealing certain annexes would be disadvantageous when filing cases against those held responsible by the commission and added that however, no information would be hidden from the people.

The minister said the President and the SLFP were of the opinion that everyone responsible in the bond scam should be brought to book. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
