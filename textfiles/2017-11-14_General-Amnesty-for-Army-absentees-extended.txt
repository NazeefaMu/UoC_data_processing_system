During this period a total of 8052 Army deserters including 10 officers, 8 Officer Cadets and 8034 other rankers have reached respective Regimental Centers expecting legal discharge.

The decision to extend an Amnesty period was proposed by the Commander of the Army after considering their previous service to the country while in service.

Upon expiry of the final day of the extended Amnesty (November 22), law enforcing authorities have been advised to launch island-wide operation to nab the reminder of those AWOL.

Sri Lanka Army, therefore appeals to all religious leaders, GramaNiladharis and relatives to educate and encourage the absentees if known to make use of this opportunity and receive the discharge.
