Asgiriya Chapter Lekakadikari the Ven. Madagama Shri Dammananda Thera said on Thursday the decision taken by the Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters that there was no need for a new constitution or for any amendments was with the full 'approval' and 'knowledge' of the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters.

He said the Maha Sangha of the three chapters would carry out a public awareness and resistance campaign if the Government continued with the proposed Constitution without paying heed to the decision taken by the Karaka Sangha Sabha.

"If the government refuses to change its stance, we will take a final decision with the permission of the Mahanayakes of the Mawatta and Asgiriya Chapters," the Thera said and added that the opposition by the Maha Sangha was not against the government but against the proposed new constitution.

“We have no trust in the new constitution nor trust those who are formulating it," he said and added that the Maha Sangha of the three Chapters would be organise a massive countrywide protest against the constitution.

The Thera said the Sangha Sabha had decided to discuss the matter with the President and the Prime Minister. (J.A.L Jayasinghe)
