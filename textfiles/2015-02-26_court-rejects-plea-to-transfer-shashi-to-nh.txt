Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today rejected a request made by Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe to transfer Ms. Shashi Weerawansa to the National Hospital in Colombo for treatment from the prison hospital.
Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya while rejecting the request made by the counsel said that the Registrar of Persons Department had been ordered to inform court tomorrow the criteria followed by them in issuing the National Identity card to Ms. Weerawansa.
The Magistrate said he would thereafter consider whether Ms. Weerawansa should be sent to the National Hospital or kept in the remand prison. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
