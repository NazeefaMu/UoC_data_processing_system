Military Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne today rejected the war crime charges levelled against former General Jagath Jayasuriya who served as the Ambassador to Brazil.

Responding to a journalist at the Cabinet news briefing, the Brigadier said baseless allegations had been made against military personnel since the end of the war in 2009.

“The recent lawsuit filed against the former General validates that the LTTE ideology still prevails though it was defeated on the soil,” he said.

Meanwhile, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said they would continue to take legal action against specific allegations levelled against military personnel based on the evidence.

“However, not all killings and everything happened during the war are violations of human rights,” he said.
