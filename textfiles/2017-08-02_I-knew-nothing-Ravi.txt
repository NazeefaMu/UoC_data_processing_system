Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who appeared before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond Issuance, said he did not know that the penthouse he and his family were residing in for nine months was paid for by the Perpetual Treasuries (PT) Pvt. Limited owned by Arjun Aloysius.

At the cross examination of the Judges at the Commission today, the Minister said he only came to know of the payments when the issue was raised in Parliament.

He said that Aloysius had paid cash through his company as the owner of the residence did not want to lease out the penthouse to a politician.

The Minister said he didn’t play any role in the transaction and that his wife and the daughter were the ones who found the house.

"I knew nothing," he said.

When asked whether he knew Perpetual Treasuries was paying for the penthouse, he said he wouldn’t have settled in the house had he known due to the ‘conflict of interest’.
