Govt. open for suggestions on Mattala Airport: Eran


	

Days after signing the framework agreement for restructuring the Hambantota Port, the government remains open for suggestions for the development of the Mattala International Airport, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said yesterday.

He emphasised the fact that the airport was a white elephant but however the government hoped to consider business propositions rather than developing it as an international airport.

“We are still in the search mode. We have no concrete partners yet,” the deputy minister said. (Kelum Bandara)
