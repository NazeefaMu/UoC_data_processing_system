AIA Insurance collaborated with the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka in successfully completing the Diploma in Personal Management for Wealth Planners and Wealth Planners’ Managers.


This was the first time such a programme for insurance agents was carried out in a local university. The 28 certificate recipients were trained under the guidance of an expert panel of lecturers from the Department of Accountancy and the Faculty of Business Studies and Finance of the Wayamba University. The Diploma programme was launched in 2015 with the objective of providing AIA’s Wealth Planners with the knowledge and expertise to provide their clients with a superior service. The curriculum covers aspects of financial analysis, management principles, professional and personal development, economics, managing projects and legal aspects of business.


Wayamba University Vice Chancellor Prof. E.M.P Ekanayake stated in this regard: “We took special effort to engage the highest quality of trainers and resources in ensuring a successful course that adds value to the Wealth Planners as well as their customers. We are proud of this first batch who took a leap into academics to better their careers and I have no doubt that they will put their learning to good use and shine in their future performance.”


AIA Sri Lanka CEO Pankaj Banerjee added: “I congratulate the qualified Wealth Planners and Wealth Planners’ Managers for their successful completion of the Diploma programme. At AIA, we pride ourselves in having the highest calibre of Wealth Planners and this programme is testament to our efforts to constantly raise the bar. We look forward to many more batches of this programme and strongly believe that the synergies between Asia’s leading insurer and one of Sri Lanka’s well respected universities can result in revolutionising the insurance industry and creating a new breed of agents.”
