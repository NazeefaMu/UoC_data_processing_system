The water in the Kalu Ganga was unfit for human consumption as it was mixed with sea water, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said yesterday.

It said the saltwater intrusion had taken place following the prevailing dry weather and had inconvenienced residents living along Kalu Ganga.

The NWSDB said the people in Wadduwa, Waskaduwa, Kalutara North, Nagoda, Bombuwala, Piliminawatte, Payagala, Maggona, Beruwela, Aluthgama, Dharga Town and Benthara, should abstain from drinking water from the Kalu Ganga but can use it for other purposes.

It said residents would be supplied with drinking water using water bowsers that would be kept in public places in those areas and requested the general public to consume water sparingly until the water in the Kalu Ganga recovers from its current state. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
