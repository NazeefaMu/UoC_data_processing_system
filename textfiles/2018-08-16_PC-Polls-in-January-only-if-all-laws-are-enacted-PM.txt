Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has informed the party leaders in Parliament that the provincial council elections can be held on January next year only if the Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill and the delimitation report are approved.

Government sources said there were only two alternatives to ensure that the elections were held in January 2019 -- either to hold the election under the present proportional representation system or hold it under the new mixed system after approving all the schedules of the PC Elections Amendment Bill and the delimitation report (Yohan Perera)
