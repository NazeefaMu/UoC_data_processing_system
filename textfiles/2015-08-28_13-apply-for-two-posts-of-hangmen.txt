The Prisons Department said today they had received 13 applications in response to an advertising calling for applications to fill the two vacant posts of hangmen.
Assistant Commissioner Aruna Attapattu said the vacancies were advertised a month ago, based on Justice Ministry approval.
He said the two vacancies would be filled by the beginning of November and the successful candidates would be given two-weeks training prior to assuming duties.
Mr. Attapattu said the two hangmen recruited on an earlier occasion had left during the training period.
