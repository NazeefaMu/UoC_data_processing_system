President, Maithripala Sirisena was doing the role of the opposition by publicly criticizing the government policies, chairman of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Prof. G.L. Peiris said yesterday.

Addressing a news briefing, he said none of the past executive presidents had criticized in such a manner as the incumbent president was doing.

“It is evident with the occasions where the President has publicly announced its displeasure over certain policies of the government like the reduction of the tax of beer. We don’t recommend the act of the President. This depicts that the President is not in line with the policies of the government,” Prof. Peiris said.

Meanwhile, he said the restriction imposed on Sri Lankan tea by Russia would have an enormous impact on the economy of the country as Russia was the largest buyer of Sri Lankan tea.

“We should not rush into this issue. It is essential to deal in a comprehensive manner with the Russian government about the issue to find out an effective solution. Moreover, the government should work in a diplomatic manner with each other in order to solve the crisis rather expressing contradictory ideas on the particular issue,” Prof. Peiris added.
