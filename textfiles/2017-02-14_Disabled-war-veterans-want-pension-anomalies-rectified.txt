Disabled war veterans want pension anomalies rectified


	



A group of disabled war veterans staged a protest outside the Presidential Secretariat today against the alleged discrimination by the government when computing their pensions. The protesters claimed that their monthly pension was lesser than the amount which would be given to ex-servicemen who served in the forces for a longer period. They said all retied soldiers should be paid a similar amount as pension regardless of their service period. Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana
