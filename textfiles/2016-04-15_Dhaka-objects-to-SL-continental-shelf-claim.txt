Bangladesh has objected to Sri Lanka's claim of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from its coast baseline.

Sri Lanka has made a submission of its claim before the United Nations for determining the limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.

A senior official of the foreign ministry said the government analysed the Lankan submission and it appeared that they also claimed some portion of the Bangladesh continental shelf, which was objected.

“It also appears that Sri Lanka has claimed an outer continental shelf entitlement in an area that is 350 nautical miles more from the baseline from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured and more than 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metres isobaths, and thus beyond the constraints line established by Article 76(5) of the convention,” the objection note said.

The government in due course of time will continue to block the Sri Lankan claim to protect Bangladesh’s interest, he added.

He said according to the UN laws, a country can have the continental shelf rights upto 350 nautical miles or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metres depth, which one is higher.

But, Sri Lanka from its baseline claimed about 1,000 nautical miles, which is India and Bangladesh's continental shelf territory, the official said.

He said the Lankan government tried to negotiate with the Bangladesh government but it did not agree.

“Sri Lanka also claimed a portion of Indian continental shelf and they should complete negation with them first,” he said.

According to the United Nations CLCS website, India and the Maldives also objected to the Sri Lanka's claim.

Bangladesh also objected to the continental shelf claims of India and Myanmar.(Dhaka Tribune)
