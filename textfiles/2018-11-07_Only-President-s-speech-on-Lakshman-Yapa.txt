Only President’s speech on 14: Lakshman Yapa


	

President Maithripala Sirisena’s policy statement would be the only item on Parliamentary agenda on November 14 and a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister would not be taken up on that day, the UPFA today said.

UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that any move to show a majority by any party had to wait till party leaders decided the agenda of the next Parliamentary date.

“Other than the policy statement of the President, no other item would be taken up in Parliament on November 14. If anyone wants to bring in a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, that has to wait until party leaders meet and make a decision,” he told a news conference held at the Prime Minister’s Office.

He said they did not hope to replace Speaker Karu Jayasuriya or the Opposition Leader when Parliament reconvened.

“We have no issue with the Speaker. We are only against some of his actions,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
