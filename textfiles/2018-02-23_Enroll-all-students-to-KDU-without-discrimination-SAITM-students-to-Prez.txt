While thanking President Maithripala Sirisena for his decision to enroll SAITM students to General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), Student Action Committee of SAITM today requested the President to enroll all the students who are currently at SAITM to KDU without any discrimination.

In a letter to the President, the student body of SAITM said the details of the transfer were not clear.
“We would like to convey our heartfelt gratitude to you for providing us with a prompt solution.

However, the details of the transfer is not clear and therefore we would like to humbly request you to direct your attention with regard to our concerns when implementing this solution,” they said in the letter.

They said that they joined SAITM after being scrutinized by the specified authorities (UGC and Higher Education Ministry) with regards to their entry qualifications and requested the President to enroll all the students who are currently at SAITM to KDU without any discrimination.

“Since our intention was to study in Sri Lanka due to certain financial and social issues, we strongly oppose any attempts made by certain parties to undermine your Excellency’s decision and send a fraction of students abroad to continue their medical in foreign universities, “it said.

They said the necessary legislative changes should be implemented before their enrollment into KDU. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
