Reinforcing the value of reading amongst people in Sri Lanka, Sampath Bank partnered with Colombo International Book Fair 2016 as the official bank for the 12th consecutive year.
The Colombo International Book Fair was inaugurated on September 16, 2016, at the BMICH. 
Parallel to the commencement of the Colombo International Book Fair, Sampath Bank announced the launch of My Book Club in joint efforts with Independent Television Network (ITN) and the Sri Lankan Book Publishers’ Association. 
My Book Club was initiated with the motive of forming a common platform that would facilitate knowledge sharing, discussions, reviews and sharing of books amongst book lovers across the island. 
Visitors who registered for My Book Club were presented with a My Book Club loyalty card. This unique card gives book club members the benefit of purchasing books with discounts ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent at bookstores registered with Sri Lanka Book Publishers’ Association. My Book Club cards can be collected at the My Book Club Counter located adjoining the Sampath Bank branch at the Colombo International Book Fair.
Commenting on this initiative, Sampath Bank PLC Senior DGM Consumer Banking Tharaka Ranwala said, “At Sampath Bank, we believe it is our duty to ensure that the bank’s actions continue to enrich the lives of the citizens of Sri Lanka. With the launch of My Book Club and My Book Club loyalty card, we aim to rebuild the culture of reading that would subsequently position Sri Lanka as a hub for knowledge and literature.” 
While the book club members are entitled to the discounts all year round, Sampath Bank will also provide cardholders with an array of banking facilities which include deposits, withdrawals, payments and more.
