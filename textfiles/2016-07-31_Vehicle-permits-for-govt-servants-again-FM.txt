The Vehicle Import Permits offered to public officials and officials of the State Corporation and Statutory Boards under a concessionary basis would be implemented again with amendments, the Finance Ministry said on Sunday.

The ministry said in a media statement that it had received Cabinet approval for the programme and the Industry and Investment Department had issued the Circular No.01/2016 in this regard.

Accordingly, Public Officers, Executive Officers attached to the State Corporations and other Statutory Boards, doctors and legal officers attached to Government Service, University Vice Chancellors, University Lecturers and Executive Grade Officers attached to University Non-Academic Staff are entitled to receive vehicle permits under this Concessionary Basis Vehicle Permit Scheme.

The ministry said an applicant should complete more than six years in State Service to be eligible to receive the permit.

One officer is entitled to only two such permits.  The face value of each concessionary vehicle permit is US$ 30,000.  

The Circular relevant to this vehicle permit scheme is available in the official website of the Treasury (treasury.gov.lk) under its Trade and Investment Policy Department tag.
