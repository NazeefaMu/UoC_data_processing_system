The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said yesterday President, Prime Minister or the subject minister has not revealed to the country on what basis the lotteries board was assigned to the foreign ministry.

JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament that according to the lotteries board act, the finance minister should be the subject minister and added that the government would have to amend the Lotteries Board Act to change the subject minister as the foreign minister.

He said the institutions which come under the purview of the finance ministry should be allocated to it because they were formed under certain Acts and Bills.

He said stability in monetary policy and finance sector depended on the confidence placed on the ministry.

Handunnetti said the move to change lotteries board under foreign ministry was humiliated in social media and added that it was the country which was humiliated ultimately and not the minister. (By Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
