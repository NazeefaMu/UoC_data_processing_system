The vote on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reflects the vibrant democracy in Sri Lanka and the government should seize the opportunity to further strengthen the team that wants to undertake reforms, a delegation of the European Parliament Committee on International Trade (INTA) said today.

The six-member delegation of the INTA arrived in Sri Lanka on Wednesday to follow up on Sri Lanka's commitments made in exchange for access to the EU market through the GSP+ scheme.

Addressing a news briefing held today at the EU Embassy in Colombo, INTA Standing Rapporteur for South Asia Sajjad Karim said the no-confidence motion was a democratic exercise and an internal matter for Sri Lanka.

“I’m not going to comment on the dynamic of that but certainly I do feel that Sri Lanka and the government in an opportunity to strengthen the team further, the team that genuinely wants to undertake the type of thing I described right at the outset, as to the types people of Sri Lanka wants to see which includes lifting the standards of the people and making the country strong. So I hope this opportunity would be seized upon,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Chair of the delegation Jan Zahradil also reiterated that the no-confidence motion was a good exercise of democracy.

“The opposition has the full right to bring in such motions and the government has the full right to defend it,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
