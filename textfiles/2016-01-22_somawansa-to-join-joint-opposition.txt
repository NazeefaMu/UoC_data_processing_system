Former JVP leader Somawansa Amarasinghe is to join hands with the joint opposition led by MP Dinesh Gunawardane to engage in future politics, it is learnt.
Recently, Mr. Amarasinghe who formed the People’s Servants Party met with the representatives of Mr. Gunawardane’s Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP).
At that meeting, Mr. Amarasinghe has agreed to team up with the joint opposition. He defected from the JVP last year and formed a new party.
Meanwhile, efforts are underway to form a new political party. Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa is playing a key role in this regard.
Mr. Rajapaksa is reported to have told MEP Media Secretary Lalith Rohana Liyanage that some members of the UNP and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka’s Democratic Party would also join the new party. (Kelum Bandara)
