Sri Lankan professionals, especially in the Information Technology sector, would not be affected by the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva said.

Deputy Minister de Silva said that the Indian IT professionals would not be given an opportunity of opening up their businesses in Sri Lanka under the agreement.

He assured that Indian professionals would not become threat to local IT professionals under the agreement

He said international service trade has four modes.

“Three of these modes are, namely, cross border trade, consumption abroad and commercial persons are already taking place in Sri Lanka and that covers the IT sector as well,” he said.

"The opposition to the agreement arises from the fear that it will allow the fourth mode of service trade, “presence of a natural person”.

“However, this is not discussed under the agreement,” de Silva said.

Therefore, Indian IT professionals would not be able to threaten Sri Lankan jobs, he said.
