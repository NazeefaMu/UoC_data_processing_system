GMOA welcomes decision to absorb SAITM students to KDU


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today welcomed the Cabinet decision to absorb 982 SAITM students to General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), after their discussion on Friday with Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told Daily Mirror that the Gazette notice on abolishing SAITM should also be delivered, parallel to this decision.

He expressed his gratitude to the Minister for his decision to absorb only the students, without absorbing the SAITM Institute and said there was no requirement for a new KDU Act as some amendments to the present Act would enable the process.

Dr. Aluthge said though the GMOA expects to end the SAITM issue, it would not accept any solution that would undermine the University. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
