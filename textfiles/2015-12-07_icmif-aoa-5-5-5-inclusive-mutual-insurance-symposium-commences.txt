2015 is the first year of the ICMIF 5-5-5 Mutual Microinsurance Strategy, which aims to extend mutual insurance to five million low-income households over five years in five countries. The symposium will be held on December 7 and 8 at Taj Samudra Grand Crystal Ballroom.
The symposium, co-hosted by Amana Takaful PLC together with Sanasa Insurance Co. Ltd and Cooperative Insurance Company Ltd, will provide an excellent opportunity for us to understand and contribute to ICMIF’s plan for developing inclusive mutual microinsurance in emerging markets. 
The first ICMIF/AOA 5-5-5 Inclusive Mutual Insurance Symposium will be an important and meaningful event, bringing together the key stakeholders of the 5-5-5 plan and contributing to a better understanding of the way forward in developing inclusive mutual insurance. State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne will grace the occasion as the chief guest along with several foreign delegates from nine countries.
Over the course of two days, delegates will hear about the status and potential of mutual insurance in India and the Philippines, the limitations, the impact it could bring to people’s livelihoods and how it can be achieved. The symposium aims to share the findings of country diagnostics with the wider ICMIF membership, to build momentum and interest in the 5-5-5 Strategy, to engage established members and donors to support strategy with resources and to commence dialogue for starting projects in Sri Lanka, Kenya and one country in Latin America.
