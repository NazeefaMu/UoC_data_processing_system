Can Sirisena  be so fragile?


	



 

Sri Lanka’s political crisis gives us a window to view it in two ways. The first affords us the opportunity to see whether the country’s leader was strong to hold his nerve and quell the opposition forces out to destroy him. In this count Sirisena failed miserably. He panicked as the UNP forces moved away from him. An isolated Sirisena forged ties with ousted former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to cling on to power. 

The other school of thought is that Sirisena did the right thing by joining with Rajapaksa because that move is termed as one that’s patriotic. The Sinhala-Buddhist nationalists consider it as a wise move because this saved the country from the UNP machinery, which the opposition claims, was selling the country’s vital assets to foreign countries. 

 

But what can’t be debated is the fact that all who threw their weight behind the protest loved democracy and fair play
	Sirisena is still the president and must remember that it was unbecoming of him to pour out his sorrows like a child
	The UNP is mulling over bringing an impeachment on Sirisena
 

If the country’s citizenry is all smiles now, President Sirisena would be sporting a bigger smile because he knows that he cleared one hurdle; now he doesn’t have to deal with Ranil Wickremesinghe. That is one headache that’s over for him. But whether he has the wit and the thinking power to get the best out of the ‘deal’ he has had with Rajapaksa is the big question. 

The continual rift between him and Wickremesinghe, the pressure from India and the much publicised assassination plot associated with his life proved too much for a man who certainly doesnt have the makings to be a political animal. The president joining hands with the opposition underscored how fragile he is in the face of adversity. 

 

Advisers 

The president’s speech on television during which he told the nation why he invited Rajapaksa to be the premier lacked emotion, drive and the punch of a man in the hot seat of politics. Sirisena is still the president and must remember that it was unbecoming of him to pour out his sorrows like a child. He said during the speech that Wickremesinghe grossly violated the Yahapalana Government’s principles apart from stubbornly avoiding collective decision making. Wickremesinghe has denied these allegations however. Srisena’s decision making also questions the input he receives from his advisers. Can’t Sirisena fathom that he created enemies among his own SLFPers when he termed up with National Movement for Social Justice before the 2015 Presidential Elections? Doesn’t he see that the situation now is even worse because he has shown his back to the forces who propelled him to be the first citizen of the country? If this arrangement too fails where would Sirisena go?

Many still believe that Rajapaksa would take his revenge on Sirisena for ousting him, but the former President has vouched that his Government would eschew politics of hate and set up an interim regime. This is yet another lifeline for Rajapaksa in his political career. What will stand in good stead for him is that the Governors of all provinces have promised support for him, and also president Sirisena. 

 


Like in JVP organised rallies, the protesters in Colombo were seen collecting the trash they spilled on the roads before they left. These acts also show the stature of people backing democracy


 

President Sirisena when teaming up with Rajapaksa could see the outside world turning hostile towards Sri Lanka. Right now he has prorogued Parliament and attracted the wrath of the international community. Proroguing parliament is so undemocratic. The ousting of Wickremesinghe as premier is considered unconstitutional by the outside world. If this situation continues in the island, the world community could impose trade embargoes on Sri Lanka. This would prove disastrous for Sri Lanka given the heavy debt commitment the country has to clear. 

The UNP is mulling over bringing an impeachment on Sirisena. On Tuesday (October 30) Wickremesinghe loyalists together with promoters of democracy came in their numbers to stage a protest in Colombo. There are differences of opinion about whether the number of people who gathered at the rally was big or small. But what can’t be debated is the fact that all who threw their weight behind the protest loved democracy and fair play. Like in JVP organised rallies, the protesters in Colombo were seen collecting the trash they spilled on the roads before they left. These acts also show the stature of people backing democracy, leave alone supporting Wickremesinghe. 

The rally was in support of Wickremesinghe to be allowed to continue as Premier. Some legal experts say that Parliament must lose confidence in the Prime Minister to remove him and that Articles 46 and 48 of the Constitution clearly show how Parliament can remove a prime minister. But there are others who form their opinions by quoting Article 46 (4) and state that when Cabinet is dissolved it warrants the removal of the premier. 

The chaos that exists in the country forced people to buy petrol in advance, giving rise to long queues at filling stations. People also mulled over whether they should indulge in the panic buying of groceries fearing the situation could worsen. There was a large drop in attendance at work places and at schools on Monday (October 29). 

Right now the Rajapaksa machinery is hellbent on ‘buying over’ people to have a minimum requirement regarding the strength of the Cabinet. Some legal experts state that the moment the UPFA exited the coalition, the National Government ceased to exist. Therefore they say there can’t be a constitutional Cabinet of Ministers numbering over 30. Apart from this, legal experts say that now its up to the newly appointed Premier to go to parliament and show the numbers. 

 

can’t be fooled 

We now live in an era where the trend of the youth is towards education. Most of the children of owners of small tea kiosks, village farmers and less affluent clerical staffers at Government institutes are armed with degrees and wish for a better Sri Lanka. These youth can’t be fooled and they’ve had enough of this nonsense of new Cabinets being formed with the same old faces in the political sphere who are termed as spent forces. 

But these educated youth will have opposition from those of their same age who showcase the little knowledge they have about life and the future. The latter do so by serving milk rice on the roads to celebrate the return of politicians in the likes of Rajapaksa. Did these people, who served milk rice on the roads, ever think that this chaotic situation in the country could create a food shortage, hence they should not indulge in wasteful habits? 

Sirisena must seriously consider that he betrayed the 62 lakhs of voters who cast their votes for a change in 2015. The president is still able use state television and address the nation, but can he do that now onwards with a mike at hand at a public platform in the presence of a large and boisterous crowd?
