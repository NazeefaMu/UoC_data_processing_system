The Government has decided to look for another partner for the national carrier Srilankan Airlines in addition to the short listed Texas Pacific Group (TPG) in its bid to convert the venture into a public-private partnership, Minister of Public Enterprise Development Kabir Hashim said yesterday.

Minister Hashim told a media briefing that TPG was selected out of about 14 applications received when the government called for expressions of interest but the government has begun discussions with several airlines as well.

He said the committee appointed for the restructure of the airline is currently having discussions with several airlines. The committee comprises secretary of his ministry, secretaries of three other ministries and representatives of the company that had been hired as an advisor.

This discussion he said has begun in line with the government’s thinking that involvement of airline is needed when it comes to restructuring of the national carrier.

He said TPG is currently carrying out a study on Srilankan Airlines. “TPG can look at the financial statements of the airline in carrying out the evaluation,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Minister said the decision on the lease of three A330-200 aircraft which has expired recently is still pending. “We are yet to make the final decision on these aircraft as the directors of Srilankan Airlines want the lease extended,” the Minister said.(Yohan Perera)
