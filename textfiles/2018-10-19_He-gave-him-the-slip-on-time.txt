He gave him the slip on time!


	



 

As a high political authority arrived at a funeral house, a onetime bigwig of another main party who was there, sloped away making his exit through a rear door, they say.

 


A typical turncoat, the politico who did the vanishing trick, had quit his original party to secure high office and is said to be putting out feelers these days to return to the fold.


The politico faded from the scene fearing possible questioning about his hanky-panky by the high authority, they say.


Meanwhile, reports say that some of his onetime colleagues had already asked the party leadership not to close the door on the ‘prodigal son’ coming back home.
