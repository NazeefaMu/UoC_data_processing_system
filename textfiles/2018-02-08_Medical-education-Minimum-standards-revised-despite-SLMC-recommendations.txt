Medical education: Minimum standards revised despite SLMC recommendations


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today the Cabinet had amended the minimum standards for medical education despite Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s request to approve the minimum standards recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news briefing that the recently issued gazette notification on minimum standards for medical education cited two credit passes and one simple pass at the GCE Advanced Level examination as the entry criterion.

“The entry criterion initially approved by the SLMC was three merit passes at GCE A/Ls. Minister Senaratne expressed his concern with regard to the issue at two instances saying the Cabinet made amendments to this criterion disregarding his need to approve the recommended standards. It is in question whether this move to revise the minimum standards for medical education is a result of a confidential committee within the Cabinet. Perhaps, it could be politically motivated. The Cabinet should discuss this matter in its upcoming sessions. It should review these amendments,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
