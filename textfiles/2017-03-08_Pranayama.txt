Pranayama


	

In Yoga, air is the primary source of Prana or life force. Pranayama maximizes the benefits of Prana. Pranayama is used in yoga as a separate practice to help clear and cleanse the body and mind. Pranayama increases the body’s immunity, as the enhanced oxygen and blood supply brings health to the body. Pranayama can retard or reverse the effects of lung damage in smokers. Pranayama also helps control the mind during stress. It helps relax and de-stress not only the mind but also the body. Recent research has shown that Pranayama is an effective solution to stress. As the management of stress through modern medicine essentially brings severe side effects, ultimately stress is multiplied by side effects in the long term.  


Hence, Pranayama is like a multivitamin capsule. Practicing pranayama regularly keeps problems at bay.  


You can prevent or cure heart disease, arthritis, impotence, obesity, menopausal problems, ulcer, fatigue, colds, viral infections and dozens of other illnesses - all with just a few minutes of practicing Pranayama daily.  


Poor breathing leads to a variety of diseases such as hyperventilation syndrome that causes everything from tiredness, chest pain and sexual problem. When you take rapid, small, upper body (chest) breaths you won’t get enough oxygen.  


The quick exhalation of carbon dioxide when breathing fast disturbs the balance of acidity and alkalinity - pH in blood. When acid levels drop, a complicated reaction occurs that keeps blood cells from delivering oxygen to muscles and organs including brain. This can lead to high blood pressure, a racing heart and shallow breathing that lie at the root of many illnesses including heart disease.  
Researchers have proven that Pranayama (breathing exercises) slows heart rate, lowers blood pressure, improves the immune system and reduces anxiety.  


Alternate breathing brings calmness, balance and unites the left and right sides of the brain. If you practice Pranayama in the morning, you can begin the day stress-free, feel wide awake and ready to tackle any problem. 


Many ailments are caused by incorrect breathing. They can be alleviated - and even cured - through specialized techniques in Pranayama.  


This discovery is causing quite a storm. Mainstream medical science doesn’t like being outperformed by ancient natural remedies.


Ancient traditional healing techniques reveal how to breathe diseases right out of your body.

Breathing exercises like Pranayama have been used for thousands of years to cure everything from a cold to heart disease.  


During breathing exercises, you breathe more oxygen into the lower lobes of your lungs. You actually radiate Prana (vital life energy) throughout your body. When you practice Pranayama, your prana is able to travel through your body freely and smoothly. The body’s organs and systems are in a state of harmony, healing and preventing diseases. Most diseases are caused due to the obstruction of free flow of Prana through your body. Free travel increases the body’s immunity as the enhanced oxygen and blood supply gives vitality to body.  

 




Pranayama is a safe and simple way to balance your physical, emotional and mental state. More doctors are prescribing Pranayama as a complementary and alternative medicine to drugs in some hospitals abroad. Pranayama and meditation are also introduced to students in some schools. Furthermore, millions of people practice Pranayama globally to alleviate stress and enhance their lives.
