Investors had expressed interest to start the second canned fish factory in Hambantota, Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera said.

The major part of the fish products imported to the country is canned fish representing 28 percent of the total import of fish products.

During 2016, 26,845 metric tons of canned fish valued at Rs.7,196 million had been imported while it was Rs.7,130 million worth 30,638 metric tons in 2017, Minister said.

Linna fish is to be used for canning locally since Herrings, Haddock and Mackerel mostly used for canning in other countries, are not found in the seas around the island.

The Minister also predicted good revenue from the canned fish industry leading to a reduction of foreign exchange drain. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)
