Applied, didn’t receive SLPP membership: Roshan


	

UPFA MP Roshan Ranasinghe yesterday said they have only applied for the membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) but they have not yet received the membership.

The issue of UPFA MP’s joining the SLPP arose in parliament early this week as several MP’s argued that MP’s who obtained the SLPP membership are ineligible to retain their parliament seats.

Responding to criticisms, MP Ranasinghe said they have submitted applications to obtain membership from the SLPP but the party's secretary and national organiser had not given them membership as yet.

"They accepted our applications but did not give the membership as yet. We were elected to parliament from the UPFA. From that day, we continue to pay Rs. 3,000 monthly as membership subscription fee to the SLFP. These fees have been deducted from our November salaries as well,” he told a news briefing.
