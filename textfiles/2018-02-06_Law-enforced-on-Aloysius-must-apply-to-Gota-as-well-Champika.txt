The same Law which was enforced on Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius should be enforced on former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa in connection with the Avant Garde scam, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said.

He said Mr. Rajapaksa was accused of causinga Rs.12 billion loss to the Government through the Avant Garde floating armoury and the security service.

The minister said the SL Navy which had acquired this business had earned profits ofmore than Rs.10 million a day and pointed out justice must be meted out by enforcing the law on the former defence secretary as well.

Meanwhile, he requested the President to wield his sword over the Ratwatte family for misappropriating another Rs.12 billion from the Ceylon Electricity Board. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
