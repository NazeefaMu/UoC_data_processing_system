President Maitripala Sirisena is reported to have instructed the State Ministers and the Deputy Ministers representing his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to stand firm against injustice by the United National Party (UNP) in running the government.

The Ministers met at the residence of Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera for dinner and discussed the matters. The President also attended it for a while. It took place in the context of MP Piyankara Jayaratne resigning from his state minister's post citing inability to work with the UNP members representing his area.

Minister Amaraweera told Daily Mirror the current difficulties were discussed at this meeting.

“We discussed about problems created by the UNP for our members. The President asked us to stand firm,” he said.

He said none of the ministers would resign hereafter, and the unity government would proceed.(Kelum Bandara)
