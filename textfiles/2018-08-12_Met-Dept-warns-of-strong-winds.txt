The general public should take measures to prevent damages from strong winds, the Department of Meteorology warned a while ago.

“There is a possibility of increase  in the wind speeds to some extent over the Island and the general public to take adequate measures to prevent damages caused by strong winds,” the department said.

In a report issued by the Natural Hazards Early Warning Centre at 1300 hours today it said fairly strong gusty winds up to 50 kmp/h could be expected in the Central mountainous areas of the Sabaragamuwa, Western, Southern, North-Western, North-Central and the Uva Provinces and in the Ampara and the Batticaloa Districts.

The department said that it expected that the strong winds may occur until Tuesday (14).

According to the forecast report valid for next 36 hours, showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in Galle, Matara and Kaluthara districts.

“Several spells of showers will occur in North-western province and in Colombo, Gampaha and Hambantota districts. Fairly heavy falls above 75 mm can be expected at some places in Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in Kaluthara district," it said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
