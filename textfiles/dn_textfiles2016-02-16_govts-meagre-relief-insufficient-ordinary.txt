Govt's meagre relief insufficient for ordinary

 
A multitude of the ordinary public are today complaining that life is like a torch burning at both ends. Farmers especially are saying that they would have to die in hunger soon as all public relief has been curtailed by the government, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
Addressing a press conference held by the Socialist Janatha Peramuna at the Rajagiriya Dr. N. M. Perera Memorial Hall, yesterday Nanayakkara said public were lamenting that the paddy purchasing exercise had almost come to a near standstill and farmers were not receiving fertilizer at the subsidized price since the fertilizer sales had been handed over to the private sector.
The meagre relief offered to farmers today were insufficient to keep them in the agriculture industry. He said that during his visit to Medabadda and Kaltota he saw some of the rooms earlier used for stocking paddy given over to conduct vocational training classes. The paddy purchasing in those areas had ceased because there were no storage facilities available. This might be a ruse adopted by the government to wean the farmers away from their agricultural pursuits, the parliamentarian said. Nanayakkara said a similar fate had befallen rubber cultivators. Certain rubber small holders had ceased tapping. While larger rubber estates had limited tapping for 10 days a month.
The tea industry too was facing a state of depression as the price of green leaf had plummeted to Rs. 54 or Rs. 55 per kilo. This shows that income levels of people had fallen to great depths while the expenses involved had increased to unbearable levels.
