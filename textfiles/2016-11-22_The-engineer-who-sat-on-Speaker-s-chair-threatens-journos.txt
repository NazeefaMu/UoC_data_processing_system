The engineer, who reportedly sat on the Speaker's chair, is alleged to have threatened two lobby reporters after the media reported the incident.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today he would inquire into the complaint about the threats.

The Speaker gave this assurance when MP Ranjith Aluvihara informed him about the threats to the journalists.

MP Dinesh Gunawardane also requested the speaker to look into the matter stating that threatening journalists was a dangerous precedent.

The Speaker said one must not give prominence to matters such as these because there were more grave issues to be sorted out. "There is no need to sensationalise issues such as this. Besides. I am ever ready to give up the Speaker's chair," he said. (Yohan Perera)
