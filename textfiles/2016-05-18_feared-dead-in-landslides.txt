Over 150 feared dead in the two major landslides in Aranayake and Bulathkohupitiya although only 17 bodies had been recovered as at late today as torrential rains and more landslide threats hampering the rescue operations, officials said.

In Aranayake, fourteen bodies were recovered by the rescue operations carried out by the Army and other security force personnel with the assistance of volunteers today.

“We have information that there was no information about 134 people. We are looking for them,” Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, who is in charge of the rescue operation in Aranayake said based on official records of local authorities including the GA and Police.

Meanwhile, a total of 37 people had been confirmed dead and a large number of others reported missing due to landslides, floods and related disasters across the country since last week with the two major landslides in Aranayake and Bulathkohupitiya, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said.
