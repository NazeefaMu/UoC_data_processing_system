Adrian Perera, the newly elected Chairman Member Network panel of ACCA Sri Lanka, believes that to develop and prosper, every country needs the core skills of professional accountants to build transparency and accountability for strong, sustainable government, companies and societies.


“Accountants need to have ethical standards and competencies, ask the right questions and know how to put the information together. This is where ACCA comes in to assist this process for both private and public enterprises through our qualifications that are aligned to meet these criteria’s. Therefore to me this is an exciting time to lead ACCA as we try to achieve our vision of being number one in developing professional accountants the world needs.”


He identified three challenges for today’s organizations: people, process and pace of change. 
“In terms of people, it is about having the right people with the right skills,whereas for processes it is where, companies must get to grips with the changing technological landscape and be able to align the finance function in a manner that will be beneficial 
to  organizations.”


As for the pace of change, Adrian feels that it is important for accountants and finance professionals to play a bigger role in facilitating change within an organization, and to apply the essential principles of entrepreneurship.  ‘I see accountants in the future playing the role as trusted advisers for businesses. We as practitioners need to be at the forefront of changes and developments and be aware of what’s happening in the economy and business landscape so that we are able to advise our organizations to help them navigate issues and challenges and manage them,’ 
he says.


“Hence at ACCA, we are working to make sure the qualification remains fit for thispurpose. We will be organizing as we have done in the past a series of workshops  that are relevant to the challenges that are facing businesses today such as Cyber security, International Taxation  and many more so that our members are updated  and knowlegable of the current trends and challenges that businesses face.”


He also points out that ‘developing professional accountants the world needs’ is pivotal. This means inspiring the younger generation to take up accountancy. ‘Nowadays one is spoilt for choice and if people don’t come forward to take up accountancy then there will be a shortage of talent.  That’s why we intend to continue our quest in building and strengthening our relationships with schools and universities across the country to promote ACCA and to make them understand the value they can derive from the qualification and the role they can play in uplifting the industry in the country and the businesses.” 


He also cited that working alongside with other accountancy bodies to enhance the profession in the country was crucial. “ ACCA will continue to foster the relationships that we have  with themany professional bodies  in the country and will look at building  new relationships with other professions  as well ,such as HR  so that  will give added value to the businesses in our country.”


“Another thing we are trying to expand is the footprint that we have in the public sector in the sense of promoting   good governance, ethics, and risk management. Looking ahead, Adrian says that ACCA is seeking to build stronger understanding and relationships between the accountancy profession and interest groups such as legislators, regulators and investors along with the business community.
