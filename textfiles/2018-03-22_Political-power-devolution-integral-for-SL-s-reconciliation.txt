As Sri Lanka acknowledged with its co-sponsorship of the UN resolution of 2015, devolution of political authority through constitutional reform is integral to lasting reconciliation and non-recurrence of violations and abuses, a joint statement issued by four UN member States said.

The statement issued on behalf of Macedonia, Montenegro, the US and the UK said they remain concerned about reports of abuse of authority by some security officials in Sri Lanka.

“Also, the multiple incidents of inter-communal violence, attacks and hate speech against minorities are alarming and demonstrate the need for reconciliation efforts,” it said.

While thanking the UNHR High Commissioner for his update on Sri Lanka, the four countries said they welcome the overall improvement in human rights and democratic reforms noted by his update.

The statement said Sri Lanka is safer and freer than it was in 2015 and The Government’s constructive engagement with UN special procedures and support for the Peace-building Priority Plan is welcome.

“The Consultation Task Force issued an important report to reflect the views of Sri Lankans and recent legislation on enforced disappearance is also positive. While welcoming these steps, we are disappointed that the pace of progress has been slow. Much still remains to be done to implement Sri Lanka’s commitments,” it said.

It said families of disappeared persons from all communities have waited too long for answers and urged that the Office on Missing Persons be fully operational without delay.

With determined leadership and a clear timeline for action, this Government can deliver the reform and justice agenda, and take the actions needed to support long-term reconciliation. Sri Lanka still has an historic opportunity to avoid returning to divisions of the past. We firmly believe that implementing the reforms in the UN resolutions 34/1 and 30/1 will help give all Sri Lankans assurance of the safe, peaceful and a prosperous future,” it said.
