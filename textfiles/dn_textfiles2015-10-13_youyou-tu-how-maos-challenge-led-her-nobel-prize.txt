Youyou Tu: how Mao's challenge led her to Nobel prize




It was 21 January 1969 when Mao Zedong gave a 39-year-old scientist from Zhejiang province the challenge of her life.
China was in the grip of the Cultural Revolution, with universities and schools across the country shutting their doors as the red guards ran riot.
Amid all the madness Youyou Tu, then a researcher at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, was handed a daunting mission: to find a drug that would cure malaria.

"The work was the top priority so I was certainly willing to sacrifice my personal life," the famously understated scientist later recalled.
On Monday, nearly half a century after her life-changing quest began, Tu was awarded the Nobel prize in medicine for her role in creating a drug that helped slash malaria mortality rates in Africa and Asia, saving millions of lives.
Yet for all her achievements, Tu, who is now 84, remains a little known figure, even in her native China where she had drifted into obscurity despite the magnitude of her discovery.
As news of Tu's victory reached her native land on Monday night, one fan wrote on Weibo, China's Twitter: "Recognised at last!"
Tu was born in Ningbo, a port city about 140 miles south of Shanghai, in 1930. She was named after a verse in the Book of Songs, a collection of ancient Chinese poetry that is believed to have been compiled by Confucius. Tu chose medicine, not philosophy, when she left Zhejiang and headed to China's capital to further her studies in 1951.
She enrolled at the Peking University School of Medicine and graduated from its Department of Pharmacology four years later.
From university Tu moved to the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. She married Li Tingzhao, a former school classmate and factory worker with whom she would have two daughters, and settled down in Beijing.
Then, in 1969, everything changed when Tu was recruited to a medical research project so secret it was known only as "523".
The unit had been created two years earlier - on 23 May 1967 - on the orders of Chairman Mao, who hoped to find a way of halting the spread of malaria, a disease that was decimating North Vietnamese troops fighting in the jungles to China's south-west.
Tu was tasked with searching in nature for a new malaria treatment and was sent to Hainan, a tropical island off China's southern coast that has long struggled with its blight.
