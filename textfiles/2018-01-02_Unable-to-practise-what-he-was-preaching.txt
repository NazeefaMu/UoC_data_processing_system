Unable to practise what he was preaching


	



 

There is a deputy purohita who had been consistent over the years in his stand against the practice of grooming family members for high political office resorted to by some powerful politicos and he would often condemn this practice in his public speeches. 

 


However, he took his supporters by surprise recently when he sponsored his wife as his party’s mayoral candidate at the upcoming local polls. 


A group of his loyalists the other day asked the deputy what made him depart from his consistent policy against nepotism – a practice he had condemned in no uncertain terms over the years. And the deputy replied: “I have exhausted my vocal chords by telling her not to come forward as a candidate. But the woman does not listen to me! Now that she has filed her nominations, she has to win! After all, it is I who would lose face, if she lost!”
