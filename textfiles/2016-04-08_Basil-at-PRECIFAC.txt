Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa arrived at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) a short while ago.

A spokesman for the commission said Mr. Rajapaksa was summoned to the commission to record a statement over an allegation of misusing flights carried out by the Air Force.

His wife Pushpa Rajapaksa had also been asked to report to the commission over the same matter yesterday but she did not make it as she was out of the country.(Ajith Siriwardana)
