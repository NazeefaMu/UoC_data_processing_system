Temporary speed limit on E01 Expressway

Motorists should travel at a temporary speed limit of 40kmph on the E01 Expressway until further notice to allow landslide mitigation work, Road Development Authority Maintenance Unit Expressway Operations Director S. Opanayake said.
He said the notice affects a stretch of the road from Imaduwa and Kokmaduwa on the Southern Expressway which faces a risk of landslides.
The notice came into force from last Friday. It is expected to be in place until maintenance is complete.
The two lanes from Matara to Colombo in the 113km post and 114km post near Kokmaduwa and Imaduwa area were temporarily closed due to landslide mitigation activities such as horizontal drilling and chemical blasting being carried out by the National Building Research Organisation due to landslide threats.
The risk of landslide arose on the slope of Nalawana Kanda on October 1 and vehicular movement was temporarily suspended for five days.
A lane of the expressway was open for vehicular movement since Friday evening and two lanes that are prone to landslides have been shut down while two lanes on the opposite direction have been opened for bi-way vehicular movement.
