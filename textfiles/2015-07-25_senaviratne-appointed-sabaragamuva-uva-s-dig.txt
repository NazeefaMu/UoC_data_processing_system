Senior DIG Ravi Senaviratne of CID had been appointed as the Senior DIG of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces by the Public Law and Order Ministry Secretary with the approval of Elections Commissioner, the police said today.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said there were three vacant S/DIG posts in Sabaragamuwa, Uva and North Central Provinces and therefore, S/DIG Senaviratne was appointed as in charge of Sabaragamuwa and Uva.
“Previously, the three provinces were administrated by the S/DIGs of other provinces. Since many election law violations and related complaints were reported in Ratnapura of, the department needed a separate S/DIG for the Sabaragamuwa province. Therefore, the ministry secretary made the appointment with the approval of elections commissioner,” he said.
He said S/DIG Senaviratne served as the DIG of CID and the appointment had to be made after he was promoted as the S/DIG. “There is no S/DIG post in the CID,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
