A Sri Lankan mother was caught selling one of her twin babies in Sharjah and was charged by the Sharjah Court of First Instance with human trafficking.

She has been deported from the country.

According to prosecution records, her twins were born out of wedlock. During interrogation, the mother told the prosecution that she was forced to sell one of the children as she had no source of income.

Presiding judge Dr Yaqoub Al Hamadi was told that the accused woman was deported, and the court has requested for documents to check with the authorities concerned.

The Sharjah Police started investigation into the case after receiving information that the woman was trying to sell a baby.

A police officer then posed as a buyer and offered the woman Dh2,500 in exchange for the infant.

When the woman handed over the baby to him, she was arrested by the police.

She confessed to the police that after getting pregnant with the twins from a relationship outside wedlock, she could not cover their expenses. She also said one of the babies was sick, thus leaving her with no alternative but to try and sell the child.(Khaleej Times)
