Cameron to campaign against 'Brexit'

 
UK: British Prime Minister David Cameron said he's ready to campaign to keep Britain in the European Union after its president, Donald Tusk, issued a draft proposal that may go some way to allay fears migrants are draining Britain's welfare coffers.
As well as offering a four-year "emergency brake" on welfare for new migrants from the EU, the plan sets out safeguards to shield the British financial system from interference by EU regulators and more powers for national parliaments.
Cameron needs to persuade a sceptical British public he's fought hard and won significant concessions as he prepares for a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU or leave - a so-called Brexit.
At the same time, he has to keep the bloc's other 27 leaders on side, because they still have to approve the plan at a summit in Brussels this month. That would pave the way for a popular vote as early as June.
"If I could get these terms for British membership, I sure would opt in to membership of the EU," Mr Cameron said in a speech at a plant in Chippenham, western England, run by German engineering giant Siemens, symbolising the degree to which Britain's economy is bound up with the rest of the bloc. "Strong, determined, patient negotiation has achieved a good outcome for Britain." But critics said the plan contained only "watered-down" pledges. The deal would give EU migrants "gradually increasing access" to benefits after they come to Britain - as opposed to the outright ban Mr Cameron had previously demanded. They described it as "pathetic" and "insubstantial".
London mayor Boris Johnson became the most senior Tory to openly criticise Mr Cameron's deal, warning that there was "much, much more that needs to be done".
Liam Fox, a former Conservative defence secretary who's campaigning to quit the bloc, denounced the proposal, saying in an emailed statement that "none of these changes even come close to the fundamental changes promised to the public".
Tusk's proposal will limit the application of an ever-closer union in EU law; child benefits will be indexed to the standard of living where the child is; restrictions on in-work benefits may last for as long as four years; and EU legislation can be blocked if 55 per cent of national parliaments oppose it, according to the text posted on the European Council's website.
