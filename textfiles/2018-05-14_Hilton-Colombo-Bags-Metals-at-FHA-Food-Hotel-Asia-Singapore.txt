As a pioneer in the hospitality trade Hilton Colombo has always prided itself in providing an impeccable service and continues to make revolutionary strides in the field of food and beverage. 

Hilton Colombo owes much of its success to its team. They are an integral part of the operations and most importantly, they are the glue that holds the brand together. The teams’ dedication and commitment to the brand and passion to push the envelope, has been the foundation of our continuous growth as a brand that has elevated the benchmark for service standards.

Hilton Colombo firmly believes in investing in the future; much of their energy is channeled towards selecting the best of the best. As such, the hotel goes to great lengths to identify talent, and mold each and every member of the team to reach their true potential. 

The hotel’s commitment towards nurturing talent and harnessing their inherent capabilities is encapsulated in our dedication to youth development.

In a move that highlights the Hilton Colombo’s commitment to supporting youth, the hotel selected a team of 7 young, budding chefs from the hotel, to participate in the FHA 2018 (Food & Hotel Asia) which concluded in Singapore recently. Hilton Colombo’s general manager, Manesh Fernando said “Our goal is to provide youth with the tools and support they need so that they can explore the world and share their stories and inspire the younger generation.”

Success stories are aplenty, at Hilton Colombo, and young Mohommed Raaji is one such budding star whose hard work and dedication was rewarded when he won a Gold medal in the Hot Cooking category, after cooking up an exquisite lamb dish, that impressed the judges at the competition. He also bagged a Bronze in the Plated Appetizer category. The rest of the team who won metal are M R T Sanjaya – Silver for Plated Dish and Bronze for Hot Cooking, Champika Rajapaksha – Silver for Dough Figurine, Ruchira Siriwardena – Bronze for Desserts and Petit Fours/Pralines, Anushka Karunathilaka – Bronze for Dress the Cake and Darshana Dayarathne bagged a Silver for the Chef Challenge and Bronze in the Hot Cooking category.

Unleashing one’s culinary mastery and securing a medal for oneself is no easy task, especially at the FHA, which is acclaimed as one of the most established culinary competitions in the world.  The FHA is a platform to showcase true culinary prowess where competitors battle with each other in their artistry and creativity field. This year more than 800 competitors participated in the competition.

With strong support from the World Association of Chef Societies and the regional chef associations, it is the ultimate arena for hundreds of budding culinary chefs from around the world to display their master skills and be recognized by a panel of internationally acclaimed chefs

In February a team of chefs flew to Dubai to participate in the Emirates Salon Culinaire 2018 known as the most prestigious culinary competitions in the world. The team proudly brought back 11 Medals and 4 Merit awards.
