Strike by non-academic staff causes ripple effect State higher education system ‘indefinitely paused


	



23 days have elapsed since the University Non-Academic Staff decided to stay away from performing their duties until their grievances are met. The University system cannot function without them. Everything from keeping the universities clean to doing most of the paper work, it is the non-academic staff that forms the entire system’s heart and makes the institution function smoothly. As a result of this strike the electricity and water supply was disconnected, making things worse. More than 15,000 non-academic staff members agreed to support trade union action which began in the form of a strike on February 27. Operations in over 15 state universities and higher education institutes governed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) have come to a standstill. On March 20th (Tuesday), the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) staged a protest where its participants walked from Rajagiriya to Parliament roundabout voicing their demands. But conditions remain the same. This indefinite strike has paralysed all academic activities including lectures and exams of undergraduates and post-graduates.   

Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on how this strike adds ‘hay’ to the already burning higher education system in the country.   

Finance Ministry not in a position to release money   
	Bio-matter and other resources at risk of dying   
	Small businesses around universities affected   
	Higher Education Minister keeps silent and travels overseas   
‘Strike will continue until govt. responds with a proper solution’   
Inter-University Students’ Federation Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said that as a result of the ongoing strike, lectures, exams and other academic activities have come to a standstill. “The Government doesn’t seem to be providing a solution for this problem. They promptly solved the SAITM issue, but what about this problem? The Government had initially agreed to pay these allowances, but it has now turned a blind eye to this issue. Therefore it’s fair for these people to go on strike. They would continue this strike until the Government responds properly and brings a solution,”said Weerasekara.   

‘These allowances were never included in a budget’
When contacted, the University Trade Union Joint Committee Chairman Edward Malwattage said that although they had met with the PM’s Coordinating Secretary and expressed their concerns, they didn’t get a satisfactory response. “They understood the hardships that we were experiencing, but they didn’t have a proper solution at hand. The Secretary in fact suggested that discussions should commence with the University Grants Commissions (UGC), Finance Ministry and a few other authorities, but that still doesn’t address our concerns. We were asked to resume duties, but we aren’t ready to do that. 23 days have elapsed and all activities at state universities have been crippled. It has been one and a half years since these matters were raised in Parliament, but no allocation was made from the Budget for these allowances. As a result, the Finance Ministry is not in a position to release the money,”said Malwattage.   

Speaking further Malwattage said that as a result of this strike the entire university system has been handicapped. “There are various businesses which depend on the universities. For example, the bus service which manoeuvres through the Peradeniya University earns an extra income from the students who travel in it. This is the same with people doing businesses in the Pambahinna town closer to the Sabaragamuwa University. But all these services have been affected in addition to shops providing printing, photocopy and typesetting services with restaurants being among other establishments that are affected. Therefore there’s a greater damage already happening than what you could just see,” he said.   


These workers are requesting for an allowance which was promised sometime back. The daily activities of a university require a huge amount of money and when universities are shut, the expenditure is even higher


‘The Govt. seems to be ignoring state universities’   
Airing his concerns, Federation of University Teachers’ Association (FUTA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Athulasiri Samarakoon said that the Government has to respond as quickly as possible to this issue. “There’s limited focus on the education system today. One example was the SAITM issue which dragged on for years. With strikes of this nature the entire education system would be disrupted. These workers are requesting for an allowance which was promised sometime back. The daily activities of a university require a huge amount of money and when universities are shut, the expenditure is even higher. Sometimes we wonder if the Government is focusing more on Non-State Universities (NSUs) and ignoring all state universities. They should consider higher education as a priority. We see many technical educational institutes mushrooming, but there’s no point in only providing technical education. In fact education should be a holistic experience for students. It is high time that the system is reformed in such a way that education is given more prominence. If not the efforts of all lecturers as well as students would be wasted,” said Dr. Samarakoon.   

Speaking further Dr. Samarakoon added that there are no electricity and water facilities at all universities. “Therefore bio-matter collected for research purposes are at risk. As such this strike also contributes to the wastage of resources as well. When exams are delayed, it is difficult to set timetables as well. Even these students enter universities with hopes of graduating as soon as their courses are completed. But unfortunately with these strikes, they would have to keep waiting. It is rather doubtful whether the Government is unstable to the extent that it cannot take a decision regarding this problem. So far the Higher Education minister too seems to be silent about this incident,” he said.   

The Daily Mirror learned that the Higher Education and Highways Minister Kabir Hashim was to travel overseas and therefore was not available for comment.   
Several attempts made to contact UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan De Silva too proved futile.   

‘It’s inhumane to keep animals in cages for a long time’   

Footage of animals kept for research purposes at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Peradeniya highlighted another sorrowful aspect of the on-going strike. In addition to that, the Veterinary Clinical Science Department and the Ambulatory Clinic at the Peradeniya University is one of the many departments that have been affected by the strike. Speaking to the media, Head of the Department and Senior Lecturer in Veterinary Pharmacology Dr. Nayana Wijayawardhane said that this is not a matter only related to the wages of employees. “We work with animals and cannot talk to them. Therefore we have to ensure that they are properly fed and cared for. We conduct a lot of research involving them and it is inhumane to keep them in cages for a long time,” said Dr. Wijayawardhane.
