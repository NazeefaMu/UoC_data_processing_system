Despite the arrest of a three-wheel driver in connection to the attack on a Maldivian man in Colombo last week, new information has raised question marks over the attacker.
Usman Nooraddeen, 45 of Thaa Atoll Vilufushi island was in critical condition as he had suffered severe head trauma in the mugging, his family had said.
He has since been transferred out of intensive care.
A family member had earlier told Haveeru that Usman was attacked while he was on his way home after shopping. He was attacked by the driver of the three-wheel which he was travelling in, the family member had said.
However, according to new information that came to light during the investigation, the three wheel driver is seemingly not connected to the attack itself.
A family member quoting Sri Lanka police said, Usman was found by a security guard in an empty parking lot near the Nawaloka Hospital in Colombo.
The guard had sent the injured Usman to the hospital in a three wheeler, the family member said.
It is believed that Usman's phone and the money was near him when he was found. The money, according to the family, was stolen by the three wheel driver en-route to the hospital.
So questions have now arisen over the attacker as Usman was already injured when he was entrusted to the three wheel driver to be taken to the hospital.
The driver is believed to have had stolen USD6,000 and Rs.50,000 from Usman.
"The driver did not confess at first. But the security guard had claimed that the money was inside the wallet when Usman was put in the three wheeler. Lanka police found the wallet from the driver's mother as he had given it for safekeeping," the family member said.
The driver remains in custody after he confessed to robbing his injured passenger. Police have now handed over the recovered money to Usman's family.
The family said the truth behind the attack will only be clear once Usman is able to give his statement. Though he is now out of intensive care, he is still unable to speak properly, the family said.
"He has a skull fracture. But he is slowly recovering," the relative said.
Usman is in Colombo to meet some family members before leaving to India for his child's operation.
The attack comes in the wake of the brutal stabbing murder of a Maldivian man in Sri Lanka.
Razeen, who is a notorious former gangster, was found dead with stab injuries in an abandoned paddy field near the Tumbovila Bridge in Piliyandala on November 5.
