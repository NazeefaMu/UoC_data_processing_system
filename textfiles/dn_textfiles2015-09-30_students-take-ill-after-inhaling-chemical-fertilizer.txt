Students take ill after inhaling chemical fertilizer

The Police said 28 students of Lindula Rahanwatta School were hospitalised yesterday after inhaling chemical fertilizer sprayed on a capsicum cultivation near the school.
The Police said the hospitalized children were between 12 and 15 years and most of them were discharged after treatment and added that three children were still being treated at the hospital. The students were hospitalised due to breathing difficulties.
The Police said strong winds that persisted in the area could have led to this incident.
