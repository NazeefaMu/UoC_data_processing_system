A group of Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) members including its National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe, several monks and lawyers on Thursday visited Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera who is detained at the Welikada Prison.
Mr. Warnasinghe said though the JHU did not agree with each and  every opinion of the BBS or Ven. Gnanasara Thera, they paid the visit because the monk was going through a difficult situation. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
