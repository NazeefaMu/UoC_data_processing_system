15 UNP MPs to join us: Muthuhettigamage


	

UPFA Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigamage today said 15 UNP Parliamentarians had agreed to join them to form a UPFA Government.

Addressing a news briefing in Galle, he said the people’s mandate is with the Joint Opposition now.

“The UPFA and JO working together is not a strange thing. We are the same team which stayed separated for two and a half years. Both sides have agreed to work together for another two and a half years without any privilege or deal. The UNP is incapable of establishing a government on its own,” he said.

He said if the UPFA governed the country well, it could achieve a two thirds majority at the upcoming General Election.

“If we contest the General Election separately, we won’t get anything. Even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa told us to leave the UNP. We went nowhere after maintaining a government for two and a half years with the UNP. Therefore, we will form a UPFA government,” he said. (Sumathipala Deeyagahage and D. G. Sugathapala)
