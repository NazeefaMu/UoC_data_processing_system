The Wild Life Conservation Department and the Army today chased out a herd of deer numbering fifteen at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) runways, a Wildlife sanctuary office of Hambantota.

However, sources said that nearly 100 deer were seen within the air port premises even on the runway on a regular basis.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Range Forest Officer of the Sanctuary Office of Hambantota Vijaya Kumara said the herd of deer numbering 15 had came to the runaway yesterday and they had taken steps to chase away the herd, though the they used to roam the airport premises for a long time.

“We suppose that this herd of deer used to stay in the airport premises, since the period of airport constructions. Perhaps this herd gets fenced in here, while building the mesh fence around the airport premises,” Mr. Kumara said.

He said the number of deer in this herd had increased within around three years and now it had become a large herd of 100.

When the Daily Mirror tried to contact the Duty Officer of the airport, the officials said he was busy with a meeting for the third anniversary preparations of the airport, which falls on March 18. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
