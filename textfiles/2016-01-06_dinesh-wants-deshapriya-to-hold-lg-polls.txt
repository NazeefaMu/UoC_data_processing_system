The Joint Opposition today urged the Chairman of the Independent Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya to announce on March 31 the holding of the elections for Local Government (LG) bodies as scheduled.
Joint Opposition Leader UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardane said since Commissioner Deshapriya was heading an Independent Elections Commission, he should have no obstacle to declare the holding of the election as scheduled.
“The Independent Commission was appointed not to follow the decisions of the government, but to execute the Elections Act. The Elections Chief has no pressure from any Parliamentarian or the government, when carrying out the Elections Act,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
