Pararajasingham’s murder
CID arrests Pilleyan

The CID arrested former Chief Minister of the Eastern Province Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan over former parliamentarian Joseph Pararajasingham’s murder.
The former Chief Minister who was summoned, arrived at the CID at 5.25 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by his lawyer.
Meanwhile, a group of CID officers left for Batticaloa on Saturday night to question Pilleyan over Pararajasingham’s murder.
However, the family members of the former Chief Minister informed the CID officers he was not home.
But the CID officers’ suspicions grew as they spotted Chandrakanthan’s vehicle at his personal residence in Batticaloa.
As a result, the CID deployed a phalanx of officers around the house of the former Chief Minister, an ex-stalwart of the LTTE.
The CID had also visited Chandrakanthan’s brother’s house in Batticaloa on Saturday night, in search of the ex-Chief Minister.
As the initial attempt to question Chandrakanthan failed, the CID told his family members to inform the former Chief Minister to be present at the CID yesterday at 5.00 p.m.
The CID on Thursday arrested two suspects in connection with the murder of former TNA Parliamentarian who was shot dead at St. Mary’s Cathedral Church in Batticaloa, while attending Christmas prayers on December 25, 2005 morning.
It has now been established that two suspects were members of the TMVP, with one even serving as an Urban Council member of the party, at one point.
The two suspects are former Battcicaloa Municipal Council member Edwin Silva Krishnanandaraja alias Pradeep Master and Rangasami kanaganayagam alias ‘Gajan Mama’.
The TMVP, formed by former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan alias Karuna, was taken over by Chandrakanthan in 2008.
