“The Goyo philosophy is driven by the passion for healthy and meaningful living. The product is available islandwide and caters to all. The idea is to bring more people into an active lifestyle and reward them for being active,” said General Manager Information Technology Digital and New Markets Harsha Senanayake. 


Sampath credit cardholders are eligible for a 15 percent discount when purchasing a Goyo fitness tracker and also receive an attractive six-month interest-free instalment plan.  Recognized as the responsible choice, SampathCards continues to transcend industry norms to offer its cardholders an unmatched range of benefits and value-added services to enhance their diverse lifestyles. The partnership with Goyo expands Sampath credit cards contribution towards positive healthcare in Sri Lanka. The promotion is valid until end-November. Goyo, as the nation’s first homegrown fitness app with an attractive eco partner wellness platform, encourages all Sri Lankans to ‘FIT Wenna SET Wenna’ promoting a localised sustainable shift towards a healthier and fulfilling lifestyle. 


Unlike other fitness trackers and wellness platforms products available in the local market, the Goyo wearable fitness device operates in sync with the app, designed with distinctive features for the everyday Sri Lankan. The app functions as a personal health advisor monitoring customer’s sleep patterns and their different phases of sleep, calculates average resting heart rate, measures calorie burning, distance walked and step count, all on a periodic basis helping the user track and monitor their progress. 


The app motivates users to participate, compete in challenges and receive fantastic rewards. The localised challenges are uniquely built with a Sri Lankan flavour such as walking the distance equivalent to two rounds of the Kandy Lake (6.4 kilometres), which is named as the ‘Kandy Tracker’ or walking the distance of the Katunayake Highway (3.5 kilometres) named the ‘Katunayake Stroller’.  Additionally, the Goyo app enables customers to stay up to-date on their performance, accumulate attractive localised badges by completing various fitness levels and view their personal stats to create interest and engagement among users. 


Goyo’s partner ecosystem offers ‘instant rewards’ as well as ‘challenge rewards’ with fantastic partner offers. As a partner in Goyo’s ecosystem, Union Assurance offers an amazing instant reward of Rs.1 million accidental death benefit cover and Rs.90,000 accidental hospitalisation cover with all Goyo purchases.


Additionally, a range of discounts and many exciting rewards from renowned national brands such as Rum Punch, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts, Cinnamon Air, Elephant House, Bodé Activ, Chamathka Jewellers, Vitawell, CDEM, Vision Care, etc. are featured in its localised partner ecosystem.


While providing locals an extremely affordable wellness platform, Goyo also understands it needs to go a step further to help people get healthy. 


Categorized into restaurants, clothing stores, sports items and multiple services, etc. customers who complete specific challenges during a set duration are eligible to win incredible rewards from Goyo partners. Goyo is also in the process of expanding its partner portfolio with more exciting and well-loved brands to suit customers’ lifestyle requirements.
