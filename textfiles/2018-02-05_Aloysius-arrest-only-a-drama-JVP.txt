Aloysius' arrest only a drama: JVP


	



The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the arrest of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius was a plan hatched to serve a political agenda.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said it was clear that Mr. Aloysius was prepared for his arrest because he was dressed in a white shirt and tie at the time.

“This arrest is just another episode in the drama. Aloysius and his wife were seen well-dressed at the time of the arrest. When an ordinary person is arrested, he is taken away as he is,” he said.

Mr. Dissanayake said action against fraudsters was being expedited on the eve of the election to achieve political objectives and not as a means of preventing fraud and corruption. (Ajith Siriwardana)
