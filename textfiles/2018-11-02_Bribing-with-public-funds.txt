Bribing with public funds!


	



 

A political bigwig of a major council, whose term has now expired, had distributed the council’s left-over funds to minor councils headed by politicos, who had pledged to support him to return to the high office for another term.

 


The political bigwig had also taken the heads of the fund-recipient – local bodies on a picnic to a holiday resort in the central hills to celebrate the event, they say.


“Disburse the monies the way you want and remember to help me at the correct time,” had been the provincial bigwig’s parting request, they say.
Meanwhile, heads of some local bodies had complained to higher authorities about being denied a share of the council’s left-over funds.
