MDMK general secretary Vaiko and his followers along with traders union leader T.Vellaiyan were arrested on Saturday when they attempted to besiege the deputy high commission of Sri Lanka in Chennai opposing a resolution in the UN Human Rights Council seeking more time for the island nation to probe the war crimes during the military offensive in 2009.

Addressing the protesters, Vaiko said the United States would bring a resolution giving two more years for Sri Lanka to hold an inquiry into the war crimes and the resolution also says that no international jurists could enter the island nation without the latter’s consent.

The new resolution will bury justice  for Tamils at the United Nations since a resolution asking Lanka to carry out an international, independent investigation was passed in the UNHRC in 2015, MDMK general secretary Vaiko said.(Deccan Chronicle)
