Union Bank recently announced the launch of Union Bank Invest Plus, a systematic investment plan designed to reward the commitment of prudent savers who are willing to save on a continuous basis; with a vision to make their dreams and goals a reality.  


Union Bank Invest Plus is the latest pragmatic addition to the range of personal financial solutions offered by Union Bank, in a view to bring their customers an enhanced banking experience coupled with optimum financial returns.  


Commenting on the latest retail banking proposition, Vice President-Retail Banking at Union Bank, Chaya Jayawardena said, “Union Bank Invest Plus is designed to help our clients plan better for their future and support them in the pursuits of their life’s goals and dreams. With a Union Bank Invest Plus an individual will have the power to decide how much to save monthly in order to reach their desired future goal and will also know exactly within how many years that dream could be realised. 
“This would make planning for the future much easier for our clients - be it for higher education for a child, starting a business of their own, or even building a sound retirement fund. This proposition will cater to the future financial needs of people from diverse walks of life, helping them to follow a disciplined savings routine while rewarding their future selves with the best returns.” 


Union Bank Invest Plus allows the flexibility to invest monthly or as a lump sum and the investment goals may start from as low as Rs.100,000, and span to a maximum of Rs.10 million. A minimum of 2 years’ investment tenure would apply for monthly installment plans while the lump sum plans could be spread across a minimum of 6 years. The maximum tenure for the investment may be customised according to the client’s requirement and both types of investment plans may be spread up to a maximum of 10 years.  


The bank guarantees a return of 8 percent p.a. (an annual effective rate of 8.3 percent p.a.) on the investment during the entire period. Union Bank’s Invest Plus clients may also enjoy the ease of keeping track of the progress of their investment plans via Union Bank’s Online Banking facility offered free of charge, giving them better control and access to their valued investments with the bank.  


A Union Bank Invest Plus plan can be opened at any of the 65 Union Bank branches island-wide.  More information on Union Bank Invest Plus or any other financial proposition offered by Union Bank can be obtained via the bank’s 24-hour customer service hotline by dialing 011 5800 800 or by visiting the banks website via www.unionb.com.
