Lack of morality leads to disaster


	

“He is truly virtuous, wise and righteous, who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another (does any wrong), who does not crave for sons, wealth, power, or kingdom, and does not desire his own success by unjust means.”
 

 



 

Moral behaviour and virtuous conduct are very significant aspects which are highly appreciated in the teaching of the Buddha. Lack of morality and respect leads people to form a fearful, dreadful and distressing society. Disparity between human beings and animals is the moral conduct and discipline. Sometimes, we meet well-trained and well-tamed animals better than some immoral and nefarious individuals in our society. Domestic violence, intimidation, threat, cyber bullying, sexual harassment and assault, abuse and violence are abundant and numbers are escalating due to the lack of virtuous conduct and respect for others. 

Vajji, the capital of Vaishali, was a very prosperous city in ancient India. People in the state of Vesali, Vajjians were the well-cultured and well-mannered individuals who have been praised and appreciated by the Blessed One. Unfortunately that reputation and dignity have drastically disappeared nowadays. Now it is history and only remains in books. Back then, men have protected and respected all females in the state of Vesali and Buddha once mentioned that it was one of the seven principles for their prosperity, but now that peaceful and honourable society have dreadfully changed everywhere in the world. Although we boast about our history and culture, the whole society has become topsy-turvy. 

 


The five precepts (Pancasila) constitute the most fundamental moral code  taught by the Blessed One: abstaining from killing, stealing or taking  what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech and the use of  intoxicants


 

Multitudes of people destructively criticize and blame innovative digital devices, social media, proliferation of multifaceted apparatus and information superhighway, but I personally believe that lack of self-management and discipline and the failure of moral development are the prime factors which create multifarious conflicts and disasters in our society today. 

Fear, anxiety, terror, distress, tension, agitation, worry and nervousness are the main burdens and tribulations. If one’s moral conduct is positively matured, one gives fearlessness, kindness, compassion and respect not only to the immediate family but also to the whole society. 

Virtuous behaviour is cultivated by undertaking precepts and acting in accordance with the ten meritorious deeds. The five precepts (Pancasila) constitute the most fundamental moral code taught by the Blessed One: abstaining from killing, stealing or taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech and the use of intoxicants. 

If someone honestly follows and doesn’t violate the precepts, he or she is regarded as a virtuous person. 

 

“What, monks, is accomplishment in virtuous behaviour? Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called accomplishment in virtuous behaviour.”

(The Buddha-AN) 

 

 

“All tremble at violence, all fear death.
Putting oneself in the place of another,
One should not kill nor cause another to kill.”
“One who, while himself seeking happiness oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness, will not attain happiness hereafter.”
“Blessed is virtue until life’s end;
Blessed is faith that is steadfast;
Blessed is the acquisition of wisdom;
And blessed is the avoidance of evil.”

(Dhammapada) 

 

 

The foundation of moral conduct should be commenced from childhood. Parenting is not just a giving birth. It is a very big responsibility and a huge commitment. As parents, they should offer a well-disciplined, well-cultured and well-mannered citizen to the society. That person should not be hurtful, harmful and fearful for the humanity and to other beings. Therefore, the duties and responsibilities of parents are very crucial. 

Twenty-six centuries ago, the Buddha compassionately emphasised very important duties which should be performed by parents towards their children. These duties mould and lead a child towards a successful, happy and peaceful life. Parents are designated as ‘First Teachers’ by the Blessed One. Their paramount duties include teaching children what is wholesome and unwholesome. 

 


Multitudes of people destructively criticize and blame innovative digital devices, social media, proliferation of multifaceted apparatus and information superhighway, but I personally believe that lack of self-management and discipline and the failure of moral development are the prime factors which create multifarious conflicts and disasters in our society today


 

In a special discourse in our Pali canon ‘Sigalovada Sutta’ -- Advice to the Son of Householder Sigala, the Perfectly Enlightened One -- Lord Buddha remarkably elaborated wonderful duties and responsibilities which should be performed towards all members in our human society. 

Parents duties as follows: 

Dissuading and discouraging from evil or unwholesome behaviour 
Teaching them moral values 
Giving them a good education and training them in a profession 
Helping them to make a good and happy marriage 
Letting them inherit the family wealth at a proper time. 

If you ignore and neglect the first two duties, the consequences will be dangerous and disastrous. Unfortunately, most parents exclusively concentrate on better education and paper qualification. Most of them are infatuated and hypnotized in materialistic commercial culture. They are entangled in the network of craving and selfishness. The behaviour and exemplary lives of parents, school and religious teachers or clergy and proper advice are very important to influence the child. If these eminent individuals are poor in these qualities and moral values, what can we expect from our young generation? 

Unfortunately, crime rates are very high and increasing on a daily basis. If one undertakes the five precepts and lead one’s life without violating them, that person gives freedom to others to live without fear and terror. 

We should educate our children on the danger and consequences of wrongdoing and unwholesome activities. Numerous evidence, testimonies and stories are apparent and conspicuous in printed and digital media. This makes us aware that lack of morality horrendously leads to disaster. 

 


Parenting is not just a giving birth. It is a very big responsibility  and a huge commitment. As parents, they should offer a well-disciplined,  well-cultured and well-mannered citizen to the society 


 

As a nation, in terms of leaders and leadership, we cannot be proud of ourselves. Our leaders and their henchmen are corrupted. In terms of moral conduct and values, they have failed miserably. As a nation, we utterly failed to select and elect a true leader to govern the country. 

Hope that educated and wise young people will find a suitable and righteous person who respects the rule of law and order to govern the country to make it disciplined. 

“He is truly virtuous, wise and righteous, who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another (does any wrong), who does not crave for sons, wealth, power, or kingdom, and does not desire his own success by unjust means.”(Dhammapada)
