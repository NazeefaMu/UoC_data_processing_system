Can’t support VoA: JVP


	

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Bimal Ratnayake said in parliament today that they were not in a position to support the Vote on Account (VOA).

He said the VoA seemed like a mini-budget which was presented to carry out the ‘same old agenda’ of the United National Party rather than a VoA which would pay government workers their salaries.
