The current dry spell experienced in the country is a result of the EL Nino phenomenon, the Department of Meteorology said yesterday.

A duty forecaster from the Department told the Daily Mirror that the dry weather normally prevailed at this time of the year brought on by the dry winds which blows from the North but said it had intensified this year as a result of the El Nino.

El Niño is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino is the “warm phase” of a larger phenomenon called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation

The department said there had been no rainfall in any part of the country during the past few days.

The temperature in most parts of the country was high with the highest temperature of 35.5c degrees reported from Colombo and 35.4c degrees reported from Katunayake while the temperatures in Hambantota, Kurunegala, Ratnapura and Ratmalana were more than 33c degrees.

However it was predicted that some rains could be expected during the weekend. Rains are specifically forecast in the Eastern and Uva provinces. (Yohan Perera)
