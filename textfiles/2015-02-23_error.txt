The CID had informed the court today that former Minister and National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa has also altered his original date of birth.
Though he was born on March 7, 1965, he had changed it to March 7, 1970 as his date of birth, the Police said.
His wife, Shashi Weerawansa was yesterday arrested on charges of changing her date of birth as well. Mrs. Weerawansa is said to have altered her DoB by four years.
CID officials said that the couple had done this with the intention of including it into their children’s birth certificates. (Manopriya Gunasekara)
