Will he get a dressing down?


	



 

A powerful purohita in yahapalanaya on an official visit to a country considered a leading world power made a speech that made headlines in the world Press.

 


The purohita in the course of his speech explained his government’s take on several national issues with international ramifications. However, it transpired that certain things he said ran counter to what a very high authority in yahapalanaya had earlier said while outlining the policy matters of his government. This had led to international media pointing out that comments the purohita had made contradicted the official stand of the government on related matters. 

 

Later several big guns in the government had brought to the notice of the highest authority of the gaffe that the purohita had made during his much publicized speech abroad. 


The purohita is due to get a dressing down soon for the embarrassment caused to the yahapalanaya, they say.
