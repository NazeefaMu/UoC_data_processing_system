Poor response to call against poison


	



 

The well- known Diyawanna member monk had the other day  extended an open invitation to all member colleagues to attend a meeting to discuss the struggle he proposed to launch against the move to relax the ban on the glyphosate weedicide.

 


He had walked into the committee room at Diyawanna complex where the meeting was to be held on time to find to his dismay that only four members had turned up to raise their voice against the practice of using poisonous substances in the agricultural and plantation sectors.  Highly disappointed, the monk had cancelled the meeting saying that if the majority were in favour of the use of poison, there was no purpose in launching a struggle against it.
