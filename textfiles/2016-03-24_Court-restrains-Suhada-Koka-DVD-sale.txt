The Colombo District Court today restrained till April 7 the printing and selling of DVD copies of the popular comedy film 'Suhada Koka'.

Court made this order on film producer Sunil T. Fernando considering the submissions of the petitioner's counsel and perusing the documents filed by the DVD film's present patent right owner Rukman Samanpriya of Ja- Ela.

Counsel Shabdika Wellapuli appearing with Kelum Maitreepala for the petitioner said the petitioner had purchased the patent right to produce and sell DVD copies of the film “Suhada Koka “ from its former owner one Raj who had purchased the patent right from Ravindra Guruge.

The Counsel said Ravindra Guruge had purchased the patent right from the producer of the film Sunil T. Fernando.

However Sunil T. Fernando after transferring the patent right to a second party was now attempting to print DVD copies of the film for commercial purposes.

The Counsel contended that if the defendant printed and distributed copies of the film, it would cause an irreparable loss to the plaintiff. (T.Farook Thajudeen)
