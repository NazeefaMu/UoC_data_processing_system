	The No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should be debated immediately if UNP was not afraid of it and had confidence to defeat it, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa challenged today.

He said if the government was requesting a special date in Parliament to make decisions on the Constitutional Council, it should also request for a day for the debate on No-Confidence Motion against the Premier. 
“We also urge the Speaker to allow the debate on No-Confidence Motion without delay, hopefully on Tuesday (9) or during this week. Moving for other Parliamentary affairs ignoring the No-Confidence Motion is not appropriate. The government had neglected the faith put in by people who voted for it and that is why the government is facing this motion today,” Mr. Weerawansa told a news conference held at Abhayaramaya in Colombo.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
