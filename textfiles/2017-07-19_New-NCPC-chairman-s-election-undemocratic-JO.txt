Claiming it was unlawful to present a no-confidence motion against North Central Provincial Council (NCPC) Chairman T.M.R. Siripala, joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said yesterday said the procedure adopted to elect the new chairman was undemocratic.

He said they were utterly disgusted with the tense situation that prevailed in the NCPC and have no hesitation to go to court against those who misbehaved and violated the agenda of the council's constitution.

"It is unlawful to present a no-confidence motion against NCPC Chairman T.M.R. Siripala of the UPFA as he had not violated the constitution nor had was he involved in wrongful activities. Therefore, we urge the President to look into this matter and conduct an investigation to see that democracy was upheld in the Council," the MP said.

He also claimed that the government was attempting to sell the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company, in the wake of the appointment of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority's new Chairman Parakrama Dissanayake.

"Mr. Dissanayake is the chief negotiator in the sale of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company. He is not an independent figure representing the SLPA. Therefore, action needs to be taken to find a solution to this, as it is a national resource which is being sold to a foreign company," the MP said.

Meanwhile, LSSP leader Tissa Vitharana said the government had not taken over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital on a policy decision.

"Even when the Sri Lanka Medical Council has not approved this hospital, the government tries to provide services to the people. We urge the government to be serious on this issue and ensure the quality standard of the hospital without putting the people into difficulty, " he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
