“The ‘paththuwa’ has a therapeutic effect that helps the merging of the broken bones by inducing calcium production and also heals damaged blood vessels,”- Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani, Senior Medical Officer, CMC


Sticks and stones can break your bones. But there are so many other ways to fracture your bones. It’s no pleasant experience at all. In fact it is very painful. Ayurveda is a very well-known form of alternative medicine when it comes to treating fractures in Sri Lanka. Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani, Senior Medical Officer, CMC, who serves in the Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre at Kollupitiya (Colombo 3) provided an insight into the treatment of fractures through Ayurveda.   

 

What is a fracture?   
Simply, a fracture is a break in the bone. According to Dr. Tharangani, a fracture can be classified under 2 types. They are simple fractures and compound fractures. “A simple fracture is when a bone breaks into two but does not pierce the skin. During such a fracture the bone is not exposed to the air. But a compound fracture is a more serious condition. In a compound fracture, the break in the bone causes the bone to pierce through the skin and protrude. There are multi-fractures also where bones are broken in several places,” said Dr. Tharangani.   

 

How serious are fractures?   
The severity of the fracture depends on the force that causes the injury. Regardless whether the fracture is mild or severe, it is painful. However Dr. Tharangani stated that simple fractures are treatable through Ayurveda. She said that the bone can be restored to the normal conditions 100%. But the medical officer also accentuated that compound fractures are severe. “Compound fractures are surgical conditions which require surgery and I do not recommend Ayurveda treatment for compound fractures. We as doctors, be it Ayurvedic or otherwise, look into the best interests of the patient because a patient’s life is very valuable. As an Ayurvedic doctor I strongly advise against Ayurvedic treatments for patients with compound fractures. Ayurveda is inappropriate for compound fracture and multi-fracture treatments,” she explained. 

 

 
Causes for fractures   
“Fractures can occur through traumatic incidents. Injuries during sports, accidents associated with vehicles and falls are listed as traumatic incidents. When a patient suffers from ailments such as osteoporosis, the bones weaken. This gives way to fractures easily despite the fall or accident being a minor one. This is common among the elderly who suffer from weakened bones,” stated Dr. Tharangani.   

 



Dos and Don’ts   
When a person experiences a fall or is involved in an incident this may cause an injury. The injury could be a sprain, a tear or a fracture. The condition could be any of the above. While fractures are deciphered by an excruciating pain that could even cause the collapse of the patient, tears and sprains are also painful. These conditions are often misunderstood. So it is strongly advised that the patient immediately seeks medical attention. If the patient mistakes a fracture for a sprain and tries to self-treat it, the condition would worsen. Some patients use the aid of an ice pack to reduce pain. Even this is inappropriate. Dr. Tharangani explained the steps that have to be taken after the injury. “In Ayurveda, we strongly advise against the use of an ice pack following a fracture as we believe it could cause blood clots and muscle tightening and aggravate the condition of the patient. Don’t move the injured area at all. Tie the place of injury with a cloth and bring the patient for medical treatment immediately,” she advised. Upon consultation with the patient, an X-ray is prescribed. Depending on the X-ray, the condition of the injury is diagnosed and if it is a simple fracture, it is treated through Ayurveda. In the case of a multi-fracture, Ayurvedic treatment is inappropriate as it demands surgical treatment.   

 

The procedures   
A Plaster of Paris cast is your usual fracture first aid. But in Ayurveda, first aid treatment is different. Dr. Tharangani explained the procedure. “The bones are set into place after oils are applied to the injured area. It is then sustained with wooden splinters and a ‘paththuwa’,” she said. The word ‘paththuwa’ is often heard in Ayurveda. The Ayurvedic doctor explained that a ‘paththuwa’ is an Ayurvedic paste. It is made using all sorts of herbs by boiling them. These contents are then mixed and ground into a paste. “The ‘paththuwa’ has a therapeutic effect that helps the merging of the broken bones by inducing calcium production and also heals damaged blood vessels. The herbs used in the paste vary according to the patient and the fracture condition,”she explained. 


“When patients keep their injury part of the body immobilized, they will experience stiffness in the joints. So we provide physiotherapy by teaching the patient small exercises, so as to avoid stiffness in the injured area,” she added.   


“It is important not to wet the injured area after receiving treatment. If the fracture is wrapped up with just a ‘paththuwa’, we usually instruct the patient to wash the injured area with hot water prior to the next consultation. If the fracture is wrapped up with wooden splinters, patients should never remove them. It is something that only the doctor should do,” Dr. Tharangani affirmed.   

 

Fracture frequency   
On inquiry, Dr. Tharangani stated that the amount of fracture injuries has increased substantially. “With the onset of the rains, the number of patients with fractures arriving at the Ayurveda Centre has increased. An increase is seen especially in Colombo city limits. The elderly and small people form the majority among these patients. It is usually simple fractures that are very common in Sri Lanka. Compound fractures occur very rarely and that too during very severe accidents,”she said.
