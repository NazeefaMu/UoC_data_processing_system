President Maithripala Sirisena today appointed a nine-member committee headed by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva to implement the government’s proposals made regarding SAITM.

Previously, the Presidential Committee on SAITM which was also headed by the Deputy Minister compiled a report which included proposals to address the SAITM issue.

The Committee in its final report proposed to abolish the management and the shareholding of SAITM.

Based on the proposals, the government announced that the medical faculty of the SAITM would be abolished and the assets, liabilities, staff and the students of the medical college would be entrusted to a new non-governmental and not for profit degree awarding institution.     

The President also appointed three observers to the Committee, one of which would be filled by the GMOA.
