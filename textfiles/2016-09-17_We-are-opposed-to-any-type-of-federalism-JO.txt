We are opposed to any type of federalism: JO


	

In the wake of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga calling for a Federal and Quasi-Secular Constitution for Sri Lanka, the joint opposition (JO) said it was totally opposed to ‘Federalism’ as a means to resolving the national question.

JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday they met to discuss the issues concerning the country at large.

He said the JO had noted the statements made by Ms. Kumaratunga call for a Federal and Quasi-Secular Constitution for Sri Lanka.

“Federalism will result in the disintegration and partition of the country,” the MP said and added that the JO stood for a unitary constitution.

Ms. Kumaratunga said at a recent function that Federalism as concept had been accepted in several countries and there was no need to be frightened about it. (Kelum Bandara)
