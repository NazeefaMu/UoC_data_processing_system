‘Star Wars’ hits $2 billion global sales

 
US: Star Wars: The Force Awakens has soared to the $2 billion mark in global ticket sales, Disney announced Sunday, as the movie landed in fourth place at the North American box office, behind “Kung Fu Panda 3” in the top spot.
The latest Star Wars franchise movie became only the third film ever to reach the $2 billion mark, and is only the second to do so in a first release, Disney said in a statement.
It also set a domestic record with $900 million in ticket sales on Wednesday, making it “the only film in history to reach this milestone,” Disney reported.
Weekend estimates showed that it would rake in $6.9 million Friday through Sunday for a grand total of $906 million since its debut last year.
DreamWorks’ computer-animated Kung Fu Panda comedy -- the third installment in the franchise -- meanwhile earned some $21 million in its second weekend out, industry tracker Exhibitor Relations predicted. Following the adventures of Po as he evolves from martial arts student to teacher, the US-Chinese production features the voices of stars Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Angelina Jolie.
The celebrity-studded Coen Brothers’ Hail, Caesar! a 1950s kidnap caper about a Hollywood fixer trying to keep a studio’s stars under thumb, debuted in second place with $11.4 million.
