The interim order issued directing the Controller of Immigration and Emigration preventing LTTE’s former arms procurer Kumaran Pathmanathan (KP) from leaving the country, was extended till December 16 by the Appeals Court today.

The Court made this order consequent to a writ petition filed by JVP MP Vijitha Herath who sought an order to institute legal proceedings against KP who was appointed as LTTE leader in 2009.

The petition was fixed for support on December 15. (S. Selvanayagam)
