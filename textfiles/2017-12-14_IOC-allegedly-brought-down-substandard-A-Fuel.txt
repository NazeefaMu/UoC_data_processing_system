The Indian Oil Company (IOC) imported a stock of 14,000 metric tonnes of substandard aviation fuel into the country on Monday (11), the Petroleum Trade Union Alliance claimed yesterday.

According to Alliance spokesman Bandula Saman Kumara the oil-tanker "Meadows’ had reached Sri Lankan waters carrying “Jet A1” Aviation fuel which was later found to be of low-quality as it failed the first quality test carried out by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).

He said despite the recent bitter experiences of suffering a fuel shortage, blamed on the IOC, the government has not leant its lesson.

Mr. Kumara said the fuel samples would be re-tested for the second day running today.

He also said the ministry had imported the aviation fuel through the IOC ignoring tender protocols and said severe consequences could arise in future if the tender is awarded to the Indian company.

When contacted IOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra said he was not in the country and was therefore not aware of such an issue.

Meanwhile speaking on the matter Alliance Convener D. G . Rajakaruna said that the country has the storage facilities for all types of fuel for upto 14 days.

As such he said talks on leasing out the oil tanks in China Bay, Trincomalee should be put on hold and the CPC should have the right refuse such an agreement put forward by the IOC. Petroleum trade unions will meet on December 20 to decide on what action to take in order to stop such an agreement being signed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
