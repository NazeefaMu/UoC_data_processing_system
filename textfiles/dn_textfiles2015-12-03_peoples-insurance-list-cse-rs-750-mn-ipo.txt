People's Insurance to list on CSE via Rs. 750 mn IPO

People's Insurance Limited ('People's Insurance'), a fully-owned subsidiary of People's Leasing & Finance PLC, has received in-principal approval for its Initial Public Offering ('IPO') from the Colombo Stock Exchange ('CSE').
The IPO is scheduled to open on December 16, 2015 and is expected to raise Rs. 750 million by offering 50 million ordinary shares of the Company at Rs. 15 per share.
People's Insurance will be the first general insurance company in Sri Lanka to adhere to the new listing requirement under the amended RII Act.
People's Insurance expects to utilise the proceeds of the IPO to further strengthen its equity base and thereby the Capital Adequacy Ratio under the Risk Based Capital regime to be implemented by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka effective from 2016.
Jehan Amaratunga, Chairman of People's Insurance while unveiling the IPO said that People's Insurance which commenced operations in 2010 has achieved unprecedented success within a very short period of time.
"We believe that broad basing the ownership through an IPO will definitely be a significant milestone in the Company's journey, and it will further strengthen our identity and increase visibility amongst the public."
Applications for the IPO are now open and prospective investors could obtain a copy of the Prospectus and Application Forms through all stockbrokers, all branches of People's Leasing & Finance PLC and People's Insurance Limited, selected branches of People's Bank and the Joint Financial Advisors and Managers to the Issue.
People's Insurance is one of the leading general (non-life) insurance providers in Sri Lanka, and is ranked fifth in terms of premium income in the industry.
