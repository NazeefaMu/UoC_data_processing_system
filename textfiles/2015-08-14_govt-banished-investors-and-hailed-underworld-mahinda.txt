Govt. banished investors and hailed underworld: Mahinda


	

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is contesting Monday's parliamentary elections from the Kurunegala District today alleged the government banished foreign investors including those from India and China and had welcomed underworld figures instead.
Addressing the UPFA election rally in Kurunegala, he said people who were responsible for unleashing underworld tactics were involved in the present government.
“There was an infamous underworld figure called Gonawala Sunil, who raped a 16-year-old girl and went to jail. However, he was released two days after he went to jail and was also awarded with a Justice of Peace post. People behind these moves are today advising us,” he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa said both the UPFA and SLFP had been well persevered and grown because of the action taken by the General Secretaries of the UPFA and SLFP, Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
He said he would not leave Kurunegala which he is contesting from instead of his home town and said Wayamba (North Western Province) had made him alive. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
