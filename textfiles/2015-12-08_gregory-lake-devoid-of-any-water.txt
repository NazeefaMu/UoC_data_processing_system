Gregory Lake in Nuwara Eliya, a major tourist attraction, is being dredged for the purpose of renovating it after 146 years.  Nuwara Eliya Mayor Mahinda Dodampe said the renovation was essential because of the risk to the lake’s sluice gate.  He said the renovations would be completed within two weeks.  Pix by Ranjith Rajapaksha
