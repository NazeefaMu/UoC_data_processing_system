Experts from China were expected to arrive on Saturday (5) to examine the Original Equipment Mechanism (OEM) due to the temporary repair of the power terminal at the Norochcholai power plant, the Director (Development), Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy Sulakshana Jayawardena said.


“Out of the three electricity generation units operated at the power plant, the third unit which would generate 3,000 MW had failed,” he said.


“While the generation unit is being repaired, inspectors from China will examine further as to see that it is properly repaired and appropriate to use for power generation,” he said.


"It is a challenge to generate electricity however the available generation is adequate to function without power cuts," he added.
