Contracts of locomotive drivers and guards to be terminated


	

All contract-based locomotive drivers and railway guards who would fail to report to work today will be considered as having vacated their posts, Railways Superintendent Wijaya Samarasinghe said today.

Though the train schedule had been affected due to the strike, several trains would be operated today for the convenience of the commuters, Mr. Samarasinghe said.

Railway Guards’ Association yesterday said their guards and drivers would refrain from their services today against the SAITM and to oppose the government’s alleged proposal to remove the pension scheme. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
