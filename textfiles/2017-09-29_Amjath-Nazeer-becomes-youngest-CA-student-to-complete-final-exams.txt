Amjath Nazeer, a 20-year-old, created history recently when he became the youngest ever student to complete the final exams, including the case study at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka). 


Nazeer joined CA Sri Lanka in 2013 to commence his career as a chartered accountant. He completed all CA examinations as well as the case study this year and is currently serving at SJMS Associates, which is an affiliate member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. He also carried out his practical training at SJMS Associates from 2014 to 2017 as an Audit Associate. 


Nazeer, who aspires to be a Chief Executive Officer, credits his dedication and hard work, which helped him reach this important milestone at such a young age. He also appreciated the continuing guidance from his parents, which helped him achieve this unique landmark in his life.  


Nazeer said that it was important to have confidence in one’s capabilities, if one was to achieve success in life. He also expressed his appreciation to his Supervising Partner and the managers he worked under who helped him and guided him through the early years of his practical training at SJMS Associates.


Nazeer had his early education at Amal International School and thereafter proceeded to Saudi Arabia with his family and studied at the Indian International School for two years. On his return, he joined Royal Institute and after his London Ordinary Level examination, he completed the exams of the Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT) within a year and then joined CA Sri Lanka to pursue a career as a chartered accountant.
