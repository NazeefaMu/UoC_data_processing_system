	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had told party leaders of the UPFA last night that he was willing to hand over the Chairmanship of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to President Maithripala Sirisena.
	However, NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa, Provincial Councilor Udaya Gammanpila and several others had reportedly asked former President not to resign from the post.
	Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga is to announce a decision taken at yesterday’s party leaders meeting shortly.
	Meanwhile, a special meeting is to take place this afternoon between President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa at the President’s Residence at Wijerama Road in Colombo.
