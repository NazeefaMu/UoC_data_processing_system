The joint opposition with the help of Buddhist monks is hoping to collect cash donations to pay the fine imposed by the High Court on former presidential secretary Lalith Weeratunga, MP Bandula Gunawardena said yesterday.

Mr. Weeratunga was ordered to pay Rs.50 million as compensation to the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) after he was found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million of its funds to distribute 'sil redi' during the 2015 presidential election campaign.

The MP told Daily Mirror a meeting was to be held last night at Sunethradevi Pirivena in Pepiliyana to launch this programme. (Kelum Bandara)
