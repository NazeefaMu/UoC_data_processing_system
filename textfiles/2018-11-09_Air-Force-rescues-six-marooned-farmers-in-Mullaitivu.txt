The Air Force is reported to have rescued six chena cultivators, who were marooned by flood waters after a breach in the bund of the Alampil Niththakay Tank in Mullaitivu.

Air Force Spokesman Gihan Seneviratne said the rescue operation was launched on a message received from the Mullaitivu Disaster Management Centre (DMC).

“The farmers who went to guard their Chena cultivations were trapped in their tree huts because of the sudden flood in the morning,” the spokesman said.

An MI 17 helicopter was mobilised for the rescue operation.

Group Captain Gihan Seneviratne said the helicopter is still conducting search operations in the area in search of any others who might be stranded. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
