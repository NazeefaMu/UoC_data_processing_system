## Title: Ceremonial farewell to CJ 43

Ceremonial farewell to CJ 43
	
Delivering her farewell speech in front of a packed gathering of judges, lawyers, ministry officials and staff, Chief Justice 43 Shirani Bandaranayake today said that the judges who upheld the law in the wake of baseless accusations should be commended and valued the most.
In retrospect, recalling the period of the impeachment, even amidst the baseless allegations and procedural impropriety that was taking place, it was strength to witness the courage of a handful of Superior Court judges who stood firm in the face of immense pressure and adversity. It is they who, I believe, should be recognized, appreciated and elevated, she said.
Earlier, the Supreme Court had overturned a judgment by the Court of Appeal which quashed the Parliament Select Committees findings.
Our lives were in turmoil and peril. And we, as a family, encountered immeasurable harassment and suffering, she said at the ceremonial farewell, attended by all the judges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Courts of Colombo, the District Courts and the Magistrate Courts of Colombo and over a 100 judges from the outstations demonstrating their recognition of Dr. Bandaranayake.
She said her struggle was not a personal one but one aimed at maintaining the integrity of the office of the Judiciary.
I never asked to be appointed and was called to serve as a judge of the Supreme Court while I was pursuing my higher studies in the United States. I had no intention of becoming a judge. I have been bestowed with a breadth of opportunities by my country, a debt which in my 16 years of service within these hallowed walls of Justice, I have tried to repay. I believe in that period, I have done my utmost to uphold the rule of law and the independence of the Judiciary she said.
She likened the trauma-ridden two year period to serving a term of rigorous imprisonment.
Concluding her address, she said, Today is a momentous day which stands as a day in which time and nature brought about justice she said.
Making her stand, and in effect the stand of the judiciary clear on the impeachment saga, she congratulated incoming Chief Justice K. Sripavan.
I congratulate Justice Sripavan on his lawful appointment as the 44th Chief Justice of the Country she said.
Dr. Bandaranayake addressed the gathering following speeches by Attorney General YuwanjanaWijayatilake PC and Bar Association of Sri Lanka president UpulJayasuirya.
Mr. Wijayathilake understandably did not make any mention of the impeachment nor the interim period and instead spoke of Dr. Bandaranayakes academic achievements. A listener ignorant of recent history would have thought that the ceremonial farewell was in fact a routine farewell ceremony.
Mr. Jayasuriya, in keeping with his reputation for no holds barred speeches, spoke of all aspects of the impeachment and the history of the Bar Association and its quest for the independence of the judiciary.
The Bar always fought for this day and the Bar has been vindicated, he said.
Commending Dr, Bandaranayakes conduct during the past two years, he said, Your Ladyship has endured this extremely difficult period with immense courage and unfailing dignity and all of Your Ladyships actions and words during this period, despite immense pressure being brought to bear on Your Ladyship, have kept in mind the paramount need to protect the dignity of the Judiciary.
Following the speeches, the judges left the Ceremonial Court, after which lawyers and judges proceeded to the Chambers of the Chief Justice which still carried the legend, Chambers of Chief Justice Mohan Peiris, to wish the departing Chief Justice farewell, ending what could be termed the most tumultuous period in the countrys judiciary.

UK MP hopes press freedom will be boosted under new govt.
	
UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister of State for Sri Lanka, Hugo Swire, who travelled to Jaffna today, expressed optimism that press freedom will grow under the new government.
This was the ministers first visit to Jaffna. He met Chief Minister of the Northern Province, C. V. Wigneswaran and visited the British Council, a UK funded demining operation by the HALO Trust in Muhamalai, Elephant Pass and the Sabapathipillai Welfare Village.
Commenting on his visit, Swire said:
I am pleased to have visited Jaffna today. Northern Sri Lanka suffered much throughout the country's long conflict and the people there still face many challenges. This was part of the reason why Prime Minister David Cameron also prioritised visiting Jaffna when he was in Sri Lanka for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2013.
Today I saw and heard several different aspects of the Northern Province's story. With the Chief Minister I discussed reconciliation and accountability, the role of the military, the prospects for a political settlement and ways in which the UK might assist Sri Lanka. Seeing Elephant Pass was a strong reminder of how important it is that Sri Lanka should not succumb once again to conflict.
I was pleased to donate books to the Jaffna library. While there, I met journalists to discuss press freedom and the pressures journalists have faced in the recent past. The hope must be that press freedom will increase under the new Sri Lankan government.

I also visited the Sabapathipillai welfare village which David Cameron visited in 2013. Along with my team, I was pleased to gift shoes to all of the schoolchildren of the village  just in time for the new Sri Lankan school year! The welfare village remains, even nearly six years after the conclusion of the conflict. I encourage the new government of Sri Lanka to seek a long-term solution, allowing people to return, where possible, to their original land.

TN urges Modi to defer meet on SL refugees
	
Asserting that the conditions in the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka are still not conducive for the refugees to return to their native land, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on Wednesday said a meeting convened by the Union external affairs ministry to discuss the voluntary repatriation of refugees was premature and that it should be deferred.
The ministry had sent an invite to the state government recently to depute an officer to attend an inter-ministerial meeting on January 30 to discuss the issue of voluntary repatriation.
According to the Times of India, the chief minister had conveyed the state's concerns in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"The process of voluntary repatriation could be considered only after concrete and credible measures are taken by the Sri Lankan government and the Sri Lankan refugees in Tamil Nadu are given adequate verifiable assurances and gain the requisite confidence to return to their native land," the chief minister said.
A total of 3.04 lakh refugees came to Tamil Nadu in four phases since 1983. No refugees have come to India since 2013.
While 2.12 lakh refugees have gone back by their own arrangements, with government assistance and with UNHCR assistance, there are about 1.02 lakh refugees belonging to 34,524 families still in the state. Of them, 64,924 persons belonging to 19,625 families are in 107 refugee camps.
He said the recent political developments were a cause of hope and had raised expectations of reconciliation. "However, there are still apprehensions about the presence of the Sri Lankan army in Tamil areas. The atmosphere of fear, intimidation and of possible Human Rights violations has not entirely dissipated," Panneerselvam said in the letter.
"There is a concern that Tamils could be reduced to a minority even in their own traditional habitation areas," the chief minister said, pointing to internally displaced Tamils in Sri Lanka who are still living in camps.
The positive intention of the new government in Sri Lanka to ensure rehabilitation and reconciliation were yet to be translated into action which would give confidence to the Sri Lankan Tamils living outside Sri Lanka to return, the minister said.
Credible and specific reconciliation measures must be undertaken, which alone can create adequate confidence amongst the Lankan Tamil refugees to return to their native land. "Our interactions with the refugees in Tamil Nadu and through NGOs working with refugees also reinforce this conclusion," he said.
The Sri Lankan refugees are particularly concerned about the pace and manner in which the internally displaced persons within Sri Lankan are being rehabilitated.
Panneerselvam said the autonomy and democratic rights of the minority Tamil population in the country should be fully protected and they should not be subjected to further persecution and humiliation nor their second class citizenship status perpetuated.
