An inquiry is now underway into an incident where two white collar high ups had obtained a bribe of Rs.200,000 for granting the annual liquor licence for a club affiliated to a state institution. 

 


The person running this club catering mainly to media personnel is required to pay a monthly levy of Rs.38,800, but has defaulted on this payment that has run into arrears from 1995.
