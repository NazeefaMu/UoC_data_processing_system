Walker quits race with warning on Donald Trump

US: Scott Walker, a man once considered to be a true contender in the Republican primary, has not only pulled out the US Presidential race, but called on others to do the same so that the party can consolidate behind a single candidate to defeat Donald Trump.
This, he says, is not only in the best interests of the Republican Party, but of the United States.
It is also the clearest evidence yet of how fundamentally shocked the Republican Party is at the anti-establishment insurgency being led by Trump, a TV star, real estate mogul and political amateur with a history of backing Democratic causes and donating to Democratic candidates.
Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, became a Republican superstar by smashing collective bargaining rights in his home state and winning three elections on the trot against an inflamed and activist Democratic resistance.
He was one of those figures that conservative pundits were referring to when they said the Republican Party had a deep bench of strong, experienced candidates vying for the party's nomination in 2016.
As recently as April 1, he led the field of 16 Republican candidates. He bowed out shattered on Monday, after a CNN poll found he had zero per cent support after the second Republican debate last week.
"Today, I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive, conservative message can rise to the top of the field," he said, reading from a prepared statement in Wisconsin.
He called on the party to refocus on true conservative issues - small government and big military. "To refocus the debate on these types of issues will require leadership," he said. "I encourage other Republican candidates to consider doing the same [quitting the race] so that voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner. This is fundamentally important to the future of the party and, more importantly, to the future of our country."
And Walker is not the only heavyweight to quit while pointing the finger at Trump.
Last month Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, "suspended" his campaign.
"The conservative movement has always been about principles, not personalities," Perry said. "Our nominee should embody those principles. He - or she - must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity."
Like Walker, Perry has perfect Republican credentials. As governor of Texas he held unemployment down during the financial crisis and lead the 2012 campaign for an extended period before flaming out in a dismal debate performance.
At present Trump is leading the Republican race, emphasising a grab-bag of issues popular with the party's base but that are anathema to its establishment class and Wall Street backers.
Trump speaks of little but walling off Mexico and mass deportations, while major employers want more labour and the GOP establishment needs more Hispanic support.
As if that wasn't enough, he has begun advocating tax hikes for hedge-fund managers.
But for the establishment the situation is even worse.
It is not just that Trump is coming first, but that insurgents are coming second and third too. The most recent CNN poll had Trump maintaining his lead, though it had been cut from 32 per cent to 24 per cent.
Carly Fiorina - a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive - has leapt into second place, jumping from 3 per cent to 15 per cent, over Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, who dropped from 19 per cent to 14 per cent.
The establishment's candidate, Jeb Bush, who has had over US$100 million funnelled to him by Republican mega-donors, is now in fifth place with nine per cent, behind Marco Rubio, the young senator who once counted Bush as a mentor.
It is hard to know who will benefit most from Walker's absence.
He has little support to be mopped up by the remaining field of 15, but major donors who had backed him will now be considering other candidates and he has a campaign infrastructure to bequeath.
He has tacked further to the right on key issues than other mainstream GOP candidates. This suggests he might clear some space for Rubio, a clear alternative to Bush for establishment voters.
For his part Walker can return to his day job running Wisconsin with his dignity (largely) intact, lick his wounds and mull his future.
On the Democratic side the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, has had some good news.
Her lead has grown over Bernie Sanders, the socialist senator from Vermont whose campaign over the northern summer caused genuine excitement as Clinton wasted months arguing about her use of a private email server.
Clinton is backed by 42 per cent of Democratic primary voters nationally, compared to 24 per cent for Sanders, according to the CNN poll, a five-point jump since the last sample.
This is not to say that her campaign is not concerned about Sanders.
Her strategists are certain that even if he took surprise wins in the first two states to select their candidates - Iowa and New Hampshire - she would knock him out of the race in southern states where she enjoys the overwhelming support of large minority groups.
But the Clinton campaign does not want to be reduced to relying on what is now being called as her "southern firewall", because it would weaken her position in a general election.
And the Clinton team faces another threat in the popular Vice-President, Joe Biden, who still has not decided whether or not he will challenge for the nomination.
