Foreign training stints a bonanza for them


	



 

The bigwigs of the statutory body providing light to the people are said to be making visits to the land of the Dragon purportedly for training stints on a regular basis and these so-called training programmes are a veritable windfall for them, they say.

 


These bigwigs are entitled to an allowance of US$450 a day during their stay in the foreign country. In addition, each of these ‘trainees’ receive gifts worth more than one million rupees at the conclusion of their visit/training programme from the generous hosts.
