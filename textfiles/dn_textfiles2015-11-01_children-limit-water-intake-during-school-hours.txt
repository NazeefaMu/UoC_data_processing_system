Children limit water intake during school hours

Schoolchildren have limited their water intake during school hours due to the poor drinking water and sanitation maintenance facilities, said Sabaragamuwa Provincial Director of Education S. Kuruppuarachchi.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Ratnapura Samurdhi reception hall regarding the launching of the Priority for Sanitation project in Ratnapura and Kegalle districts last week.
Chief Minister Maheepala Herath presided.
The government under this project will provide Rs. 246 million to upgrade sanitation and drinking water facilities in 20 national schools and 95 provincial schools in the Ratnapura and Kegalle districts.
Kuruppuarachchi said that even though a majority of schools in the island had adequate toilet and sanitation facilities, most students had shown reluctance to use them due to their low standard of construction and lack of proper maintenance.
