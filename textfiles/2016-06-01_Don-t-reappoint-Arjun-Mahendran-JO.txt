The joint opposition has written to President Maitripala Sirisena urging him not to reappoint Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran when his current term ends.

JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane yesterday told Daily Mirror the letter was signed by him and the other party leaders of the joint opposition. He said the Governor’s tenure would end soon and he was not fit to hold the post.

The joint opposition had on earlier occasions raised matters regarding bond scam. It was also investigated by a parliamentary committee.

New Left Front leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Communist Party leader D.E.W. Gunasekara, Lanka Sama Samaja Party leader Tissa Vitharana and Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) are reported to have been the signatories to this letter. (Kelum Bandara)
