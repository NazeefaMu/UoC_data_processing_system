Foreign assistance has been a hot topic in Sri Lanka lately. Earlier Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe talked of loans taken by the previous regime to the tune of US$ 4 billion the other day and said this too had contributed to the country’s present economic crisis. However foreign assistance varies and is unique some times. Assistance given by Japan to Sri Lanka especially through Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is such a scheme of assistance. These do not involve commercial loans but only does Sri Lanka’s economy good.   

 

 

Warakapola Hospital was granted a loan worth 3,935 million Yen to develop the new ultra modern building
	JICA provided 5,151 million Yen for Greater Kandy Water Supply Project
	Japan has also pledged assistance to the new parallel Kelani Bridge which is under construction
 

According to officials of the Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka it is multifaceted. Therefore assistance comes through Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATYREPS), private public partnerships and volunteer programmes which are examples of assistance offered by Japan. 

SATYREPS is designed to promote joint research in which both Japanese research institutions and those of developing countries work together in such countries under the JICA framework technical cooperation projects based on social needs. It aims to acquire new knowledge and utilize research outcomes to the benefit of the society with a view to resolving global issues such as environment, energy conservation and disaster prevention.

Volunteer programs support activities by citizens who wish to cooperate in the economic and social development as well as reconstruction of developing countries. The first volunteer was dispatched to Sri Lanka from Japan in 1981 and there are 70 volunteers in the country currently.   

When it comes to private public partnerships it involves collaboration with the private sector.   

The assistance programs include the Warakapola hospital project where JICA developed medical facilities at Warakapola Hospital where a loan worth Yen 3,935 million is given to develop a new ultra modern building. This new building which was opened in February this year comprises modern equipment to deal with non communicable diseases such as cardio-vascular disease. As one of the fastest growing countries in the world, non communicable diseases has overtaken communicable diseases in terms of mortality and had become a major health concern in the country. Therefore the medical facilities in the new building cater to this need. District Health Director Kegalle Dr. Vijith Gunasekera said the number of beds in the hospital has been increased to 500 from 150 with the Japanese assistance. “ We now have several new facilities in the hospital including a paediatric unit, radiology unit and consultancy services” Dr. Gunasekera said.   

One of the two key initiatives implemented under the Japanese Volunteer programme is the training of baseball player undertaken by Kazuya Yagi who had developed a baseball team in S. W. R. D Bandaranaike MV in Kundasale. Yagi’s efforts have yielded results as one child from the school had been chosen for Sri Lanka’s junior team. Mr. Yagi said he hopes to create a women’s baseball team as well. Mr. Yagi speaks fluent Sinhalese. Satomi Wada who is conversant in Tamil provides training on environment protection in Vincent Girl’s High School Batticola. She demonstrated how to make compost to the children speaking in fluent Tamil.
