Joint Opposition will not participate in APC if it does not address country’s issues - Wimal

National Freedom Front Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said that members of the Joint Opposition will not participate in the All Party Conference (APC) if it does not address the issues faced by the country.
He said the Joint Opposition will participate in the APC if it has goals acceptable to all.
MP Weerawansa was participating in a media-briefing held in Colombo yesterday
“The government is facing a crisis today because several ministers are accusing each others on various matters. There has been a drastic increase in the prices of essential items in an unprecedented manner,” he said
“The burden of the cost of living has greatly affected the ordinary people,” he said.
“The people caste their vote for change at the January 8 Presidential election and January 17 General elections respectively.But, the people have already felt the change due to skyrocketing of the prices of essential commodities. They will further realize
the real change with the presentation of the budget on November 20,” Weerawansa said.
“The joint Opposition plans to take a serious measures in due course to counter this trend,” he said.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader and Colombo District UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the Geneva resolution is a clear agreement to hunt down members of the Security Forces, who defeated terrorism and also to revive terrorism.
“The government’s agreement contravenes with the Sri Lankan Constitution. European Union countries can act against Sri Lanka through this agreement. But, the Foreign Minister has already signed it. According to the Geneva agreement, there is a tendency to revise certain judicial verdicts given in the past. The TNA is also acting above and beyond the verdicts of Sri Lankan Courts,” he said.
UPFA MP Prof. G.L. Peris said the government has commenced a programme to release LTTE suspects detained under the PTA.Under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, over 12,000 LTTE ex cadres were rehabilitated.
“We did not rehabilitate and release about 235 LTTE suspects who clearly did not fit the profile for rehabilitation. The Australian Foreign Minister has been requested by TNA MP Sumanthiran to include an Australian Judge in the proposed Hybrid Court,” MP Peiris.
“The government has also invited a powerful figure of the Global Tamil Form to Sri Lankan to discuss the matter. There is a programme to repeal the PTA and other sector laws and establish Hybrid Courts with foreign judges to take action against Security Forces members,” he said.
LSSP Leader and former Minister Prof. Tissa Vitharana said that terrorism has spread its tentacles across the world and the recent attacks in France is one such example of that. “But, our valiant soldiers who helped destroy one of the most brutal terrorist groups in the world is being accused of human rights violations and if this trend continues, it will spell doom for the fight against global terrorism,”he said.
“Although this government is described as a national government, it is an entire UNP led government. The five-year development plan presented by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently in Parliament is a repetition of the Regaining Sri Lanka programme, he unveiled in 2002,” he said.
“The UNP is currently implementing the wishes of imperialists. They are now following a neo-liberal and neo-colonial economic policy. There is a huge economic breakdown. But, people are being deceived . Foreign Reserves in Sri Lanka decreased to US dollars 6.2 from US dollars 8.3. They are not enough for next seven months which is the usual norm.
The budget deficit has also gone up. Promises pledged by this government were not fulfilled. We cannot allow this to continue. How are all these promises going to be fulfilled in the future? In this situation, the government is trying to hoodwink the people by making various false promises. There are reports that the US is going to build a naval base in Trincomalee to broaden their military drive. We will oppose this move tooth and nail,” he said.
PHU leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said that meritorious activities will be held to mark the 70th birthday of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at Anuradahapura today, and we invite all Sri Lankans to attend this occasion.
“Only seven Sri Lankan Kings have unified the country previously and the former President was the eight ruler to do so. There are reports that United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Powell is coming to Sri Lanka. But this news does not appear in the US government or Sri Lankan government websites. It is a mystery as to why this visit is being undertaken so secretely,” MP Gammanpila said.
“We urge her to draft a report that is fair by both sides instead of drafting reports which are partial to the LTTE,” he said.
Communist Party Deputy Secretary and MP Chandrasiri Gajadheera said the joint opposition urges the government to establish a Truth Commission to investigate whether it delivered the promises made during the 100 day programme.
