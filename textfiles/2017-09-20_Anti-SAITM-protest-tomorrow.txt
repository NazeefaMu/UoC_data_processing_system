The education, petroleum and healthcare sectors countrywide are likely to be disrupted tomorrow because of anti-SAITM protests to be conducted by a trade union alliance led by the GMOA.

According to the GMOA, those in the ayurvedic and dental sectors including nurses are also expected to join them in a picketing campaign outside the Colombo National Hospital.

It said some 15 teacher and principal associations would go on sick leave during the day while the medical faculty lecturers and a group of university lecturers and students have threatened to boycott classes.

The GMOA said petroleum unions would picket outside the Orugodawatte and Kollonnawa Oil Refineries against the privatization of the country’s education sector.

“We urge the government to abolish SAITM and stop the move to privatize the country’s health and education,” GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen De Soysa told a news briefing today.

He said the boycott was warning to the government to resolve this matter without delay.

Ceylon Teachers' Services Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam was attempting to sabotage trade union activities. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
