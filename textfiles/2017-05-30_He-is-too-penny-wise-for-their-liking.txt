A group of white collar high-ups of an establishment connected to air traffic had a severe disappointment when their political authority was not moved out as expected when the pack was reshuffled recently. 

 


This group of white collar high-ups had made representations to the high political authorities urging that the purohita concerned be moved out as soon as they heard that a reshuffle of the top team was in the offing. 


The purohita has incurred the wrath of high-ups when he had issued strict instructions to cut down on extravagant expenditure on unnecessary foreign trips, seminars and conferences. Hence their disappointment.
