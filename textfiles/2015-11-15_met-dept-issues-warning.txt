	The Department said possibility of strong winds of 70- 80 kmph was expected across the island with the northern half of the country bearing the brunt of the change in weather.
	“Heavy showers, over 150 mm, is expected at any time of the day with cloudy skies and showers expected across the island throughout the day,” the Met Department said.
