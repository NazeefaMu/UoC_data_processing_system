The recently held Eluga Tamil demonstration in Jaffna by Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran was a result of internal competition for the TNA leadership led by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said today.

Addressing a news conference organized by the Socialist Alliance at Dr. N. M. Perera Centre, the MP said imperialistic movements were behind the Eluga Tamil demonstration.

Meanwhile, Prof. Tissa Witharana said Mr. Wigneswaran could have opted for a discussion with the TNA leadership if there were any issues without organizing an event which would provoke Tamil people.

“These moves are detrimental to the Tamils and it would only incite racism,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
