A federal judge has released the terrifying video of a gang member defendant in a racketeering trial attacking a witness with a pen, before he is shot dead by a marshal.  


The shocking footage shows the moment Siale Angilau, a member of the Tongan Crips gang, stood up, grabbed a pen or pencil, and ran towards the witness stand before launching his body over it in 2014.  


The witness, another gang member who was shackled and chained, managed to sink into the corner of the courtroom and avoid the 25-year-old.  He was not hurt.  The video then shows a deputy US Marshal, identified in court documents as Jane Doe, pull her gun from its holster and rapidly fire four shots at Angilau.The video is muzzed to keep the judge, officers and any witnesses in the courtroom from being identified.   


US District Judge John Dowdell made the video public when he dismissed a lawsuit brought by Angilau’s family claiming excessive force.
