He stirs up a hornets’ nest


	



 

Betel leaf organizers and activists in a certain electorate in Wayamba organized a party meeting recently.

 


The Betel leaf’s chief secretarial one who was present at the meeting as the chief guest emphasized the need for unity of the rank and file of the party at this grave hour and called on party members and sympathizers to sink their petty differences and rally round the current leadership. The audience greeted his speech with several rounds of applause. 


The next speaker to address the meeting was a purohita who too is a secretarial one of sorts. He held out dire consequences for those breaching the party discipline and aimed an occasional barb or two at the former Big Boss. 


As the purohita held forth attacking the disruptive elements trying to break up the party into pieces, the gathering began getting restive. An occasional interruption or a catcall gradually grew into a big din of protests and boos. In the midst of the big commotion that ensued, the purohita who was on his feet quietly faded from the scene.
