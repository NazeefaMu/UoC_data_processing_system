Drink some clean water as the first thing you do upon waking up. Drink as much as possible. This will cleanse your interior – the hormones, chemicals and toxins that have built up in body during the night. Water  helps to  flush them away.   




Do not eat so that the food overloads your stomach. Balance the amount of food you take with the volume of water you usually have after a meal. Always keep room for food and water to be mixed in your stomach. Remember that your stomach expands after a meal.   


Avoid junk. Never take much oily, deep fried, highly salted and greasy food nor artificial drinks. Always have ‘natural’ food. Eat leafy greens, fruits and vegetables, but remember to avoid highly toxic apples, oranges and grapes which are injected with chemicals for a longer shelf-life.   


Drink warm water if you are developing symptoms of a cold. Having warm water aids blood circulation and gives your body the strength to fight against invading germs. Have lukewarm water after a meal because it eases digestion. Do not drink cold water as it shrinks your stomach making digestion difficult.
