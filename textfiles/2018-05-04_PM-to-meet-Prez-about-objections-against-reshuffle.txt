Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is to meet and discuss with President Maithripala Sirisena certain objections that have been raised by UNP backbenchers on the recent reshuffle, with emphasis on the appointment of new deputy and state ministers, UNP sources said yesterday.

The sources said the UNP backbenchers had been especially critical of Syed Ali Zahir Moulana's appointment as the Deputy Minister of National Integration Reconciliation and Official Languages.

The backbenchers have expressed their dissatisfaction when they met with the Prime Minister on Wednesday (2) these sources revealed.

The meeting between the two leaders is expected to take place next week.

Another suggestion made by these UNP backbenchers was to have a successor in mind for the posts filled recently as a result of the reshuffle as recommended by the Ruwan Wijewardene committee report. This committee was appointed to look into the UNP reforms. (Yohan Perera)
