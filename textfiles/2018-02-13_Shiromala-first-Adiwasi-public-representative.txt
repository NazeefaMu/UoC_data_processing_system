For the first time in the history of governance in Sri Lanka, an Adiwasi people’s representative, who contested at the Local Government election from Dehiattakandiya has been elected from a multi-member ward in Henanigala as a member of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).

The 37-year-old W.M. Shiromala is a mother of three, who has passed G.C.E (O/L) examination. She has received 1,369 votes as the first Adiwasi people’s representative.

She said there were many unresolved problems faced by the members of her community.  

“I cannot settle all those problems but I will try my best to settle some of them,” she said.

“That is why I was elected as a representative by the members of our community and others. Therefore, I won’t breach that confidence. In the same way, my only hope is to contest at the Provincial Council and Parliamentary Elections, which are scheduled to be held in future,” she said.

“I give my fullest support for the country’s development, while protecting our religion and culture which is endangered,” she said.

The leader of Adiwasi community, Uruwarige Gunabanda said that he was elated because a lady belonging to their community had received the opportunity to resolve their problems.

“She won the hearts of the members of our community to be elected to this position. It is a pride for all the members of the community,” he said. (Text and pix by A. Piyathilaka)
