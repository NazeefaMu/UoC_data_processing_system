He was left holding the plate


	

How a certain prominent purohita had to undergo a brief but a very embarrassing moment at an outstation public function recently has gone viral in political circles.

 


The purohita was among the distinguished guests who attended the opening of a rehabilitation centre in the East. A foreign organization was the main sponsor of this centre and a female representative from the organization was also present as a guest of honour.


The guests at the function were served with a fried fish, a delicacy this area is well-known for, ahead of the formal opening and when the time came for observing the traditional rites associated with the ceremony, the foreign lady was invited to cut the ribbon. And an organizer was seen extending a pair of scissors to her. However, she found herself still savoring the fried fish and she handed the unfinished plate to the purohita who was standing by her side to have her hand free to do the honours.

The purohita gallantly took over the plate with a partly eaten fried fish. However, if he thought he was to hold the out-of-the place- object only for a few seconds, he would have been sadly mistaken. For the foreign lady was again invited to light the traditional oil lamp as well. The purohita who continued to hold the plate of fried fish was now conscious of furtive glances being cast his way and ripples of amusement passing through the gathering. Some agonizing seconds for him ticked away as the foreign lady was going about lighting the traditional oil lamp and he was almost in a sweat with unease by the time the lady returned to relieve him of the ‘burden’, they say.
