Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament today that Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake had set a good precedent by resigning from his portfolio.

He said no member of the previous government had resigned no matter how serious the charges levelled against them were.

The Premier said the minister’s resignation to allow for impartial investigations showed this government’s commitment to good governance.

The Premier said media institutions were making allegations today taking advantage of the environment of freedom that prevails in the country today.

"Had the media done this during the previous regime, it would have experienced the same fate which befell Lasantha Wickramatunga and Prageeth Eknaligoda. Media today paints everyone as thieves because of media freedom," he said.
