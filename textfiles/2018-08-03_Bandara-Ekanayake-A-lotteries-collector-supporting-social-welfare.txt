Some people buy lotteries as a habit while several others to try their luck. Many start their daily routine only after purchasing lotteries. Basically, lotteries are as important as the morning cup of coffee.   

Out of a thousand lottery buyers is an interesting character whose life is closely-knit with this art. His collection includes lotteries issued from the very inception of the Lotteries Board. He can be introduced as E.M.D. Bandara Ekanayake, a retired postmaster residing at Dolahena in Kalawana. Explaining his connection with lotteries, Mr. Ekanayake expressed the following to our sister-weekly, Deshaya: 

“I began purchasing national and development lotteries since the very inception of the Lotteries Board in 1962. Back then, the price of a lottery ticket was Fifty cents and only Rs.100,000 was given to the winner. Before that, I purchased lotteries printed on behalf of the Industrial Exhibition in 1959. I have collected all lotteries I purchased over the years. Earlier, there were no lottery stalls in Kalawana, so I had to travel by bus or send someone else to Sinniah Stores in Nivithigala to purchase lotteries. In the past, lotteries were sold at Ranasinghe Hotel, owned by P.D.T. Lathpandura in Kalawana. It is from there that I have been purchasing lotteries. My children continue this legacy. Although I haven’t won more than Rs.10,000 from lotteries, I keep buying them to  contribute to the Lotteries Board that renders public services such healthcare and education. Similarly, I help people in whatever way possible. I have built a community hall in my village,” he said.    

Not only is Mr. Ekanayake a collector of lotteries, he also collects bus tickets and newspapers.
