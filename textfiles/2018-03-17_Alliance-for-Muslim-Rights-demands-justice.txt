Some Muslims affiliated to the Alliance for Muslim Rights carried out a protest march yesterday that started off from the Mosque at Bambalapitiya to the United Nations Head Office at Thunmulla to protest against the government’s inaction with regard to recent acts of violence against Muslims.

The protesters handed over an epistle to the UN head Office urging the authorities to take action against those who were responsible for the recent unrest. Pix by Nisal Baduge
