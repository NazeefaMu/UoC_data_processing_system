Star-gazers to have the last word!


	



 

That the official leader of the opposition decided to move into his Colombo 7 official residence on the advice of Number One in yahapalanaya is no longer news.

 


When the grey-haired veteran was about to go into occupation of the official residence, he had received astrological advice not to move into the new residence before getting clearance from the competent astrologers that the premises was free from Vastu Dosha. Now the astrologers are being consulted on the rituals to be performed to propitiate deities and to nullify the possible Vastu Dosha.  So the veteran political leader is waiting for the ‘okay’ from astrologers to move into his official residence, they say.
