She attracts more unwanted visitors!


	



 

There was an actress who turned an economic advisor overnight. She once stole the limelight when she accompanied a very high authority on one of his foreign visits. She has now become the Girl Friday of a deputy from Siyane Korale eying an electorate in Wayamba, they say. .

 


The deputy has offered this job to the fair and lovely one out of consideration for their past friendship.  From the time this fair one assumed duties, the deputy’s office has become a busy crowded place. A good number of visitors to this office these days happen to be Diyawanna politicos, including purohitas, at all levels.  Some purohitas, in fact, have made it a habit to visit this office even twice a day. They would breeze in hailing the fair one with the stock greeting, “Ah! Kohomada, Nangi?”


There is such an unending stream of visitors, mostly VIPs, to this office, some claim that it could be called one of the busiest places in the Public Sector.  With too many visitors crowding his office, the workaday affairs of the deputy have run disarray and he is said to be cursing himself these days for employing a beauty that led to a situation that he never bargained for, they say.
