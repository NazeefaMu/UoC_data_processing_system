Sri Lanka Navy rescued the 07-member India crew from a Maldives-bound Indian Merchant Vessel, which had sunk in the seas south of Sri Lanka due to a mechanical fault.

Sri Lanka Navy said that upon being informed by the Maldivian government about the ill-fated ‘Maria Iurudaya’, a medium-scale merchant vessel sinking in the seas 68 nautical miles south of the Galle lighthouse, the Navy Headquarters alerted all merchant ships plying in that area as well as SLN ships/craft patrolling in the southern seas to render assistance.

Subsequently, the Navy was informed of a drifting life-craft with sailors on board by a multi-day fishing trawler named “Sahan Putha’. The Fast Attack Craft P490 was dispatched immediately to the location for the rescue. The Indian crew in distress was rescued accordingly and brought safely to the Galle Harbour this morning (21 October). All seven Indian sailors are in good health and arrangements have been made to hand them over to the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka for repatriation.
