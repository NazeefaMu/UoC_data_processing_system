The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will certainly contest the elections under a common front and a common symbol, SLPP front-liner Basil Rajapaksa said yesterday.

He told Daily Mirror that the two parties would form a broad alliance including other like-minded political parties.

“We will definitely contest together under whatever symbol,” Mr. Rajapaksa said and added that the sovereignty of the people was with the people and as such the elections would be the best opportunity to decide on the next set of rulers.

“The countdown to the next elections has begun,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
