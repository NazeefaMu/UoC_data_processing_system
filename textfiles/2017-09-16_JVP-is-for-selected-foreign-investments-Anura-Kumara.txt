The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) does not totally denounce foreign investments but welcome investments in selected areas, its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said on Thursday.

Mr Dissanayake made these comments at a seminar organized by ‘We are Sri Lankans Circle.’ “Our party does not denounce foreign investors but welcome them to invest in selected areas. There are valuable natural resources in Pulmudai and the country only produces five kinds of chemicals using these resources. However Sri Lanka does not have sufficient technology to enhance the product portfolio using the natural resources found there. Therefore our party believes that foreign investment is needed in sectors such as these. Therefore we are for selected foreign investments,” the JVP leader said.

Speaking further, he said the JVP does not believe in an economy without a private sector but that the private sector should work according to a national plan. “Our belief is that the private sector should not be allowed to work independently but work to a national plan,” he said.

“Our effort is not to convert Sri Lanka into another socialist nation like Russia or China. Russian shoes are too big for us to fill while Chinese shoes are too small. What we need is a pair of shoes which will fit us just like our founder leader Rohana Wijeweera once said” he added.

He said a national development plan was needed for the country to address major issues such as debt, how to make maximum use of our natural resources, development of human resources, stop corruption and should focus on history and culture.

Popular Musician and social activist Sunil Perera, who graced the occasion, was of the opinion that all politicians who governed the country for the last 70 years should be jailed. “Politicians who governed the country during the past 70 years should be put in specially designed jail as all of them had been engaged in and have encouraged corruption,” he said. He said people should not be afraid to denounce all these politicians who belong to the main political parties of this country during future elections.

“India Gandhi was killed by a sheikh in 1984 but Manmohan Singh, also a Sikh, became the Prime Minister of that country while Abdul Kalaam became the President of India despite being a Muslim. Sri Lankan should learn from these examples when it comes to national unity and treat everyone equally,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
