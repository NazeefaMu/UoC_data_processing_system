Presidential Media Division today rejected reports that the Bribery Commission would be dissolved this week.
It said the appointment of the Commission, its members and removing them should be done in accordance with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
“However, the new commissioners will be appointed no sooner the Constitutional Council is set up,” it said.
