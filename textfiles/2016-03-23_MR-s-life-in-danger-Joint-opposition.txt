MR’s life in danger: Joint opposition


	

The joint opposition said today former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s life is in danger and the government must take responsibility if anything untoward happened to him.

SLFP MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the government had neither allocated a cent to the repairing of Mr. Rajapaksa’s bullet-proof vehicle that met with an accident several months ago nor had he be allocated an official residence even after 14 months.

“It is the joint opposition that is carrying out the duties of the opposition. We have had to face lot of threats and intimidation.Mr. Rajapaksa, who represents the joint opposition, has serious issues with regard to his security. We have firsthand experience where Gamini Dissnayake and Lalith Athulathmudali, who led the Democratic United National Front against the then government, were killed. So we have a reasonable fear about Mr. Rajapaksa’s life as well,” he said.

Mr. Abeywardena told a news conference that Mr. Rajapaksa’s security concerns had aggravated after former LTTE leaders were released and with underworld gangsters freely operating in the country.

“This government has shown its inability to rule this country. So it is trying to suppress the people and we are the only group preventing the government from doing so,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
