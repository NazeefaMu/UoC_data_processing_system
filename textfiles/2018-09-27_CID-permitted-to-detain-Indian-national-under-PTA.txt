CID permitted to detain Indian national under PTA


	

The Fort Magistrate’s Court today allowed the CID to detain Marsili Thomas, the Indian national who was arrested recently, for three months under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) for further investigation.

When Thomas was produced in the Court today, the Magistrate ordered the CID to produce the suspect in Court on October 23 for observation.

The CID arrested Thomas last Thursday while he was visiting the house of Namal Kumara, the Operation Director of the Anti Corruption Movement.

Kumara recently revealed a conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
