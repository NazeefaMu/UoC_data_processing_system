While urging the Government to launch an impartial investigation into the recovery of a suicide jacket and explosives in a house Vallakulam, Chavakachcheri Last night, the Joint Opposition today said that these kinds of incidents could cause a threat to the national security.

Speaking at a media conference in Borella, Prof. G.L.Peiris said the Government was attempting to hide the truth behind the scene to the public.

While claiming that these kinds of incidents could cause a threat to the national security, he requested the Government to stay vigilant and give priority issues pertaining to the national security.

Prof. Peiris said according to the information they received, the explosives were prepared to being sent to a place in Wellawatte.

“This incident should not be considered as an isolated incident. The people should know the absolute truth regarding this incident.

“Therefore the Government should not conceal the truth. However, we noticed the Government had published false amounts of explosives found in Chavakachcheri. We urge them to find those who involved in the incident, the purpose of them and whether this was just one incident in a planned network,” he said.

Former Agriculture Minister Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that the national security could not be handled properly because many officers of the Intelligence Service had been jailed over various allegations. (Piyumi Fonseka)
