Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, joined by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, met a joint opposition’s delegation led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday and discussed constitutional reforms.

The meeting took place days after President Maithripala Sirisen assured the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) that he would ask the Prime Minister to discuss constitutional reforms with Mr. Rajapaksa who is now an MP representing the Kurunegala district .

JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane who also attended the meeting told Daily Mirror Mr. Rajapaksa did not agree to commit himself to anything in this regard because the government, as a coalition of different parties, was yet to come out with its stand on the proposed constitution.

He said the JO members who served in the subcommittees that worked out constitutional proposals raised concerns that their views were disregarded and noted that the JO would stand by the 14 proposals it had submitted earlier.

The protection of the country's unitary nature, the foremost place accorded to Buddhism and new electoral reforms are among the proposals submitted by the JO.

“We remain concerned over the non-recognition of the JO in Parliament despite it being the largest group in the opposition,” Mr. Gunawardena said.

JO MPs Lohan Ratwatte, Bandula Gunawardene, Vidura Wickramanayake and Shehan Semasinghe also attended the meeting. (Kelum Bandara)
