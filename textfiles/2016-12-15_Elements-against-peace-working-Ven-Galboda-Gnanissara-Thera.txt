The Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Vihara Hunupitiya Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera yesterday said the recent incidents regarding the Navy Commander and the IGP were ones that were carefully brewed to destabilize the administration of the country by interested persons.

“The calm nature of the nation fades away when incidents such as the one which the Navy Commander and the IGP were involved, take place," the Ven. Thera said.

“The situation in the country had become so bad as it had become difficult to carry out social work in our own hometowns," he added.

He said a time would come soon when the IGP and the Navy Commander would have to visit places without their uniforms. (Yohan Perera)
