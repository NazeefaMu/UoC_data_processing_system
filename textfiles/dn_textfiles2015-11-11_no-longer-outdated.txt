No longer outdated

Historically speaking, Sri Lanka has never grown outdated. On the contrary, this little Isle of our dwelling continues to be historically updated. That has been very much a treasure trove for the men of letters. Sadly though, Sri Lankan English writers seem a bit hesitant to tread that territory. It has a fair share of reasons. History thriller genre demands research - a lot more than its peers. And you need to be well conversant in the island's native language. Ananda Liyanage belongs to this rarely spoken of category. He has authored four voluminous works of fiction: The Legacy, The Deception, The Vengeance and The Prophesy - they cover four significantly controversial periods of history.
Liyanage does not write at a rate. He cannot, for, as he himself admits, that exercise demands a lot of research. That said in repetition, a well researched work keeps history no longer outdated.
Q: Since the release of your fourth novel 'The Prophesy' in November 2012 apart from the short biographical sketch 'Reflections & Reminiscences' in December 2014 you have been silent. What have you been doing during this time?
A: I have just finished a collection of detective short stories. The detective did detection in colonial Ceylon during the 30's and 40's. It is now in the stage of being copyedited. Meanwhile I have started writing the next story which is a long story. The detective short stories will be launched in March 2016 the next story in March 2017. The long delay in the release of my books was due to the reason that I realized too late that writing short stories is a different art form altogether and took me about thrice the time that it normally takes to complete a single book of the same size. I made up my mind not to repeat the mistake again of attempting to write short stories unless there was a very strong motive to do so.
Q: Why do you write?
A: I started writing for the fun of it. However lately I have been using the print medium to make factual statements about certain historical occurrences which others do not write about as it goes against the preconceived way in which they have been schooled to think.
Q: What is your muse?
A: When I wrote my first book 'The Legacy' I did not have any inspiration other than that I received from my sister. I kept on writing for the fun of it. After I finished writing it I did not know what to do with the manuscript. Many people borrowed it and read it.
All of them commented favorably on it. One such friend was an ex colleague of mine at the Commercial Bank who went beyond complimentary remarks and told me how to get it published. He was Prasad Samarasekere a graphic artist by profession and who had acquired a name for himself as a cover designer of books. After release of my first book the favorable comments and reviews that I received became the inspiration for my subsequent creations. So it has been the appreciation of readers which has been my main inspiration.
Q: What kind of books do you like to read most?
A: I enjoyed most reading thrillers laced with adventure when I last used to read. This is the genre which I like to write about now.
Q: What are your favourite books?
A: By title and author but not exactly in order of preference they are 'Treasure' and 'Cyclops' by Clive Cussler 'Shockwave' by Colin Forbes, 'Tinker Tailor Solider Spy' and 'Smiley's People' by John le Carre, 'Wild Justice', 'The Sunbird', 'Hungry as the Sea' and 'Eagle in the Sky' by Wilbur Smith, 'Breakheart Pass' by Alistair MacLean, 'Landslide' by Desmond Bagley, 'The White South' by Hammond Innes, 'The Holcroft Covenant' by Robert Ludlum, 'Cloak of Darkness' by Helen MacInnes etc. I will stop now as the list is endless. I have only touched on the contemporary writers.
Q: What have you got to tell the worst critic of yours?
A: It takes a huge effort to produce a book of the substance and size I write. From start to finish it includes among other things the following. You have to fist design the plot which has to be practical and should fit in to known facts. The plot has to be researched thoroughly to be watertight. Next you have to build the characters to fit into the plot and build up the characters by events and dialog. In all such efforts you have to ensure that the story moves on without stagnation and the reader interest is maintained. The ending of one chapter has to contain enough excitement for the reader to proceed to the next chapter. After the writing is over the finished product will contain close to a million characters with spaces. Then it will go for copy editing to maybe two or three persons. You have to input the corrections made by them and consider the changes suggested by them. In total with these you would have typed over a million characters.
Then there is the printing and launch to supervise. The whole effort might take anything up to from fourteen months to sixteen months. That is a very heavy load of work and responsibility. On contrast the critic has to just walk into a bookshop select the book pay at the sales counter and walk away with it and then sacrifice some of his or her leisure time to read it. What I have to say to them is to be mindful about what the author goes through before you criticize. Remember that an author always welcomes constructive criticism but destructive criticism tends to kill inspiration.
Q: Looking back, do you wish if you could edit your first book?
A: Yes. I certainly will copyedit 'The Legacy' before I go for a reprint. I now have three people who do copy editing.
Q: What is your opinion about literary awards?
A: I do not want to comment at length on this but only say that I have decided not to make any application for an award or expect any. I am happy when I produce a book that make my readers happy and gives them pleasure in reading.
Q: Out of the award-winning books and popular books, which category appeals to you most?
A: In a way none of these categories in itself appeals to me. The story has to contain enough excitement to keep on reading. In my young days when reading was possible I used to read even some large books at a sitting. That is the criteria which appeals to me.
Q: Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating?
A: I hardly read now. Even when I do it is to do research for my writing. However I have to sit at a table now to read as I have to rest the book as my hands are too weak to hold it. It was not always like that in the past. In my young days I used to read at every available opportunity. I think my special reading habit was reading while traveling.
I read while travelling by bus to office and back daily. I used to travel a lot mostly by bus as I did not have a car till much later in life. So I let the bus driver do the driving and concentrated on my reading. The shaking of the bus did not bother me and I quickly got used to it.
