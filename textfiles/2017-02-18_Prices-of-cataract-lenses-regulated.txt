The prices of 38 brands of cataract lenses were regulated from midnight yesterday, the Health Ministry announced.

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the price regulation would help reduce the prices charged for cataract surgeries and the malpractices would also be eliminated to a large extent.

He said cataract lenses would be provided by the Health Ministry free-of-charge through hospitals countrywide and added that the ministry had imported 100,000 cataract lenses even though only 89,000 cataract surgeries were conducted each year.

The minister told a news conference that the price regulation was done after consulting the eye surgeons and that the CIF value of the lenses was obtained from the Customs Department.

“The price regulation was implemented after discussions with the companies and the eye surgeons. We hope to reduce prices of more surgical equipment in the future,” he said.

The National Medicinal Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Chairman Asitha de Silva said cataract lenses that would not come under the price regulation were available in the market so that people could purchase their special requirements, which includes lenses used for special donation programmes and special lenses used under medical advice.

Ophthalmologist Charith Fonseka requested the various organizations that donate cataract lenses to use good quality lenses for patients.(Ajith Siriwardana)
