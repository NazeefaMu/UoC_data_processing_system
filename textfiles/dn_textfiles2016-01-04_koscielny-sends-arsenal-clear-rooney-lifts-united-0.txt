Koscielny sends Arsenal clear, Rooney lifts United

 
LONDON, SATURDAY: Laurent Koscielny's goal saw Arsenal pull two points clear of second-place Leicester City at the Premier League summit on Saturday, while Wayne Rooney scored a milestone winner for Manchester United.
Koscielny stabbed home a flick-on from France team-mate Olivier Giroud in the 72nd minute at a rain-lashed Emirates Stadium to earn a below-par Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Newcastle United.
Leicester drew 0-0 at home to Bournemouth and now have just a one-point lead over Manchester City, who produced a rousing comeback to win 2-1 at Watford via late goals by Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero.
"We were not at our best, but we had to dig deep and we can do that when needed," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. "It was about solidarity, tired legs and taking a chance from a set-piece.
Leicester have now gone three league games without winning or scoring after their stalemate against 10-man Bournemouth at the King Power Stadium.
Manchester City looked to be sinking to a sixth defeat of the campaign after Aleksandar Kolarov's 55th-minute own goal saw them fall behind at Watford.
But Kolarov teed up Toure to volley in an adroit 82nd-minute equaliser and Aguero then brilliantly headed in an 84th-minute winner from Bacary Sagna's cross as Manuel Pellegrini's side reignited their title challenge.
At Old Trafford, Rooney gave United a 2-1 win over Swansea City with a fine 77th-minute back-heel that made him the outright second-highest goal-scorer in both Premier League (188 goals) and United (238) history.
After Anthony Martial's header was cancelled out by Gylfi Sigurdsson, Martial teed up Rooney to score a goal that ended United's eight-game winless run and further eased the pressure on manager Louis van Gaal.
The result lifted United to fifth place, two points below fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Everton on Sunday.
West Ham United are a point back in sixth after Michail Antonio and Andy Carroll scored headed goals in a 2-0 home win over Liverpool.
Aston Villa spurned another chance to close on safety after losing 3-1 at second-bottom Sunderland, with Jermain Defoe scoring twice to leave Remi Garde's side seven points adrift at the foot of the table.
Jonny Evans's stoppage-time goal earned West Bromwich Albion a last-gasp 2-1 win over Stoke City, who had Geoff Cameron sent off after an altercation with Claudio Yacob.
Kenyan midfielder Victor Wanyama was dismissed as Southampton went down 1-0 at Norwich City, where Alexander Tettey scored a 76th-minute winner. AFP
