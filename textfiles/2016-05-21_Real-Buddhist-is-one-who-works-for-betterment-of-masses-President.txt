The real Buddhist is the one who works for the betterment and the contentment of the masses, President Maithripala Sirisena said in his Vesak message.

“Where there is wisdom, compassion, kindness, equanimity, human devotion, tranquility, discipline, righteousness, selflessness and simplicity, you find Buddhism. The Buddhist way of life is to respect peace and humanity,” he said.

The path to overcome greed, hatred, fear and ignorance is necessary not only for the social existence but also for the good governance, the President further said.

Full Message

Today, the Vesak Day, the Buddhists the world over celebrate the birth, enlightenment and the Mahaparinirvana of the Gauthma Buddha, the greatest religious visionary lived 2560 years ago, with unparalleled compassion and kindness towards the fellow human beings.

The Buddha, after attaining the way to traverse sorrow through wisdom, taught the path to achieve spiritual and physical tranquility. With the understanding of the human being, the surroundings and also the universe, the Gauthama taught an all inclusive, comprehensive Dhamma which is timeless. It has encompassed the development of knowledge and wisdom, discipline of one’s senses, spiritual tranquility, selflessness and such practices that result in the betterment of the human society.

Although, the Buddha told us that emancipation could be achieved through spiritual development and wisdom, we are gradually distancing from this noble truth. The society is our common stage. There are many performances on this stage. Our display of devotion, truthfulness, purity, and selflessness are mere dishonest acts than honest deeds. There is no validity of our Buddhist label if we are unable to control our sinful thoughts arisen in our minds through our wisdom.

Where there is wisdom, compassion, kindness, equanimity, human devotion, tranquility, discipline, righteousness, selflessness and simplicity, you find Buddhism. The Buddhist way of life is to respect peace and humanity.

The path to overcome greed, hatred, fear and ignorance is necessary not only for the social existence but also for the good governance. The Buddhist minds should develop the aspirations of a society in which there is no distinction of race, caste, religion or social status.

Many people believe that the religious life is the practices of offering flowers, listening to religious sermons and visiting the temple on Poya days. However, the real Buddhist is the one who works for the betterment and the contentment of the masses. May all Buddhists act with determination to the path that leads to the emancipation of the people. Let us first correct ourselves and then attempt to correct others.
