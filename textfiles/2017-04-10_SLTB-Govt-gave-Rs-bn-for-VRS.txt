The total number of employees before the VRS was at 10,000 office employees,10,300 drivers, 10,400 conductors and 7,000 in the mechanical services.

The Government gave Rs. 1,350 million to the SLTB to pay Rs.16, 200 each as part of their monthly salary.

After the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) it had now become possible for the 104 SLTB depots across over the country to pay salaries to staff in full, the Minister said.
