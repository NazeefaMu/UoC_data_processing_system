A special meeting of the Government Parliamentary Group, comprising Ministers and MPs of both United National Party (UNP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would be held at Temple Trees today (June 19), Cabinet Co Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said yesterday.

Minister Karunathilaka told a media briefing that both -President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe-would chair the meeting which was scheduled to be held at 5 p.m.

“The UNP Parliamentary Group Meeting was fixed for today anyway, but we were informed that President Sirisena will also participate in it as well. SLFP Ministers also participate in the group meeting whenever President participates in it. Therefore today’s meeting would be a special one,” the Minister said.

However, he refrained from divulging details about it.

Asked whether the UNP and SLFP would meet shortly on reviewing the MoU with regard to the National Unity Government, the Minister said both parties had been meeting frequently since the forming of the National Government in 2015 and would meet in the future as well to see how the Government could be carried on.
