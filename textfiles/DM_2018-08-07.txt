A cable car project under fire!
	

A business tycoon with close ties to a main political party is set to launch a cable car service project with the sacred city in the upcountry as the pivotal point, they say.

However, a certain section has raised objections to this project saying that it goes against the general acceptance that has become almost a tradition that no structure that rises above the golden canopy of the Sacred Palace should come up in the area.
Reports say that the cable line is routed over a forest reserve and plans are underway to fell priceless trees in this reserve for the purpose.

Advantis Engineering Partners With ATAD Steel Structure Corporation to Bring Rapid Construction Solu
	
(From left)  Mr. Do Duc Trung, Sales Director, ATAD Steel; Mr. Huynh Ngoc Dong, Chairman, ATAD Steel; Mr. Mohan Pandithage, Chairman, Hayleys PLC and Mr. Ruwan Waidyaratne, Managing Director, Hayleys Advantis Limited
Advantis Engineering, a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with global pre-engineered building giant ATAD Steel Structure Corporation. This latest partnership is in keeping with the companys ongoing efforts to bring sustainable, cost effective and rapid construction solutions to Sri Lanka.
Pre-engineered steel buildings are tailor-made solutions to meet the exact needs of customers. This system consists of factory-fabricated steel column & beam segments that are simply bolted together at site. The external surface is constructed using varying walling systems based on the requirements of the customer. Upon completion of component fabrication, the entire building is shipped, in parts, to the site for rapid assembly. As the latest trend in building construction, this advanced solution has outstanding advantages to customers.
An efficiently designed pre-engineered building can cost less than a conventional steel building (or standard steel or civil construction) by up to 25% and can reduce the scheduled construction time by 30-50% with fast delivery and quick site assembly. Raw materials can also be calculated more accurately enabling the reduction of material usage and wastage in the factory and on-site. Low weight flexible frames of pre-engineered steel buildings also offer higher resistance to earthquakes, making it a safer option.
We are proud to be partnering with Advantis Engineering to bring our innovative and sustainable building solutions to Sri Lanka. At ATAD we are committed to bringing these new and efficient construction methods to the forefront of the construction industry and we believe Advantis Engineering shares our vision. Together we are confident in our ability to bring the next generation of construction solutions to this beautiful island, said Huynh Ngoc Dong, Chairman, ATAD Steel Structure Corporation.

Advantis Engineering, a pioneer in converting marine containers to sustainable, usable work spaces under its brand Convertainers, has long identified the need for rapid construction solutions to aid the countrys economic growth and development. As existing businesses expand and new ones enter the market the gap between available space and demand will only continue to grow and it will be years before developers, relying on traditional methods, are able to bridge this gap.
Commenting on this partnership, Kamal Wimalaratne, General Manager, Advantis Engineering, said, Providing a solution for the increasing scarcity of space in urban areas is crucial to the continued economic growth of our nation. With traditional construction being cumbersome and slow, especially for businesses that need large spaces constructed for their operations, it was clear that we needed an innovative solution to meet todays fast growing needs. Hence we are proud to be partnering with ATAD Steel Structure Corporation, a leader in the construction industry, which creates easily deployable space solutions that help businesses get up and running much faster, resulting in quicker return on investment.
ATAD Steel Structure Corporation, with over 15 years of experience in the construction space, is one of the largest global suppliers of pre-engineered buildings, providing world class solutions in over 35 countries with over 3,000 buildings completed to date. ATAD is the proud owner of the largest and the first LEED Gold steel structure factory in Asia, certified by The US Green Building Council as a factory that can produce 144,000 MT of steel structures per year. The LEED Gold factory also affirms ATADs strategy to contribute to a more sustainable world by building environmentally-friendly green buildings with deep knowledge and experience in green construction.
Advantis Engineering, a fully owned subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, constantly strives to provide innovative space solutions for a wide variety of industries.

Anyone doing business with Iran will not do business with US:Trump
	
Donald Trump has thrown down the gauntlet, warning that any businesses trading with Iran would not be allowed to trade with the US.
Hailing the re-introduction of sanctions against the state, the US President tweeted: "These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States."
He added: "I am asking for world peace, nothing less!"
His comments come just a day after the European Union said it was implementing a blocking statute to shield companies "doing legitimate business" within the country against the impact of US sanctions coming into force as a result of Trump's decision to withdraw from the multilateral Iran nuclear deal.
The blocking statute will allow EU companies to recover damages resulting from US sanctions and ban them from complying with sanctions unless they get special dispensation from the European Commission.
Under the deal Iran agreed to drastically scale back its nuclear programme in return for relief from sanctions introduced by the international community over fears it was developing nuclear weapons.
But Trump has repeatedly slammed it as a bad deal for the US. Yesterday he claimed his new approach was "based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and all around the world". (cityam)

Bangladesh must relocate Rohingya from crowded camps: HRW
	

DPA, 06th AUGUST, 2018- Bangladesh authorities should relocate Rohingya refugees from crowded mega-camps at risk of diseases and landslides during monsoon season, Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged Monday.
Some 700,000 minority Rohingya Muslims fled a brutal Myanmar crackdown in August 2017, joining 200,000 who had fled previous waves of violence to create the worlds largest refugee camp in Bangladeshs Coxs Bazar.
With no prospect of return to Myanmar in the short term, Bangladesh should move refugees to smaller camps on safer ground with less risk of flooding and landslides and with more space to prevent communicable diseases, fires, community tensions and domestic and sexual violence, according to the report released Monday. Bangladesh should register fleeing Rohingya as refugees, ensure adequate health care and education and let them pursue livelihoods outside the camp, said HRWs refugee rights director Bill Frelick, while praising Bangladesh for hosting the refugees.
Myanmar and Bangladesh in November last year signed a deal to facilitate Rohingya returns.
Bangladeshi authorities insist the camps are temporary and that Rohingya must return to Myanmar, which has prevented the construction of permanent, cyclone-proof structures.

REUTERS, 06th AUGUST, 2018- Bangladeshs cabinet on Monday approved raising the maximum jail time for rash driving deaths to five years from three, the law minister said, as students protested for a ninth day over the deaths of two teenagers killed by a speeding bus in Dhaka.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who faces an election due by the end of the year, has accused her political rivals of trying to stir up anti-government sentiment using the deaths as a pretext. The opposition has denied involvement.
The crowded capital of 18 million has been paralyzed by angry students demanding changes to transport laws following the July 29 deaths after the driver of a privately operated bus lost control and ran over a group of college students in an alleged race for passengers with another bus.

## Title: Britain outsources Death Penalty
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 7 August 2018 12:10 am
Britain outsources Death Penalty
	
Information has begun to trickle into the public domain of the UK having agreed to the prosecution of two British terrorists in the USA. Britains concurrence is not conditional to the two terrorists not being executed if found guilty.
Britain abolished the death penalty in 1965, but it remained a legally defined punishment for crimes such as treason till its complete abolition in 1998. It is a signatory to the 2004 13th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights which prohibits all members from the practice of capital punishment.
The Beatles is an all British ISIL terrorist cell dubbed after the famous British pop group due to their English accents.
They were named John, Paul, George, and Ringo by their prisoners. The leader was known as Jihadi John. Video recordings are available of the group beheading at least 27 hostages including two American journalists and two British aid workers in 2014. They were tasked with guarding over 20 western hostages in Raqqa and are known to have resorted to very harsh methods of interrogation such as mock executions and waterboarding.
Mohammed Emwazi a.k.a. Jihadi John was killed in a US drone attack on November 12, 2005. Alexanda Kotey dubbed Ringo, a 32-year-old convert from London and El Shafee Elsheikh known as Goerge, a British citizen of Sudanese origin were apprehended by Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) in the Turkish border.
Aine Lesley Davis a.k.a. Paul, a Brit was convicted by a Turkish court and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. Meanwhile, Britain has stripped them of their citizenship.

Britain and other EU members states should stop lecturing to Sri Lanka of the need to prosecute or release 70 some hardcore LTTE terrorists heldsince 2009
The current controversy revolves around the fate of Kotey and Elsheikh. Options available are; indefinite detention in Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp (GTMO) or transfer to International Criminal Court which might not be plausible as the US government does not recognize ICCs jurisdiction.
British Home Secretary Sajid Javid has dispatched a letter to US Attorney General Jeff Sessions dated June 22, admitting Britains legal processes are insufficiently robust and there is a good chance prosecution would fail.
Therefore, Britain would approve Americas request for mutual legal assistance for Kotey and Elsheihk. All available intelligence on the two terrorists to US Prosecutors without the caveat, the duo would not face the death penalty, currently forbidden in British and EU law.
Boris Johnson who resigned as Foreign Secretary recently over a policy disagreement on Brexit has reportedly expressed concerns. In an internal government briefing document, Johnson is known to have stated, not seeking assurances .. could damage our ability to secure adequate assurances from the US and other countries in the future but agrees that the benefits outweigh the risks in this instance. He supposedly agreed to the Home Secretarys recommendation on the basis the benefits outweigh the risk of the two men returning to the UK. Should we prevent the men from being tried and brought to justice because of the risk of the death penalty
It was, but less than a decade ago, one of his predecessors David Milliband, accompanied by his French counterpart came charging to Colombo in May 2009 to save Velupillai Prabhakaran, one of the worlds most feared terrorists and his high command who had been encircled by the Sri Lankan Army.

Despite initial hesitations, Javids letter subsequently received Prime Ministerial concurrence. A release from Downing Street stated, The ultimate aim of all of us is to ensure these men are brought to justice.
It was a tacit admission, the justice the two terrorists would receive in a British court of law would be wholly inadequate.
Indefinite incarceration at GTMO or prosecution in a US court which could result in the death penalty was the justice desired by the British Government.
Even though it was a violation of Britains stated policy on capital punishment, Javid dispatched the letter without public or Parliamentary consultation.
Human Rights groups, as well as a cross-section of Tory, Labour, and LibDem MPs, expressed outrage over the governments decision. One parliamentarian stated, we have to show we are better than Islamic State in our morals and should, therefore, have nothing to do with capital punishment.
Britain is required to uphold EU law at least till March 29, 2019. EU law is notoriously more concerned of terrorists rights than those of ordinary citizens. It is symptomatic of the problems western liberal democracies face in dealing with terrorism at home.
On the other hand, many among the British establishment expressed a counter view. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, head of MI5, Lord Chief Justice and head of counter-terror policing have said, Britains archaic treason laws need to be updated and used to prosecute jihadis who have fought in Syria.
The Treason Act of 1351 has not been used since 1946 but should now be revised to prosecute terrorists amid growing fears that British laws are currently not robust enough to deal with returning jihadis.
A former chairman of COBRA Intelligence Group, the British governments top-level crisis-management group, has opined, Of course both execution and detention without a trial run contrary to British ethical principles. But history proves that, in times of war, we must sometimes adapt our values to secure victory.
Even today, some have difficulty in comprehending that, because this is not a conventional war with tanks rolling across the plains and dogfights over the skies.
The relevance of this episode to Sri Lanka is twofold.
Sri Lanka is currently divided over President Sirisenas plan to impose the death penalty for those repeatedly convicted for drug trafficking.
Whereas rights groups and some in civil society are opposed to the idea, it would appear the general populace is supportive of the move.
INGOs, NGOs, and the European Union have waded into the issue by publicly voicing their opposition to the Presidents plan.
Firstly, this is not of the rights and wrongs of the death penalty. It is about the right of the people of this country to be able to decide on their own, if death penalty, may it be for terrorism, drug trafficking, or any other reason need be reinstated or not.

Sri Lanka is currently divided over President Sirisenas plan to impose the death penalty for those repeatedly convicted for drug trafficking

Sri Lanka, unlike Britain, does not have the luxury of outsourcing trials and executions of undesirables to another country, while preaching to the rest of the world of the evils of capital punishment.
Secondly, contemplating sending the two Jihadists for indefinite incarceration in Guantanamo detention facility or to the gallows without insisting on having the two terrorists, former British subjects, brought to the UK for prosecution under British law is but plain and straightforward humbuggery.
Britain and other EU member states should stop lecturing to Sri Lanka of the need to prosecute or release some 70 hardcore LTTE terrorists held since 2009.
The need for such detainees to be tried or released is a given.
However, it is not for other nations, especially those who twist international conventions when it suits them to pontificate to other countries how they should address their security, terrorism, and crime-related issues.
The US currently holds 40 detainees at GTMO without trial for over ten years. Britain has agreed to send two Jihadi terrorists, former British subjects for indefinite incarceration at Guantanamo or possibly to face the death penalty.
Meanwhile, there is no evidence of EU Ambassadors in London expressing their objections to Britains decision, as done by their counterparts in Colombo last week.
In this instance, the stance taken by both Britain and EU would appear to be, human rights, justice, and the law need be applied consistently according to international conventions when it involves other countries but may be sliced and diced to suit their own interests at home.

GMOA - Enjoy life but  pay taxes
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) and the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) are both complementing and competing with each other for the position of the most influential opposition of the UNP-led government. 

When one blocks roads with rallies the other cripples hospitals. When one pushes railway unions to action the other pulls medical students to roads. They both hold regular press conferences to drive home the point that the countrys economy is in tatters and the government is out to sell the country. Other than one being a political movement and the other being a professional trade union theres one other factor that makes them apart. That is with regard to the degree of public patience. 
While a chunk of the public seems to be quite impatient to see the return of the players of the Joint Opposition the whole country seems to be losing its patience with the doctors. Mention the acronym GMOA and the public explodes. It will rattle off dozens of things to prove that the GMOAs taking patients to hostage is nothing less than criminal.
After years of patience with the medical body the countrymen have started considering that doctors are even worse than politicians. Its appraisal on the medical officers is hitting such a rock bottom soon and is likely to say that it really would not mind the government encouraging an influx of doctors from Singapore or elsewhere to ensure smooth functioning of the health sector. After all what would the GMOA do if the public decides to side with the foreign doctors against the locals who take patients hostage at regular intervals 
There was a time that the JVP was becoming quite a public nuisance by getting down workers and students to roads and making them clash with the police so that the masses were reminded that there was a political party by the name JVP. With its Inter University Student Federation (IUSF) and the network of workers unions the ex-Marxists created traffic snarls in the city every other day. Then came the GMOA, a professional group that the masses thought had some semblance of sanity more than the JVP. Today the JVP is almost totally eclipsed thanks to the never-ending SAITM protests and hospital strikes engineered by the GMOA. 
While there were speculations that the bulk of the units in the plush apartment complexes that are mushrooming in and around Colombo are bought by expatriates and also some shady businessmen who want to hide their black money, it has been revealed that quite a large number of them are owned by the doctors. This in fact is a good trend and the countrymen are happy that the professionals are earning well.
Besides, that would encourage more ethical people to buy apartments as its nice to have professionals instead of some unknown shady businessmen as neighbours.
However, what the doctors should realize is that the country can no longer afford to give them a free run while the rest of the country pays the taxes depending on income. Enjoy life but pay the taxes.

Govt. shouldn't steer commercial banks to bankruptcy: Gammanpila
	
The government should not influence commercial banks for political projects leading them to bankruptcy, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday.
Addressing a news briefing, he said the Central Bank (CB) had requested the heads of commercial banks to join the national Gamperaliya programme by granting loans up to Rs.100,000 without any collateral.
CB officials including its governor have made this proposal to several commercial banks on July 26. However, bank high-ups have refused the request saying bad debt accumulated from such loans will burden them, thereby passing it on to State banks, he said.
Moreover, MP Gammanpila said commercial banks were negative in increasing the loan limit for pawning jewellery in a bid to improve the currency in circulation.
Commercial banks dont want to increase the loan limit for pawning jewellery because they have concerns over how helpless depositors will become when gold prices reduce, he said.
On a different note, he said the 15% interest granted to deposits made by senior citizens may be terminated in the future.
The Central Bank bears the difference between the current interest rate and the 15% granted to senior citizens. However, it has not been practised for six quarters, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. wont turn back on its  economic policies   - Eran Wickramaratne
	
Liberalization is the way forward
	Tax base is unimaginably low in Sri Lanka
	Tax base goes up with the rise of per capita income in any country

State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne in an interview with Daily Mirror, speaks about the economic policy of the government and recent tax reforms. The Excerpts:
 Q The government faces a lot of criticism over recent tax hikes, particularly on the small and medium scale entrepreneurs. Wont it affect their investment capacity and expose them to economic vulnerabilities
We have to understand that tax base in Sri Lanka is dangerously at low levels. In every country, taxation goes up along with the increase of per capita income. Then, you create more government services and a more equal society. If you look at advanced countries, they are more equal societies. It is unimaginably unequal in our country. This basic issue needs to be sorted out. Social contract is under threat because of this inequality. Therefore, there can be a bloodbath again in the future at some point. Sri Lanka has had a history of that. One aim of taxation is creating a more equal society. 
Within that taxation, we have to re-balance the direct and indirect taxation. We have two tax regimes basically. The corporate tax regime is 28%. It is 14% for small and medium enterprises. Any export industry is within that. 
If you take the entrepreneurial aspect, it is so low in Sri Lanka. It is unimaginable to see how low it is. In Sri Lanka, it is only 2.8% of the total population. In Vietnam, it is 19.6%. In Thailand, it is 27. 5%. 
If you take a country like Bangladesh with a big population, it is 11.6%. China has 7.5% of business owners. The point is that we have to increase the number of entrepreneurs. That is why this economy has a structure of an underdeveloped country. We are still driven by large companies only. We want to encourage. We are giving different kinds of loans through the banking system under Enterprise Sri Lanka programme.

We have two tax regimes basically. The corporate tax regime is 28%. It is 14% for small and medium enterprises. Any export industry is within that 

QIn such a context, if you increase taxation on existing businessman, it will put them in a difficult situation. How do you address that issue
We had tax free status for 40 years. It has not increased investment though. Actually, it is not taxation that blocks Foreign Direct Investment. It is lots of other different issues. Those issues need to be addressed rather than taxation. Business registration has to be quicker. People have to be able to register businesses in a day. We need to address issues in the Doing Business Index. 
Q Countries in Scandinavian region, people get quality services from their governments in return for high taxes they pay. It is not the case in Sri Lanka. Now you have increased taxes. How are you going to improve facilities for people
All these countries went through these development phases. In Scandinavian countries, taxation is between 40-55%. It is 11.5% in Sri Lanka. We have now moved to 14%. At 14%, we are giving more services than other countries. People have free education and free access to health. If you look at the measurements in health and education, what we have achieved with a little money is amazing. Longevity has improved to mid and late seventies from fifties in the past. If somebody says that service level has to be improved, I completely agree with it. The quantitative targets are really good. But, the quality has to be improved. If you go to see a doctor, he has to spend a lot of time with his patient. The level of education differs from national schools to rural schools. More investment needs to be done to improve quality. Dilemma for the country is to balance investment in human resources and other infrastructure. This is the need. Do you need a highway to Kandy Do you need investment in the improvement of education These are the policy dilemmas that are there. 
Q What is the government planning to do
The government is gradually increasing investment in health and education expenditures. It is a tough one, though. We have to manage the debt profile. While we are managing the debt profile, we are doing all these things. 

We had tax free status for 40 years. It has not increased investment though. Actually, it is not taxation that blocks Foreign Direct Investment. It is lots of other different issues. Those issues need to be addressed rather than taxation
Q Earlier, you said in an interview with me that the government would not make public investment as such. It is a departure from the practice of the previous government. Now, the government has moved to pump in a lot of money for such development projects such as the renovation of irrigation tanks. What is the reason for the shift in policy 
First, I would not say there is a sudden change of policies. The previous regime was spending as high as seven percent of GDP in public investment. Ours is going to be more like five percent. We are not going to get into the seven percent range. There is no change of policies. There is only change of emphasis. What kind of infrastructure do you build We are going to focus on the rural sector. That is why we are focusing on the construction and renovation of irrigation tanks, anicuts, rural roads etc.
We have to face environmental unpredictability. Up to 2014, the world used to have 40 disasters a year. After that, it is averaging at 400. That is the reason for us to make investment in irrigation tanks and all for the benefit of majority of people. The most affected countries in these disasters are in the West Indies. Within the first five or six most affected countries, Sri Lanka is one. This is a huge problem. Many people have not recognized it yet. We have not contributed to global warming. But, we are suffering from consequences of it. There has not been sufficient rain for four cultivation seasons. If we build tanks, we can retain water. Therefore, we invest in the development of 1200 tanks. 
We want to drive our economy through private investment as the other part. We need to keep looking at the doing business environment making it better and better. Liberalization is the way forward. The future of this country lies in overseas markets. It lies in our ability to export. 

We have to understand that tax base in Sri Lanka is dangerously at low levels. In every country, taxation goes up along with the increase of per capita income. Then, you create more government services and a more equal society
Q What is the extent of liberalization you seek
The argument is always between the consumer and the producer. People who come to the doorstep of the Finance Ministry or the Finance Minister are businessmen in general. They say they create employment. So, their industries are needed to be protected. On the other hand, we have 21 million consumers out there. Dilemma is that you can get products cheap from outside. We have to think of the living standard of people. That is the balance we need to strike. Ours is a small internal market. Sri Lanka has to be a trading hub basically. Markets are much wider outside. Markets outside in Asia are growing. Living standards of the Asian markets are growing. We have to attract investment. We do not have technology and investment to produce everything the Asian markets need. The Finance Minister talked about the liberalization of the shipping industry. We are not going to be ship builders. We certainly can provide all the services. We can certainly become the biggest and most efficient port in Asia. Now we are in South Asia. I am talking about Asia. That will come through liberalization only. 
I actually think Colombo will continue to the leading growing port. Hambantota is a buried investment. Certainly, we should grow Hambantota as well. We have converted it to a equity swap. 
Q You started all investments in the council sector ahead of the main elections scheduled. So, some people interpret it as a move for vote catching. What is your response
I would not say that. We have been under tremendous pressure to abandon our fiscal discipline. The Finance Ministry has not given into that pressure. We have tight fiscal discipline. We are committed to bring the budget deficit down. We are committed to have an exchange rate that is globally competitive. When you look at the measures we are taking at the macro level, that assessment is completely untrue. We are changing only emphasis. There is no change in policies. We are not for turning or looking back on our economic policy. We want to be consistent. In all the macroeconomic indicators, we are positive. Of course, there are problems.

Sri Lanka has to be a trading hub basically. Markets are much wider outside. Markets outside Asia are growing. Living standards of the Asian markets are growing
Q There is a lot of criticism on the absence of a policy on Free Trade Agreements (FTA). As for the FTA with Singapore, almost all the professional bodies are opposed to it. What is the reason for it
I would say that this country has been a protected one. The level of protection has grown from 1990s. It is normal that when you are protected and in a safe comfortable zone, you do not want to move out of it. In 1977, JR Jayewardene took over the government. All the reform programmes were opposed at that time. What a good thing we did! That is what people said after 15 years. We liberalized. That was the period in which my mother waited in the list for ten years to get telephone facility. You can get a telephone instantly. If we are going to be the trading hub, we have to have agreements. We have arrangements with India. We are negotiating with China. Can you imagine having access to Indian and Chinese markets
If Singaporean investments are relocated here, we will have access to Southeast Asian markets. 

If we are going to be the trading hub, we have to have agreements. We have arrangements with India. We are negotiating with China. Can you imagine having access to Indian and Chinese markets

Hugging the honeypot!
	
A story that has gone viral in the public service sector tells a lot about the doings of a white-collar bigwig of a Ministry who is taking an extra special interest in tender affairs in the 32 establishments coming under the Ministry purview, they say.
The man is said to be personally handling all responsibilities connected with calling and awarding tenders in all these establishments leaving his other responsibilities in the hands of his deputies.
The high political authority in charge of the Ministry has given the white-collar bigwig a free hand to handle tender matters as he is assured of the lion share from the kick-backs being collected from favoured contractors, they say.

## Title: Improved infrastructure plays major role in real estate values  JLL Report

Improved infrastructure plays major role in real estate values  JLL Report
	
With the recent announcement that the much-anticipated Colombo Light Rail Transit (LRT) project is all set to proceed with Phase 1 following the green light from government ministries, there has been widespread speculation on its effect on the price of property within close proximity to the line. Taking into consideration various factors and an accumulation of relevant statistics, leading global real estate consultancy Jones Lang La Salle (JLL) has evaluated the relationship between this new infrastructure development and the value of real estate in Colombo.
Construction of the LRT is scheduled to commence as early as 2020 at a cost of USD1.7 billion - funded by Japanese government loans, and re-payable over 40 years, at 0.1% interest, and with a 12-year initial grace period.
The first line -travelling from Fort/Pettah to Malabe- is projected to begin commercial operations in 2024 and promises a considerably reduced travel time of approximately 30 minutes between the two termini. Phase 1 is reported to be fully elevated, with a total of 16 stops over the 15.3 km length of the line.
As is expected, with any major commercial development promising to bring with it added convenience and ease of travel, property prices en route are expected to spike.
In an attempt to assess the impact of the projected LRT terminal on real estate values, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. has considered both, history, and global case studies, for similar infrastructure improvements, in other geographies around the world -namely those in cities such as London and Dubai.
The correlation between real estate values and improved infrastructure is not a new phenomenon, and it was in London with the opening of the first Metropolitan underground line in 1863, that this was first observed.
Infrastructure has subsequently become the lifeblood of prosperity and confidence, driving sustainability, and, by upgrading inadequate systems, removing transport bottlenecks, with significant lifestyle improvements for those who benefit. However, with half the worlds population now living in urban areas, and, this set to increase by 50%, from 4 billion to 6 billion, over the next 15 years, the speed and scale of urbanization poses enormous challenges for local governments.
Closer to home in the monocentric city of Colombo, the urban population currently accounts for approximately 48% of the total population which is projected to increase to 72% by 2033. This rapid pace of urbanization underscores the need for discovering alternate channels to leverage the citys workforce and increase efficiency, thereby improving the standard of living of its citizens on par with the rest of the worlds leading metropolises.
However, in the case of Colombo where commercial activity is restricted to a single CBD, the pressure on existing infrastructure is more intense, and the cost of construction and disruption during the construction phase is much higher. As a result, sustainability is driving urban planners to move towards a polycentric model, where cities have multiple commercial sub centres -perhaps best illustrated in the model of new cities, such as Dubai, which in addition to the Sheikh Zayed/DIFC CBD, has numerous sub commercial hubs including Business Bay, The Marina, Jumeirah Lakes and Jebel Ali.
If Colombo is to alleviate chronic congestion issues and move towards a more sustainable, environmentally friendly, polycentric model with the intention of improving living standards for residents and driving commercial efficiencies for businesses, an integrated LRT system will prove to be vital to these goals. The suburb of Malabe, according to online data, already enjoys projected, year on year, land price increases of 16%, with per perch prices already approaching LKR1 million. This is partly due to good access to the southern expressway, and the proliferation of high tech IT and business parks providing excellent employment prospects for graduates from nearby educational institutions.
In this evaluation, the Thunen Rings Principal -the first mathematical model to explain agricultural land values in relation to distance from population centres, developed by Johann Heinrich von Thunen in 1826- has proven useful. Developed further by the American, William Alonso, in 1960, to become the Bid Rent Theory, land values, in relation to distance from a CBD or major infrastructure improvement, can now be quantified.

Slope A demonstrates that proximity to a major infrastructure improvement has less impact on the value of residential property, although the radius of influence is wider. Commercial property values rise higher than residential, although the radius of influence is narrower (slope B). In certain circumstances, where the infrastructure improvement may be a source of noise and air pollution, such as a major road, slope C demonstrates that there is an optimum distance from that source, for maximum value increase, too close and values may fall, due to adverse effects, too far and values begin to slide.
There have been numerous global studies on the impact of infrastructure improvements on property values, each with its own host of factors that influence the outcome, but it appears that whether road or rail, and from such diverse geographies as Brazil, Sweden and Dubai, there is very close correlation demonstrating value increases of between 6 and 12%. An ideal example is London, and the M25 orbital motorway, which opened in 1986. Over the 30 year period, since its opening, real estate values, for property in its vicinity, have risen a staggering 551%, or an average of 6% per annum, compounded.
Having stated this, it would still be prudent to consider two other interesting facts that emerge from such studies, that may influence a decision in investing in real estate where infrastructure developments are in the pipeline.
Firstly, commercial real estate, and lands, benefit from higher rises than residential real estate when road and rail improvements are delivered. Secondly, and perhaps, even more importantly, rental rates rise more than sale values in the residential sector. Studies in Dubai have shown that property sale values, within 0.5km from Metro stations, actually fell, and the optimum distance for values to rise, was 1.0 to 1.5 km, while rental rates rose sharply for properties within a 0.5 km radius of these transport hubs.
It can then be concluded that while there is more often than not a distinct correlation between improved infrastructure and property prices, there are other holistic factors to be considered that may just sway this relationship. Accordingly, owner/occupiers and buy to let investors would do well to conduct their own research before accepting sales pitches, that include price rise projections, at face value.

Indias bid to weed out illegal immigrants Clashes with tradition
	


The debate has far-reaching consequences for the concepts of nationality
	Critics find the Indian governments stand and Indias citizenship laws morally repugnant
	There were over 10 mn illegal immigrants in India -5.4 million in West Bengal and 4 million in Assam
	Anti-Muslim communal feelings that are at the root of the NRC exercise in Assam could spread to these places too creating communal tension

There is a heated controversy in India today over the preparation of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the Eastern Indian State of Assam.
The debate has far-reaching consequences for the concepts of nationality, citizenship and the traditional Indian ideal of building a composite, multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-linguistic India.
More immediately, the drafting of the NRC has posed an imminent threat to the citizenship of four million of the 40 million people of Assam, who might either be expelled or be allowed to live in India as Stateless people without civic rights.
Most of the illegals are Bengali-speaking Muslims who had allegedly migrated from East Pakistan/Bangladesh. If the exercise is extended to West Bengal and megacities like Mumbai and Delhi, as demanded by the activists of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), hundreds of thousands of Bengali-speaking Muslims living there could also face expulsion.
Anti-Muslim communal feelings that are at the root of the NRC exercise in Assam could spread to these places too creating communal tension.
Vote Bank Politics
With the Indian parliamentary elections due in May 2019, the NRC has triggered vote bank politics. While the BJP is whipping up Assamese majoritarian communalism in Assam and Hindu communalism in the rest of India the Congress and other parties are caught between the need to pander to the Assamese/Hindu majority while seeing that the religious and linguistic minorities stay with them.
Given Bangladeshs policy of not taking back anyone whose Bangladeshi citizenship cannot be proved with documents, the four million illegals in Assam could be declared Stateless and placed outside the pale of law in India. The Stateless would be a category without civic rights and liable to be exploited by State and non-State institutions and unscrupulous individuals.
Changing Idea of Citizenship
Once Hindu refugees from West and East Pakistan were accommodated after the partition of the Indian sub-continent in 1947, India conferred citizenship on all except those who were citizens of another country.
But the concept of citizenship based on birth came under assault in Assam in 1951. Assams porous border with East Pakistan which later became Bangladesh, led to unbridled immigration from East Pakistan/Bangladesh posing a demographic threat to the majority Hindu Assamese.
In an article dated August 1, 2018, Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recalled how the leaders of West and East Pakistan had eyed Assam.
Sheikh Muhibur Rahman, an East Pakistani leader who later became the founder of Bangladesh wrote in his book Eastern Pakistan: Its Population and Economics:
Because Eastern Pakistan must have sufficient land for its expansion and because Assam has abundant forest and mineral resources, coal, petroleum etc., Eastern Pakistan must include Assam to be financially and economically strong.

NRC is unfair because it is heavily document-oriented, which is untenable in a country where very little is documented
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, one of the Prime Ministers of Pakistan, had said in his book entitled Myth of Independence:
It would be wrong that Kashmir is the only issue that divides India and Pakistan, though undoubtedly the most significant. One at least is nearly as important as the Kashmir dispute, is that of Assam and some districts of India adjoining East Pakistan. To these Pakistan has very good claims.
The Pakistan movement had a claim to Assam because of its sizable minority Muslim population and its contiguity to Muslim-majority East Pakistan / Bangladesh.
Over the years, given the relative poverty of East Pakistan / Bangladesh and growing opportunities in Assams agricultural sector, infiltration of Bengali-speaking Muslims into Assam took place on a large scale.
On May 6, 1997, Indian Home Minister Indrajit Gupta, told Parliament that there were over 10 million illegal immigrants residing in India, of whom 5.4 million were in West Bengal and 4 million in Assam.
In its ruling in the Sarbananda Sonowal vs Union of India case in 2005, the Indian Supreme Court said: The dangerous consequences of large scale illegal migration from Bangladesh, both for the people of Assam and more for the Nation as a whole, need to be emphatically stressed. No misconceived and mistaken notions of secularism should be allowed to come in the way of doing so.
As a result of population movement from Bangladesh, the spectre looms large of the indigenous people of Assam being reduced to a minority in their home State. Their cultural survival will be in jeopardy, their political control will be weakened and their employment opportunities will be undermined.
The silent and invidious demographic invasion of Assam may result in the loss of geo-strategically vital districts of lower Assam.
The influx of these illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region. It will then be a matter of time when a demand for their merger with Bangladesh may be made.
The rapid growth of international Islamic fundamentalism may provide for driving force for this demand. In this context, it is pertinent that Bangladesh has long discarded secularism and has chosen to become an Islamic State.
Loss of lower Assam will sever the entire land mass of North-East, from the rest of India and the rich natural resources of that region will be lost to the Nation.
Accords
Arun Jaitley recalls that on September 30, 1972, the Congress government said that those Bangladeshi nationals who had come to India before 25th March 1971 were to be detected but those who entered India in or after the said date were to be repatriated. This was reiterated in the Assam Accord signed on August 15, 1985.
However, the application of the law was lax. In the 50 years between 1961 and 2011, the majority (Hindu) community in Assam has grown 2.4 times; but the minority has grown 3.9 times, Arun Jaitley pointed out.
Making a distinction between refugees and illegal immigrants he said: The receiving nation can, on humanitarian grounds, be considerate to refugees in terms of providing them with the basics of life. Refugees have not conferred citizenship. Refugees dont become voters. Some pre-1971 migrants from East Pakistan may have moved for reasons of persecution, the same is not true of all post-1971 migrants who have illegally entered India.
Then there is a third category, who are neither citizens nor refugees, who come for reasons of economic opportunity. These are illegal migrants. Their entry is a silent invasion of the country to which they move, he asserted.
Critics Point to Inhumanity of NRC
But critics find the Indian governments stand and Indias citizenship laws morally repugnant.
They cite Indias traditional commitment to building a secular and non-discriminatory society; its past openness to admitting persecuted people or distressed people irrespective of their background and describe the NRC process as an inhuman one and a violation of international law.
Shuvro Prosun Sarker, in his 2014 paper Reducing Statelessness: A New Call for India says that since India is not a party to international refugee conventions, it should go by the ICCPR, which applies to both citizens and non-citizens.
Rending people Stateless is a human rights violation as per international law, he submits.
Neeraja Gopal Jayal, author of the book Citizenship and its Discontents says that the NRC is unfair because it is heavily document-oriented, which is untenable in a country where very little is documented. She regrets that India has become narrow-minded and committed to exclusions even at the cost of humanity.

M Karunanidhi passes away at 94
	
Former Tamil Nadu CM and DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi passed away after battling illness at the Kauvery hospital in Chennai on Tuesday. The 94-year-old leader was earlier shifted to the hospital on the intervening night of July 27-28 after his blood pressure fell. On July 31, the hospital said Karunanidhi would require an extended period of hospitalisation due to decline in his general health, although his vital parameters have normalised.
Earlier in the day, Kalaignars health deteriorated and the hospital said, Despite the maximum medical support, his vital organ functions continue to deteriorate. His condition is extremely critical and unstable.
July marked 49 years of the leader taking charge as the party chief. Karunanidhi was the first leader to enter the 50th year as the president of a political party. He became Tamil Nadus CM in 1969 for the first time and had held the position in the state five times, with the last tenure being in 2006. The patriarch had retreated from mainstream politics in 2016 after being diagnosed with a drug-induced allergy and his son, M K Stalin, took over as the working president of the party.
Karunanidhi had not been keeping well since October 2016 and recently had undergone a procedure to change his tracheostomy tube, to help him breathe. Working DMK president and Karunanidhis son, M K Stalin had said that Karunanidhi was suffering from fever and doctors were providing medication as he assured there was nothing to worry about the 94-year-old leaders health. A medical bulletin released by the Kauvery hospital on August 6 read, There has been a decline in the medical condition of Kalaignar Dr M Karunanidhi, DMK President and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. He is on continuous monitoring and being treated with active medical support. His response to the medical intervention over the next 24 hours will determine the prognosis.
Several senior DMK leaders, including M K Stalin, daughter Kanimozhi, his family members and other frontline leaders were present at the hospital when the leader breath his last. Karunanidhis estranged son and former DMK leader M K Alagiri, who was expelled from the party by Karunanidhi in January 2014 after a prolonged struggle for power with his younger brother Stalin also visited him in the hospital.
Earlier, President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, Congress president Rahul Gandhi among other senior politicians had visited the DMK patriarch in Kauvery hospital and prayed for his speedy recovery.
Karunanidhi, who enjoyed a cult figure in the state, had been known as one of the fierce adversaries of late AIADMK chief Jayalalitha, post-MGR period. His first election speech in 2016 had created a stir and momentum when he nicknamed Jayalalithaa a Maharani (princess).
Known for his oratorical skills, Karunanidhi identified himself with the common man. I am one of your brothers, I am one of your children. I am talking from my heart. Only if Dravida rule comes, Dravida makkal will get a good life, he would say, adding that he came to visit them not to seek votes alone, but to bring a change. (Indian Express)

Magnanimity of a doting husband!
	

A white-collar high-up who has offered the post of coordinating secretary to his wife has also provided a separate office to her on a different floor in the building. The magnanimity of the doting husband has not stopped at that; he has also given her two assistant secretaries too though she has hardly any work to do!

Despite receiving a regular monthly salary, the lady is said to be attending office only by fits and starts. And when she does attend, she does not formally register her attendance either.
Meanwhile, another white-collar subordinate occupying a cubicle adjoining the high-ups office room is attending to the work expected of a coordinating secretary. Only the top four high-ups of this establishment are exempt from the requirement of registering their attendance. The lady is also enjoying this privilege unofficially, they say.

New Head of Operations at the Sustainable Future Group
	
Dhishna Bastiansz-Head of Operations at the Sustainable Future Group
Sri Lankas leading environmental certification organization The Sustainable Future Groupnamed its new Head of Operations recently. Dhishna Bastiansz brings an admirable track record of achievement in market research, marketing and advertising communications fields. With approximately 10 years of Account Management experience in international adverting agencies, DDB,O&M and JWT, she joined local firm Q&E as its Director Account Management, before moving on to the position of General Manager of Quantum Strategic Services, a leading player in the local market research industry. After a brief stint with The Nielson Company, she spent over 6 years as Head, Qualitative Research Business for Lanka Market Research Bureau. Prior to taking on her role at The Sustainable Future Group - she was the Director Research & Strategic Planning at Bates Strategic Alliance.
Commenting on the new appointment, FarisFausz - Executive Director of SFG said Dhishna brings a wealth of industrial and marketing experience with her, which will no doubt help SFG to work closely with our industrial and corporate clients and to better focus and shape our service offering, so that we can remain relevant and viable, but while retaining our core proposition of trust and integrity in the work we do. The certification and brand marks that have been developed and offered by SFG are founded on the principles of mitigating environmental impact and are structured to mirror the most globally accepted protocols in each instance. We have worked to better understand the complexities at hand faced by local business and are on a continual journey to better the countrys environmental situation through active engagement with the private sector. With synergies now being achieved between national ideological and political views, the private sector will have an increasingly important role to play in facilitating the countrys transition toward a more environmentally friendly nation. We see SFG as having a strong role to play in ensuring the transparency, accuracy and integrity of the environmental claims made by industry and I believe Dhishnas appointment will give added impetus toward the achievement of our shared vision.
The Sustainable Future Group (SFG) was created to provide the missing link for private sector organizations in the Asia Pacific region with a verification, validation & assurance body that exists to enlighten, engage and empower organizations by ensuring that sustainability is placed at the forefront of their businesses.
SFG was one of the first in the region to be awarded ISO 14064 accreditation from the International Accreditation Forum (IAF)  the global governing body for accreditation of inspection, verification, testing and certification companies, through its local representative, the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB). This enables SFG to provide verification and certification services for ISO 14064 - 1 & 2: Principles and Requirements at Organization and Project Levels for Quantification and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Removals.

Our courts  not up to  the mark : Maithri Gunaratne
	
It is not the politicians who are most corrupt, but the govt. officials
	The UNP was never a party which robbed and plundered the country
	Gota is a strict disciplinarian who loves the country passionately
	We cant be fully confident that a person is tried and given capital punishment fairly
	I have four guns in my possession

During an interview with the Daily mirror , Maithri Gunaratne the former provincial councillor from Galle who formed a new political party titled United National Freedom Front speaks about the weakness of the Yahapalana Government. He was also the former Chairman of the Lanka Coal Company (LCC) and Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation.
Excerpts-
Q Who is responsible for the failure of the Yahapalana government
The blame will mainly go to the President for failing to keep his promise to the people that good governance will be established. The Prime Minister, who was considered to be an Economic Guru too, has failed to show his so-called talents. However, nobody can place the blame on the Opposition parties because no matter what the government is, the Opposition plays its role. The real Opposition is actually played by the media now.
Q Why do you think the relationship between the President and Prime Minister became sour, creating the ongoing conflict
There was an unsigned agreement between Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena. After the Central Bank bond scam was exposed, where everyone pointed fingers at the Prime Minister for having brought Arjuna Mahendran to the post of Central Bank Governor on his own decision without the consent of the President, this agreement was contaminated.
I think now the President is in a very embarrassing situation where he is not in a position to remove the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the majority of the UNPers voted for him in 2015 Presidential Election. By not taking any action against the Prime Minister, he is pushing himself into a corner. The relationship between Prime Minister and President has become sour because of their own conduct.

Q As you think, to what extent does the bond scam seem to have affected the UNP
The UNP never had an image of a party which robbed and plundered the country. The UNP has always been responsible for developing the country by creating jobs, building houses and launching new development projects. Due to the bond scam, the credibility of the party and its leader has been shattered. It is difficult to restore that credibility because people do not have confidence towards the UNP now.
Q You were with those who called for a change of the leadership of the UNP. But it didnt happen. Instead, the same personalities exchanged their duties within the party. Any comments
I was not really surprised at all because I know whenever there is a need for the leadership change in the UNP, only the officials are changed.
Whatever is said and done, the UNP which is a national party has a pervasive role to play for the betterment of the people. Nowadays, people are sick of politicians because 90% of politicians dont even have their Ordinary Level qualifications. It is a party like the UNP that can make a change and set an example by presenting educated candidates for politics. But, where is the example being set
Q How do you see the future of the UNP
Right now, there is no one who is able to revive the party. If there is someone with the genuine interest to build the party, that person would have shown it already. No one has done that so far. Unfortunately, not a single UNP politician is showing that future promise of a good leader.
They do not mean to give good governance. They perfectly know how to practise good governance and all about the concept. They just used the concept as a motto for their political campaigns without having any intention of really putting the motto into practice.

He was responsible in finishing the LTTE. Although Mahinda was ruling the country back then and Sarath Fonseka was handling the Army, it was Gotabaya Rajapaksa who put all efforts together

Q A few months ago, you were arrested by the Kadugannawa Police while having two guns in your possession. Why do you have to keep firearms in your possession Do you receive constant threats from someone
Not two, I have four guns in my possession. Since 1988, I have been going through the brunt of the JVP. My father had a narrow escape from death from an assassination attempt of the JVP. From that time onward, I am legally keeping weapons for my self-defence.
Q What is your opinion regarding the Presidents decision for capital punishment
I also believe imposing capital punishment is good, but when the Sri Lanka Police Department, Attorney Generals Department and the Judiciary system are corrupt, we cant be fully confident that a person is tried fairly and given capital punishment fairly. The efficiency of these organizations is questionable. I strongly believe that a court case should not take more than two years to conclude and give the verdict.
People no longer have faith in these systems. That is why people are taking the law into their hands and it is obvious in the everyday news where people kill other people in broad daylight. If the government keeps eyes closed, people are going to take more issues into their hands.
Q There was a questionable major coal tender. A week after you spoke about coal deals at Sri Lankas expense, you were removed from the post of Chairman Lanka Coal Company (LCC). Later, you were again removed from your position as Chairman of Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation. Can you share with us your experience at those two institutions
While working at the Lanka Coal Company, I exposed a fraud that took place there. Without investigating my complaint, they chased me out. Later, I led the Lanka Mineral Sands Limited which is one the richest companies in the country. Within four months, the institution which was at a stake could earn Rs. one billion.
I was also able to increase the production largely. But, later the authorities kicked me out. There is no place in this country for honest people to work. Only rogues and people who want to play out are allowed to work in the government sector.
The government willingly keeps questionable people in the organizations while honest people who are not chasing after money and personal perks are being removed. How do we expect the country to prosper at this rate
I also want to note one of the most important facts. It is not the politicians who are most corrupt. The government officials are the most corrupt people and those government officials are coming from universities with degrees and all educational qualification to rob public money. They still continue corruption in any government because of the simple reason that ministers do not know their subjects.
Obviously, we cannot expect any good thing from such ministers who have not even passed their Ordinary Level examinations.
Such Ministers, intimidated by corrupt government officials who have degrees and Masters in the relevant Ministry subjects, sign whatever document brought by those officials.
When people hire drivers to drive their own vehicles, they check the drivers licences, medical histories, professional histories and many other factors, because the people do not want their vehicles to get smashed up. But, when the same people select politicians to run the country, they cast their votes for politicians just because their grandparents voted for them irrespective of whether those politicians could run the country or not.
Q Supreme Court Judges recused themselves from hearing the Fundamental Rights Petition filed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Meanwhile, the Attorney General had informed the Supreme Court about a Contempt of Court case against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake over insulting remarks against the judiciary and the lawyers. What is your opinion
First of all, at least we should be happy that those judges recused themselves from the court case rather than hearing the case and giving a biased verdict. When it comes to the standards of law, our courts are not still up to the mark. The Bail Act is not being practised in a proper manner in this country.

The UNP never had an image of a party which robbed and plundered. The UNP has always been responsible for ... Due to the bond scam, the credibility of the party and its leader has been shattered. It is difficult to restore that credibility because people do not have confidence towards the UNP now...
Q During a recent press conference, did you say that Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the most suitable to run for Presidency in the next Presidential Election How do you support your statement
Out of the three Rajapaksa brothers including Chamal, Basil and Gotabaya, I would choose Gotabaya for the presidential candidacy.
He was responsible in finishing the LTTE war. Although Mahinda Rajapaksa was ruling the country back then and Sarath Fonseka was handling the Army, it was Gotabaya Rajapaksa who put all efforts together.
If we talk about urban development, Gotabaya was able to completely change Colombo City. This was what the UNP was famous for. The UNP could do a lot of development in this country in the past. But, they are currently going in a negative path.
Further, Gota is a strict disciplinarian. This country really needs a strict disciplinarian who loves the country passionately. I think he has these qualifications.
Q How do you think a person like Gota whose name has been linked with 2012 Welikada Riots where 27 inmates were killed, MIG deal and Avant Garde case, is suitable for the Presidency
Well yeah, his name is linked with all those mentioned cases. But, even after three and a half years, he was not even arrested for any of those cases if he was guilty. The Yahapalana government was not able to nail him if he is involved in those cases. This government having had the power to bring him to book and prove the charges against him, they did nothing. So, should we keep going on speculations
Q What is your response to the controversial statement made by Former Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran about the LTTE
I met and spoke to the people of Jaffna a month ago and I am telling you this with full responsibility. If the government keeps ignoring and does not help the people in Jaffna, they will take up arms.
We dont want it to happen again in this country. Vijayakala took one step forward and made that statement. As she said there was ongoing harassment in various manner to women in the North. It is only going to show that there is no law and order there. However, under any condition, the people of this country cannot go for another war with Muslims, Tamils or any other people.

Playboy has become a nuisance!
	

A playboy- local politico of a mini-council in an area well-known for its historic rock has become a big nuisance to young girls working at an establishment responsible for supplying safe drinking water, they say.

This elderly cupid is in the habit of making passes at the young girls when they are on their way to work or back home. And he would threaten those who repulse his advances to transfer out to a distant place, they say.
This politico holding a deputy post is said to be a close buddy of the leader of his party.

Post of Opp. leadership: Uproar in Parliament
	
Parliament was in a state of chaos today when the joint opposition asked Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to give a ruling on the request it had made to appoint one of their members as the leader of the opposition.
Heated arguments were heard when JO parliamentary group leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardane asked whether the Speaker would give a ruling on this matter.
We made a written request to appoint a new opposition leader from the JO and you promised to give a ruling on it today. We like to know your decision with regard to this matter, the MP said. He said the JO was eligible to hold the opposition leaders post because it had the support of 70 members in the House. "We have nothing against the incumbent Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan but our point is that this post is traditionally given to the group which has most number of seats in the Opposition, the MP said.
JO MP Dallas Alahapperuma recalled that MP Anura Bandaranaike was appointed as the Acting Leader of Opposition followinga request by a majority of members in the Opposition despite Mr. K.B. Ratnayake being named by the then Opposition Leader to the post when she was going abroad in 1993. He said Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva was named Opposition Leader in January 2015 despite some UPFA MPs accepting ministerial posts in the 100-day government.
Opposition MP Susil Prenajantha said the Speakers decision to call for the opinion of UPFA general secretary was not a proper thing to do. He said the party in the opposition which has the most number of seats should hold the opposition leaders post.
JO MP Vasudeva Nanaykkara said the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) had called for an explanation from the Speaker on not having appointed a JO member to this post.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said all UPFA members who are holding ministerial posts should resign and sit in the Opposition if a new opposition leader is to be appointed from another group. The HO members are ones who contested from the UPFA and if an opposition leader is to be appointed from that group the UPFA members who hold ministerial posts should resign and sit in the opposition, he said. TNA MP M.S. Sumanthiran also expressed similar views.
Minister Harin Fernando said the issue was nothing but rift within the UPFA. He said the matter with regard to leader of opposition would be settled if the rift in the UPFA is solved.
UNP MP Thushara Indunil said all back bench MPs of his party had decided to crossover to the opposition and claim the opposition leaders post if a member in the joint opposition group is appointed to this post.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

In reply to a question raised by a journalist, the former President said that there is no truth in the statement made by Anura Kumara Dissanayake to the affect that there are deals between himself and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He is the one who struck deals during elections, and still he continues with these deals. Anura Kumara is the one who strikes deals even with the President. Despite Anura Kumara being the leader of the JVP he only speaks in Parliament matters that are favourable to the Prime Minister, he said. (Athula Bandara)

Prestantia Music School brimming with talent
	
Prestantia Music School's Junior Choir with Doctor Priyeshini P. Perera and Mr. Wasantha Geekiyanage

I recently had the privilege of spending a Sunday evening with the talented young choristers of Prestantia Music School.
To say I was blown away by the talent of the youngsters merrily warbling away to the tunes of The Greatest Showman, would be an understatement to say the least.
A lot of people find it hard to believe just how good these little ones are, being able to witness them perform and do what they do best in their home turf was truly a wonderful experience.
The international award-winning champion choir comprises of 25 children, professionally trained and directed by Doctor Priyeshini Pieris Perera, who is also the founder of Prestantia Music School.
The choir is backed by Doctor Perera on Piano and Mr. Wasantha Kumara Geekiyanage as the voice instructor.
Founded in 2012 with only two students, the growth of Prestantia in numbers and student accolades in an extremely short period of time is commendable. Doctor Priyeshinis vision was to return to Sri Lanka after her doctorate and create opportunities that she never had growing up. Although the music school has been around for six years, the choir has been formed very recently. Prestantia, meaning excellence in Italian is definitely more than apt to describe this set of extremely talented youngsters.
I remember having to travel all the way from Moratuwa to Colombo to further my advanced studies in Piano. Moratuwa is known to be a town of musicians and most of them are self-taught. I knew I had to do something more than that. After completing my doctorate, I wanted to educate the next generation of musicians professionally. We are a close-knit lot and therefore Prestantia has become more of a community music school.
We have been in existence for about five and a half years and our biggest achievement I would say is being awarded the Gold diploma at the Asia Pacific Choir Games in 2017. It also earned us the qualification to represent Sri Lanka at the Grand Prix of Nations. We havent had any sort of exposure on an international level until last year. said Doctor Priyeshini.
The students have a very strong sense of belonging to the school and are proud to be a part of Prestantia Music School. The junior choir has also been invited to perform at the 2018 Chengdu International Childrens Chorus Week in August.
They will be representing Sri Lanka while junior choirs from Germany, Australia, South Korea, Czech Republic, Russia, New Zealand and 12 other choirs from mainland China. Chengdu international Childrens Chorus Week is a glamorous International cultural program hosted in China. Each of the countries will represent their culture through music.


I love music, I always sing and I love playing the piano. Prestantia Music School and the choir has become such a big part of my life.
-Chethaitwa (10)


Singing is my favorite thing to do in the world and Prestantia music school gives me the backing I need to learn music and I have a lot of fun here as well.
-Shayini (10)

The choir has given me the opportunity to show my talent to the world. I didnt know I could sing like this until I came to prestantia Music School. I got to participate in lots of competitions and I got a lot of opportunities to show the world how much of talent I have in me and Im really proud of it.
-Dilendri (13)

I have a lot of fun here and I get to learn so much as well. I get to learn in a fun way. I am so proud to be a part of the choir.
-Ihaan (11)


I joined the Prestantia Music School for voice training and with each year. I could see a big improvement. I could pitch the higher notes very well. And I think that others should also come here to learn music and they are most welcome.
-Shaun (12)
Im so proud of what we have achieved so far as a music school and a choir.I feel like we are getting the exposure we deserve. It makes me really happy.
-Tiara (14)


I joined the choir last year and the experience has been amazing. Its so fun, we enjoy a lot. We train hard but we have so much fun too.

Prez rejects perks for MPs monitoring 'Gam Peraliya'
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have turned down a Cabinet paper submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking office and staff facilities for MPs assigned to oversee the implementation of the governments Gam Peraliya programme.
The recommendation has been made by a committee comprising officials including the Secretary to the Prime Minister and the Finance Ministry.
The Prime Minister submitted the Cabinet paper on behalf of the committee. The committee had recommended that each MP assigned to monitor the programme implementation was provided with a separate office and a staff of seven.
The government had earlier decided to assign the MPs who do not hold ministerial posts for this purpose.
The President had reportedly rejected the Cabinet paper saying it was unnecessary and also turned down a Cabinet paper put forward by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama seeking to allow ministers to retain private lawyers at government expense in fundamental rights cases filed against them.
The President said they could retain lawyers only from the Attorney Generals Department. (Kelum Bandara)

The National Freedom Front (NFF) today accused the Police of not taking steps to arrest those responsible for the Wadduwa tragedy where four persons died during a Facebook party at a hotel's beach front in Wadduwa.
NFF national organizer Jayantha Samaraweera told a news briefing that the Police was unable to take action because there was a prominent politician involved in organizing the beach party.
According to the information we have gathered, then Mount Lavinia Police OIC Chief Inspector Lalith Weerasinghe was transferred to the Wadduwa Police on the instruction of a prominent politician in South while the Wadduwa Police OIC was transferred to Dodangoda Police Station.We found that the organizers had obtained a liquor license, a permit for the use of loudspeakers with security provided by Avant Garde Security Service, Mr. Samaraweera said.

## Title: Reflections on the language of my birth

Reflections on the language of my birth
	

There are times when I lament my abysmal knowledge of Sinhala. It is a language of course, but even as a language it takes much more than memorising grammar rules and vocabulary to master it. Being a dilettante when it comes to these matters, I never really picked it up. Poetry eludes me, so does prose. I tried my hand at writing a few essays there and a few love poems here, but the experience was so overwhelming that I gave up. This was years ago. I havent tried again since. In hindsight, this can indicate fear, ignorance, complacency, or a lack of willpower, depending on how you look at it. My excuse is that without getting steeped in the foundation of a language, without understanding the historical processes behind a language, it is difficult to be creative.
Professor K. A. I. Kalyanaratne, former co-honorary secretary of the Hela Havula, in a review of Cumaratunga Munidasas Purana Sinhala Akuru Karanaya, contended that it is a language which separates us from the animal world. I strongly agree. Language is what makes civilisation possible, and civilisation is what facilitates identity on the basis of shared rituals and practices. Perhaps no other intellectual and artiste from the 20th century understood this in relation to the Sinhala language more than Munidasa himself, whose death anniversary fell on July 25. No, this is not a sketch of the man, much less an exploration into what he did, rather some brief reflections on his work.
Garrett Field, in his seminal but overlooked work Modernising Composition, contends that the modern history of linguistic politics in Sri Lanka begins with Cumaratunga.
Put briefly, the man tried to do for the language what the revivalists of the previous century had done for Buddhism. It was his belief that purity in language, the maw basa, shorn of foreign accretions, was integral to the ideal of nationhood. There would not, in other words, be a desa and rasa without a basa. With this objective, he thus sought to redefine Sinhala, not just in relation to academic syllabuses (at one point he was appointed as an inspector of Anglo-Vernacular schools for the Department of Education), but also in opposition to the accepted texts which had been used to teach the subject. Based on these beliefs, he confidently rejected both the Sasadavata and the Muvadevdavata, which contained Sanskrit loanwords he felt to be inimical to his project. He was not, in other words, afraid of rebuking what needed to be rebuked.

Cumaratunga Munidasas poetry rises from its pages and implores us to musicalise it
There were three faces to the man: linguist, poet, and activist. Contemporary society and scholarship tend to analyse each facet in isolation, forgetting that it is the fusion of them, and not the study of one over the other, which can help us understand what the man did and whether the project he spearheaded worked to its envisioned end. That is why his criticism of poets who imbibed Tagore cannot be seen as only an aesthetic judgment, but rather as an integral part of his belief in achieving purity in the markers of our identity. Not even the Mahavamsa was immune from his pen since it promoted the idea that the Sinhalese were descended from North India when historical records showed that there was a thriving help civilisation prior to the arrival of Vijaya.
I am certainly not up to the task of charting and tracing what Cumaratunga did in relation to Sinhala poetry, prose, and polemics, but I cannot help but observe that throughout his life, the man combined didacticism and austerity of expression to convey his beliefs to the lay reader, and to convince that reader. This proved to be a strength in later years. With Lakminipahana, Subasa, and Helio, the three journals which helped the Hela Havula disseminate its worldview throughout the country, he was able to turn his endeavours from the fringe project it could well have become to an active search for roots. And one demographic that he targeted, more than any other, was the child. No one who has read Kumara Gee, or sung such immortal classics as Ha Ha Hari Hawa, can fail to be moved by its nuances, a point made by former Speaker of the Parliament W. J. M. Lokubandara at the recently held Cumaratunga Munidasa Sisuvarama, where he observed that the mans poetry rises from its pages and implores us to musicalise it. There was nothing immobile about it, in other words.
The Cumuratunga Munidasa Sisuvarama is one noteworthy way through which his contribution to childrens literature is being sustained, and promoted, among the children of today. Begun in 2012 and organised by the Cumaratunga Munidasa Foundation, it rewards academic achievement in Sinhala by granting a scholarship to the student who obtains the highest mark for the subject at the Ordinary Level exams. And so it was. Professor Wimal Dissanayake, who wrote an extensive piece years ago on the route linguistics took in Sri Lanka through the Munidasa, spoke of the way the man brought tradition to modernity. This year, by contrast, the organisers focused on the poet in the man, seeing it fit to invite the leading academic on the subject in Sri Lanka, Professor Sunil Ariyaratne. Also, by contrast, this year saw just one winner, Senuki Vilara Gunaratne from Museaus College, with the event being unveiled at the much larger, more comfortable Western Province Aesthetic Resort, on the death anniversary of the Munidasa, July 25.

Garrett Field, in his seminal but overlooked work Modernising Composition, contends that the modern history of linguistic politics in Sri Lanka begins with Cumaratunga
Professor Ariyaratne spoke. He referred to some poems that, in his opinion, had not been researched into or analysed well before. He contended that these poems could help us gain insights into the mans innermost beliefs. Just as the moon brightens the night sky as a thousand stars cannot, so can one good child brighten up his parents life in a way that many bad children cannot, he quoted, observing that it was the mans didacticism, combined with the many metaphors he borrowed from everyday life, which made his poetry stand out. To this end, a few observations made by that other renowned critic of the Sinhala poem, Gunadasa Amarasekara, might be pertinent here.
In an article titled Cumaratunga Munidasa the poet, later published in an anthology dedicated to the man (the first in a series titled Visidunu Vimasuma), Amarasekara roundly dismisses the two strands of poetry which dominated the first and second halves of the 20th century: respectively, the Colombo school and the nisadas (free verse) school. My contention is that Cumaratungas Piya Samara is greater than the work of either of these two groups, because of its originality and its efforts at going beyond the confines of the Kotte era, Amarasekara argues, observing that while the Colombo school, represented in its early years by Ananda Rajakaruna, sought to combine the form and meter of the Kotte Period with contemporary experience, it failed because, in his opinion, it deteriorated to a series of exercises in aestheticism, more preoccupied with its own workings as he suggests or rather implies.
This can, depending on how you view Amarasekaras critique, be taken to mean that while the Colombo poets (who imbibed not just the likes of Thotagamuwe Rahula Thera, but also the Lake Poets from England) found a reference point in the 15th and 16th centuries, they were unable to find a canvas for their inspiration in their society.
But while the likes of Rajakaruna failed to move from the 15th century, they did not make the error of erasing the fine distinction between prose and poetry, something Amarasekara argues the nisadas school committed. Amarasekaras distrust of free verse was shared even by contemporary English language poets, most famously Robert Frost, who once contended that writing it was like playing tennis with the net down. Because of the liberty taken by our free verse poets, the critic argues in his piece, Sinhalese writers began coming up with metaphors like adaraye simenthi (the cement of love) and jeevithaye bhumi thel (the fuel of life), implying of course that such metaphors made little to no sense and were a convenient cover for the writers laziness.

The Supreme Court has determined that certain sections of the Reparations Bill is inconsistent with the Constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed Parliament today.
He said sections 27(a) and 27 (A) (iii) of the Bill was inconsistent with Sections 4(D) and Section 3 of the Constitution and therefore the SC has stated that the Bill has to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the total number of members in the Parliament. The SC has also recommended that Bill should be approved by the people at a referendum and that the inconsistency could be removed if amendments were made in line with the directions it had given.
Reparations Bill provides provisions to set up an office to look into disappearances and pay compensation to the relatives who had gone missing especially during the war.

Warden Rev. Marc Billimoria witnessing the launch of the Alumni Web Portal

The Old Boys Association (OBA) of S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia re-launched their website, along with a new Alumni Portal, at the 2018 Batch Heads Dinner Ceremony hosted by the Warden, at the College Hall on August 3, 2018.
The Chief Guest at the ceremony was Mr Nanda Fernando, CEO of Sampath Bank, the exclusive event partner, and was attended by representatives of class groups and other alumni groups of the College and the Executive Committee of the OBA.
The new Alumni Portal, powered by the globally renowned Vaave Alumni Platform, enables its members to engage with each other and leverage the power of the entire alumni network.It also facilitates collaboration between the membership and the OBA in student development and other OBA projects.
The Alumni Portal is rich in features, such as Newsrooms, Facebook-like Discussion forums, Job Portals, Event Management capabilities, Mentorship programs for students or young old boys, and will soon boast even an online store for STC souvenirs and memorabilia.

Old boys should contact the administrator and provide your OBA membership number in order to gain full access
The Alumni Portal will also enable members to maintain rich member profiles, which will facilitate targeted communications and fast search for the OBA, while providing state-of-the-art security in order to maintain strict privacy of personal information. Members can also self-determine the level of visibility for (each attribute of) their personal information, to their batch mates and the broader membership.
The Alumni portal also has separate sections for Class Groups, Overseas Chapters and Special Interest Groups, providing a unified platform for alumni from different vintages, geographies and interests to come together, while maintaining their unique identities and interests.
Old boys of S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia, who wish to join the alumni network, may do so by visiting the website: www.stcmloba.com and following the links to Register or Join Network.
Upon registering to the portal, old boys, who are registered members of the OBA should contact the portal administrator (online) and provide your OBA membership number in order to gain full access to the features of the portal. Speaking at the occasion, the Warden, Rev. Marc Billimoria, stated that the Alumni Portal would be an ideal platform to enable the OBA to live up to the original objectives of Warden Miller, who first established the OBA With a view to the strengthening of the ties, which should bind a man to the place where, it is to be hoped, he has learned some of the most valuable lessons of life. Such a society in connection with S. Thomas College would, I think, promote this desirable result, but it would have a further very beneficial effect. It would be a means of giving lads (old boys) a sort of rallying point. They would be more likely to come under the good influence. They would be less liable to get lost sight of.
The Alumni Portal is one of many projects undertaken by the OBA to strengthen ties between the school and its alumni.
The Old Boys Association of S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia was established in 1886 and is one of the oldest Alumni associations in Sri Lanka.

Scores die quake hits Indonesian island again
	
Scenes of destruction greeted rescue workers across Indonesias resort island of Lombok on Monday, after an earthquake of magnitude 6.9 killed at least 98 people and prompted an exodus of tourists rattled by the second powerful quake in a week.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said it expected the death toll to rise once the rubble of more than 13,000 flattened and damaged houses was cleared away.
Power and communications were severed in some areas, with landslides and a collapsed bridge blocking access to areas around the quake epicentre in the north. The military said it would send a ship with medical aid, supplies and logistics support.
In a message on social network Twitter, the Indonesian Red Cross said it helped a woman give birth after the quake at a health post. One of the names she gave the baby boy was Gempa, which means earthquake.
Lombok was hit on July 29 by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano.
The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evenings quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) revised down to 6.9 from an initial 7.0. At that magnitude it released more than five times the energy of the quake a week earlier, the USGS website showed.

The deadly contrast: Mahinda  vs  Gota
	
Sri Lanka would go to a presidential election sometime during the next year as the presidency enters the final year of its five year term in January 2019. The prospect of a new Constitution, which may also require the approval in a referendum is diminishing. And even the constituent partners of the government are divided over the rationale of abolishing the executive presidency. A presidential election plus a general election should the president decide to dissolve Parliament after four and a half years into its term  is the most likely outcome. And it would also be a three way race, that pits Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, President Maithripala Sirisena, who has now gone back on his earlier commitment to not to seek a second term, and the Joint Opposition candidate, most likely Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The candidacy of Wickremesinghe and Sirisena would see anti-Rajapaksa voters divided and as the recent local government elections vindicated, the winner of this rivalry would be the Joint Opposition.
Gotabaya plays his presidential ambitions close to his chest, yet, despite the quirky calls for Chamal Rajapaksa or Dinesh Gunawardene as a potential presidential candidate, even those who make such claims know in deep down their hearts, that those gentlemen are yesterdays garbage, who neither inspire voters , nor have political courage for decisive policy.

In contrast, Gota is an autocrat first, and if ever, is a populist by pretense . For those like Gota, electoral legitimacy matters only until they achieve political power
In contrast, to give the devil his due, Gota is different. Being a Rajapaksa adds up to his electoral appeal. But, a good part of his image is built on not being a politician, though younger Rajapaksa was more powerful, and lethally so, than any politician during the presidency of his brother.
Gota speaks as if he has rendered himself unto his elder brother. If former President Mahinda Rajapaksa asks me to contest and to carry forward the ex-presidents mission, I would, he asserts. However, even MR knows Gota, who is unpredictable and a law unto himself is a dangerous choice. When he was the president, he used to tell the media, dont criticize Gota, criticize me. Those who count on Gota to be the reincarnation of MR may be committing a costly miscalculation. Gota is not MR.
Consider the contrast of their personalities 
Local and foreign political pundits tend to describe MR as authoritarian. Yes , he was, however, the operative word of Rajapaksas political character is that above all, he was and is a populist. Absolutism of his rule was subjective and was a predictable outcome of his populist legitimacy. In other words, MR was a populist first, and authoritarian later. 
In contrast, Gota is an autocrat first, and if ever, is a populist by pretense . For those like Gota, electoral legitimacy matters only until they achieve political power. Once there, rather than playing by the rules, they are more likely to rewrite them and to rely on the arbitrary force of the states coercive organs. The Rajapaksa administrations resort to white-vans and extra-judicial killings of prison inmates to address the law and order problem, at the expense of the very rule of law it was entrusted with to defend, was primarily a product of Gotas personal preference.
Those who terrorized the public with bed time stories of Idi Amin, during Sarath Fonsekas presidential campaign now has a real prospect to worry about.
MR was a populist to the extent that he was so cocksure that he would win the popular vote, that he disregarded opposition from his advisors to call snap elections one and half years before the end of his presidential term. When he lost, he left power gracefully, perhaps because, he knew he would make a comeback. Gota may not. Electoral mandate would not matter much in a Gota presidency. There will be other layers of state power through which he derives legitimacy and obedience. If MR was a Hugo Chavez,Gota is more likely to become an Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,Egypts Army chief-turned President, who exploited popular grievance to capture power and then made an ass out of the countrys nascent democracy.

MR was a populist to the extent that he was so sure that he would win the popular vote, that he disregarded opposition from his advisors to call snap elections 18 months before the end of his presidential term
Nonetheless, MRs populism had its constraints. The economic windfall at the end of the war provided him with time, space, and sufficient legitimacy to address the structural problems of the economy. MR squandered that opportunity because he valued his political calculations over the long term viability of the economy. When the post- war bonanza fizzled away, economic troubles, hitherto suppressed and unattended, magnified. His government spent US $ 2.5 billion to defend the value of an over-priced rupee. By the last year of his government (2014), exports as a share of the GDP halved from their 2000 value (33%). The Electricity board and Petroleum Cooperation accumulated looming losses due to unaffordable subsidies. National carrier was ran to the ground. He left a right royal mess for his successor to clean up.
Perhaps, Gota might have been more proactive. As much as he was willing to send Police STF to evict slum dwellers, he was also not inclined to feed the people with subsidized sprats and lentils. Some of the much talked about feats of the Rajapaksa administration such as Colombo beautification was made possible due to Gotas cold-hearted determination.

Nonetheless, MRs populism had its constraints. The economic windfall at the end of the war provided him with time, space, and sufficient legitimacy to address the structural problems of the economy

However, there is a glitch. Even the dictators need a group of competent advisors to run the economic policy. Pinochet had Chicago boys, young economists trained in the University of Chicago; pro-American autocrats in East Asia had their American advisors. Who has Gota got Majority of the so- called intelligentsia in Viyath Maga are no name nobodies, who are more at ease in parroting long lost economic theories of a middle path, which has proved to be a road to nowhere. They imbibe a nostalgia for the 1956, a populist misadventure that deprived the country of its hitherto held competitive advantage, leading us to the depravity of sending our women to toil in the Middle East. There is also a sense of strong opposition from his backers towards free trade agreements. Though such opposition is shrouded in the concerns for saving local jobs, the untold desire is to maintain the rotten status quo that favours a few under-performing industries at the expense of the future of a nation. 
At the end, running a country is far more complicated than evicting squatters in Kompannavediya. If the panacea for the efficient governance is enlarging the role of military in public life, Pakistan could now have been an economic miracle. Gotas hype does not provide solutions to complex problems that Sri Lanka is currently faced with. Still, more than anything else, the current governments failure to provide a strong leadership continues to provide currency to that farce.

Unhealthy for SL to raise funds through 'Panda bonds' : JO
	
The Central Banks move to raise US$250 million through Chinas Panda bonds is not healthy and clearly shows that the CBs authority to obtain loans has been handed over to the People's Bank of China, the joint opposition (JO) said today.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana told a news briefing that the People's Bank of China would issue Panda bonds to Chinese citizens on a request made by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
The Panda bonds are issued to Chinese citizens and later converted to US dollars from Renminbi. Our Central Bank is so bankrupt that it is now asking China to issue bonds to its citizens to raise US$250 million on our behalf, he said.
The MP said the financial chaos in the country was spinning out of control because of inefficient economic management and the resultant decrease in foreign reserves.
He said Sri Lankas foreign reserves worth US$9.9 billion in April 2018 had dropped to US$8.4 billion at the end of July.
What happened to the US$1.5 billion within such a short time The simple answer is that the Central Bank has released dollars to the market to artificially prevent the rupee value against the US dollar from hitting 200. In May and June, it released US$357 million to the market to prevent the rupee from depreciating. The CB should reveal whether it used the entire US$1.5 billion for this purpose. On the one hand CB is releasing dollars into the market and on the other hand it is raising money through Panda bonds, the MP said.
He said the President and the Prime Minister should intervene and prevent an economic collapse. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: What is Science   why Empiricism and Rationalism depend on each other

What is Science   why Empiricism and Rationalism depend on each other
	
The jump from observed to unobserved is not empiricism but rationalism, which cannot be solved in empiricism alone in Western Philosophy
	Induction, as mentioned, however could be tested, which brings us back to a form of empiricism

Is there a specific method of acquiring knowledge, which is peculiar to Western science Starting with Francis Bacon up to Thomas Kuhn, perhaps the Philosophers of Science had thought so, though the methods that they had identified were not the same.
They agreed that Science differed from other subjects and systems of knowledge mainly because there was a Scientific Method in acquiring knowledge. Paul Feyerabend on the other hand was of the opinion that there was no scientific method as such.
The Western science that is supposed to understand an already existing nature, is not very much different from other disciplines but that does not mean that there is no difference at all between Science and other systems of knowledge.
Western thinking is based on dualities and the so-called scientific methods are categorized under either empirical or rationalistic headings.
In empiricism, sense experience is primary, while rationalists are associated with the deductive method.
Bacon is supposed to be an empiricist while Galileo is called a rationalist who followed the deductive methods.
This is an unnecessary categorization, as there are neither pure rationalists nor pure empiricists from the time of ancient Greeks in the Western tradition.
Induction (inductive reasoning) does not come under logic, but arises from the extension of a property of some members of a population from a limited number of observations in a sample(s) of the population to the entire membership of the population, whether on a statistical basis or not. The population could be infinite. It is not different from having an idea in rationalism in the Western tradition.
Rationalism begins with basic ideas that may be in the form of axioms or hypotheses or whatever one calls them, all of which will be called axioms hereafter.
The jump from observations of a property of a limited number of members of a population to all the members of the population, whether it is finite or not, will be called a generalization.
There is no empirical basis for this jump, and is based on an axiom. Neither is there any logic in an Aristotelian sense.
It does not follow any rule of inference. It is an idea or a hypothesis as in Western Rationalism.
Generalizations come under rationalism in Western Philosophy. Generalizations in a finite population are said to be concrete, when the generalization could be imagined.
Otherwise, a generalization is said to be abstract. These generalizations are results of a process known as inductive reasoning.
When it is said that induction does not come under logic, it means that induction is not deductive starting from a set of Axioms using rules of inference and Aristotelian two valued two-fold logic.
Inductive statements are not different from axioms, which need not be observed for the entire population. They are ideas imposed on the population. For example, the oft quoted statementAll men are mortal cannot be observed, and it is an abstract generalization.
The syllogism in a way can also be considered as a test. For example, consider the syllogism:
All men are mortal
Socrates is a man
Socrates is mortal.
The statement All men are mortal is obtained from a limited number of observations by generalization. It is an induction.
If one considers syllogism as a deduction, it is not significant, as Socrates is mortal is included in the premise All men are mortal.
It is transparent at the very beginning and the so-called deduction has no significance.
However, one can consider it as a test of the generalization or the Axiom all men are mortal. Here is Socrates. If Socrates is mortal as implied by the Axiom then the axiom holds. Otherwise, the Axiom is invalid, and inductive knowledge all men are mortal is not consistent with observations.
The jump from observed to unobserved is not empiricism but rationalism, which cannot be solved in empiricism alone in Western Philosophy.
This is one of the problems that David Hume associated with induction, which has no solution within the sphere of pure empiricism.
Most of the problems of Hume including causality arose from being a pure empiricist, if one may say so. Western thinking, or more specifically Chinthanaya (it is much more than thinking) is dualistic, and empiricism and rationalism are considered as two tight compartments without any interaction or association (ontology and epistemology constitute another duality).
Induction, as mentioned, however, could be tested, which brings us back to a form of empiricism.
On the other hand, deductions in rationalism in Western Knowledge make use of rules of inference, which are obtained through induction.
The rule if a=c and b=c, then a=b is nothing but a generalization from limited observations such as if two people are equal in height to a third person, then the two people concerned are themselves equal in height to one another.
The rule if a=b then b=a, or the rule a=a are rules of inference obtained through induction by observing a limited number of cases. These rules are not God given.
Reasoning which depends on rules of inference, obtained by induction cannot be justified without induction that does not come under logic.
These rules of inference are static in the sense change has been ignored. The rule a=a is valid only if a does not change. If a changes then what is identified as a does not exist as it is not the same a that is encountered. To say that a= a, one needs to consider a as an object that does not change. This is generalized from the observation of non-changing properties of objects.

This is an unnecessary categorization, as there are neither pure rationalists nor pure empiricists from the time of ancient Greeks in the Western tradition
Change itself is a property that cannot be deduced using two valued two-fold logic as exemplified by Zenos Arrow. However, we shall not discuss it here as it is beyond the scope of this essay.
If one considers a finite population, makes a limited number of observations of a certain property of members of the population and then extend the observations for the unobserved as well, it may be called a concrete induction.
However, if the population is infinite then the induction is abstract as the conclusion cannot be grasped through the senses or even imagined.
What we have tried to explain so far is that empiricism and rationalism do not belong to watertight compartments but depend on each other. Some people without being aware of it call themselves both empiricists and rationalists, which seems to be correct even though according to strict dualities in Western Chinthanaya, an empiricist cannot be considered as a rationalist as well. What is discussed here is not related to the so-called Copernican Revolution of Kant.
In Western science, very often with or without experiments observations are made (In Astronomy no experiments as such are designed). Most of these observations depend on some basic knowledge that has been acquired by the observers (experimenters as the case may be) through concepts and Axioms.
The observations are very often limited to samples of a population, and induction is called into play in arriving at an Axiom whether concrete or abstract.
These inductive axioms could be tested by considering other members of the population, but until a member is found to the contrary the Axiom is held to be valid. As Hume has observed people have a tendency to come to conclusions by induction.
