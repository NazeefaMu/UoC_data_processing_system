There is no instability in the government though some forces are trying to sabotage development in order to capture power, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.

“Whatever issues which the MPs of both allies of the government talks of could be resolved through a dialogue. These are minor matters though they shout about on those,” the Prime Minister said responding to a question raised by the journalists at a media briefing as to how the government could go-ahead with the economic plans which he came out with last afternoon.

“I have discussed the economic development plan with President Maithripala Sirisena and he had agreed to it,” the Premier added.

Further he said former President will not only fail to secure the Premiership but to safeguard his MP’s post when the development programme goes ahead.

The Prime Minister assured that it would be possible to secure in a few weeks time. “We have finalized the GSP plus with the European Union and will be able to get in touch with them in a few weeks time,” he said.

Referring to the Hambantota Port Agreement he said a framework agreement has been signed with the China Merchant Company and would sign a follow-up agreement with the company later. “There would be at least eight agreements on the development of Hambantota Industrial Zone with Chinese companies and companies of other countries,” he said.

Elaborating on the economic development plan he said two primary corridors namely South West Monsoon Corridor and the North Eastern Monsoon Corridor would be set up in this year. Under the South West Corridor he said Kandy, Colombo, Galle, Hambantota and Moneragala will be linked. This would comprise two airports and two ports. The North Eastern Monsoon Corridor would comprise the Trincomallee Harbour. The Trincomallee Port he said would be developed with the assistance of countries such as Japan, India and Singapore.

Further, it was highlighted that ‘Ceylon city’ which is similar to Dubai International Financial Centre, would be developed. In addition several tourism zones and industrial zones would be developed. The North is to be developed as a special war affected zone while, the Central business district, Aero City and a Science and Technology City would be developed in addition the Bandaranaike International Airport and the Colombo Port to be expanded.

The Prime Minister also said the country will go for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with China and the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India this year. “FTAs would be a key to venture into foreign markets in order to enhance investments,” he said.

“The GDP would be increased while the minimum wages of a Sri Lankan will be increased to US $ 300 a month,” the Prime Minister added.

Coming up with government’s plans on the proposed Development Special Provisions Bill, he said he will discuss the amendments with the Chief Ministers of provinces and others shortly. “One can easily implement the Bill without involving the provincial councils if they oppose it,” he further said.
