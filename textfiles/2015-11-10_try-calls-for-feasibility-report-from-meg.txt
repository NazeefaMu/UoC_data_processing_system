Port City: Arjuna calls for report from Megapolis Ministry


	

The Ministry of Ports and Shipping has requested a feasibility study to determine the effects of the Port City on the Colombo Port.
Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga said they had requested the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development for the report as the project came under their purview.
Sand used during the initial stages of construction to reclaim the sea had washed into the port jetty after the project was halted earlier this year.
“There is a possibility the sand would obstruct the shipping and the functions of the jetty would be disrupted as well,” he said.
Ranatunga said the study would be completed in two weeks and said that they hoped to make a decision regarding the project soon.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) sources said the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report had been given to the Committee headed by the Prime Minister, which in turn had handed over the project to the Coast Conservation Department for further perusal.
The report would also be provided to other government institutions to look into technical issues.
However, the source said that they had not been informed of a feasibility report on the project.
The source said the Chinese company had been given permission to clear the sand blocking in the Beira Lake and protect the existing structure.
“There has not been any construction since the project was halted in March this year. Close to 5,000 individuals have lost their jobs due to the project being halted,” the source said. (Indika Sri Aravinda)
