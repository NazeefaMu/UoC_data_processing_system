The 12 member politburo of the United National Party (UNP) met yesterday discussed a proposal to set up new positions in the party including appointing a Propaganda Secretary, a Media Secretary and a Trade Union Affairs Secretary, Politburo member MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said yesterday.

Mr Bandara told journalists these new positions will be created in addition to the general secretary.

However, he said no names were nominated for the posts at yesterday’s meeting. He said the politburo would have to meet at least two more occasions to decide on the reorganization.

However, he said new office bearers would be appointed before April 30, 2018. Meanwhile, the party had decided to hold its May Day rally on May 6, 2018, at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium.

However, another member of the politburo told the Daily Mirror that no final decision had been made on new posts.

Four members of the Bureau Sajith Premadasa, Eran Wickramaratne, Gayantha Karunathilaka and Ajith P. Perera had not participated in the meeting. Some of them are out of the country according to MP Bandara, while others have excused themselves as they had other important appointments. (Yohan Perera)
