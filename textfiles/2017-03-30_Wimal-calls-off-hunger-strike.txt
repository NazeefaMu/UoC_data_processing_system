MP Wimal Weerawansa called off the eight day hunger strike he was engaged in amidst the chanting of pirith a short while ago, National Freedom Front (NFF) sources said.

The MP had decided to give up his fast after requests made by Venerable Theras of the Malwathu and Asgiri chapters and fellow politicians, it is learnt. He ended the fast by drinking a cup of milk.

The parliamentarian commenced a hunger strike on March 22 against alleged political revenge perpetrated by the government against him. He was admitted to the prison hospital on March 26 (Sunday) and was transferred to the National Hospital yesterday.  

Weerawansa was remanded for allegedly misusing 40 state vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation causing a loss of Rs. 90 million. Bail applications to release him were refused by the courts. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
