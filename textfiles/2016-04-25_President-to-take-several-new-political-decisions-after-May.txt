President Maithripala Sirisena said that he would take several new political decisions after May 1 for the betterment of the country and its people.

President Sirisena said that he believed those decisions would prevent the corrupt forces that had abused state power from regaining power and also help protect democracy and the freedom of the people, while taking the country  forward freed of corruption and fraud.

He said so today at a public rally, and later participated in a ceremony to vest Phases I & II of the Medirigiriya Water Supply Project with the public.

The president said he would not disappoint the people who had voted to bring this new government to power in the hope of creating a clean political culture and a free country.

“Even though various criticisms were levelled against the government in an environment where the freedom of expression is secured, the government has implemented a strong strategy to raise the living standards of the people while developing the economy,” he said.

Today, the development of Sri Lanka has received the utmost international support and, for the first time in the history of the country, the Head of State of Sri Lanka has been invited to attend the G7 summit, he said.

He added that a prominent business delegation from Germany, including its Economic Affairs Minister, would visit Sri Lanka next month to explore business opportunities in the country, and that the Government of Iran had extended an invitation to him to visit Iran to find ways in which Iran could assist in the development of Sri Lanka.

He also emphasised that he would not leave room for anyone to misuse state assets, and that if any complaints were received of such misuse, the full weight of the law would be brought to bear upon them, without consideration of their status.
