Our poll chief, one-time Facebook enthusiast has taken a sudden decision to give this social media a wide berth for good.

 


 Highly perturbed over this decision, hundreds of his fans had appealed to him to rethink his decision without success, they say.


Meanwhile, some people who had made discreet inquiries as to why the poll chief had decided to say good bye to the Facebook, claim that they have stumbled on the reason. 


Their finding is that it had come to light recently that the poll chief and a certain professor who worked tirelessly to bring yahapalanaya into power were the anonymous co-authors of a highly controversial FB page and he decided to leave the Facebook when some people had started criticizing him following this revelation, they say.
