Wooing at public expense


	



Despite being past the mandatory retirement age of 60, this fair one attached to a certain regulatory commission still looks attractive enough to draw a second look from any grown-up normal male, they say. What makes this story is that a powerful secretary to a very high political authority going beyond bestowing a second look on this voluptuous lady has gone out of his way to authorize a service extension to her and an acting pay package as a bonus in addition to the normal salary. 


By the way, this lady had doubled as the private secretary to both the ex-officio chairman and the director general of the regulatory commission during the previous regime thanks to the patronage of a powerful secretary at that time.


The new Director General of the regulatory commission had reportedly walked out of the board meeting held last week to protest against granting a service extension to the comely one when a lady appointed as his private secretary had already assumed duties. 
However, the Director General’s newly appointed private secretary has now been shifted to the institution’s ‘reserve pool’, they say.
