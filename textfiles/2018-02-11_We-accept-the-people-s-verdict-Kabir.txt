UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim in a statement said the UNP would accept the people’s verdict given at the local government elections humbly. “The people have shown us a danger signal,” he said.

Minister Kabir Hashim said the UNP would analyse the LG polls results closely and resolve to carry out government’s services and duties more diligently and speedily.

“We have done a lot for the people in the last couple of years. We have also introduced a new electoral system at the local government level and has put an end to the intra party and inter party rivalry and minimize election expenditure which leads to corruption. We have also plugged opportunities to use State assets in elections and given much relief to the people in the fields of education and health. But, for our disadvantage the dividends of this services and benefits offered to the people have not been clearly displayed. However, we believe that the people will be in a position before long to enjoy the dividends of our services before long,” Minister Hashim stressed.

“The natural disasters like, floods, droughts and earth slips that devastated the lives of the people in unprecedented proportions and the huge debts, a legacy of the Rajapaksa regime that burdened the economy had affected the lives of the people negatively but all these calamities were beyond the government’s control,”he said.

The people kept the confidence in us for social and economic change at the January 2015 Presidential poll and confirmed it in the August General election. Therefore, we firmly resolve ourselves to fulfil their aspirations on the mandate they have given us and fully committed to realize all their goals, Minister Hashim stressed. (SAJ)
