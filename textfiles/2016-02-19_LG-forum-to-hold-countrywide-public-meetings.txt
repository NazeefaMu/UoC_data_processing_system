After the Negombo event, the forum of local government members loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has decided to conduct public gatherings covering all Grama Seva Divisions in the country.

They held a confab last Sunday and called for the formation of a new political party as an alternative to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa told the Daily Mirror these local government members would now have public meetings covering all the villages. Besides, he said there would be further public meetings at local authorities’ level to create awareness on the need for a front against the United National Party (UNP)-led government.

“We will also activate youth and women’s wings in this regard,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
