WASHINGTON (AP/Daily Mail) / 18 January 2017— They line up near the Oval Office, down the hallway toward the Cabinet Room, trailed by their spouses and young kids in their finest clothes. When it’s their turn, the White House staffers enter for a few private moments with President Barack Obama, a photo and a farewell hug from the boss.  


There’s a mass exodus underway this week at the White House. As Obama holds his last news conference Wednesday, his staff is busy packing up their offices and turning in their Black Berrys. For some who joined Obama’s team right out of college, it’s the end of the only professional experience they’ve ever known.
