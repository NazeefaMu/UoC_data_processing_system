Ninety housemaids who were provided alternative shelter by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Kuwait arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport today.
The Foreign Employment Bureau had intervened in bringing them back to Sri Lanka.
The housemaids were accommodated at safe houses after complaints of being subjected to various forms of harassment including the non-payment of the wages by their employers. The employment contract of some had expired.
During a visit to Kuwait last year, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala had met all the housemaids staying at the safe houses and assured them that her ministry would help bring them back to the country even though some of them were not registered with the Bureau.
The FEB said more than 300 housemaids were still living in safe houses in Kuwait.
However, Minister Athukorala said she would take necessary measures to bring them back to the country.
“Thrity six of the housemaids did not even have money to return home. The FEB had provided them the money and helped them to contact their families as well,” an official said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
