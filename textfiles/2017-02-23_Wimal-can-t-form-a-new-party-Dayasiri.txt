National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa has no right to form a new party to function independently, SLFP Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said at the weekly SLFP media briefing today.

Mr. Weerawansa yesterday told Parliament that five members belonging to his party would function independently in the Opposition and that they should be recognised as a separate party in Parliament.

He said he had informed the Speaker about this decision in writing earlier and the latter had failed to heed the request.

“There are only three main parties in the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA). All the other parties contested in the UPFA led by the SLFP. Those parties were not considered as separate entities. If Mr. Weerawansa wants to function as an independent party he can be independent in Parliament like Minister Chandrasiri Gajadeera," he said.

“Before he form an individual party he should write to the SLFP General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera for permission,” the Minister said.(Chaturanga Paradeep)
