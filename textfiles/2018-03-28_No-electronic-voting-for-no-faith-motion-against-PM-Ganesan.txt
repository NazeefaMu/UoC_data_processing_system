Party leaders have decided to call for a division by name or by row when parliamentarians vote for the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe on April 4.

Minister Mano Ganesan speaking to the media said the electronic voting system will not be used in the process to ensure error free results.

“Recently, a tense situation occurred in Parliament during the passing of a certain Bill due to an error of the electronic voting system. Accordingly, we have decided not to use it in this no-confidence motion since it is an important matter,” the Minster said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
