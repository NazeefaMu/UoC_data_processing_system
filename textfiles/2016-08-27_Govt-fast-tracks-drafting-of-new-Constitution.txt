With this in view, the Steering Committee which is drafting the constitutional proposals has decided to hold meeting on consecutive days so as to complete its task as early as possible. The Committee met this week and will meet on three more days next week.

Four out of six sub-committees appointed to work on different aspects of the Constitution have submitted their reports to the Steering Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The remaining two subcommittees have been requested to submit their reports by September 3. The Steering Committee will incorporate the recommendations before compiling the final report to be presented to Parliament.

The Government had announced it would draft a new Constitution and present it for public approval at a referendum.(Kelum Bandara)
