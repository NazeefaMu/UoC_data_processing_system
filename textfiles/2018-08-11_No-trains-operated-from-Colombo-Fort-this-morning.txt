No trains were operated from the Colombo Fort Railway Station this morning, the Railway Control Room said today.

All train journeys were cancelled due to the ongoing strike launched by the Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA) on Wednesday over salary anomalies of Railway employees. 

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, a spokesman from the Control Room said the night mail train which was scheduled to leave from the Fort Railway Station was also cancelled.

However, he said the trains with fuel carriages left for Kolonnawa this morning. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
