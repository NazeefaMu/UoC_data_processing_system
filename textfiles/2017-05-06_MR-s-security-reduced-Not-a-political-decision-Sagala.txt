Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said yesterday the security detail of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was reduced based on a periodically conducted VIP security assessment and not on political grounds.

He told parliament that security was provided to VIPs based on the threat assessment conducted by the police every six months and that it was the responsibility of the IGP to attend to security matters of VIPs.

The minister said Mr. Rajapaksa's security contingent consisted of 229 security personnel including the STF and it was being reduced to 187 with 42 of them being recalled.

"On his request, Mr. Rajapaksa was provided with 100 army and 103 MSD personnel at the time he retired in 2015. We replaced the 100 army personnel with MSD personnel according to a policy decision of the government to provide only police security to VIPs and in addition assigned 26 STF personnel for his security. Even now he has 187 security personnel. This decision was not taken on political grounds," he said.

The minister said the security details of former presidents including J.R. Jayewardene, D.B. Wijetunge and Chandrika Bandaranaike had been gradually reduced based on a threat assessment.

"The 65 security personnel assigned to president Jayawardane was reduced to 18 by the time he died. D.B. Wijetunge's security was reduced to 12 while president Kumaratunge's security was reduced from 198 to 59 personnel," he said.

The minister said security had also been increased for some VIPs including M.A. Sumanthiran and Jayampathi Wickremaratne considering the threat assessment carried out.

"The security provided to VIPs may be increased or decreased based on a threat assessment on their lives," he said and added that Mr. Rajapaksa could be provided extra security on days such as May Day if requested.

MP Wimal Weerawansa claimed that Mr. Rajapaksa's security had been reduced after seeing the crowd at the joint opposition May Day rally. (Ajith Siriwardana)
