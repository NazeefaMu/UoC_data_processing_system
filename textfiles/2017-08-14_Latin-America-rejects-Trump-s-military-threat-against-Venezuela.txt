Latin America rejects Trump’s military threat against Venezuela


	

CARACAS REUTERS Aug 12- After months of attacking Venezuela’s unpopular President Nicolas Maduro, Latin America came out strongly against U.S. threats of military action against the crisis-hit nation.    U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise comments on the Friday may bring the beleaguered Maduro some respite in the region, just as Venezuela was the on verge of becoming a pariah over its recent installation of a legislative superbody, widely condemned as a power grab by the ruling Socialists.   


 Following Trump’s assertion that military intervention in Venezuela was an option, Maduro’s critics are caught between backing the idea of a foreign invasion of Venezuela or supporting a president they call a dictator.
