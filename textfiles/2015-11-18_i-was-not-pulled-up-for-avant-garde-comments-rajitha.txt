Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today said he had not been pulled up by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for making comments on the Avant Garde controversy.
Sending a special message from Brazil, the minister said he had come to know of several rumours that had been circulating which led many to believe that he had been criticized by the Premier.  
“I left for Brazil on Monday and didn’t have an opportunity to meet the Premier before I left. Even though some people may point to me as the one who was criticized we all know who was really criticized by the Premier for the comments they made on the Avant Garde,” Minister Senaratne said.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
