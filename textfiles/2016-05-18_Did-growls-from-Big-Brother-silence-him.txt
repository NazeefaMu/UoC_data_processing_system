Did growls from Big Brother silence him?


	



 

Several Diyawanna members from the main party from the North including their leader from the East holding high office in the council were having a friendly chat with a group of yahapalanaya members in the lobby the other day. 

 


Their talk had taken a serious turn when a yahapalanaya one asked the leader from the East why they were throwing monkey wrenches into the Sampur power plant project despite their pious platitudes about the general good of the people.


The leader from the East replied: “We are against it on a matter of principle. We will not allow the government to go ahead with the project.”


Media people soon heard that the leader from the East had made a statement expressing the party’s firm stance against the Sampur project and began calling him to check whether this hearsay statement was correct. However, his stock reply to everyone who inquired about the statement supposed to have been made by him was: “No comment.”


Many Diyawanna members had later wondered why the veteran political leader who was so bold and articulate in the council lobby had suddenly turned cautious with the media. Meanwhile, some people say that growls from a neighboring country had silenced the grey-haired leader.
