* Currently, there is no licensed vaccine in the world for HIV or AIDS
* During the 'Window Period' HIV can be transmitted to another person without detection and knowledge, because only sensitive tests such as antigen detecting test can detect the virus in blood in less than two weeks.
* 160 HIV positive Sri Lankans have been detected as of October 2015
* Majority of them are between the ages of 25 and 45
* Nearly 230 HIV positive Sri Lankans identified in 2104 (last year)
* It is believed that there are 3000 HIV positive persons in Sri Lanka but the actual number of positive persons (including undetected HIV positive persons) could be much higher than this.
Q: What is HIV and AIDS?
A : HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus. AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Q: How does HIV transmit from one person to another?
A : There are three (3) main modes of transmission
1. Mother to child transmission. (4%)
2. Sexual transmission (95%)
3. Blood born transmission (1%)
In Sri Lanka, 95% of HIV transmission is through unsafe sex. 60-80% of transmissions are heterosexual transmissions and male homosexual transmission is 20-40%.
It will take one to ten years from the date of becoming HIV positive to develop AIDS. Between one to three months, there may be little viral manifestation with symptoms such as mild fever, lymph-node enlargement, mild skin rash etc. But these symptoms will disappear without notification.
If a patient is infected with HIV Virus, he or she may live without any symptoms from one to 10 years. During this period HIV virus remains alive in their blood and sexual secretion. From HIV positive blood or sexual secretion contaminated with HIV virus, the HIV virus enters into the body of a normal person through blood or through mucous membrane of the genital organ, anus or mouth.
Even if the HIV Virus is present in the blood, the blood test for HIV may give negative results if tested before three months from the date of infection. This is because the antibody development takes about three months from the date of infection. This period is called 'the window period.' If a more sensitive test is done (antigen detecting test) the window period will be reduced by less than 2 weeks.
Q: Who are in the high risk group?
A : If people have more than one sexual partner and if they do not use condoms, they are in the high risk group. Sex workers, Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM), Intravenous drug addicts too are in the high risk group.
Q: How can HIV infection be prevented?
A : 1. Abstain from sex and using intravenous heroin.
2. Confine to one sexual partner.
3. If you have sex with multiple partners, use condoms correctly.
4. Avoid using heroin
5. Do not share needles if take intravenous heroin
6. Screening of pregnant mothers for HIV and if there are positive ones, offer antiviral treatment.
7. Screening of all risk groups for HIV and treat with Anti Retro-Viral (ARV) for all HIV positive people.
8. Treatment acts as prevention because treatment with ARV reduces undetected virus level in blood.
Q: Many prominent medical experts and professionals say that homosexuals have taken the lead in spreading AIDS in the world. How about Sri Lanka?
A : There is an increasing trend of transmission of HIV among male homosexuals (MSM) in Sri Lanka. The prevalence of HIV in MSM is more than 1% in Sri Lanka. It is less than 0.1% in normal population.
Hypertension drugs may be more effective if taken at night
Taking hypertension medicine at night may control blood pressure more effectively and significantly lower the risk for diabetes.
A dip in blood pressure during sleep is normal, and a nighttime dip of less than 10 percent in systolic pressure (the top number) is known to be associated with a higher risk of death.
Researchers studied 2,012 men and women with high blood pressure. Their average age was 53, and none had diabetes at the start of the study. The researchers randomly assigned half of the people to take all their hypertension medicine at night, and half to take it all in the morning.
Over an average of six years, 171 developed diabetes. After adjusting for fasting glucose, waist circumference, mean sleeping blood pressure and other factors, those who took their medicine before going to sleep had a 57 percent lower risk for diabetes. Taking medications at night also resulted in a greater relative decline in nighttime blood pressure.
“We are recommending now that patients take the meds in the evening. It’s a no-cost intervention,” said the lead author, Ramón C. Hermida, a professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Vigo in Spain, adding that patients should not change their medication regimens without talking to their doctors.

Going to bed late may make people fat
A study has found a link between sleeping later during the working week and an increase in body mass index
Going to bed late could be making people fatter, according to a new study.

Going to sleep late in their teens and adulthood may be making people fatter
Research published in the American journal Sleep this month suggests that going to bed later during the working week, as a teenager through to adulthood, is linked to an increase in body mass index over time.
A summary of the report said: “The aim of the current study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between bedtimes and body mass index (BMI) from adolescence to adulthood in a nationally representative sample.
“The results highlight bedtimes as a potential target for weight management during adolescence and during the transition to adulthood.
“Later average bedtime during the work week, in hours, from adolescence to adulthood, was associated with an increase in BMI over time.
“These results remained significant after controlling for demographic characteristics and baseline BMI.
“Although sleep duration, screen time and exercise frequency did not attenuate the relationship between work day bedtime and BMI over time, fast food consumption was recognised as a significant partial mediator of the relationship between bedtimes and BMI longitudinally.”
The research was carried out by academics at the University of California Berkeley, Columbia University and the New York Psychiatric Institute, and assessed the bedtimes of 3,300 teenagers between 1994 and 2009.
Earlier this year, Public Health England encouraged people to sleep more in a government campaign to promote healthier lifestyles.
“Lack of sleep is a growing problem,” according to Lisa Artis, of the British Sleep Council.
“Firstly people don’t place enough importance on sleep and the health benefits being well-rested can have.
“Secondly, unlike a lot of well understood life changes such as eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, sleep isn’t really on the agenda.”
Research has also suggested that routinely getting less than six hours sleep a night can impact attention, concentration and memory, and is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.

Herbal Medicine -:
The Power of Peppermint
Studies have shown peppermint oil to be fairly effective at relieving irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a collection of symptoms that includes abdominal pain and cramping, bloating, constipation and diarrhea that affects 5 to 20 percent of the population.
At the mention of peppermint, candy canes and ice cream comes to mind. But did you know that peppermint is also an age-old herbal medicine that has been used to treat a wide range of abdominal woes? The oil extracted from the peppermint plant contains a host of compounds, but the most abundant and perhaps the most pharmacologically important is menthol.
Studies have shown peppermint oil to be fairly effective at relieving irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a collection of symptoms that includes abdominal pain and cramping, bloating, constipation and diarrhea that affects 5 to 20 percent of the population. One explanation is that the oil-especially the menthol-blocks calcium channels, which has the effect of relaxing the “smooth” muscles in the walls of the intestines. Recently, Alex Ford, a McMaster University researcher, concluded that instead of popular over-the counter drugs, peppermint oil should be the first line of defense against IBS.
Peppermint can temporarily allay itching caused by insect bites, eczema and other lesions, including the rash of poison ivy. Peppermint tea can be used as a mouthwash for babies with thrush (yeast in the mouth) or for reducing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, especially for women who want to avoid stronger medications.

Some asthma inhalers ‘could stunt growth’ in children
Children under two who use certain asthma medicine could be stunted in later life, a preliminary report suggests.
Doctor Antti Saari, from the University of Eastern Finland, said his team analysed data from 12,000 children to find those who used inhaled corticosteroids long-term showed signs of stunted growth, the BBC reports.
The researchers looked at information on the height of the children's parents and data on the children's weight and asthma medicine in order to calculate expected height and growth.
They found an association which, if permanent, could lead to around 3cm of decreased adult height.
Experts said they would likely still be affected in adulthood, The Mirror reports.
“It is important that doctors think twice whether these steroids are needed or not in this age group,” Doctor Saari said.
Corticosteroids are found in brown inhalers and are used to manage the “wheezing” symptoms of asthma.
Doctor Samantha Walker, from Asthma UK, said: “The study confirms other research suggesting ICS used in infancy can interfere with bone growth, although the impact is relatively minor.
“No parent should therefore stop their children taking these lifesaving medicines, because a slight reduction in growth is a small price to pay for medicines which may save your child’s life.”
