Total Cost Management (TCM) is a systematic and structured approach to understand the costs of an organization, with the aim of providing a holistic framework to control, reduce and eliminate costs. Cost management is a philosophy, an attitude, and a set of techniques to create more value at lower cost. In this fast pace competitive scenario, Cost Management information increases customer value.


Total Cost Management (TCM) is spread across Governments, Companies, State owned Enterprises, Government Projects and all undertakings whether private or public and provides a holistic framework to control, reduce and eliminate costs, throughout the value chain. This process of managing the financial outcome of activities encompasses all operations, internal and external.
TCM is also one of the most powerful tools that companies can wield in their quest for competitive advantage.
