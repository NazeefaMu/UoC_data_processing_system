This character is a secretarial one of a very high political authority and his main job is promoting and fostering national unity and harmony.  

 


He got egg on his face recently when his young son caught distilling pot-arrack.


The young man was manufacturing the hot stuff not for sale. It was for a hospitability cause; for serving the hoi polloi attending the election propaganda meetings which the political boss is billed to address.
