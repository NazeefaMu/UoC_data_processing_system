Former Mayor of Colombo, A J M Muzammil has been nominated for the post of Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia, informed sources said yesterday.

Mr Muzammil, when contacted by Daily Mirror, confirmed that he had been nominated for the post. He said his name had been sent to the High Posts Committee in Parliament for approval.

However, he said he would claim his due place at the next local government elections and would contest for a seat in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). “ I am hoping to claim a slot on the UNP list for the CMC, but I will leave it to the party to make the final decision,” he said.(Yohan Perera)
