Speaker Karu Jayasuriya denied a request made by MP Ravi Karunanayake to make a special statement in Parliament today.

The Speaker said Mr. Karunanayake cannot be allowed to make a statement as it does not fall in line with a privilege issue.

“Your request cannot be granted as you wanted to raise a privilege issue and the matter which you intend to raise does not fall in line with a privilege issue. Therefore, I cannot allow you to make the statement in accordance with the standing orders,” Speaker Jayasuriya said.

Mr. Kaunsnayake then sought an explanation from the Speaker on his decision. (Yohan Perera & Ajith Siriwardhana)
