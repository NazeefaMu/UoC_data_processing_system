Organic food is more nutritious and free of pesticides.


How your food has been grown has a major impact on your mental and emotional health. The term ‘Organic’ refers to the way products are grown and processed. It is believed that organically produced food items are nutritious and free of pesticides.


“Organically produced food items are slightly superior and healthier than food items you usually find in the market. Organic food items are usually grown without adding any pesticides, but what’s the guarantee that all organic food products are 100% pesticide free? I think it’s better that people opt for more organic foods because they are healthier” said nutritionist, Doctor Damayanthi Perera.
