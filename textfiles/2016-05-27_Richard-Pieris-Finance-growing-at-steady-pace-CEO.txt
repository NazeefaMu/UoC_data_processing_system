The deposit base of Richard Pieris Finance Ltd is Rs.3 billion and the total asset base is Rs.10 billion, said the company’s Director/CEO K.M.M. Jabir. 
Marking the third successful year of operation, Jabir said that the company planned to open a number of branches this year. At present it has two branches in Borella and Matara. The other branches planned to open are in Kandy, Galle, Kalmunai, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Negombo, Panadura and Wennappuwa.
“We go by our logo ‘Your Gain is Our Goal’. With our committed and dedicated employees along with our loyal customers, our growth is at a steady pace,” said Jabir. 
“We have been growing at a steady pace. The number of staff has increased to 125 and in the current financial year, we plan to recruit a further 150 to man all these new branches.” 
Where its interest rates are concerned, it is in par with the industry. As such, its customers are very happy with the organisation, which is clearly evident with the growth such as the deposit base, growth of asset base and the number of customers, which has increased to almost 5,000. 
Elaborating on future success, he said that the company planned to open about 10 branches islandwide to meet the wide reach the company expects. 
“And also we plan to launch a series of new products to cater to the demands of our valued customers without restricting for the traditional products,” he said. 
Commenting on the high recognition of Richard Pieris Finance Ltd, Jabir said “on top of that, last year, we achieved the Gold Award for the ‘Emerging Entity of the Year’.” 
“Celebrating the third anniversary, it is really heartening to see the growth of the company, since I joined from the inception. As the founder CEO, I’m really glad to see the momentum. 
In addition, the balance sheet is growing, which is getting stronger from year to year. Profit is showing an impressive growth. We benchmark our future growth to be 30 to 35 percent. 
Our strength is the trust our customers have placed with us and our committed employees, who are well versed, experienced, dedicated, committed and ever-willing.”
