Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has agreed to amend the Development (Special Provisions) Draft Bill and re-submit it with amendments, a Chief Minister said.

“The Prime Minister assured that the draft Bill will be amended,” Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.

The Premier has conveyed this decision after discussions with a group of Chief Ministers. Four Chief Ministers from the Western, Southern, Eastern and Uva Provinces had taken part in the meeting with the Prime Minister at Temple Trees yesterday evening.

Provincial Council members were asked to express their opinion on the Draft Bill, and by yesterday three PCs – Uva, North-Central and Northern Provincial Councils – rejected the bill, claiming it would only pave the way for the creation of a ‘Super Minister’.
