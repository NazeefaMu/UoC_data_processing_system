Members of the Joint Opposition were subjected to unfair treatment as its MPs were not allocated time to speak within the first two hours of the budget debate which was telecasted live on TV, leader of the group Dinesh Gunawardane told Parliament today.

"Please allow at least one joint opposition MP to speak during the first two hours of the debate so that our group will also get some publicity," he said while highlighting that other MPs get media publicity from the live telecast.

Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella who responded to the claim said the joint opposition would get publicity during the time allocated for questions which was also broadcasted on live TV.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya assured that he will look into the matter and do the needful.(Yohan Perera)
