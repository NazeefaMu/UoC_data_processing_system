The former strongman received a call from the country’s main office. And the caller was a secretarial one of sorts, they say.
The white collar caller told the former strongman who came on the line: “I have got instructions, Sir, to invite you to attend the celebrations to be held on January 8 in Colombo to commemorate ‘the triumph of yahapalanaya’”. 
“Am I being invited to commemorate yahapalanaya?” a visibly amazed former strongman asked. 
“You are, Sir, welcome to the celebration!” replied the white collar one.  “Convey my well wishes for the inauguration anniversary,” said the former strongman. “But, tell them I have no greetings to extend for anything else connected with the celebration…” And he hung up, they say.
