The Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Anura Wijayapala tendered his resignation to Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya this evening, the Ministry said.

The reason behind the resignation of former Chairman Wijayapala is said to be his reluctance to be flexible in implementing the decisions and policies of the Ministry when dealing with problems between CEB directors and the unions.

Mr. Wijayapala had wanted to tender his resignation in March last year but it was turned down at the time. However, the Minister had accepted his latest letter of resignation. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
