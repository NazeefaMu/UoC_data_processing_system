The Magisterial inquiry, involving Minister Harin Fernando and his cousin over an alleged brawl between them, was yesterday terminated by Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne after the both parties decided on a settlement.

Earlier, the Minister lodged a complaint on the matter with the Kollupitiya police seeking legal action against his cousin, Andre, over an assault at the Colombo Swimming Club in April 2, 2015.

However, Minister’s cousin also complained to the Police to counter file a case against Mr. Fernando over an alleged assault against him.  (Shehan Chamika Silva)
