The Criminal Investigations Department today summoned former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda to record a statement regarding the disappearance of 11 individuals in 2008.

The inquiry is connected to the investigation of a Special Operation Unit of the Navy, allegedly responsible for a series of abductions from 2006-2008.

Previously, the police said the CID was investigating a complaint by the former Navy Chief that a secret navy unit had operated during his tenure, and that it was responsible for a series of abductions.
