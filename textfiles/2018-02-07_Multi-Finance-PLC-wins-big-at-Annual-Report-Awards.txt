This is the company’s third recognition award for going beyond statutory boundaries in financial reporting for compliance with legislative requirements and accepted accounting practices.
Winning the distinction from among 140 organisations including blue chip companies and conglomerates shows the emphasis MFPLC – a subsidiary of diversified conglomerate Fairway Holdings – places on compliance as a critical requirement in the success of the company.
