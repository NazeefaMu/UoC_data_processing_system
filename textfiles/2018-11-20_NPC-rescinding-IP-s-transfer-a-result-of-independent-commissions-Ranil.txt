In a twitter message, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said the intervention by the Police Commission to prevent the arbitrary executive action of transferring a police officer was an important result of the independent commissions introduced by the 19th Amendment.

“Robust democratic institutions are key to protecting the freedoms of citizens from arbitrary actions of the State. We must defend and strengthen such institutions,” he tweeted.
