Thajudeen killing: CCTV footage still in court custody


	

Although one month has elapsed since Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris ordered the CID to send the DVDs and a CD of the CCTV footage of the vehicle in which rugby player Wasim Thajudeen travelled, to a forensic laboratory abroad for examination, they are still in Court custody.

The Magistrate had directed the Criminal Investigations Department to send those DVDs and CD abroad for in-depth studies on January 7 this year.

However, the CID is yet to obtain those articles relating to the case from the custody of the Court.

Earlier, the Colombo University's School of Computing (UCSC) recommended that the video footage be examined at a well-equipped forensic laboratory abroad such as the FBI, MPS or the new Scotland Yard as the poor quality of the video footage and the UCSC's limited technical facilities to do so.

It is reported that the footage had been recorded during the night and as such strong lights from oncoming vehicles had distorted the images. (Nirangi Abeywikcrema)
