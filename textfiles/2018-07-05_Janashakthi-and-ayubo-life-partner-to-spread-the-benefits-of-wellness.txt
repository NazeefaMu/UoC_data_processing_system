Revolutionizing Insurance consumption, Janashakthi Life is partnering with ayubo.life to provide their corporate policyholders with the renowned benefits of wellness. Understanding that preventative measures yield better healthcare results over the long term, Janashakthi Insurance has made this revolutionary service available to their corporate policyholders, ensuring that companies are able to remain competitive in the modern marketplace through increased employee productivity and engagement.

The ayubo.life app, which is available on both iOS and Android, functions as a wellness partner that helps users make informed decisions about their health and fitness. Users will have access to doctor consultations via call or video, fitness tracking, medical report management, medication delivery, a health marketplace, wellness activations, daily health tips, and much more. There is also a social feature that allows users to form communities where they can view, interact and comment on featured content and achievements of friends and family. With this partnership, Janashakthi Life is helping promote healthy lifestyle choices amongst its customers that will ultimately reduce the overall healthcare burden on individuals and society as a whole.

“This partnership signifies Janashakthi’s continued innovation in the Life Insurance industry,” said Mr. Jude Fernando, Director and Chief Executive Officer of Janashakthi Insurance PLC. “With this bold new offering Janashakthi Life is moving away from the traditional Insurance proposition of providing curative healthcare products, and charting new territory by committing to support our customers in the wellness space. We are constantly looking to create greater value for our customers and are delighted to be able to provide them with access to this state-of-the-art solution. ayubo.life is a cutting-edge online platform that enriches lives by making health and wellness accessible to all. We are proud to have partnered with them and look forward to spreading the message of wellness across the island.”

Commenting on the partnership, Chief Operating Officer for ayubo.life Dr Chamila Ariyananda said, “We are thrilled to be partnering with Janashakthi Life. This is a partnership born from a shared vision for the country’s future wellbeing. Together we will disrupt the traditional way corporates think of wellness and insurance which makes no provisions for the prevention of an illness or for the individual falling in to a diagnosed or high-risk condition. By providing people with easy access to experts in health, fitness, nutrition, and mental health, as well as with wellness culture building digital activations, we hope to encourage them to make positive lifestyle changes that will drive a culture and attitude of wellness within their company.”

To further promote wellness amongst Sri Lankans, Janashakthi and ayubo.life will encourage users to participate in a virtual walkathon on the 18th of July 2018. Users will be encouraged to walk 40,000 steps through 18 curves over a period of seven days while also receiving information on the seven aspects of wellness. ayubo.life has previously held virtual walkathons that allowed users to virtually scale Mount Everest and hike the trail from Colombo to Kandy.

ayubo.life, an online platform which helps people integrate wellness into their lifestyle without disrupting their daily commitments, is owned and operated by Digital Healthcare Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., a company funded and supported by Hemas Holdings PLC.

Founded in 1994 as a Life Insurance company, Janashakthi Insurance PLC made its mark in the industry as an innovator and household name over a span of over 23 years. Janashakthi has a strong presence across the island, with an expanding Life Insurance network and a dedicated call centre.
