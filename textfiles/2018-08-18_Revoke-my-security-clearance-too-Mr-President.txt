US, (Daily Mail), 17 August 2018 - William McRaven, commander of the U.S. Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden, condemned President Donald Trump on Thursday for revoking the security clearance of former CIA chief John Brennan – and asked that his be cancelled as well.  


The decorated retired Navy admiral, in an open letter published in The Washington Post, defended Brennan as ‘one of the finest public servants I have ever known’.  


‘Few Americans have done more to protect this country than John,’ McRaven wrote of Brennan. ‘He is a man of unparalleled integrity, whose honesty and character have never been in question, except by those who don’t know him.’  


‘Therefore, I would consider it an honour if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency.’
