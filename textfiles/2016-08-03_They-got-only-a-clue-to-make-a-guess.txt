They got only a clue to make a guess


	

Several senior purohitas of yahapalanaya were having a good time together. They were all a bit soaked, but had their heads up. And then   the question arose as to how they could hook a few guys from the JO camp. 

A senior one from the West said that there were at least three from the camp ready to come running if they were assured of places in the top team.
“Who are they, Machang?” a stalwart from the Kalutara district asked.


“I can’t give the names. But I can assure that this information is 100 percent correct!” said the Kalutara one.


Pressed to give at least a clue to make a reasonable guess, the Kalutara purohita said: “One of them is a big mouth from Galle – Matara area. Another one is residing in a locality from where they could hear the drum beat of the Tevava ceremony at Sri Dalada Maligawa. The third one is living close to the Dambulla rock. Now go ahead and make 
your guess!”
