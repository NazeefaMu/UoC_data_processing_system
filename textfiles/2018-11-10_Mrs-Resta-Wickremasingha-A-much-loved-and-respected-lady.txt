Mrs.Resta Wickremasingha A much loved and respected lady


	

Mrs.Resta Wickremasingha came from an affluent Baptist family from Kerawalapitiya, Hendala, Her parents Mr. & Mrs. Robert de Alwis were blessed with two children, Resta and her brother Leslie.  


I knew her only at the tail end of her life, so whatever I am writing about her is hearsay, and that’s from my husband, for she had moved closely with his parents.  


She was a highly qualified lady in all aspects but she had been a special chosen vessel to do the Lord’s work.  Her preaching had been excellent, although she was not a priest. She had been much loved and respected by all who knew her, she had etched her name in he Baptist world.  


I came to know her only in 1970 and at that time she resided in the Principal’s bungalow at Carey College, Colombo. She was married to the late Dr. W. G. Wickremasingha who was the Principal of the College and also the President of the Baptist Sangamaya. 


They were blessed with three girls. A few years back one of them was taken to her eternal home leaving behind her husband and a young family.  
“From the time my parents retired and came to reside at Hendala and we became members of the Hendala Baptist Church, Mrs. Wickremasingha became a dear friend to our family.  


My husband had the privilege of working with Mrs. Wickremasingha during his young days. He says she was a well disciplined lady. Whether it was collecting funds for the Church or attending to the maintenance of the church, she wanted everything in order and precise. He has shared with me little humorous incidents which had taken place at that time.  


However, much people hadn’t agreed with her, my husband laughs and tells me that at the end of it the work will be done according to her advice. After meeting in the church she would drop in at my husband’s parental home to have a chat with them and share her views.  


It was due to the concern she had for my husband and the concern her close friend and associate the late Mrs. Clarice de Mel had for me that my husband and I are sharing our lives together today.  


I believe that this was the last act of kindness she performed before she was called home by the master at the relatively young age of 51, her death anniversary falls on the 10th of November.  


“Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful servants.
