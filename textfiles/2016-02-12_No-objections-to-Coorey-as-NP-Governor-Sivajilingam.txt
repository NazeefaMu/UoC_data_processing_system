TNA Northern Provincial Councillor M.K. Sivajilingam said today they were not opposed to the appointment of Reginald Coorey as the Northern Province Governor because he was an experienced politician but they would have preferred a Tamil or a Muslim as the Northern Province Governor.


He said in the past the government had appointed a Sinhalese as the Northern Province Governor.
“Personally we have no objection to the appointment of Reginald Coorey but by appointing a Tamil or a Muslim to this post will be another step towards reconciliation,” Mr. Sivajilingam said.


He asked why the government was reluctant to appoint a Tamil or a Muslim Governor if it could appoint Tamil and Muslim ministers.
