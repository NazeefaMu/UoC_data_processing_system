A change in attitude after mini-polls
	

A leading purohita from the South has of late become rude and discourteous to his constituents.

The queer behavior he has developed since the recent mini-polls has become a matter for both puzzlement and amusement of the people in the electorate, they say.
When the constituents call at his residence on home turf, the purohita would berate them saying, How much of work have I done for you people But you defeated me! Get all your matters attended to by the people you voted for. Dont come to see me hereafter!
However, the purohita would call back the people he turns away after a tongue-lashing and would listen to their problems after telling them, Remember before you cast your vote again that our government will continue in power for another two years!

Ahead of 2019 Parliamentary polls Rahuls bid to make Congress a distinct alternative to BJP
	
Flush with successes in by-elections in the politically significant Hindi-Hindutwa heartland in North India, namely, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress under its new President Rahul Gandhi, has unveiled an ambitious plan to oust the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from power in the next parliamentary elections in May 2019. 
The timing of the re-launch of the Congress is appropriate as BJP-led Governments in the Centre and the States are beginning to feel the heat of anti-incumbency. 
But India oldest party has a long way to go and time is short. As on date, BJP-led alliances are in power in most of the States of North India, including the populous ones which send large numbers of members to parliament. 
And the Congress has to be built anew with a new kind of leadership, a new structure, and a new set of ideas to be a clear alternative to the BJP which has developed some unique characteristics under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
The BJP of today is more self-confident, well organized and well-funded than ever before. Its single focus is to capture power by any means, and yet it is able to project itself as a party with a well-defined ideology aimed at securing the support of the majority Hindus. Above all, it is led by an exceptionally charismatic leader, Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India. Further, Brand Modi, which is what the BJP is now, has been gaining acceptance in the North-East, well beyond its traditional Hindi-Hindu-North Indian habitat. 
Therefore, any alternative to the BJP has to be both in the realm of ideology and the party structure. It is the contours of this alternative that Rahul Gandhi spelt out in his concluding remarks at the 84 th, plenary session of the Congress in New Delhi on last Saturday.
Contrasting Congress From BJP 
A self-confident and yet humble Rahul said that the Congress will substitute the BJPs policies with totally new ones. While BJPs policies are based on hate and anger, Congress policies will be based on love and brotherhood. The BJPs policy of Hindutwa (political and cultural primacy of the majority Hindus) will be replaced by a policy giving equal place to every faith, caste, individual. 
Congress, he said, it would strive for communal and caste tolerance and coexistence and eschew the BJPs policy of sharpening religious divisions and promoting communal hatred to win elections and keep itself in power. The lynching of Muslims for eating beef or selling cows for slaughter had become commonplace in the North Indian States ruled by the BJP. 
There are attempts by the BJPs ideological wing, the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), to infiltrate all institutions, especially educational and research institutions to change the mental makeup of Indians to wean them away from their historical legacy of tolerance. 
The Congress, on the contrary, would respect all faiths and ideologies and not criminalize disparate thinking, Rahul said. Explaining his visits to Hindu temples in Gujarat during the last State Assembly elections, which critics said were a fake show of devotion to Hinduism to wean away Hindu votes from the BJP, Rahul said that he had been going to Hindu temples in the past too. But he had also visited mosques and churches, as he believes that God is everywhere. India belongs to all, irrespective of religion or caste, he added. 
Unlike the BJP under Modi, the Congress will fulfill its promises, Rahul said. Modi had promised the earth, one of his promises being that the billions of dollars of black money stacked away abroad would be unearthed and brought back to India, and INR 15 lakh would be put into every Indians bank account. But nothing of this kind has happened. On the contrary, Modis draconian Goods and Services Tax, with the highest rates in the world, coupled with his demonetization of 85% of the currency hit trade, investment and employment. 
The Congress President pointed out that instead of fulfilling his promises to the people, Modi is rubbing shoulders with corrupt corny capitalists like Nirav Modi. Rahul promised that the Congress will honor its commitments to the people. And if mistakes are made, it will apologize publicly, unlike Modi and the BJP, which are too arrogant to do so. It is human to err and if an error had been committed, a public apology is called for, Rahul said. 
While unemployment and farmers distress have become Indias most pressing problems, Modi tries to divert attention from them by launching fancy programs unrelated to the needs of the people, such as performing yoga in public places, Rahul charged. 
New Economic Plank 
In contrast to the BJP, which has not brought about investment despite its Make in India slogan, a Congress Government will generate employment by encouraging small and medium industries to come up at the district level, Rahul said. These industries will use locally available talent and resources and bank credit for them will be ensured. He promised loan waiver for farmers burdened by debt, which has led to 2500 suicides to date. Food parks will be set up in every district where farmers can being their perishable produce, get guaranteed prices and have their produce processed to enhance their shelf life.
Over to youth 

Rahul said that the Congress will be led by the youth. The wall dividing the leaders from the workers will be broken down. But this will be done without alienating the senior leaders from whom there is a lot the young can learn, he added. 
Symbolizing the new party structure, Rahul did away with the practice of having all the top leaders sit on the dais, while the workers squat below. The dais was empty but for a podium for the speaker. Rahul said that he hoped that soon, the empty stage will be filled by talented youth from every part of India. He promised that from now on, work done for the party and not spending power will be the criterion for giving party nominations in elections.
Urging party cadres to get into electoral battles with courage and not be intimidated by an aggressive BJP, Rahul said that the Congress party is known for showing courage in the face of adversity. Thousands upon thousands led by Mahatma Gandhi, had gone to jail during the independence movement while V.D.Savarkar, an icon of the BJP, was pleading with the British to release him from jail, he recalled.
In the context of the killing of liberal and secular journalists like Gauri Lankesh, Rahul said that the Congress will give the media the fullest freedom and that whenever the media is harassed, the Congress will rush to its aid.
Meeting Chinas Challenge
Rahul avoided foreign affairs, but mentioned the challenge from China in the economic sphere as it affects local industries and local employment. He pointed that China is increasing its economic hold on the countries in the South Asian region and that Indian markets are awash with China-made goods. Rich Indian businessmen are minting money by importing Chinese goods while Indian manufacturers are starved of bank loans and burdened with GST, he charged. 

But a Congress government will not shun China or fight with it, he said. We will compete with China in a friendly way, he assured. 
The Congress President said that the world today has before it two alternative models to emulate - the American and the Chinese. But there is scope for a third model, the Indian model which is at once growth oriented and democratic, he said. The Congress will develop this model for the world to follow. 
It remains to be seen if Rahul will be able to implement his ambitious schemes to defeat the BJP. Time is short. The Big Match is only 14 months away.

Don't enter politics seeking riches: PM
	
Dont become politicians who search for luxuries after coming to the field as paupers, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the newly elected members of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday.
The Prime Minister came up with this advice during the swearing-in of new CMC members including the first woman mayor of Colombo Rosy Senanayake at Temple Trees last evening.
You are faced with a task of saving the city dwellers from Dengue, resolving the garbage issue and keeping the city clean. Therefore get on with these tasks, the Prime Minister said. Also, he said the members of CMC should remember that most of the dwellers in Colombo are poor.
Some politicians own only a push bicycle when they come to politics but later obtain Benz cars. Dont think of becoming such politicians, he added.
Also, he requested the UNP members of the CMC to help the government to carry forward its ten-year plan which it intends to implement shortly.
Ms Senanayake said she together with the other UNP members of the CMC would work as one family to make Colombo a smart and beautiful city. Also, she said she would strive towards bringing people of all races and religions in the city together. She said her task would be easier than her predecessors as she would be working with a UNP led central government. Ms Senanayake said the UNP has been able to get 29 women candidates elected to the CMC.
National Organizer of the UNP Bikkhu Front Venerable Ambanpola Gnanaloka Thera said politicians who begin their career from the CMC should work for the party rather than working with individual people. (Yohan Perera)

He now runs the show
	

A highly privileged inmate of a state-run lodge has come to command such clout now that he has become the virtual authority deciding as to who should be admitted to the star class hospital ward he is currently occupying.

A person hailing from the business elite, now an accused in a sensational case pending in courts was ordered into a temporary stay in the state-run lodge recently. And when the lodge authorities had admitted him to the particular star class ward on medical advice as usual, the privileged inmate already occupying it had immediately objected to the new admission and the authorities had meekly transferred the new mate to another ward in the hospital, they say.
The privileged inmate, a onetime prominent politico, is directing his business operations from his ward and he is averse to sharing the ward with any other mate who could become an impediment to his operations, informed sources say.

Leesons Hospital installs worlds most advanced cardiac 640 slice CTscanner
	
Now available in Sri Lanka at Leesons HospitalToshiba Aquilion ONE ViSION EDITION  CT scanner is the worlds most sophisticated dynamic volume CT scanner

<U+F0A7> Offers most sophisticated cardiac imaging system in the world
<U+F0A7> Fastest scanning with minimal x-ray exposure
<U+F0A7> Specialised TOSHIBA cardiac MRI scanner completes 500 successful investigations.

Leesons Hospital (Pvt) Ltd, the leading private healthcare provider to the Gampaha region, announced the recent installation of the worlds most advanced 640slice CT scanning system with a view to drastically enhance diagnostics capabilities in Sri Lanka while ensuring optimal patient safety.

Installed by Mediquipment, a well-respected provider of machines and services for the medical industry, the new Toshiba Aquilion ONE ViSION EDITION  CT scanner is the most sophisticated dynamic volume CT scanner anywhere in the world.A detector large and fast enough to capture complete scans of the heart in a single beat, enables successful and highly reliable examination of patients while ensuring the lowest possible exposure to radiation.

The Aquilion ONE ViSION EDITION is manufactured by Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, Japan, now a Canon group company.The acquisition in December last year was part of larger plans from Canon to enhance its presence in the medical sector, leveraging on the internationally renowned reputation of Toshiba as a manufacturer of highest quality Ultrasound, CT, MRI and X-Ray systems.

We are extremely pleased to be able to announce the significant upgrade to our diagnostic capabilities with the installation of the Toshiba Aquilion ONEViSION EDITION at Leesons Hospital. As always, patient safety and comfort remain our paramount concern, and with this machine, we can ensure a minimal x-ray dose of 0.26 mSv, less than from a chest x-ray, or even the radiation that we are generally exposed to on an airline flight.

Pradeep Dolawattage, P.H. Saman Krishantha, Managing Director Leesons Hospital; C. Kamijima, Senior Vice President, Canon Medical Systems Corporation; and Rienzie Nanayakkara, Director Sales,Mediquipment Ltd

Particularly with cardiac scans, the image needs to be captured in the interval between heartbeats, so the technology must be quick enough to complete its scan in that fraction of a second to get the clearest possible image. This new machine means that Leesons can now offer the highest quality diagnostics in Sri Lanka, on par with the most advanced hospitals in the world. We encourage our patients to visit our facility and make maximum use of these remarkable new capabilities, Leesons HospitalManaging Director,SamanKrishanthasaid.

Routinely completing scans in just 0.275 seconds, the Toshiba Aquilion combines next generation Quantum Vi detectors with integrated dose-reduction solutions to ensure fastest possible scans in the country while its large 78cm bore ensures a greater comfort and less confined experience than a typical CT/MRI scanner.

The new machine rounds out the high-end radiology suite of Leesons, bringing them on par with the best healthcare and diagnostic facilities in the world, with its most immediate and promising application being in the diagnosis of a range of different cardiovascular health issues such as an unstable angina caused by cholesterol blockages of arteries.

In the two years that Leesons has been operating its radiology unit  including high end CT, MRI, X-ray and ultrasound facilities - it has already completed 500 cardiac MRI scans using its Toshiba Vantage Elan 1.5T MRI scanning machine, installed last year with specialized cardiac scanning software - another firstamong the best available in the country.

First established in 1979 as a small dispensary by Mr. P. H. Leelananda, a well respected businessman hailing from the Gampaha district, it was later converted into a small nursing home with 10-bed capacity in 1989.

Since then, Leesons has grown into a fully-fledged healthcare institution providing top-quality medical services with 90-bed capacity, an Intensive Care Unit, an Emergency Treatment Unit with 5 beds, 4 modern operating theaters, 140 channeling chambers, a dedicated dialysis unit, blood bank, eye-treatment unit and 24 hour pharmacy, laboratory, ambulance services and an outpatient department run with 160 dedicated nursing paramedical support staff.

Our Movies, History
	
We have richer stories, wedo nothing with them.-Sidath Gajanayaka
Lets face it; a few years ago, the young had more or less given up on our movies. It took an extraordinary revolution, by our scriptwriters and directors and even actors, to take us beyond the commercial/arty divide rampant in the industry, through a spate of productions that began with Ho Gana Pokuna and continued until Adaraneeya Kathawak and, now, Bennet Ratnayakes Nela. If Ho Gana Pokuna takes you back to those days when movies about children were really for our children, and if Adaraneeya Kathawak and Nela take us back to that time when we truly enjoyed romances onscreen, its not because there werent directors and scriptwriters who were able to give us these movies back then, its because those directors and scriptwriters were unwilling to tread on what was generally considered to be forbidden territory. The same, incidentally, can be said of our vocalists and composers: whod have thought that a song like Saragaye was possible three years ago 
We go to the theatre because we want to escape the ennui of our everyday, banal lives. The young of today, who are more intelligent than those from my generation, know when they are being cheated; they want something new, even with other art forms. They are tired of expedience in the arts because they have ready access to the internet and because the internet provides them with answers to every question they have, except for questions which delve into their most potent inner feelings. Those feelings can only be satiated by works of art that try out something new. And the new artists they look up to are experimenting in exciting ways, targeting the young and with them the old as well; one year after Saragaye, for instance, Sanuka Wickramasinghe gave us Perawadanak, which as a young man told me seemed to be aimed at the middle-aged rather than the school-going demographic he came from. 
This is worrying
But while these revolutions are happening and while our revolutionaries are being inspired by them, so much, that they are setting up their own schoolboy bands, shooting away their own cameras, and writing their own scripts for film festivals, theres one segment or genre which has not yet been salvaged from the banality of yesterday; movies about our stories, or more specifically, about our HISTORIES. This is worrying, because for an industry to vindicate itself in the eyes of the people, it has to get this genre sorted out. Right away. 
And with Aloko Udapadi, Chathra Weeraman tried to sort out the genre out last year. But even Aloko Udapadi, despite its minimal use of special effects and a commendable set of performances ranging from the exceptional (Roshan Ravindra) to the downright clichd (Dharshan Dharmaraj), falls into the same trap that countless other movies about our history have fallen into. What Chathras film lacks are the histrionics about nationalism that so terribly and unsubtly beset other productions (even Jayantha Chandrasiris Maharaja Gemunu, not to mention Vijaya Kuweni, Mahinda Gamanaya, and Sri Dalada Gamanaya  it seems that I cant remember ANY sequence from the latter three now  cant quick get out of this fix), but what it unfortunately has in abundance are the American Cinemascope Epic-inspired sequences of savagery and ambitious cutting and editing that culminate in what I penned down in my review last year as something the Wachowski Brothers could have perfected with some more CGI  the anthima vijayagrahani satana. 


In Somaratne Dissanayakes early works theres an intelligent hand at work, turning the child actors into more than who they are

Aloko Udapadi is a grandiloquent monument to the eternal desire of our filmmakers to keep everyone satisfied through a big budget. Its manifest lack of overly ambitious special effects will keep the moderate moviegoer happy, but not the ordinary small town and village moviegoer, who will instead smile contently at the melodramatic romances and sequences of escape and treachery and, of course, swordfights and scenes of combat which, despite the subtlety of the special effects, are nevertheless inflated. It is, as Himal Kotelawala put it aptly, terribly unsubtle, though to me its also trashy in a strange way; its first half presents us with an interesting conundrum  how are you going to protect the Buddha Sasanaya without subverting the precepts in the holy texts  but the directors and the scriptwriters dont take us to the climaxes that this premise ought to have led us to in the first place. 
When the truths get obliterated
We are terribly unsubtle about our children and our history this way because we treat them like we treat our wives and husbands and sons and daughters; we think we know who they are, and what they will do next, but we are shocked if not angry when they dont behave the way we expect them to. In Somaratne Dissanayakes early works, for instance, theres an intelligent hand at work, turning the child actors into more than who they are. In his later works, however, he makes us expect blasts of emotion from them, and one after the other, that is what we get from his new child actors. Its the same story with our history; we expect it to go from Point A to Point B smoothly with no disjuncture or detour, but we are shocked when an artist questions the conventional wisdom by laying down historical realities which we werent aware of. Like our wives and husbands, we want our stories to remain the way we want them to be (as laid down by our textbooks). What gets lost there is subtlety, and in the end, truths get obliterated and myths get perpetuated. 
The Americans got away with this crime for decades because they werent raking up their own history, but instead appropriating them from other sources and civilisations, from Pagan Greece to Biblical Rome, appropriating them so well that we ignored the most basic flaws they thrived on (like how on earth could Charlton Heston ever be convincingly cast as Moses or, worse, El Cid). When they went back to their stories, the writers had the luxury of working on a relatively recent civilisation that provided a multitude of ways and means by which reality could be embellished. Even David Lean, who moved away from his home country to Arabia and Soviet Russia, was channelling this peculiar trait of the early American filmmakers, D. W. Griffith and John Ford included. 
For better or for worse
What our directors and writers of historical epics miss out is the fact that while trashy epics like The Robe and The Ten Commandments and even Ben-Hur lost their sense of complexity and proportion thanks to the money-saving and money-making processes unleashed by the Big Studios, the more worthy epics, which did not suffer this fate, like Leans Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago and Ryans Daughter, had one inextricable common factor; the long shots and lengthy editing were compensated for by the material that grew out of these technical gimmicks. Despite the overdrawn sequences of silence in Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, the camera never becomes a substitute for the landscapes; its merely a prop, and the material, the sense of grandeur, comes out of that. In her review of Renoirs La Grande Illusion, Pauline Kael distinguished between two kinds of artistry in the movies; the one that brings the medium alive with self-conscious excitement, and the one that makes the medium disappear. For better or for worse, the historical epic belongs to the first of these categories  the latter is the category of a Pather Panchali, a Gamperaliya, an Anantha Rathriya, where only life is affirmed  because of which the moviemaker has to operate from the premise that what he is depicting, and projecting, is life made more grandiloquent and poetic. 


Aloko Udapadi is a grandiloquent monument to the eternal desire of our filmmakers to keep everyone satisfied through a big budget

Because the epic genre is flawed in this respect, the director and the writer is treading on unfamiliar, dangerous territory; no matter how hard they try, they just cant get their story out of the one-dimensionality that so often encumbers the genre they are in. That is why the artiste has to work from the characters and the surroundings he works on. Neither Lawrence of Arabia nor Doctor Zhivago would have succeeded the way they did if all they gave us were lovely visuals and melodies (even though both have visuals and melodies that we dream of and hum now and then). There was always a sense of artifice that was buttressed by a living, breathing reality, which in turn gave these movies life. The plotlines parsed, the characters clicked. They made sense. 
I think were entering an exciting new era and form of pop culture, different from the pop culture that greeted us 20 years ago when Bathiya and Santhush released their first album, Vasanthaye. Were seeing genres being redefined and re-contextualised by our artists, which is not a bad thing. No culture survived, not even the most puritanical, without being open to change. No culture can survive for long if it shuts out that change. Besides, the generation that grew up on Bathiya and Santhush did not have the kind of access to social media and the internet that the generation who are being entranced by Sanuka Wickramasinghe have, so the latter, who as I implied earlier are intelligent in more ways than one, want something new. I thus suspect that our historical epics will have to change, not because the young want to tarnish history, but because they are tired of transliterating the textbook to the screen.

PM asked to name a successor
	
The committee appointed to look into the reorganization of the United National Party (UNP) in its report had recommended that Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should name a person who would take over the party leadership as and when he steps down from the leadership.
A member of the committee said it had come out with this suggestion as its members were of the opinion that it would be easier for the party to move forward when a suitable person who would take over the party is named. Also, it was stated that many in the party had wanted to feel secured in the future.
The committee had also recommended that Deputy Leader should be given more powers such as the authority to go around the country organizing party activities.
It was also highlighted that vital decisions on the future of the party would be made on March 22.
Meanwhile, the UNP Parliamentary group which met last evening had decided to work unanimously to defeat the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. The Prime Minister had told the parliamentary group that one should not panic about the No confidence as it had not been handed over to speaker yet. He had also told the group that such a motion would be taken up for debate as soon as possible once it is handed over to Speaker and would be defeated. (Yohan Perera)

' Port city ' stands tall despite civil society protests
	

The Budget Appropriation Bill of 2018 in which he claimed thatRs. 1200 million alone is allocated to minimize coastal erosion caused due to the Port City project
	The poison percentage in the air would increase by about 40% due to the drastic increase of the air pollutant The sand supplied at the international bulk rate is supply at $200 per ton which represents a value of $2.8 billion
	Another problem is the increase of land area from the 1st EIA report from236 hectares to 269 hectares


The Peoples Movement against the Port City (PMAPC) has since 2011 been protesting against the construction of the Port City and continue to thoroughly denounce the Governments decisions and actions in relation to the same. A press conference and seminar were held at the Methodist Hall by the Creation Care Desk of the Methodist Church on February 28 in collaboration with the Peoples Movement to oppose the Port City. These efforts were initiated with the intention of spreading awareness among the general public regarding the detriment caused by this project to the environmental, its impact on society and the economy, with their protests being strengthened by facts and figures.
The warning made by Dr. G.G. Karunaratne as reported in the Sri Lanka Mirror on February 3rd that in the future the buildings of Colombo city would face the threat of sinking and that the city as a whole would be affected by flooding due to the rise in sea level was affirmed by the panel. 
Recent responses
Sajeewa Chamikara, Environment and Legal Consultant of the Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform, stated that the response made by the present Government including the President, just recently, regarding the possible harms that could be created by the Port City project is a joke because the PMAPC have since the beginning of the project being trying to make the Governments in power aware of the tragedy that it is going to befall the country. He further stated that by responding to the threat of Colombo sinking, the President may be intending to avoid the more general and vast negative impacts that the port city is posing. Sajeewa pointed out to the Budget Appropriation Bill of 2018 in which he claimed that Rs. 1200 million alone is allocated to minimize coastal erosion caused due to the Port City project. Instead of gaining economic benefits, the country is already assigning money that could be well spent on welfare of the people in order to deal with harmful repercussions of building the Port City. 
Faizer Manzoor , a member of the PMAPC, criticized the open statement made by the Government that they are moving from a rural agricultural based economy to a service based economy in order to justify ventures like the Port City.
He claimed that by doing so the Government is ignoring the majority of Sri Lankas population, who are engaged in farming and fishing, and is attempting to destroy the very fabric of this country. The Yahapalana Government made a big song and dance boasting that it has converted the agreement from an outright sale to a 99-year lease. But we must realize that this is still no more than neo-colonialism. 
Adverse environmental, social and other impacts
Prof. Ranil Senanayake, an expert in System Ecology, strongly criticized the Port City project as an unscrupulous act of the Government through which politicians gain monetary favours. Addressing the environmental and health impacts he stated that the poison percentage in the air would increase by about 40% due to the drastic increase of the air pollutant matter PM2.5 and as a result, children of the future would be prone to cancers and other diseases. 
The harmful environmental impacts were further discussed by Prof. Carmell Corea, a Marine Biologist and Sajeewa. 
Coastal erosion-The PMAPC states that the required sand to build the city is mainly taken from shallow seas  in particular from the Thambagala area (between Uswetakeiyava and Negambo). For now approximately 200 million cbm sand has been mined for this purpose. In this mining process the seawater is subjected to a massive turbulence which then causes fish to move to other areas. This directly affects the fishing industry and the livelihood of the population of that area as a majority is engaged in fishing for their day to day survival. It is claimed that a large area of the coast from Galle Face to Moratuwa is already eroded. 
The PMAPC views the proposal submitted to the Cabinet by the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Patali Champika Ranawaka for an additional 40 million cbm of sand from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation to complete the land fill for the Port City as a move that would cause great alarm. 
Land Slides - The PMAPC observes that the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIA Report) states that approximately 3.45 million cbm black granite is supposed to be deposited at the bottom of the sea to build the Port City. The explosives used to quarry black granite are not used responsibly and are causing landslides in the hilly areas. 
Destruction of coral reefs and disturbance to the equilibrium and bio-diversity of the sea are other negative environmental impacts highlighted in the conference which would eventually affect the fishing community, tourism industry, and the nutrition level of people. 
EIA Report- The PMAPC also finds the EIA Report to be heavily flawed and not representative of the actual situation. There is nothing mentioned about any possible harm caused to the Galle Face beach nor any adverse effects to the seashore and coral reefs that might arise due to sand mining. The legitimacy of the EIA report was also questioned. Sajeewa also underscored the fact that the EIA report was intentionally opened to public debate in the month of December, when people are spending their holidays. 
Cost benefit analysis
According to the PMAPC, The Supplementary Environmental Impact Assessment Report completely ignores the sand and quarry fill that the Government is providing free of charge. The sand supplied at the international bulk rate is supplied at $200 per ton which represents a value of $2.8 billion. 3.45 million cbm of quarry material worth more than $ 1.2 billion is to be supplied free by the Government. For their input, the project company is to receive 50% of the saleable land which is forecasted at $6 billion. The PMAPC claims that CHEC is receiving 4 times what they have invested and we are only receiving 1/15th of what we factor in. 
Practicality of ending the project is the responsibility of the Government
Sajeewa stated that the agreement with the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) allows the project to be stopped during situations of severe harm. As a civil society movement we can only protest and notify the Government about the ill effects of the Port City project. The Government comprises the decision makers and they must bear the responsibility to stop this and make it practical. We suggest that without letting this project further threaten the future of our country, it should be stopped at least at this point. The authorities which are legally capable of putting an end to this include the Central Environmental Authority, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, and the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department. 
Petition will be open to objections on April 5
The CEJ has filed a petition against the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA), Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department, Central Environmental Authority, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd, Secretary, Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Chairman of the Urban Development Authority and finally the Attorney General. According to Sugath Athapaththu of the Centre for environmental Justice (CEJ), the petition will be open to objections on April 5th. Counter objections are to be filed on May 4th. The writ primarily pleads that the the purported Agreement between the Secretary to the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Limited which was entered upon by the said secretary under the so-called powers vested on him under the SLPA Act is ultra vires the powers of the 1st Respondent SLPA. 
We also filed a petition before against the the construction of the Port City, the drawbacks of the EIA Report being one of the main issues. There, the Court ordered the CEA to issue a new report taking into account all the factors. But what was subsequently issued was a supplementary report which is in violation of the Environment Act in Sri Lanka as it fails to give a complete assessment of all the possible issues concerned. Another problem is the increase of land area from the 1st EIA report from 236 hectares to 269 hectares. 
Although the fundamental rights petition filed by the CEA was not allowed leave to proceed and the petition was withdrawn, since the Port City affects the fishing community in a major way and also the traders in Colombo, a fundamental rights petition could still be filed by them. The tragedy is when the judiciary also acts under Government pressure and possible economic benefits being their priority concern. 
I believe that this project is part of the One Route One Belt initiative proposed by the Chinese Government, said Athapaththu.

No legal provision to cancel project
When inquired into whether the primary claim asserted in by the petitioners in the case filed in the Court of Appeal against the SLPA and others, Dr. Kamardeen, Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Law, University of Colombo,stated that as per the SLPA Act No. 15 of 1979, the SLPA is entitled to delegate in writing the powers, duties or functions of the Chairman (which are enumerated in s. 7(1)(a) of the same statute as to acquire, hold, take on lease to give on lease, hire, pledge and sell or otherwise dispose of any movable or Immovable property) to any employee of the Ports Authority with written approval of the Ports Authority. Hence if the activity delegated falls within the permissible activities and is done following the stipulated procedure, the act cannot be ultra vires. 
In response to the question directed regarding the legality of the SIEA Report, she stated that neither the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980 nor the amendment No. 53 of 2000 provide for a supplementary EIA report. They only refer to the the EIA and the Initial Environmental Impact Assessment. 
When questioned whether an agreement can be terminated in the event of severer environmental and social impact, she pointed out that there is no particular legal provision permitting the suspension or cancellationof a project that has gone through a successful EIA process, unless than to issue directives to any person engaged in the project regarding the measures to be taken in order to prevent or abate damage or detriment to environment as per Section 24B(1) of the Environmental Act. Compliance with such directive then becomes the duty of such person. 
There is also the fact that the specific contract between the parties may contain clauses that enable the Government to terminate the project on grounds of environmental harm. If that has also not been included, there is another possibility of terminating the project on the grounds of public purpose. This principle has come into investment law through international law and is a general principle of law. However, even if a project is terminated on such grounds, the public purpose element must be capable of being proved, otherwise the state will be liable to pay compensation if the company decides to turn to investor-state arbitration. 
In general, Dr. Kamardeen opined that based on past development projects, (not having assessed the environmental harm of the Port City project will be very severe) and in the absence of a strong legal regime for environmental protection, it would probably outweigh any economic benefit that is derived. Environmental damage is of 2 types - reversible or irreversible. Those that are reversible can be quantified monetarily. Developmental projects can be allowed where the harm is quantifiable, provided enough resources are allocated to rectify the environmental damage. Certain environmental harms are irreversible, and those cannot be quantified through any amount of money. If a project would result in an irreversible environmental harm, it should be abandoned.

Putin cruises to victory in Russia
	

By Anton Troianovski, (c) 2018, The Washington Post  Mar 19, 2018 - 
MOSCOW - Vladimir Putin cruised to victory Sunday for another six-year presidential term after an election that was long on spectacle and short on suspense. From the Arctic to the International Space Station, Russia rolled out an elaborate presidential-election-day display designed to show the breadth of Putins public support as he extended his tenure for a fourth term to 2024. 
Putins opponents on Sundays ballot included a nationalist, a Communist, and two liberals. But Putin barely campaigned, opposition activist Alexei Navalny was barred from the ballot, and reports of ballot-stuffing and people ordered to vote by their employers rolled in throughout the day. 
With about two thirds of the ballots counted, more than 75 percent were for Putin, according to the Central Election Commission. The runner up was Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin with 12.7 percent. Success awaits us! Putin told supporters in central Moscow. Together, we will get to work on a great, massive scale, in the name of Russia. 
Putin himself cast his ballot at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Asked what result he was hoping for, he responded: Any that gives me the right to fulfil the duty of president.

## Title: Response of CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd

Response of CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd
	
The Port City project has to be looked at from the development aspect not merely to serve the needs of the present, but for urban life several generations away. While the NGOs who have been protesting against this massive development project have been saying somewhat the same story, which is that we need to save our environment for the future generations, they somehow seem to be missing that this project is being carried out with all the checks and balances that are necessary from the environmental and social aspect.. 
When we talk of the future and the people who would live in Sri Lanka, we have to take into consideration the projections made by UN-Habitat that by 2030, 60% of the worlds population will live in urban areas. Having said that, one cannot build a city without sustainability in mind as it is a mandatory factor from a marketing point of view. So we would not be following sustainability practices just merely because its the right thing to do but also because it is a part of the business plan of this new city. 
And for this reason, the Port City has a detailed development permit with 72 conditions issued after the EIA was approved, which is being followed meticulously, so that our progress is mapped for scrutiny. In addition to this, there are 26 Government agencies who are monitoring and reporting the different aspects of the Port City development project. 
It is clear that certain NGOs continue to spread disinformation about Port City. This time they have regrouped under a new banner to bring out the same rhetoric whereas all relevant points of contention have been explained in various press responses and the 2 EIA studies.. We believe there is a hidden agenda to the spread of this misinformation. 

It is clear that certain NGOs continue to spread disinformation about Port City. This time they have regrouped under a new banner
For example, the theory that Colombo city buildings would sink spread by the NGOs, was a result of a hypothesis presented by one particular private company at the IESL a couple of months ago. This got blown out of proportion in the media. Carmel Corea is basing her arguments taking this report as truth when there is no scientific basis to back the hypothesis. This is irresponsible behavior and fear mongering. 
As per the numerous statements made by Port City in the past, sand dredging is carried out in a completely sustainable manner at distances of over 7.5km from the shoreline, and at depths of 15m or more. It is a scientifically proven fact any qualified coastal engineer will confirm that any dredging beyond the coastal zone of around 2km from the shoreline and more than 8m in depth has no impact on coastal erosion. Port City was imposed limits of more than double this minimum standard. Also, all offshore sand mining sites used for dredging will comply with environmental regulations. Therefore, the Government allocation for coastal erosion has nothing to do with Port City 
Also, the dredging has no impact on livelihoods as the depth of dredging is limited to 3m from the surface of the seabed, and a thickness of sediment of at least 0.5m is maintained. This practice prevents impacts on fish breeding. As for granite we have to clearly state that the Port City project obtains its granite from 11 quarries (which have their own EIA approval) in the Colombo and Gampaha districts amounting to only 7% of the quarry reserves of these districts. We have to categorically state that no coral reefs have been destroyed due to the Port City project and this was addressed in the SEIA. Also, the Coast Conservation Department has confirmed that there is no coastal erosion due to the project. 
We need to categorically state that the Supplementary Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) report is a very comprehensive document which has taken all aspects deemed necessary for an EIA into consideration. There was a stringent inspection and evaluation process and was put up for public scrutiny and received 215 written responses. As a result of this process, Site 1 for sand mining which was located between 2- 4 kms from the shoreline was taken off the dredging map. As for sand mining costs, it falls into the overall budget of the development project where 3 dredgers have been brought in and sand is being obtained from approved sites. Annual demand for construction sand in Sri Lanka is estimated at 12 million cubic metres. However, due to high salinity of sea sand, despite its price being much less than river sand, only 3% of construction in Sri Lanka is carried out using sea sand. i.e. only 0.36 million cubic meters of sea sand is used. 
The SEIA does not violate any law. The National Environment Act clearly has provision for Supplementary EIAs. In any case, the SEIA states that this document can be considered as a stand-alone document independent of the EIA as all aspects covered in EIA are more comprehensively covered in SEIA. For example there is a detailed cost benefit analysis carried out in the SEIA. 
At this point in time, the effect of particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 are purely academic where Port City is concerned because the current readings are within safety limits. However, we would like to point out that both the SEIA (Dec, 2015) and EIA (Oct, 2017) discuss the particulate matters under the relevant chapters on air quality. In particular, EIA (Oct, 2017), provides records on PM10 and PM2.5, which still comply with safety standards. Also the Government has recently announce of all vehicles being powered by batteries in the future, which will have a positive impact on air quality

Saudi women should have choice whether to wear abaya: Crown prince
	

RUTERS, 19th MARCH, 2018- Women in Saudi Arabia need not wear headcover or the black abaya - the loose-fitting, full-length robes symbolic of Islamic piety - as long as their attire is decent and respectful, the kingdoms reform-minded crown prince said.
With the ascent to power of young Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the kingdom has seen an expansion in womens rights including a decision to allow women to attend mixed public sporting events and the right to drive cars from this summer.
The changes have been hailed as proof of a new progressive trend toward modernization in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom, although the gender-segregated nation continues to be criticized for its continued constraints on women.
The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of sharia (Islamic law): that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men, Prince Mohammed said in an interview with CBS television aired late on Sunday.

## Title: SL should announce time-bound plan on its pledges to UNHRC: HRW

SL should announce time-bound plan on its pledges to UNHRC: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government should announce a time-bound plan to carry out its pledges to the United Nations Human Rights Council since October 2015, Human Rights Watch said today.
At an interim update before the Council this week on progress towards fulfilment of its human rights commitments, UN member countries should press Sri Lanka to ensure justice and accountability for the tens of thousands of victims of the countrys civil war.
In October 2015, the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 30/1 by consensus in which Sri Lanka pledged to set up four transitional justice mechanisms to promote justice, reconciliation and human rights in the country.
These included an accountability mechanism involving international judges, prosecutors, and investigators; a truth and reconciliation mechanism; an office of missing persons; and an office for reparations.
Thus far only the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has been set up  just ahead of the current session in Geneva. The high commissioner for human rights, in a report to the Council, expressed similar concerns. The Council will discuss the high commissioners report this week.
The Human Rights Council needs to make it clear to the Sri Lankan government that it expects it to stop playing games and start delivering on its commitments, said John Fisher, Geneva director. The Sri Lankan government needs to move beyond pre-session PR and present a meaningful and concrete plan to deliver results for the victims who have been awaiting justice for far too long.
Human Rights Watch welcomed the December action by the government to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT).
Creating the Office of Missing Persons, while a positive step, is just the latest body set up in Sri Lanka to look into enforced disappearances. Reports of prior government-established commissions, some of which have been made public in recent years, have not led to accountability.
The Office of Missing Persons now represents their last best hope to learn the fate of their loved ones, said Fisher. It must do its work quickly and properly. Families of the disappeared have appeared before commission after commission, and many have camped out in the open over the past year in protest of government inaction.
The justice and accountability mechanism in the 2015 resolution is a key demand from victims and families affected by Sri Lankas 27-year civil war between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Both sides to the conflict, which ended in May 2009 with a decisive government victory, committed serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including extrajudicial killings, deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, enforced disappearances, and torture.
The government should publicly set out when this mechanism will be set up instead of hiding behind various politically expedient excuses, Human Rights Watch said.
The government has also failed to deliver on its other pledges under the 2015 resolution. A government-commissioned task force led by independent activists carried out a nationwide consultation down to the grass-roots level and delivered a detailed report on the expectations of victims and affected communities.
However, the report and its recommendations have languished and it is unclear whether the government will take them into account in either the Office of Missing Persons or the other transitional justice mechanisms.
Another key outstanding pledge, namely security sector reform including the repeal of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), also remains unfulfilled. Sri Lanka has a long history of abuses by security forces, both during and after the civil war. The security forces have long used the PTA to detain suspects for years without charge, facilitating torture and other mistreatment. The governments claims to be working on repealing and replacing the PTA with a rights-respecting law have yet to come to fruition.
Sri Lankas state of emergency laws and regulations under the Public Security Ordinance (PSO) create a legal framework for abuse by the security forces in the name of national security interests.
The government recently resorted to emergency rule in response to anti-Muslim riots in the Kandy district. The government was largely successful in quelling the riots, arresting dozens of people suspected of instigating and participating in the violence, but the episode highlighted the lack of action in limiting the PSOs broad powers. The government had pledged to review these regulations under Resolution 30/1 but they still permit the authorities to detain people for up to 14 days before being produced in court.
A lack of justice and impunity for past abuses fuels current abuses in Sri Lanka, Fisher said. The governments delay in undertaking promised reforms is a slap in the face to the victims and their families who have waited for years for answers. The government should stop hiding behind politically expedient excuses and act on its pledges, it said.

SLFP ministers to tell Prez they'll support no-faith motion
	
SLFP ministers are reportedly hoping to inform President Maithripala Sirisena in writing that they would support the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

We are signing a separate letter to be handed over to the President. We will inform him that we will support the motion unless the Prime Minister is removed before that, he said.

State not intending to set up separate HC trial-at-bar: SASG
	
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda said yesterday the State did not intend setting up separate High Court Trial-at-Bar but a Bench constituted from the existing cadre of High Court judges.
He said the proposed permanent High Court-at-Bar shall consists of three judges nominated by the Judicial Services Commission from among the high court judges with one judge being nominated as Chairman.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Kodagoda with Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana, Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle and Senior State Counsel Yuresga de Silva appeared for the Attorney General for the special determination by the Supreme Court on the proposed Judicature Amendment Bill.
He said the permanent High Court-at-Bar shall have jurisdiction in respect of the offences committed by any person wholly or partly in Sri Lanka or committed by a Sri Lankan citizen outside Sri Lanka or on Board any ship or aircraft.
The senior ASG said the High Court was originally set up in 1973 by the Administration of Justice Act as an institute of administration of justice and it inherited criminal jurisdiction which was earlier done by the Supreme Court.
He said the District Courts and the Magistrates Courts had also conferred with these jurisdiction and all trials were heard by jury and thereafter the administration of the justice law was repealed by Article 105 of the Constitution and the Supreme Court, Appeal Court, High Court, etc.set up.
"In the nature of High Court, there are two separate Courts namely High Court of the Republic and High Court of Province under the Article 105(1)(c) of the Constitution. The differences between them are insignificant Under Article 112(b), the power of disciplinary conduct, Appointment and removal of High Court judges are vested in the Judicial Service Commission whereas it was earlier performed by Chief Justice. High Court of Province was created by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and in spite of the creation of the High Court of Province, the High Court of Republic continue to exist. In terms of our law, there are modes (manner or mechanism) of hearing the cases namely (1) Trial at Bar by High Court judges, (2) hearing by the High Court by jury before a High Court Judg, (3) hearing by three judges of the High Court without jury namely High Court at Bar or Trial at Bar by distinguished Judges," the senior ASG said.
He traced the origin of the High Court Trial at Bar, on the eve of the Sinhala--Muslim riots, the 3rd mode of hearing by three judges was introduced for the offences of civil commotion, disturbance of peace so and so forth whereas this crimes were originally heard by the Supreme Court and the power remained conferred on the Governor then but it was taken away and conferred on the Minister now where the proposed Bill provides for the 3rd mode of hearing.
The senior ASG underlined the government policy submitted that the 6th schedule to the Judicature Amendment has series of offences namely serious financial and economic crimes unde Penal Code. He differentiated the gravity of the offence mentioned in the theft category said it would be considered on the seriousness not on the nature of the crimes.
"Some of the serious crimes listed in the said schedule are Dishonest misappropriation of Property, Criminal breach of trust. In the aftermath of abortive coup of 1962, parliament enacted criminal law (special provision) Act, he reminded," he said. The hearing for a special determination of the Supreme Court was taken up by a Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices Buwaneka Aluvihara and Nalin Perera. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

There is a lady occupying a high office in a certain province thanks to the fortuitous circumstance of being a reputed astrologer which appears to have taken precedence over any other credentials.
The lady has become more a soothsayer than an astrologer and she has to cope with an unusual rush of leading politicos seeking to consult her about their future prospects these days. Leading politicos either over the phone or in person would seek answers to questions such as May I get a place in the top team Will the no confidence succeed and Will the government fall, they say.
Many politicos from both sides of the great divide reportedly put much store by her predictions.

Trump rails against Mueller investigation
	

By Philip Rucker, (c) 2018, The Washington Post -
President Donald Trump fired a barrage of angry statements Sunday railing against the Justice Department special counsels Russia investigation and attacking the integrity of former FBI Director James Comey and his former Deputy Andrew McCabe, charging that their notes from conversations with him are Fake Memos.
For the second straight day, Trump was unrestrained in his commentary about Robert Muellers expanding investigation, which is looking not only into Russias interference in the 2016 presidential race and possible links to the Trump campaign, but also whether the president has sought to obstruct justice.
In one of his tweets, Trump protested, Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans Another Dem recently added . . . does anyone think this is fair And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!
Mueller is a longtime Republican. He was nominated as FBI director in 2001 by a Republican president, George W. Bush, and was appointed special counsel by Rod Rosenstein, the Republican picked by Trump to be deputy attorney general.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, warned Trump that any interference in the Mueller probe would result in a very, very long, bad 2018.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned that a move by Trump to order the firing of Mueller would be a step too far for lawmakers. If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency because were a rule-of-law nation, Graham said on CNNs State of the Union.
