Chief Magistrate recalls notices on Gota, 6 others


	

The notices issued on former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and six others to appear in Court on September 7 were recalled by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake today.

The seven suspects were noticed by the Colombo Additional Magistrate on July 20 over the case of alleged misappropriation of state funds when constructing the D. A. Rajapaksa memorial and museum at Weeraketiya.

Rescinding the notice, the Chief Magistrate said the issuing of notices was a grave error and a violation of the Court of Appeal’s order which had been given in this regard.

Accordingly, Magistrate Dissanayake said Mr. Rajapaksa need not appear in court on September 7 and ordered the FCID to hand over the recalled notices to the suspects. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
