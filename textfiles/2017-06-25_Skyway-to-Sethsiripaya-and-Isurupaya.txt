An elevated road dubbed as sky way would be constructed to connect Sethsiripaya 1, Sethsiripaya 2 and Isurupaya in Battaramulla, which house many Government Ministries and Departments, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.

Construction work on three more buildings would also begin before the end of the year in lands belonging to the Urban Development Authority and the Samurdhi Scheme to provide office accommodation to Government Sector, he said.

“These buildings will be constructed for the Ministries and Departments, which are currently housed in buildings belonging to the private sector paying large amounts of money as rent,” he said.

He said a reasonable rent would be charged as rent for these buildings from the Government institutions. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)
