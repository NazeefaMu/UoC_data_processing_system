The Meteorology Department said today prevailing showery weather would be enhanced during next few days between November 18 and 21 due to an atmospheric disturbance in the Bay of Bengal.

It said heavy rains exceeding 100mm could be expected at some places in the Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Western, Eastern and Uva provinces.

Due to the active cloudiness in the Southern sea areas, heavy showers and sudden roughness of the sea associated with sudden increase of wind strengthening up to 70-80 kmph was expected over the sea areas off the coast extending from Batticaloa to Galle via Pottuvil and Hambantota.
