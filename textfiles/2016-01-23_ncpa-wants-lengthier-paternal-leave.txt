NCPA wants lengthier paternal leave


	

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) was contemplating on urging the Government to enact or amend laws to grant lengthier paternal leaves, NCPA Chairperson Dr. Natasha Balendra said yesterday.
“Currently, fathers of new born babies are given only three days’ leave,” she said.
The decision had been made with the purpose of strengthening and enhancing the responsibility vested in fathers on their children, she said.
"The common adage, which says it, is mother who is more responsible for a child is not true. Father's dedication also has a significant place in a child's life.
But it is inadequate. Granting more leave for fathers will give them more time to spend with their children. The bond between a child and a father should be stronger," Dr. Balendra stated.
She said that the NCPA had received 10,732 complaints on various child abuse cases last year.
Among the 10,732 complaints, legal action was taken against on 2,784 cases.(Piyumi Fonseka)
