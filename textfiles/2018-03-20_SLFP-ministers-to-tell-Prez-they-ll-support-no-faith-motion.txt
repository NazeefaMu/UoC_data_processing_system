SLFP ministers to tell Prez they'll support no-faith motion


	

SLFP ministers are reportedly hoping to inform President Maithripala Sirisena in writing that they would support the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Daily Mirror today that a few SLFP ministers would sign the no confidence motion but the rest would act during the voting.

“We are signing a separate letter to be handed over to the President. We will inform him that we will support the motion unless the Prime Minister is removed before that,” he said.

The joint opposition is collecting signatures for the motion and making attempts to obtain the signatures of some UNP members as well while some SLFPers are said to be opposed to the motion, which seeks to unseat the Premier. (Kelum Bandara)
