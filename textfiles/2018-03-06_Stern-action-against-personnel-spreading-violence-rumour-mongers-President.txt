President Maithripala Sirisena today assured stern action would be taken against anyone who spreads violence in the country and spreads rumours with the intention of provoking citizens.

Making a special statement over the inter-communal clashes reported in several places of the country, the President assured action against the elements which spread violence at a time when the government was taking measures to establish political stability, peace among communities and reconciliation in the country.

He also said stern action would be taken against those who breach peace and provoke citizens by spreading rumours and false news by various means, including social media platforms.

The President said necessary action has been taken after convening the National Security Council to discuss the prevailing situation.

“A proper mechanism had been put in place to take further action after having discussions with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, everyone should act calm, maintaining law and order,” he said.
