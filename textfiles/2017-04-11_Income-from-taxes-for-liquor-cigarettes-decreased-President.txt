President Maithripala Sirisena said today the income from the taxes for liquor and cigarettes had been reduced for the first time of the history.

“The treasury reported the Cabinet that the income from the taxes for liquor and cigarettes has been reduced for the first time of the history. Though this is a decrease of the income for the government, we consider it as a great investment for the future generation”, he said.

President Sirisena said the ‘Drug free Country’ program, inaugurated by the government to build a healthy nation by saving the future generation from the drug menace, had resulted in the decrease.

The President expressed these views at the ceremony to open the new building complex of the Teldeniya District Base Hospital, Kandy today.

He pointed out that the main benchmark of the development of a country is education and health. “A country where educated and healthy people are living is rapidly moving towards development”, he said.

He said it is the government’s goal to lead all sections of the country towards an efficient development. “Today Sri Lanka is getting international support like never before. The government’s objective is to use that support for the development of the country”, the President added.
