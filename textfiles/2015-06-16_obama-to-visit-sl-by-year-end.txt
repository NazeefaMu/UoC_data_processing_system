US President Barak Obama had assured that he would visit Sri Lanka at the end of this year, Leader of the House and Plantation Industries Minister Lakshman Kiriella told a news briefing today.
He said the government had invited Mr. Obama to visit the country.
Mr. Kiriella came out with this information, while countering one allegation stated in the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, that Sri Lanka had been isolated internationally after he assumed duties as the premier.
“If world leaders like President Obama are waiting to visit Sri Lanka how could anyone say the country is isolated?” he asked.
Countering allegations of controversial bond issue, which is another allegation made against the Premier, he said the Supreme Court had cleared Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran over the allegation. (Yohan Perera)
