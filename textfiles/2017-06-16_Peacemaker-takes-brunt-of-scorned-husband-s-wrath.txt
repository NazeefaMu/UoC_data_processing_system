An individual, who attempted to separate two bosom pals who were fighting over a woman, sustained injuries to his face and shoulder from the hand saw wielded by one of the men, who happened to be the husband of the woman in question.

Sources revealed that there were two friends who were bosom pals and lived in the Meegalawa Police division. One was married while the other was not. Both of them were so close that they even engaged in distilling illicit liquor (Kasippu) together.

Recently the married man's wife had started an affair with her husband's friend and even went to the extent of living with him. This did not go down well with the woman's husband and he had decided to take revenge on the cheating couple.

One day he had seen the pair heading toward the lake for a bath. The infuriated husband had waylaid them and had attacked them with a hand saw. Before he could reach them however a passer-by had decided to intervene in proceedings and had got between the hand saw wielding husband and the cheating couple. The unfortunate man had copped several blows to his face and shoulder and had to be hospitalised. The Galgamuwa police are conducting investigations into the incident. (Manel P Hewage)
