Game of musical chairs continues

Is there such a dearth of qualified people in the country that we don’t have fresh faces coming forward to administer the richest sports body in the country Sri Lanka Cricket?
When Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera announced that Sri Lanka Cricket elections will be held on January 4 and subsequently followed that statement up by fixing the dates for accepting nominations for the important posts one assumed that some new faces would appear to contest, but lo and behold what do we have here? It’s the same old faces that we have seen an umpteen number of times whose track records everyone knows, who have shown interest in coming forward to contest. The only thing that has changed is that one-time bitter rivals have now switched allegiance for reasons best known to them and are supporting one of the two candidates leading the race – Thilanga Sumathipala and Nishanta Ranatunga. Sumathipala is a former three-time president and Ranatunga has been secretary for quite a number of years and still was until April 1 when former Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake decided to dissolve the elected body on the grounds of corruption and replace it with an interim committee which is currently administering Sri Lanka Cricket.
Apart from the front runners for the presidency other names that have appeared in the media are that of Mohan de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga, K Mathivanan, the Dharmadasa brothers Jayantha and Upali, Nuski Mohamed, Shammi Silva, Hirantha Perera, Asanga Seneviratne and Michael de Zoysa – all of whom who have served as past office-bearers of Sri Lanka Cricket.
To any outsider it would appear like a game of musical chairs where you keep on switching allegiance from one side to the other so that the same old faces get elected time and again. One of the names that won’t surface on this occasion is that of former Sri Lanka cricketer Jayananda Warnaweera who has been the strong arm of the South. Warnaweera’s refusal to co-operate with the Anit-Corruption Unit of the ICC on alleged charges of match-fixing has led to him being banned from cricket for two years which makes him ineligible to hold any position related to cricket nor serve it.
The question that begs to be answered is ‘aren’t there any others who can serve Sri Lanka Cricket?’
There are enough people outside who are willing to come and serve the game but not in this present scenario where they will not stand a ghost of a chance of contesting and winning especially under the present constitution.
There are some high caliber people like Hemaka Amarasuriya, the former chairman of Singer, Michael Elias, former St Peter’s captain and managing director of John Keells, Brian Obeysekera and Kanthi Johnpillai to name a few who played cricket at high level at school and then gone onto hold good corporate posts. They would not mind coming to serve the game but not with a contest. For instance how can you expect Hemaka Amarasuriya to contest an individual like Sumith Perera of Badureliya SC?
If former Sri Lanka cricketer Roshan Mahanama who is retiring as ICC match referee wants to come in, with his stature how can you expect him to contest with the present set of persons and win?
For them to come and serve cricket the constitution needs to be revamped. You actually don’t need a committee of about 25 individuals to make decisions.
Sri Lanka Cricket is a Rs. Six billion company and there are member clubs who don’t deserve to be there. You take the voting rights of some of the clubs who don’t make any contribution at all other than come and collect a cheque from Sri Lanka Cricket for the vote. A majority of the clubs don’t even have a club house or a ground and one wonders whether they have their accounts updated. Some of these clubs enjoy the status of having two votes the same as established clubs like SSC, NCC, Tamil Union, CCC etc.
What the Sports Minister needs to do is to initiate a full inquiry and find out who the actual clubs are and which districts are functioning. If the constitution is amended half these so-called clubs will drop out and more respectable and honourable people who know what corporate governance is will come into serve Sri Lanka Cricket.
