Wimal usually dodged his summons: FCID


	

The Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) in a response to claims made by MP Wimal Weerawansa for summoning him on Poya Day to record a statement said they had no other option because the politician keeps dodging his summons saying he was busy with parliamentary affairs.

A senior officer said the FCID had no vested interest in harassing individuals by summoning them but was only carrying out their duties.

The MP was summoned on Poya Day to record a statement in connection with the misuse of some 12 vehicles belonging to the Presidential Secretariat and some 40 vehicles belonging to the then Ministry of Construction and Engineering Services during last year's presidential election.

The MP had told journalists outside the FCID that government leaders did not care about the religious significance of Poya Day. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
