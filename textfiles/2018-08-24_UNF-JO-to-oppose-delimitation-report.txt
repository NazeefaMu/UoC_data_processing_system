UNF, JO to oppose delimitation report


	

The Provincial Delimitation Commission Report is likely to be rejected by Parliament in the wake of the ruling UNF and the joint opposition deciding to vote against it, Parliament sources said.

UNF sources said its parliamentary group had decided to vote against the report.

Meanwhile, JO MP Udaya Gammanpila expressing similar views said the JO decided to vote against the report because the proposed mixed electoral system could result in a crisis, just like what happened to local government bodies earlier this year. He said the JO was of the view that its decision would not allow the government to postpone the elections any further by using the mixed electoral system as an excuse.

It now appears that the 16 SLFP dissidents, SLFPers in the government and the JVP will be the only ones likely to vote in favour of the delimitation report. In the event that the report is rejected in Parliament, the elections to PCs would have to be held under the proportional representation system.

The Delimitation Commission Report will be taken up for debate today with the voting at 6.00 p.m. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
