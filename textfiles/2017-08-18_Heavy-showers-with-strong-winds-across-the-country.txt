Heavy showers were experienced in most parts of the country today, according to our correspondents. Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department warned the naval and fishing communities to be vigilant of strong winds that would be experienced in sea areas.
It also issued a general warning that fairly strong winds would be blowing across the country in the coming days.
It said the sea in areas off the coast extending from Hambantota to Batticaloa via Pottuvil would be very rough as wind speeds could reach 60-70 kmph. The wind speed in other areas too could increase up to 50-55 kmph.
Meanwhile, the Met Department said heavy rainfall of upto 100 mm could be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces as well as the Kalutara, Galle and Matara Districts.
Heavy showers and strong winds would experience in the South-Western part of the country and surrounding sea areas in next 48 hours, the Meteorology Department said.
In stark contrast speaking to the Daily Mirror the Duty Meteorologist told the Northern and Eastern parts of the country would continue to experience dry weather until the inter-monsoon showers start in mid-September. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
