Reduce price of special arrack: Labour minister


	

Labour Minister W.D. J. Seneviratne today proposed a price reduction on a bottle of special arrack despite a decrease in government revenue by way of taxes.

He said this at Ratnapura District Coordinating Committee meeting which was held today.

This proposal was supported by Ratanapura District UNP Parliamentarian A. A. Wijetunga and UNP Provincial Councillor Siripala Kiriella.

The minister said a large number of people engaged in manual labour consume this brand of arrack.

“With the price of a bottle of arrack rising to Rs.1,500, they are compelled to find cheap alternatives such as Kassippu or other illicit liquor,” he said.

He said many estate workers, men and women are known to be addicted to 'kassippu' and added that his proposal might arouse much discussions among the people but whatever said and done we have to face reality. (Ajithlal Shantha Udaya)
