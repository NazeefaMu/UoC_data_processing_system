Ready to help Govt. to restore normalcy: MR


	

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday assured that his party was ready to support the government in their hour of need to restore normalcy in the country.

Addressing a hurriedly arranged news briefing at his residence in Colombo last evening, Mr. Rajapaksa said Joint Opposition (JO) Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane had phoned both the President and Prime Minister in this regard.

“We have no problem about offering our fullest support to the government, if it requires our assistance. In fact, Minister Lakshman Kiriella asked me to speak to the people at this crucial juncture. We request everyone to act wisely, stay calm and be patience in order to maintain law and order in the country,” he said.

He reiterated the inaction of the government had aggravated the tense situation and said the government had got it all wrong.

“Whenever something went wrong during my tenure, including the violence at Rathupaswala or Aluthgama, the blame was put on me. Today, the government is placing the blame on the police. This only agitates the people as then they have no one to turn to,” he said.

When asked about moves by the government to block social media to prevent false news from spreading, Mr. Rajapaksa said it was an unwise move.

“Many people, especially those from the business community, have complained to us about how this has affected their businesses,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
