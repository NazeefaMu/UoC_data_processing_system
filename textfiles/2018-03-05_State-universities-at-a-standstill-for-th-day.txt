State universities at a standstill for 6th day


	

The academic activities at 15 State universities and other institutions under the purview of the University Grants Commission (UGC) are at a standstill for the sixth consecutive day as at today as a result of the ongoing work stoppage by non-academic staff.

University Trade Union Joint Committee Chairman Edward Malwattage said they were carrying out a work stoppage from February 28 demanding a salary increase and solutions to several other connected matters.

He said though the trade union action had disrupted the academic activities at State universities, the UGC was yet to discuss their demands.

Mr. Malwattage urged the authorities to hold discussions with the non-academic staff to resolve this matter immediately.

However, Daily Mirror was unsuccessful in its attempts to contact UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan De Silva. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
