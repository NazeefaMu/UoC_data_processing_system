A federation of trade unions today staged a protest opposite the Global Transportation and Logistics (Pvt) Ltd (Global Park) in Seeduwa, demanding immediate solutions to the sudden removal of 66 workers, who were members of the federation.


Addressing the media, Free Trade Zones and General Services Employees Union’s Secretary Niroshan Viduranga said that they have been terminated haphazardly from the company since last Friday.


“Today also we are here to do our job. But the authorities are not letting us in. Therefore we are forced to protest in order to win our rights. We were on leave till January 13. But when we reported for work on 13th, the management had issued a list of employees whose services have been terminated,” he said.


He said the discussions with the owner of Global Park, Onella Karunanayake, regarding this were proved futile. (Ranjith Ferdinandaz)
