Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has no right to demand the removal of Buddhist temples from the North, State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today.

He told a media conference that there was no need to remove Buddhist temples because freedom of worship should be preserved in the North just like in other parts of the country.

“There are Buddhist temples, Hindu Kovils, Churches and Mosques in the rest of the country where the people coexist peacefully and the situation should be the same in the North as well," the state minister said.“Anyone could stage protests demanding parts of the country, but no matter what such demands will be of no use."

However, the state minister said some demands made by Mr Wigneswaran could be discussed with a view to arriving at a peaceful solution.

He said he agreed with one of the several demands made by Mr. Wigneswaran. This is about investigating some of the things that happened during the armed conflict.

“Investigations should also be carried out on the alleged sale of video clips on the war to channel-4 by some soldiers, the recent incident where an army officer is alleged to have killed his wife and all the other acts of violence carried out under the guise of war," he said while pointing out that such incidents were an insult to genuine military officers such as Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Wijaya Wimalaratne and Hasalaka Gamini.
