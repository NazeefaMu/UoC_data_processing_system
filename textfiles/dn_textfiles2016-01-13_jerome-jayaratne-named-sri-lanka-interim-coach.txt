Jerome Jayaratne named Sri Lanka interim coach

 
Jerome Jayaratne Sri Lanka Cricket's head of coaching, has been appointed interim head coach of the Sri Lanka team for the upcoming home series against West Indies. Jayaratne's appointment came four days after Marvan Atapattu had resigned as the national team coach.
Jayaratne was appointed SLC's head of coaching in 2008, a role that did not extend to the national team coached at the time by Trevor Bayliss. Jayaratne has coaching certificates from Cricket Australia and the ECB, and previously held the posts of manager-coaching as well as coach of the SLC academy squad. He also played 22 first-class matches between 1990-91 and 1995-96.
Atapattu had quit after Sri Lanka lost Test series to Pakistan and India, only the second time they have lost two home series in a year. He had officially held the position since September last year, but had effectively been head coach since April 2014, after Paul Farbrace's departure. Before that, Atapattu had worked as batting coach of the team since 2011.
