A vainglorious gimmick?


	



 

This important public institution in a province was shifted to a posh new building complex and a grand ceremony was organized to mark the event, they say.

 


A very high political authority was the chief guest on the occasion.


The big boss of the institution keen on placing on record the ceremony as a landmark event in contemporary history has gone to a great length to make it a colourful and impressive affair with no concern about the costs involved.


He had set aside a sizable amount to hire six video cameras and a drone to cover the event when the institution has already in its possession an expensive high-quality video camera.


Employees of this institution, who, however, looked on those grand plans as a vainglorious gimmick of their boss, joked that they were going to have a coronation, not an opening ceremony.
