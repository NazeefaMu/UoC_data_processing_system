British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Britain and its allies including Sri Lanka are watching the Maldivian situation very closely.
In response to a question, Prime Minister Cameron expressed hope that “the diplomatic efforts, including by the Commonwealth action group, will lead to the changes we want to see.”
He said;
It was an honour to meet former President Nasheed, who I think did an excellent job for his country in cutting out corruption and turning that important country round. He suffered terribly from being in prison, and it is good that he is able to get out to seek medical treatment, but we want to see a change in behaviour from the Maldivian Government to make sure that political prisoners are set free. Yes, we are prepared to consider targeted action against individuals if further progress is not made. Let us hope that the diplomatic efforts, including by the Commonwealth action group, will lead to the changes we want to see. Britain and its allies, including Sri Lanka and India, are watching the situation very closely.
