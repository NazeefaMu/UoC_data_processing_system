Science, Technology Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said yesterday the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had not given up its efforts to join hands with the joint opposition to contest the upcoming elections.

He told Daily Mirror his side had not abandoned efforts to unite the two factions of the party and that talks were underway in various ways to achieve this and added that some ministers were talking to the media without knowing what was going on behind the scenes.

“We have not given up our efforts,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
