Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that, if it's a fault, he would admit to the incident of ‘Sil Redi’ distribution but said it was not a fault.

He expressed these views in response to journalists after visiting former president’s secretary Lalith Weeratunga and former TRC director Anusha Palpita at the Welikada Prison.

“I have given eight orders in March, before the presidential election was held, based on requests received by the people. The decision to hand over ‘Sil Redi’ was only one among these eight decisions and funds to these programmes were allocated right away. This was not made aiming elections as charged by some elements,” he said.

He said he never forced his secretary to implement an order and said when a President says something to his secretary, it naturally becomes an order. “We don’t threaten the secretary with clubs to get work done,” he said.

He said even the judges had admitted that the two officers had not received any benefits by implementing the decision.

Meanwhile, he said the health condition of Mr.Weeratunga was not satisfactory and a specialist doctor from the National Hospital had also visited him. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
