The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was not concerned about whoever was appointed to the premiership, as the JVP was well aware of what both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa did as Prime Ministers, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.

He told parliament that the JVP did everything possible to defeat the political coup and said whoever becomes the Prime Minister was not relevant to them.

“If a new government is appointed, a New Prime Minister should also be appointed. But it is not relevant to us,’ he said.

Mr. Dissanayake said they voted in favour of the No-Confidence motion brought against the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on April 4 against his actions as the Prime Minister for three years and added that the same criticism they made against him was still valid.

He said even though the then government managed to secure its power in Parliament through numbers, it had lost confidence of the people and added that the government’s stability did not depend only on numbers.

“A situation conducive to President Sirisena’s political coup had been created in the country due to the people’s loss of confidence in the government. There had been a situation where the people were compelled to somewhat accept the coup. The government had been acting against the mandate obtained in January 2015,” he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
