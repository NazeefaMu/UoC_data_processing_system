Responding to President Maithripala Sirisena’s remarks yesterday, UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera said in a twitter message that he would rather be a butterfly than a leech.

The President yesterday said at a rally in Colombo that in the previous government, the decisions were taken by a 'Samanala gang' not by the Cabinet.
