Commenting on the election of business tycoon Donald Trump as the next President of the US, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said the results showed that common citizens are fed up with career politicians who simply deliver speeches which had no outcome.

In a tweet, Mr. Rajapaksa said “One of the reasons Donald Trump won was because people are sick of career politicians delivering rhetoric instead of results. This is a lesson for Sri Lanka to consider,”
