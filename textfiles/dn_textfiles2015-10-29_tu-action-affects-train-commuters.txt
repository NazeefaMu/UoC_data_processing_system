TU action affects train commuters

Trade Union action affected the smooth functioning of trains on Wednesday, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday.
He said only 57 train engines operated on Wednesday whereas 80 engines should have been in operation.
The minister said this was due to a tug of war between a section of technicians and clerks.
De Silva made these observations at the ceremonial opening of the Railway Quarters at the Slave Island Re-development Project yesterday where 40 houses were granted to Railway Department employees.
The minister said he discussed the issue with members of both those trade unions and settled the matter.
"The technicians' salaries had not been rectified. The technicians took revenge from the people by not repairing the engines," de Silva said. "How can the country move forward with such an attitude of the working class?" he asked.
