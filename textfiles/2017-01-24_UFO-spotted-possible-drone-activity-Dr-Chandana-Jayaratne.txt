The Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) that hovered in the skies and spotted in several areas of the country on Saturday night could be a drone activity, Professor, Department of Physics, University of Colombo, Dr. Chandana Jayaratne said.

Speaking to Daily Mirror he said that he could not say it was an alien activity depending on the video footages and the pictures which captured the object, as they were not clear enough or possible man made.

However, he further said an investigation regarding this has been launched as the incident was reported in many parts of the country.
