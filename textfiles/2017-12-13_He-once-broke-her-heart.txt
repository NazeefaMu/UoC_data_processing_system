Apart from winning cricket lovers’ hearts with his exemplary skills with the bat, Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli has bowled many ‘maidens’ over with his good looks. The 29-year old, who owns a number of records on the cricket field, carries himself equally well off the field   


On Monday, as Virat Kohli took to social media to announce his marriage with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma in Milan, congratulatory messages poured in from all quarters on social media for the newlywed couple. The news of Kohli’s marriage also broke the hearts of many girls, who would have hoped to marry the star cricketer in their dreams, yet they expressed happiness and wished him a happily married life ahead.   


England women’s cricket team star Danielle Wyatt was one such fan of Virat Kohli who had expressed desire to marry the Indian batsman in the past. However, when she came to know about his marriage with Anushka Sharma, the talented off spinner extended her wishes to them.
