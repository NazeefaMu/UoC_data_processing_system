IUSF motorcade to reach Colombo: Use alternative routes


	

Police advised motorists to use alternative routes to reach Colombo because the convoy of vehicles organised by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) is scheduled to reach Colombo using multiple routes including the Galle Road, High level Road and the Negombo Road.

Police expect heavy traffic between 12 noon and 3.00 pm.

They said the protesters had planned to gather outside the Fort Railway Station after 3.00 pm and informed the public to keep away from Olcott Mawatha, Lotus Road, Maradana and Hulftsdorp.
