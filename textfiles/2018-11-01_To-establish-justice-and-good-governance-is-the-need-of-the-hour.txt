To establish justice and good governance  is the need of the hour


	



 

Statement by Mr. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar  

 

A constitution is primarily a set of rules and principles specifying how a country should be governed, how power is distributed and controlled, and what rights citizens possess. Since the 1931 Donoughmore constitution, Sri Lanka has had universal suffrage to elect its representatives in government, making us one of the oldest democracies in Asia.   

While many countries around the world over this time, have had coups, dictatorships and constitutional breakdowns; Sri Lanka, in spite of the Cold War, multiple youth insurrections and a 30-year old war has managed to govern itself with respect to its constitution.   

Without respect to a constitution to govern a country, oppression shall rule over the people.   

This is an historic moment in the post-independence era of Sri Lanka.

What is unfolding in front of our eyes is an unprecedented sequence of events.  

As a nation, we have a moral obligation to unite, in order to establish justice and good governance, and protect our constitution.  

Whilst appreciating the  Speaker’s strong stance to uphold democracy during this uncertain period, I have no doubt, the Speaker will reconvene Parliament, and allow the duly elected representatives of the people of Sri Lanka to decide who commands the majority of the House, in the interest of Sri Lanka, today and tomorrow.   

Sri Lanka has been a beacon of light in cherishing and upholding democracy in the region.   

I urge all Sri Lankans to rise up to the moment and reject any act of violence and acts that undermine and hinder our democracy.  

I also urge leaders of all political parties to act with utmost responsibility at this very important juncture.  

Your decisions would determine the future of Sri Lanka and will be mentioned in our history books.
