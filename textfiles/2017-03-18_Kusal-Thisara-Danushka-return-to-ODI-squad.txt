Sri Lanka's ODI squad to face Bangladesh will be captained by Upul Tharanga once again, with three players returning to the fold.
Kusal Perera, Thisara Perera and Danushka Gunathilaka will return for Sri Lanka in the one-day international series against Bangladesh. 
After being left out of the two Tests against Bangladesh, the trio are in line to feature in the three-match series that begins in Colombo on March 25. 
Upul Tharanga will captain the 15-man squad in the absence of Angelo Mathews, with stand-in Test skipper Rangana Herath retired from the format. 
A loss of form saw Kusal left out of the squad for the Test clashes with Bangladesh this month and he will hope to return to the top of his game in ODIs after managing just one century and a fifty last year.


Thisara and Danushka return after missing the tri-seres against West Indies and Zimbabwe, as well as the 5-0 defeat in South Africa. (Sportal)
