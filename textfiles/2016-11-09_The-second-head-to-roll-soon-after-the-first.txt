It looks as if the administrative heads of independent commissions are going through a very inauspicious time. The administrative head of the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the telecommunications industry has now been sent home even before the ho-ha raised over the resignation of the DG of the Bribery Commission had hardly died down, they say.

 


According to informed sources this white collar high-up had incurred the displeasure of a powerful madam and an office at the apex had asked him to quit. And he had immediately left the hot seat with good grace.  By the way, this administrative head was responsible for issuing licenses to certain electronic media institutions in the country.
