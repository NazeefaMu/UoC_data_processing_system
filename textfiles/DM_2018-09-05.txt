A hiccup over a tea cup!
	

There was a large crowd of mourners at the Medamulana mahagedara when Number One arrived there the other day to pay his last respects to the departed Rajapaksa family member. He was warmly welcomed by his former big boss, the former Speaker and others of the bereaved family.

After paying his last respects to the departed, Number One was chatting with family members and friends when he was invited to tea.
According to the security rules being observed, all food and drinks meant for Number One should pass through his security personnel.
So, the security men themselves prepared the tea for Number One, placed the cup on a platter and gave it to a domestic aide to be offered to Number One.
The domestic aide who headed where the special guests were seated, respectfully offered the cup to the former strongman.
The former strongman, who found himself in a tricky situation, straight-faced nevertheless, put aside the cup.
Number One too rising to the occasion promptly helped himself to a cup among those ready for the other guests!
Later highly disconcerted Number Ones security men recorded a statement from the domestic aide responsible for the breach of both security rule and etiquette.
Asked why he did not offer the cup to Loku Mahattaya as he was precisely instructed, the domestic aide had replied: Why Didnt you see that I offered it to ape Loku Mahattaya!
And this reply had stumped the security men who had left without doing any further questioning, they say.

Anticipating another term in office!
	

The Northern Provincial chief has reportedly triggered a new issue by seeking an extension of the lease of his official bungalow despite the term of office is to expire in another month, they say.

The house now being used as the official residence of the provincial chief owned by a leading member of the Northern Alliance had been taken on lease by the Council and the lease is due to expire by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, the provincial chief had written to the owner seeking an extension of the lease and intrigued by this request, the owner had quietly inquired from the head of the Northern alliance whether they were going to re-nominate the incumbent as their candidate come the upcoming polls.
The alliance leaders had felt offended for seeking an extension of the lease of the house when the party had yet to decide on its nominee for the chief post and the alliance chief had asked Wiggy to meet him in Colombo early to sort out the matter, they say.

CEB officials in alleged  power generating controversy
	
The scandalous power purchase agreements the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has entered into with retiredIndependent Power Plants, has dearly cost the countrys coffers.This was revealed in the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report dated August 27, 2018. Entering into these agreements bypassing Government procurement procedure is alleged to have become a money spinning business to certain high-ranking CEB officials and its line ministry- the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy. 
Astonishing revelations show how the CEB with the concurrence of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy (MOPRE) has signed agreements with retired Independent Power Plants (IPP) granting undue benefits to the supplier (power plant owners) thus depriving the electricity consumers the opportunity to obtain low cost electricity. Given this background, CEB employees are gearing up to lodge a complaint with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), reliable CEB officials told the Daily Mirror on conditions of anonymity . 

For twoyears between2016 to 2018the CEB had paid Rs.1.824 bnto the PPAs fraudulently

Duringthe height of the war, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) had no other option, but to purchase electricity from IPPs on a short-term period as a temporary solution. This was to meet the ever increasing demand for power until CEB had its own power plants. Hence, CEB in June 1998 entered into a twenty-year power purchasing agreement (PPA) with Asia Power. This agreement lapsed in 2018. CEB then entered into an agreement with 20 MW ACE Power Matara which was then a subsidiary of Aitken Spenc
e PLC in 2002, for ten years and the contract lapsed in 2012. In order to provide electricity uninterruptedly, the CEB in 2005 entered into yet another a ten-year agreement with 100MW ACE Power Embilipitiya which too is a subsidiary of Aitken Spence PLC. This agreement lapsed in 2015. 
According to the respective agreements payments were to be made to the national grid not only for the units that were supplied, but also to settle the loans that had been obtained to construct the power plants and its interest component as well. Therefore the calculations were done accordingly. The capital cost, interest and return on equity were calculated and included in the unit cost that was settled monthly. After the contract lapses, the party to the agreement was to acquire all IPPs. But failure to acquire these retired power plants and re-entering into agreements with them, made the CEB incur huge losses. 
ACE Power Embilipitiya had invested approximately US $ 18 million on the power plant while ACE Power Matara approximately US $ 22 million and Asia Power approximately US $ 40 million. As per the agreements these payments were done in US Dollars. 

The sources further alleged that the reason to pay the capital and the interest over and over cannot be considered as an error

Before the enactment of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No: 20 of 2009, the CEB was able to enter into agreements with IPPs without following tender procedures. However after the Electricity Act of 2009 came into effect, the CEB, had to call tenders to select the supplier whose offer was the lowest when there was a need to procure electricity as per Section 43 of the same. 
But Section 43 further vests powers in the cabinet allowing the CEB to procure electricity without calling for tenders on two occasions. They are- (1) when the country is facing a power crisis or (2) at a time when there is a breakdown at a major power station. 
Even though, the Electricity Act (amended) stipulates these conditions, certain high officials at the MOPRE and CEB kept on entering into agreements with ACE Power Matara and ACE Power Embilipitiya to procure electricity bypassing the tender procedure. 
After the first agreements lapsed, in 2016 MOPRE is alleged to have misled the Cabinet and obtained its approval to procure emergency power, claiming there is a national calamity. Receiving Cabinet approval, CEB entered into an agreement with ACE Power Embilipitiya for one year where the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has issued a no objection letter to procure electricity on emergency basis if there was a power crisis situation in the country. Once this agreement lapsed in 2017, again the cabinet had been misled and the agreement had been extended by another year without the PUCSL permission. 
By misleading the cabinet once again, the CEB entered into a six month agreement with ACE Power Matara and the term was extended by another six months in the guise of a looming crisis situation. 
The PUCSL, which is the regulator for electricity industry in the country, has neither granted the generation license to ACE Power Embilipitiya nor approved the agreements both parties entered into in 2016 and 2017. It was the same with ACE Power Matara as well. 
This is against the Electricity Act No: 20 of 2009 as amended. The PUCSL has the authority to take legal action against this illegal power generation. According to Section 43 of the Electricity Act, licenses could be granted to IPPs for power generation only after considering the lowest bidder after following the procurement guidelines. Since the CEB entered into agreements to purchase electricity, without following the guidelines stipulated in Section 43 of the Electricity Act, the PUCSL correctly refused to grant the licenses, although the CEB says they entered into the agreement based on the Cabinet Approval, sources added. 

Govt. procurementguidelines not followed
Questions have now been raised as to why the CEB with the concurrence of the line Ministry entered into new agreements with the same suppliers once again without following Government procurement guidelines This is despite recommendations being made to the Cabinet on January 9, 2017 (Ref: MF/PE/CM/2017/04) by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. In his recommendations, Minister Karunanayake had given approval to procure electricity for a shorter period until the CEB acquires the retired IPPs. 
According to the documents this newspaper is in possession of, Secretary Power and Renewable Energy had not made attempts to purchase any of the three retired IPPs and instead had continued obtaining Cabinet approval claiming that the country is facing a power crisis. 
When the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) summoned Ministry Secretary B.M.S. Batagoda and the CEB higher officials on August 7, 2018, Batagoda had confirmed with the COPE that although there were plans to acquire these retired IPPs, it was the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Procurement Board that had not agreed to acquire the plants for the prices quoted by the power plant owners. The COPE report dated August 27, 2018 further states as to how the CEB through its agreement with ACE Power Embilipitiya has to pay Rs.2.736 billion for the next three years as investment cost whereas they could have saved Rs.101 million had they acquired the plant for the price submitted by ACE Power Embilipitiya which was Rs.2.635 billion. 
Be that as it may, the CEB and the MOPRE not only ignored the Cabinet decision to procure power following tender guidelines, but also have agreed to pay these retired IPPs once again, the capital they have invested and its interest component. 
The sources further alleged that the reason to pay the capital and the interest over and over cannot be considered as an error, but has been done purposely as part of this money is alleged to have gone to the hands of certain higher officials at the MOPRE and CEB. 
Paying back the capital investment and its interest component was strictly confined to its first term, but not beyond that period. The total project cost was forced into the tariff during the initial agreement period, but by paying the project cost over and over again even after it was settled, the CEB has deliberately burdened the cash-strapped national coffers. They deliberately failed to acquire these power plants despite receiving advice from the Finance Ministry. Not only had they failed to abide by the Finance Ministers recommendations, but also to follow competitive tender processes. Had they called for tenders from all IPPs, they would have send their bids and the CEB would have obtained from the lowest bidder benefiting the country, sources said. 
It had come to light as to how the CEB had paid ACE Power Embilipitiya for the period 2016/2017 a staggering Rs.912 million as compulsory payment (capital investment and interest). When the agreement was extended in 2017 once again another Rs.912 million had been paid as compulsory payment. For two years since 2016 to 2018, the CEB had paid Rs.1.824 billion to the supplier fraudulently. 
In the second agreement CEB entered into with ACE Power Matara in 2017, a compulsory payment of approximately Rs.420 million had been made. 
After the laps of agreements with retired IPPs in 2018, in submitting yet another misleading Cabinet memorandum on March 15, 2018, MOPRE Secretary had sought Cabinet approval to re-enter into agreements with the said three retired IPPs for three years based on a collective decision taken by the CEB Board of Directors. 
The Cabinet on March 28, 2018 had granted its approval to MOPREs proposal. The CEB had then requested the three retired IPPs to obtain power generation licenses from PUCSL or no objection letters for the extension of PPAs for three years. 
When Chairman Ganegala requested DGM (Energy Purchase) Eng. Sujeewa Abeywickrama, that he (Chairman) intends to sign the PPA with ACE Power Embilipitiya on April 5, 2018, Abeywickrama said that he couldnt prepare agreement papers without the cabinet approval document.
Since pressure was mounted on Abeywickrama, by e-mail, he (Abeywickrama DGM (EP) had submitted a draft PPA to AGM, P. L. G. Kariyawasam for three years as per the Cabinet memorandum. DGM (EP) had sent the e-mail to Kariyawasam on April 5, 2018 at 17.40 hrs. In his e-mail, Abeywickrama had instructed Kariyawasam to obtain the Cabinet decision paper and the legal clearance prior to signing the agreement, sources said. 
However despite of DGM (EP) request, a few hours after submitting the draft PPA on April 5, the Chairman had signed the PPA the same evening while GM and AGM (Transmission) signed as the witnesses. It is alleged that the second signatory to the agreement- the Deputy Chairman had signed the document the following day- April 6. Meanwhile CEB documents reveal that the legal clearance had been obtained from the Chief Legal Officer on April 6, but not before the Chairman placed his signature to the agreement. 
According to documents this newspaper is in possession of, the question arises as to why the CEB hurriedly entered into the said agreement on the verbal instructions on the claim made by the Ministry Secretarys that the Cabinet of Ministers had granted approval to the memorandum submitted. It is learned that by the time the agreement had been signed, the CEB had not received the Cabinet approval letter, but received it only on April 10- five days after entering into the agreement.



Handunnetti comments
Chairman COPE, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told the that there are no provisions for any Government institution to enter into any agreement based on a Cabinet approval unless they receive the approval in writing. We raised this issue in the COPE meeting held on August 7, Handunnetti said.
Meanwhile, General Manager CEB, by letters dated May 1, and July 12, 2018 had sought approval from PUCSL to procure electricity from these three retired IPPs to which, the latter had asked CEB to provide details under which clause of the Electricity Act, they are asking for approvals to procure electricity without following tender procedure. 
Meanwhile ACE Power Embilipitiya, sent its April invoice (April 6 to 30) which was approximately Rs.850 million to which, DGM (EP) had refused to authorise the payment. This is because the PUCSL had not granted them the power generation license. This led the CEB to interdict him from service from July 12, 2018. 
Although the reason for the interdiction was for his refusal to authorise the payment, the charges levelled against him were based on an inquiry for going against him at the National Transport Commission, sources claimed. 
As the CEB failed to make payments, ACE Power Embilipitiya had stopped generating power for the national grid from July 16, 2018 which led the GM to make a request by letter dated July 17 to the Secretary MOPRE to resolve the matter. 

Authorising illegal payments
Secretary Batagoda on the same day, had granted approval to the Chairman and GM to settle the outstanding payments to the investor based on approval of the Cabinet. However in the same letter, Batagoda had stated that the Electricity Act did not provide provisions for extension of retired IPPs. While authorising to make this illegal payment, he has also stressed that there is no provisions to do so. This is a joke, CEB sources added. 
Hence a new DGM (EP) had been appointed and on his orders, Assistant Finance Manager (Transmission) and Accountant (Energy Purchase) on July 18 had authorised the payments, violating the Electricity Act. 
Meanwhile, B.M.S. Batagoda by a letter dated August 6, 2018, to Secretary to the President, has made a request to direct the PUCSL to issue approvals to extend PPAs of IPPs- 24 MW Ace Power Matara, 51MW Asia Power and 100MW Ace Power Embilipitiya for three years as approved by the Cabinet until new power plants which have been planned will be commissioned from 2021. 
The letter further states that the unit cost of these three power plants are lower than most of the other thermal plants in operation. Once again Batagoda has tried to mislead the Presidents Office by claiming that these three retired IPP supply electricity at the lowest price per unit. Questions are raised as to what made Batagoda to make such a claim when there is sufficient documentary evidence to show how solar, wind and few other IPPs that were selected following a tender procedure supply low cost electricity to the national grid. Although Batagoda in his letter says that the average unit cost of ACE Power Embilipitiya is Rs.23.64, ACE Power Matara is Rs.24.41 and Asia Power is Rs.24.69, he has failed to state in his letter as to how the CEB, after following procurement guidelines, are to procure electricity at a lower cost from 10MW Vavunathiv Solar Plant (Rs.11.86), LNG Kerawalapitiya (Rs.14.99) and 10MW Chunnakam Wind Plant (Rs.10.07)once they are commissioned, sources further claimed. 
Batagodas letter further states, In terms of Section 13 of Electricity (amendment) Act, Section 43 of principal enactment has been amended. According to this amendment, Section 43-2(a), the Commission can grant approval for power plants which had been in operation on the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers prior to the date when this act came into force. According to sub section 4 (a) of Section 43 of the Act, the power plants which have received the approval of Cabinet of Ministers prior to the date of this act coming into force has been exempted from the requirement to submit competitive tender. 

At the moment the price at which ACE Power Embilipitiya supplies us is Rs.23.64.

Although Batagoda says that as such, page 13 of the COPE report dated August 27, 2018 states that when purchasing electricity after the lapse of the earlier agreements, the CEB has to abide by the Electricity Act (amended) and follow procurement guidelines when purchasing electricity. 
Media Spokesman CEB, Director Development Surakshana Jayawardena refuting the allegations said that there is no necessity to call for tenders from the three retired IPPs as they received Cabinet approval prior to the date the amended Act came into force. 
Although there are allegations, the CEB cannot interrupt the power supply and that is why we have continuously obtained Cabinet approval to purchase power from retired IPPs. When instructions were given to acquire the retired IPPs, we obtained the Government valuation. The prices these owners submitted were higher compared to the valuation of the government. They did not agree with the report of the Government valuer. As the CEB cannot afford their prices, it was recommended to procure electricity for a period of three years which is beneficial to us. If we enter into agreements more than three years, it would not be beneficial to the CEB, Jayawardena said. 
He further added that by year 2020, CEB will have its own plants and there wont be a necessity to acquire these depreciated power plants. 
When asked as to why the CEB is still paying the capital cost to these retired IPPs when this payment was strictly confined to its first term, Jayawardena asked as to how the IPPs could cover the continually repair charges, staff wages and other rehabilitation work if the CEB pays only for the generation cost He further said that it is cheaper to purchase electricity from these three retired IPPs rather than going for tender procedures, because there is a possibility of them bidding at a higher amount than the price at which they are supplying the national grid. 
At the moment the price at which ACE Power Embilipitiya supplies us is Rs.23.64. In the event we call for tenders, they will increase their prices knowing that the new competitors cannot supply for a lower rate as they have to pay for the Environmental Impact Assessment reports, to obtain the equipment for the power plants and for other additional costs. So it is beneficial for the country to extend the agreements with these retired IPPs rather than call for tenders to procure electricity, Jayawardena said. 
When asked as to why the CEB hurriedly signed the three year contract with ACE Power Embilipitiya on April 5, 2018 before they received the Cabinet approval document, Jayawardena did not agree with the allegation, but said that the CEB will never enter into an agreement unless they receive the necessary approvals in writing. 


There are no provisions for any Government institution to enter into any agreement based on a Cabinet approval unless they receive the approval in writing. We raised this issue in the COPE meeting held on August 7

 Sunil Handunnetti

A blatant lie
Nalin Edirisinghe, Director Licensing Division PUCSL, meanwhile told the Daily Mirror, that the CEBs claim that even after the first term ends, the CEB has to keep on paying the IPPs the capacity charges to run the plant is a blatant lie.CEBs claim cannot be accepted as these plants have been in operation for 10 years only. Easily they have a lifespan of 20 years or more. And if we check what CEB has spent after taking over the Barge mounted power plant, we can have an idea of any rehabilitation costs. That plant was used in Sri Lanka for 15 years and for a few more years elsewhere before it was brought to Sri Lanka. There are few components in the capacity charges agreed on for these plants, one for Return on Equity; Equity is fully paid so no need to pay this (in case of ACE Embilipitiya this payment is Rs. 58 Million per month), and there is a fixed O&M that covers salary, etc.. Then you have variable O&M and fuel cost in the energy charge. In the case of ACE Embilipitiya, fixed O&M and variable O&M have increased from the last year (of the PPA) figure and the fuel rate has remained constant, Edirisinghe said. 
With regard to the allegations the CEB has levelled against PUCSL for not granting generation license to retired IPPs, which is against the Electricity Act No: 20 of 2009 (amended), Edirisinghe said that Sri Lanka Electricity Act stipulates the requirements to be followed in addition of new power plants is Section 43 of the Act. 
In the Act, there is no specific Section to accommodate extension of retired plants, thus it is not recognised in the Law, and so it must be treated as a new addition. Globally, the thermal plants are not having a going concern after the PPA period and thus PPAs are modelled as such; where the total capital is paid off by the end of the PPA. According to Section 43, unless the power plant is procured under emergency situation in the country, the Transmission Licensee is required to follow competitive bidding process in procuring the power plants, Edirisinghe claimed. 
Edirisinghe further said that Section 8 and 9 of the Act stipulates the requirements on ownership requirements for generators over 25 MW capacity and any generation plant procured under the due process and meets the requirements on the ownership can be issued with a license irrespective of whether it is a retired plant or a new power plant. 
With regard to the CEBs claim that there is no reason for the PUCSL now not to issue generation licenses, because the Commission in 2016 and 2017 has issued no objection letters to the retired IPPs, Edirisinghe said that the Commission at any point had not issue generation licenses to any of the IPPs in 2016 nor in 2017. 
The Commission granted a no objection to procure electricity from ACE Embilipitiya power plant in April, 2016, but not in 2017.In 2016, the approval for the procurement was requested by the Transmission Licensee and the no objection was granted by the Commission on emergency basis, where water supply to Mahaweli power plants were restricted and one 250MVA transformer is out of operation in Kotugoda Grid substation. However in 2017 and 2018, CEB did not justify that the procurement is conducted on emergency basis and hence, competitive bidding process was required to be followed. Since, this requirement was not met, the Commission was unable to issue even a no objection for the procurement. Further, the plant did not fulfill the requirements on ownership of the plants above 25MW, as per Section 8 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, to be eligible to be issued a generation License. Hence, the plant was not granted a generation License even in 2016, Edirisinghe said. 
When asked what the benefits are to request CEB to procure electricity following Government procurement guidelines, Edirisinghe said, That is the Law, and Law must be abided by everyone, especially the state institutions. It would ensure transparency, and there could be other parties and other technologies that meet CEB requirements (if any) at a lower cost, even these plants themselves may bid cheaper, under competition. If we dont trust the competitive tender process, then that must be addressed without by-passing that. 
To the CEBs argument that in the event tenders are called these retired IPPs will certainly bid higher rates than what the CEB now pays them as the other power plants will bid higher prices to cover up their expenses to carry out EIAs and other instalment costs, Edirisinghe refuted the CEBs claims. 
Recent bids for Solar and Wind were in the range of Rs10-13, thus they could outbid these plants even with battery storage. We must keep in mind that what the country needs at this moment is energy (if at all) not capacity (we have 4,000 MW installed capacity while the peak demand is only 2,400 MW). CEBs practice of inaction and extending PPAs calling emergency requirements is not the fault of the consumer. There may be a transmission issues in the southern region, so that we need generation in that region; there are other transmission solutions to solve that transmission issue other than adding generation, all these must be explored before buying expensive power, Edirisinghe said.


      No necessity of calling for tenders      
However, Secretary MOPRE B.M.S. Batagoda is of the view, that there is no necessity to call for tenders when purchasing power from ACE Power Embilipitiya, ACE Power Matara and Asia Power. Prior to the enactment of this Act, a decision had been taken by the Cabinet of ministers and the PUCSL to give their respective approvals to purchase power from these three IPPs. The PUCSL and the Cabinet can give approval for these three IPPs which started supplying electricity to the national grid prior to the date of the coming into force of the Electricity Act. According to sub section 4 (a) of Section 43 of the Act, these power plants have been exempted from the requirement to submit competitive tenders. If the CEB says that electricity should be purchased to avoid a calamity situation and if these three IPPs are the only plants that sell cheap electricity to the national grid comparing to the other plants, why does the PUCSL want the CEB to follow a tender procedure Do they want to purchase electricity at a cost Batagoda queried. 
Batagoda further said that he couldnt understand PUCSLs stance not to grant its approvals to these three IPPs although under the same conditions, the latter granted the approvals when CEB extended the agreements in 2016 and 2017. 
At that time the PUCSL did not raise its objections, but now, as if it has woken up from a deep slumber, it says that unless power generation plants are selected following competitive bidding procedure, its approval cannot be given. What is the theory behind this argument This Commission is maintained by the peoples money to provide a better service to the citizens of this country, but not to take care of certain power plants that supply electricity at a higher cost. As we have to purchase electricity to provide an uninterrupted power supply, we have to purchase more power. ACE Power Embilipitiya and ACE Power Matara supply electricity at the lowest cost to the grid with the price being in the range of Rs.20 to Rs.22. We also purchase electricity from 20MW plant in Embilipitiya, which is situated in close proximity to the ACE Power Embilipitiya. We purchase electricity from them at Rs.28 per unit. We also purchase power at Rs.36 per unit from factories that generate electricity with their own generators, Batagoda claimed. 
When asked as to why he says that these three IPPs supply electricity at the lowest cost. His recent letter to the Presidents Secretary requesting the intervention to obtain the PUCSL approvals for these IPPs giving the breakdown of unit prices, the CEB purchases, which show that there are few plants that sell low cost electricity, Batagoda said that those plants are owned by the CEB. When asked if the CEB owned plants can sell low cost electricity why cant it acquire these three IPPs as directed by the former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Batagoda said that if the TEC and the Tender Board says that it is not viable to acquire for a higher price than the price given by the Chief Government Valuer, neither the Ministry nor the CEB has the authority to purchase them. 
Clarifying as to why the CEB continues to pay capacity cost for these three IPPs even after the laps of the initial agreement period, Batagoda said that the CEB has to pay a lower capacity cost to maintain these plants. If we do not pay the capacity cost how can they run their plants The country is heading towards a power crisis situation in 2019 and 2020 and we have to purchase more power. If we do not pay the capacity cost to them and if they refuse to supply electricity to the national grid what would be the situation The electricity that generates from these three plants are insufficient and we purchase more from other plants. Having a PhD and with much working experience, I know how to discharge my duties genuinely by my country, but not like the way how Engineers and PUCSL officials work for an agenda. They want to look after their personal interests, but dont work for the betterment of the country, Batagoda charged. 
Meanwhile, when asked as to what happened at the COPE meeting, Batagoda said that the COPE members listened to his explanation carefully and asked him to send a report regarding the allegations levelled against the PPA. 
This report will be send to the COPE within this week. They accepted what I explained and that was why I was asked to submit this report. The COPE pointed its finger at us based on the attacks by the media on us. I asked COPE to give us permission to purchase electricity at Rs.28, Rs 36 and Rs 45, which request was turned down by the Committee, he added. 
Chairman COPE, JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti However Chairman COPE, JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti told the Daily Mirror, that the MOPRE Secretary was instructed to submit a full report on PPAs and why capacity charges are still paid to these three IPPs. 
What we have observed is that there is a s huge scam associated with these PPAs, Handunnetti said.

CLINICAL ATTACK ON SURGEON What action have the line ministries taken
	
The Daily Mirror edition of 17 August 2018 carried an article in which an appeal was made by Sunil, a paddy cultivator in Badulla, whose wife Jayanthi (34) had been diagnosed with Meningothelial Meningioma, a rare disease that needed further treatment at a cost of Rs. 400,000. Follow-up surgery by a highly skilled neurosurgeon was required to replace an artificial skull in place of the part of her skull that had already been removed. 
The writer contacted Sunil and agreed to help him in his hour of need after obtaining positive feedback from a few friends who were also ready to help with the cost of surgery. 
Today in Sri Lanka our Peoples Representatives think not twice on spending Rs. 240,000 of our tax payers hard earned money on a single office chair to sit on, perchance to portray their false sense of importance, when a 34-year-old woman with three little children aged 12, 7, and 5 is languishing helplessly for want of a mere Rs.400,000. 

Mercifully, the hapless couple knew nothing about the tragic incident and had only been informed by the hospital that the young surgeon is on extended leave

On 21 August, in the same newspaper appeared a carefully written feature article by Kalani Kumarasinghe headlined Clinical assault of surgeon questions morality of students. The incident had occurred within the Peradeniya University premises and what had transpired was shocking. A band of student strikers had assaulted a young surgeon whilst he was on the phone attending to his patients needs. The victim Dr. Yohan Koralage was one of only 13 neurosurgeons serving in Sri Lanka and also the doctor who had attended to the initial surgery on Jayanthi. Mercifully, the hapless couple knew nothing about the tragic incident and had only been informed by the hospital that the young surgeon is on extended leave. I am made to understand that Dr. Koralage has suffered serious injuries to his head and hands with little hope for full recovery. 
What action have the line ministries taken in this regard or are they even aware of what is happening in the Health Sector and the Law and Order Sector that allows such horrific incidents to continue unabated Why are such hooligans allowed to roam free in the hallowed grounds of Peradeniya while a young mother is eagerly awaiting medical attention and the precious life of a young doctor is in such peril
we need to know the answers and we need to know them now.

Democrats vow sparks will fly in Kavanaugh hearing
	

REUTERS, 04th SEPTEMBER, 2018-U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday complained about Republicans blocking access to documents stemming from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughs previous work in the White House under President George W. Bush as the conservative judges Senate confirmation hearing began.
News photographers clicked pictures of Kavanaugh as he entered the hearing room. After Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing, Democrats protested the withholding of the documents and asked to have the hearing adjourned.
Democrats have demanded in vain to see documents relating to the three years Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump for a lifetime job on the top U.S. Court, spent as staff secretary to Bush, a job that involved managing paper flow from advisers to the president. Kavanaugh held that job from 2003 to 2006.
Republicans have released some but not all of the existing documents concerning Kavanaughs two years as a lawyer in the White House Counsels Office prior to becoming staff secretary.
If confirmed by a Senate controlled narrowly by Trumps fellow Republicans, Kavanaugh is expected to move the court - which already had a conservative majority - further to the right. Senate Democratic leaders have vowed a fierce fight to try to block his confirmation.

Distancing a controversial figure!
	

Number One in yahapalanaya paid an official visit to the North recently. He attended a public rally held thereafter participating at a series of public functions in various parts of the peninsula.

Diyawanna members from the North too had been invited to this public rally held in Myliddy area.
Before coming up to the stage at the rally, Number One had inquired from an organizer as to who were to be accommodated on the stage and how seating was arranged for them.
After listening to the organizer who explained how seating was arranged for each distinguished guest, Number One had instructed him to seat Diyawanna member Senathirajah in the chair immediately on his left by shifting the guest for whom it was already reserved well away from the seat reserved for him.
Later those who had attended the public rally had noticed that former State Minister Madam Vijayakala, who publicly yearned for the return of the LTTE to rule the North, seated in a distant corner of the stage.

The orator will be Gordon Mackay, the Acting Secretary General of Liberal International and a former member of the South African parliament from 2014 to 2018, where he served as a senior member of the shadow cabinet as shadow energy minister. Gordon Mackay is famed as a doer, a thinker and a good orator who has achieved great heights in the interests of his country.
He was instrumental in blocking the highly contentious nuclear deal, promoting greater integration of renewable into South Africas energy mix and refining an energy policy to adjust to the increasing decentralization of electricity production. He is also one of only three MPs deployed by his party to lead policy decisions with leading banks. Institutional investors and international governmental organizations.
Gordon was appointed Acting Secretary General of Liberal International which is the global federation of liberal political parties in January 2018. This is a wide network which includes seven European Prime Ministers, two African Presidents, the Canadian PM, large number of finance and energy ministers and leaders of the opposition. As a part of his mission, Gordon has worked with the political leadership of Liberal International to introduce a strong focus on climate change and sustainability. He is also working closely with member parties to redefine liberalism for the 21st century with a special focus on the liberal position on institutional and race based inequality. His work experience before entering parliament was working for UNICEF in New York in the office of emergency programmes with a specific focus on peace building and recovery in post conflict settings. Among his many qualifications are a masters degree in International Studies from the University of London, an honours degree in Development economics from the university of Johannesburg, post graduate diploma in Humanitarian Studies from the School of Tropical Medicine, University of Liverpool and professional qualifications in Energy Economics from the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics.

Dudley Senanayake memorial oration this year will be held on September 14, 2018 at 5.15 pm in the BCIS Hall at the BMICH.

FACETS 2018  the glamour of Sri Lanka
	
Though all that glitters is not gold, those that do glitter capture the eyes of the beholder. The FACETS Gem and Jewellery Exhibition 2018 did the same to all who attended the event which brings together the best gem and jewellery manufacturers of the island under one roof.
The 28th chapter of the exhibition was held for 4 days giving access to the general public to see, study and purchase gem and jewellery within a range of products from precious to semi-precious stones, and gold, silver to costume jewellery. FACETS is organized by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association with the support of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority and Export Development Board. Throughout the years the exhibition has become a platform for small and medium gem and jewellery manufacturers and traders to showcase their ware to a mass of local and international audience. The presence of foreign delegates has added value to FACETS, making it a truly international exposure for Sri Lanka.
The gala opening ceremony was attended by Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Science, Technology, Skills Development & Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage. Emphasizing on the importance of the Gem and Jewellery industry as a foreign income generating source for the country, the Minister pronounced that all stakeholders should work towards increasing the annual revenue up to 1 billion as a whole. Dr. Amunugama reiterated the cooperation rendered by the government towards the industry, mainly in areas such as customs clearing and taxation during both import and export. He also mentioned that in spite of this, there is a dire need to instill national policies that will contribute in developing the industry. The pioneers of the industry, most of whom I have the privilege of knowing personally have sacrificed immensely at the beginning. It was the gem traders who took our stones to the world by personally travelling to countries such as Madagascar and Tanzania to promote our treasures, he stated. Several generations down the line, the industry is thriving, especially in the international arena where the glamour of the Ceylon Sapphire has been brought back to its source.
The highlight of the ceremony was the launch of the coffee table book Sri Lanka Gems by Vladyslav Yavorskyy, an internationally renowned gemologist and author of Terra Spinel: Terra Firma, Terra Garnet and Terra Connoisseur.
The exhibition showcased many of Sri Lankas gem and jewellery manufacturers as well as several international stalls. The gems varied from precious to semi-precious to coloured stones, attracting buyers from all levels. Purchasing a gem is an investment which has a very low risk in depreciation. The varied value levels of the stones enables the buyer to make an investment within ones budget. FACETS was a platform to compare, evaluate and purchase gems, as well as a great opportunity to learn about mining, cutting, polishing and value adding of gems. The complete process from mine to market was displayed for those interested in learning about the industry.
The jewellery zone ranged from high value gold to silver to creative costume pieces, once again catering to all levels of jewellery lovers. The small and medium manufacturers under the National Gem and Jewellery Authority as well as the Export Development Board received significant exposure in bringing out their products to the market. Visitors were also able to make use of the opportunity to evaluate the jewellery they bout or already owned at the valuation counters.
The International Gem and Jewellery Exhibition marked its 28th chapter this year. Since inception in a small scale, it has played a key role in establishing and developing the industry, and continues to build the platform to enhance the involvement of all stakeholders involved. Today it has evolved into a full-fledged exhibition that actively promotes Sri Lanka to the world.

Govt. to control fees charged by private hospitals
	
The National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) is expected to issue a gazette notice specifying the maximum fee that could be charged from patients by private hospitals, nursing homes, private clinics and private medical practitioners and specialists.
"The pricing formula to be gazetted for the first time in Sri Lank's medical history consists of 53 services ranging from scans, tests and surgeries performed on patients suffering from ailments such as heart and chronic kidney diseases and various cancers," Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He said some of the medical services also include transplants, laparoscopy, appendicectomy, carpal tunnel surgery, hemorrhoidectomy, hernia, thyroidectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, colonoscopy, laparoscopy, endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, dialysis, echocardiogram, ultrasound scan, urine culture, lipid panel, fasting blood sugar test, cataract surgery, dental extraction and surgery, all type heart, brain, kidney surgeries, stents and angioplasty surgery and channelling.
The Health Ministry is to set up a special desk to inquire into complaints. It is mandatory to issue a receipt that includes the type of treatment and drugs given to the patient.
Meanwhile, the NMRA on the instructions of the minister also reduced the prices of 26 essential drugs of which 15 are for cancer patients and 11 for other diseases.
For instance, under the new price formula, a 50 mg Fluconazole tablet now costs only Rs.25 and the old price of it was Rs.59.22. The maximum retail price of 10 mg Montelukast tablet has been reduced to Rs.21 from Rs.154.31. The new price of a Topiramate 100 mg tablet is Rs.52 from Rs.186.88. Ceftazidime 500 mg injection is reduced to Rs.480 from Rs.650. The price of a Sitagliptin 100 mg tablet has come down to Rs. 48.50 from Rs. 232.00. Insulin 10 ml injection is reduced to Rs.1,200 from the earlier Rs.1,760. (Sandun A Jayaskera)

Greens mull over their latest choice!
	

The Green party seniors for some time have been looking for an alternative candidate for the big poll in case their leader decides to step down.

The partys deputy of Gam Udawa fame, Madduma from Uva and Willow Wielder Sanga have been among the most popular choices of the partys rank and file so far. But they all have declined the honour. In fact, at least for one of them astrologically auspicious hour is yet to come.
Meanwhile, several seniors of the Green partys highest decision-making body are said to have come up with a new name. Though the choice is new, the name, of course, is not new to the party for it is connected to an old Green family.
This character hailing from the upcountry is said to be having blood ties to occupants of several big chairs in the Diyawanna council, they say.

Number One in yahapalanaya had summoned the party organizers at the periphery for an important discussion the other day.

The organizers who had attended from various parts of the country had been seen talking hush-hush in small knots about the future direction of the party. The rumour that Number One was going to team up with the former strongman for a new political journey had been the main subject of their hush-hush. Some had sounded unhappy and highly upset about the rumour, but some others had welcomed it as happy tidings. Anyway, they all had decided to get the factual position from the horses mouth itself.
Presently the proceedings had begun and Number One himself was the first to take the floor.
It had been obvious from his address that he had no intention to have any truck with the former strongman and the rumour that set many a tongue wagging was baseless.
In fact, Number One had lambasted the JO for their plans to stage a massive protest against the government.
Number One, in conclusion, had appealed for their unstinted support to restore the party to its pristine glory.
Finally, they had dispersed without asking any of the questions they had planned to put to Number One!

Hithumathe Jeewithe:  Stray life of the Criminal Justice System
	
There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of the law and in the name of justice.
- Montesquieu

As a columnist some of the news that hits you on a daily basis is good raw material to work upon. Specially for a column not exclusively dealing with the political, a news item which might not capture headlines could still ignite the spark to write. The harrowing tale of Hithumathe Jeewithe is one such story. 
Batugahage Don Sumathipala alias Ranjith or Hithumathe Jeewithe, as he is popularly known, based on the tattoo across his chest, is not the ordinary criminal you come across these days. At the age of 17, he was made a criminal by the urge to avenge the gang rape and brutal murder of his school-going sister by the HQI of Kalutara Police, the Principal, a politician and a few others. He has been in prison for over 40 years, escaping seven times, sentenced to death a few times, receiving Presidential Pardon twice. Rarely would you come across a person who had borne the brunt of hard life to that extent, not due to his own fault in the first place.

Disturbing questions
I do not wish to justify the killing of five persons whatever the motives that were behind it. Yet the story of Sumathipala is unique in the sense that it poses so many questions regarding different aspects of life in Sri Lanka. Some years ago Sumathipala was interviewed by a private television station and the confession received the attention of the public, providing a lot of points to ponder about as various as an aspect starting from the Criminal Justice System, the leaders we have, Presidential Pardon, the life in prison , the gulf between law and justice, the good and bad sides of officialdom etc.
A justice system that pounces to punish men like Sumathipala while failing to reach those who commit gruesome crimes such as the one committed against his sister in 1972; an official hierarchy that abuses the power of office and uniform bestowed on them to serve the public such as the Senior Police Officer who actually took part in the gang rape and brutal murder of the innocent damsel; the Politician whose ego was pricked when Sumathipalas sister, being crowned Avurudu Kumari refused to allow him to hug her which consequently led him to order such heinous revenge on her, the corrupt officialdom exemplified by the so called Principal who betrayed the girl in to the hands of those vicious wolves in the first place; a self complacent justice system that ignores roots of delinquency but penalizes the symptoms- all are but a screenshot of a society accursed. 

Many do not brand him as a criminal but a hero
	
	It was certain elements of this society that made him a criminal


Sumathipala was left with no alternative but to avenge by claiming the lives of each and every monster who was responsible for his sisters fateful tragedy; according to him, the trial for the first murder he committed took less than one year, at a time when murder trials took years or even decades, the justice system resolved to punish a lawless murderer who beheaded a law enforcing officer and presented the SP with the severed head. Although decades have passed by, the logic remains the same; swift and resolute application of law to ordinary men likehithumathe jeewithe while being timorous, hesitant and deferential when confronted by those used to the silver spoon. 
Sumathipalas testimony as recorded by media reveals so many disturbing facets of life inside prisons; corrupted officials, favourable treatment of those who are affluent, politically powerful and backed by black money, a culture that makes those who are incarcerated for minor offences in to hardened criminals, inhuman and debasing treatment of prisoners in violation of normative principles of conduct and fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. 

Cell mates
The names of those who shared cells with Sumathipala during prison time spanning four decades includes Rohana Wijeweera, Vijeya Kumaranatunge, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena and Sarath Fonseka; I am sure there are many more who shared prison bunk beds with him for political crimes. Those names suggest that despite being a representative democracy , we still have a system akin to that described by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in Gulag Archipelago, criminalizing political dissent in failing to make a distinction between those and ordinary crime. In a sense being incarcerated is better than disappearing in the first place, you
may argue!
Then we have the maru siras, podi wijes, cheenas and the like. They too, are an indictment against a social system that has failed; driving innocent young men to the fringes of decent and civilized society by condoning exploitation, harassment and victimization by the haves. Almost all such individuals share one common denominator; all of them were POOR!! So, the criminal justice system rolls on extra turbos! 

One law for the Poor
A societal system that makes have nots criminals, murderers and prostitutes to be exploited by the haves for their enjoyment. A criminal justice system that sees it only fit to punish them severely without being aware of the possibility, nay , the imperative that they be restored and re introduced to civilization; turning a blind eye to the transgressions of the powerful and the mighty repeatedly. 
Despite all these negatives, Sumathipala talks about some exemplary characters within a system that vilified him; the SP of Kalutara at that time, who told this young man when he went with the severed head of the HQI in the morning, to calm down, turn himself in and offered a cup of tea, being fully aware of the circumstances that turned a wide-eyed youngster to a possible serial killer. Then the Prison doctor, who, after Hithumathe slashed himself with the broken dinner plate served in prison, did the surgery and refused to release him to be hanged insisting that he was a patient needing medical assistance before he could become a condemned death row inmate and after failing to retain custody of the patient, telephoned the then President William Gopallawa obtaining Presidential Pardon in the nick of time. Well , the Presidential pardon has served worthy causes as well, for a change, hasnt it

Convict or Victim
We have a legal framework to ensure rights of accused and convicted individuals as well as victims and witnesses. One wonders why a person who suffered due to the utter failure of a criminal justice system by being forced to take the law unto his own hands should be viewed as a criminal and not a victim. The conduct of the Piliyandala Police in rounding up this human being who has borne the brunt of all social evils on himself like the crucified Jesus, is despicable and possibly done on the urge of a sinister move of an invisible hand that wants Hithumathe silenced!
Thousands of comments on social media do not call Hithumathe a Criminal; in fact many hail him as a brother who did justice on behalf of a wronged sister. There is a film to be released celebrating this remarkable human being. 
All that seems to suggest that Hithumathe Jeewithe is a Hero; I do not beg to differ, either! 
It is the Criminal Justice System that should brand itself with a tattoo saying Hithumathe Jeewitheon its hind side, not Sumathipala!

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today rejected claims that he met with former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran in Singapore.
In response to a question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, he told Parliament that he has had no connection with Mahendran after he left for Singapore.
MP Dissanayake asked whether the Prime Minister had met Mr Mahendran in Singapore as reported in media and asked whether he did not have a personal responsibility to bring Mahendran back to Sri Lanka as he was PMs confidante and the one who recommended him for the Central Bank Governor Post.
"He can personally mediate to bring Mahendran back to Sri Lanka as he was his close confidante without seeking Interpol assistance or repatriation laws," the MP said.
The PM said the Government had taken every step to bring Mahendran back to Sri Lanka and asked the MP to complain if the Government had neglected the investigation.
"We have allowed the Attorney General and the Police to carry out their investigations independently," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Impossible to believe Kamer was radicalised: Goolbai
	
Former Principal of Asian International School (AIS), Goolbai Gunasekara yesterday said that it was impossible to accept that the 25-year-old Kamer Nizamdeen who was arrested in Australia for alleged terrorism charges, was radicalised.
I certainly remember Mohammed Kamer Nizamdeen who was recently accused of being a possible terrorist in Australia. It is something I not only do not believe in, but also it is something I will continue to disbelieve until (if ever) it has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that this exceptional boy is guilty of, someday,
Kamer came to AIS for the final 2 years of schooling in order to do his London A/L exam. He came from one of Colombos best known and most prestigious boys' schools where he had achieved excellent results at the Ordinary Level Exam. Many students enter international schools to do their Advanced Level Exam and most of them do well. But Kamer immediately became one of the most popular boys in his class for the very simple reason that his main attribute was niceness. This is an overworked adjective, but one that describes Kamer perfectly. He was a gentle, charming and yes, a nice boy in every way,
His unfailing courtesy to teachers and to his classmates was noticed from the start. Teachers who taught him were always full of praise for his work ethic and his general thorough approach to studies. His teachers have kept in touch with him after he left us (gaining 3 As I might add) and entered the University of Melbourne,
Envy is one of Sri Lankas worst national traits. It is characteristic of an island mentality say some psychologists. I am no psychologist myself, but long experience has taught me a fair amount of discernment. Kamer was gentle, sweet natured and comfortable with himself. He had no hang-ups. He had a happy home and projected an aura of personal calmness and self control. Perhaps he was too successful at what he did and that upset his contemporaries, she added.

Jana Balaya will go ahead despite venues being cancelled: JO
	
The joint opposition organised anti-government protest march, Jana Balaya Kolambata will be held today as scheduled despite the Colombo Municipal Council cancelling the bookings made for different venues, JO leaders yesterday assured.
JO national organiser and MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a news briefing that they had booked five different venues several weeks ago but they were informed yesterday that the bookings had been cancelled.
However, he said the most number of people in the history of such rallies would be brought to Colombo today to protest against the selling of national assets, the increasing cost of living, mounting taxes and the deterioration of cultural values.
JO leader and MP, Dinesh Gunawardane said people from the Northern, Eastern and Southern Provinces, the upcountry and other areas would arrive in Colombo today.
We want to remind the government that it no longer has a mandate to rule the country in the wake of defeat in the local government elections. People are being oppressed daily. Their suffering should come to end, he said.
MP Udaya Gammanpila said the government was under the impression that it had developed the country in an unprecedented manner and people were satisfied with governance.
The government doesnt understand the displeasure and the disappointment expressed by the people at their home and workplace. Therefore, the people should express their anger in a way it is heard by the government. The best way to do that is by joining our protest, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Prasanna Ranatunga asked bus operators not to be worried about the transport authorities threatening to cancel route permits.
The law says that only a fine of Rs.1,000 can be charged if a bus operated outside its permit. The permit cannot be cancelled. If the authorities fined bus operators, we will pay the fine by tonight with the help of the people, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

If we take stern action on this regard, the JO will accuse that the Government is misusing and violating democracy. Hence, it is up to the people to deal with protesters, the Minister said.
Many accuse that the Government is not taking any action because it is scared of this protest, the Minister added.

Kamers predicament  doesnt describe him! Says his former school principal at AIS
	
And I certainly remember Mohammed Kamer Nizamdeen who has recently been accused of being a possible terrorist in Australia
	
	His unfailing courtesy to teachers and to his classmates was noticed
	
	The news of his arrest sent shock waves through a vast number of people

I have been a teacher for over 50 years and a Principal for at least 30. During that time hundreds of students have passed through my hands and have touched my life in one way or another. 
I cannot truthfully say that I can remember all of them. ( And is there anyone in his right mind who would expect me to) But through the years, in the minds and hearts of their teachers, many children stand out. There are many reasons for them to be unforgettable characters; sometimes because they were very naughty. Such kids can be most endearing and we recall them with laughter. Others may have been brilliantly clever and we recall them with respect; specially if they were smart enough to stand out among other clever brains. Or they could have been fine sportsmen. I recall some others forming part of the cheering squad during outstanding victories by the school. Whatever the reasons may be, teachers can always recall the ones who were special to them for diverse reasons. 
And I certainly remember Mohammed Kamer Nizamdeen who has recently been accused of being a possible terrorist in Australia. It is something I not only do not believe in, but also it is something I will continue to disbelieve until (if ever) it has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that this exceptional boy is guilty of, someday. 
Kamer came to AIS for the final 2 years of schooling in order to do his London A Level exam. He came from one of Colombos best known and most prestigious boys schools where he had achieved excellent results at the Ordinary Level Exam. Many students enter international schools to do their Advanced Level Exam and most of them do well. But Kamer immediately became one of the most popular boys in his class for the very simple reason that his main attribute was niceness. This is an overworked adjective, but one that describes Kamer perfectly. He was a gentle, charming and yes, a nice boy in every way. 

He had it all!
His unfailing courtesy to teachers and to his classmates was noticed from the start. Teachers who taught him were always full of praise for his work ethic and his general thorough approach to studies. His teachers have kept in touch with him after he left us ( gaining 3 As I might add) and entered the University of Melbourne. 
Kamer was an IT genius and did outstandingly well at Uni. He was known as the Poster Boy at his Uni. where, I believe, he was used for various advertisements by the authorities. Because yes! He was also handsome. So unfair his peers may have thought. He had it all! 
The news of his arrest sent shock waves through a vast number of people. His parents of course were used to him being the ideal child; to his brother to whom he was an icon, to his teachers of both his schools, his classmates, his friends, his relatives and, of course, myself.
It is an accusation that will not be acceptable to most of us and if indeed he is the victim of jealousy and vindictiveness we all hope the perpetrator of such an act does not go unpunished. 

Kamer came to AIS for the final 2 years of schooling in order to do his London A Level exam. He came from one of Colombos best known and most prestigious boys schools where he had achieved excellent results at the Ordinary Level Exam.

Envy is one of Sri Lankas worst national traits. It is characteristic of an island mentality say some psychologists. I am no psychologist myself, but long experience has taught me a fair amount of discernment. Kamer was gentle, sweet natured and comfortable with himself. He had no hang-ups.
He had a happy home and projected an aura of personal calmness and self control. Perhaps he was too successful at what he did and that upset his contemporaries! 
That this young man could have become radicalised is impossible to accept. He was the ideal Muslim, but his religion was personally felt and not publicly shown. 
Kamer was a quietly poised and a successful person. He has remained so right up to this moment. I believe he is in a PH.D programme, something which we all expected of him. He had absolutely no reason to become a radical or fanatic Muslim and it will take irrefutable evidence to get any of us to believe in these charges levelled against him.

Legal action against those who cause public inconvenience: Nalin Bandara
	
Deputy Minister of Law and Order Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said strict action would be taken against those who cause the public any hindrance and damage to public property and institutions during the Joint Opposition protest today.
He said the government had given way to freedom of expression and the freedom for anyone to protest. The Joint Oppositions Jana Balaya Kolambata protest is not a big deal for the government.
The minister said that more than 4,000 security personnel had been deployed for public safety.
When asked if any incidents were reported, the minister said no major incident was reported.
Commenting on charges that busses travelling to Colombo were checked by the police, Bandara said the procedure was normal and that the busses were checked at random as with all security measures taken before such a public gathering.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Macron appoints key ally as environment minister
	

DPA, 04th SEPTEMBER, 2018-French President on Tuesday appointed a heavyweight ally, National Assembly President Francois de Rugy, as his new environment minister.
The move comes a week after high-profile ecologist Nicolas Hulot resigned from the position live on air, saying the government was not doing enough on environmental issues.
The appointment of de Rugy, 44, who has 10 years as a Green lawmaker under his belt and an authoritative presence in the assembly, seems aimed at showing that the centrist president is still taking environmental issues seriously.
But it was overshadowed by another high-profile resignation, that of sports minister Laura Flessel earlier on Tuesday.
Flessel, who along with Hulot repeatedly polled as the most popular member of Macrons Government, said her surprise resignation was for personal reasons.
The Olympic fencing gold medallist promised to remain a loyal team member with the president and prime minister.
But, she said in a statement, she wanted to get back to previous commitments, rightly focused on the human, on solidarity and international cooperation.
The Elysee said that Flessel would be replaced by another sporting figure, former world champion in the 200-metre swimming backstroke Roxana Maracineanu, 43.

Over 5, 000 policemen ready to face Janabalaya today
	
Over 5,000 policemen from various units armed with all riot controlling mechanisms will remain standby to face the anti-government protest organised by the joint opposition Janabalaya Kolambata today in Colombo.
A top official at the Police Headquarters disclosed the Daily Mirror last night that over 5,000 policemen called in from a number of police stations in the Greater Colombo area and its suburbs will be deployed to control traffic and safeguard law and order situation.
Contingents of police will especially be deployed in major locations in the city where the protest march could reach including Colombo Fort and Railway Station area, the Lipton Circus in Town Hall and the Liberty Roundabout in Kollupitiya, he said.
Since the origination, the routes or the end destination and the chief gathering point of the protest campaign was not disclosed by its organisers even till midnight yesterday, the police will have its troops stationed in many other crucial points in the city.
Also, the chief entry and exit points with routes to the Colombo including Galle Road, Kandy Road, Negombo Road, High-Level Road as well as Battaramulla Road will be heavily monitored during today.
The police deployment will also consist of a large contingent of Police Special Task Force personnel to face any unlawful occurrence and disruption to the day-to-day civil lifestyle by the unruly protesters.
Meanwhile, Police Anti-Riot Squads armed with Water Cannon Units as well as Tear Gas Canisters will be kept ready for any unruly atmosphere.
The senior official said that although they had received explicit instructions to use the minimum force in controlling the protest, relevant action would be taken to counter any situation disruptive to the normal civilian lives. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

## Title: Patchwork art at Devi Balika junction - EDITORIAL

Patchwork art at Devi Balika junction - EDITORIAL
	
The junction next to Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Borella has the unique distinction of being a meeting place of some 15 road lanes. These include four lanes each from Kotte and Horton place, two lanes each from Pelpola Vipassi Mawatha, Borella Kanatte road and the road that connects junction with Cotta Road and one from Shady Grove Avenue.
Such is the complexity of the vehicular movement in this location, usually a team of policemen is stationed at various points of the junction to man the traffic during heavy traffic hours. The proximity to Castle Hospital only goes to enhance the need for a smooth flow of traffic in the location which is frequently used by politicians heading for parliament too. 
Despite these factors the road condition of the junction is much to be desired. For the past few months it has been looking more like a patchwork art with its wide variety of layers of carpeting, with different heights and pot holes making it so uncomfortably bumpy.
The reason for this bizarre outlook, especially on to the left side when travelling from Colombo, is the excavations carried out by various government agencies in the site at regular intervals. While the motorists somehow bear up with the inconvenience caused by the regular obstructions in the junction by way of digging, what really gets on their nerves is the post-work outcome. 
Post-excavation; the government agency responsible for the digging fill up the respective pits and put a patch of tar on them often making a mound or a valley in the junction. These mounds and valleys prompt the motorists to slow down thus affecting the smooth flow of traffic. Ideally the government agency responsible for the digging  be it the Water Board (NWSDB), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) or any other, should have sought the assistance of the Road Development Authority (RDA) to smoothen the mouth of the pit once their work is completed. Or else at least after three or four such excavations, the RDA should lay a new asphalt carpeting in and around the location. In the absence of such moves, the junction today looks more like a battered war-zone than a crucial entry point to the Colombo city. 
A few weeks back, the media highlighted the state of the junction with photographs. Unfortunately no action has been taken so far by the authorities to improve it.
This junction, however, is not the only place in the city that needs some proper carpeting. Almost all the spots where excavations have been carried out are in need of smoothening. Even the roads in the heart of Colombo are in need of immediate repairs, no effort has been taken to attend to them for the past few years.
While the previous regime scored heavily on the management and construction of roads, its a fact that the UNP-led government is yet to make up its mind to maintain the roads properly. Some attribute this to lack of funds. Good roads are a crucial factor in the economic and social development of any country. They add up to economic growth and the living standards of the people. The public, while reeling under the heavy taxes slapped on them during the past few years, expects the returns in the form of development of infrastructure and transportation system. Driving or commuting down bumpy roads after paying those heavy taxes is certainly not something that the public deserve.

Addressing a Sathyagraha organized by the joint opposition (JO) he said, The incumbent government has violated the independence that we acquired after defeating the LTTE. The peoples democratic rights are being violated by postponing the elections".
The situation is going from bad to worse. The country is heading towards an autocratic form of governance rather a democratic rule, the former president said.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to restore democracy by forming a new government, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

89th Birth Anniversary falls on Sept 5 : MERVYN DE SILVA, JOURNALISM AND MOSCOW
	
Mervyn de Silva wrote a brief bio-data on the smaller-sized of the Lanka Guardian notepaper/ letterheads in the last years of his life. It was rearranged into a narrative and appeared on the back cover of Crisis Commentaries: Selected Political Writings of Mervyn de Silva published by the International Center for Ethnic studies, Colombo, 1999. It was Mervyns laconic look back at his life as he saw it in his late 60s. He never made it to 70. Here is his last CV just as he had typed it: 

1949-53: Edited University Magazine. Founded News Sheet.
1954: Joined Associated Newspapers, largest publishing company as part-time Parliament reporter while studying Law.
1960: Joined Associated Newspapers permanently.
1965: Appointed Deputy Editor, Evening Observer.
1970: Editor, Daily News, Premier English daily.
1972: Editor-in-Chief of Associated Newspapers.
1973: Newspapers nationalized by left-wing Bandaranaike regime.
1976: Dismissed.
1976: Joined privately-owned TIMES as editor-in-Chief.
1977: Times nationalized by right-wing UNP Jayewardene government.
1978: Dismissed. Founded Lanka Guardian.

Currently Colombo correspondent Financial Times, London, NEWSWEEK, and Times of India. Has worked for The Economist, London. Published in New York Times, Washington Post, Le Monde Diplomatique, International Herald Tribune, Christian Science Monitor and Far Eastern Economic Review.
Mervyn had so many dimensions and achievements he could have written a fuller CV. And yet his brief bio focused on his career as a print journalist. That was the axis and trajectory of his being. He wrote for publication in the print media, both mainstream newspapers and periodicals. He was a maestro of the printed word written for a general and regular reader. 
He was more. He was a literary critic, a film reviewer, a commentator on international affairs, a radio broadcaster on subjects ranging from poetry to world affairs, and for a while a regular commentator on international affairs (interviewed by Eric Fernando) on TV. 
He was a maestro of the printed word written for a general and regular reader
	He was a brilliantworld-class journalist and arguably Sri Lankas greatest journalist
What strikes one in his abbreviated CV is the strange symmetry of his dismissal by two (otherwise) contrasting Sri Lankan governments i.e. political Establishments. 
Izeth Hussain, literary critic, intellectual and diplomat, pointed to this phenomenon: 
perhaps it is not really surprising that he [Mervyn] was twice booted out of editorial positions. It is not surprising from a Sri Lankan perspective. It is more than surprising, stunning in fact, from an international perspective. For here was a journalist widely recognized as exceptionally brilliant, a world-class journalist as we say, arguably even Sri Lankas greatest journalist, and he of all people gets sacked not once but twice, on both occasions from state-owned newspapers. 
Hussain, who was senior to Mervyn by two years at the university, understood the mans trajectory and existential choices: 
He [Mervyn] would have rebelled against the constricted life-style expected in careers leading to one becoming a pillar of society. His brilliant performance at Law College showed that he could have become an outstanding lawyer, and minted money. Instead he chose journalism and, as his widow Lakshmi used to bemoan, he never made enough to buy his own house. It was his vocation. He was born for journalism. 
By the time of his death he [Mervyn] had come to be recognized for several years as the doyen of Sri Lankan journalists. A non-conformist, someone always on the side of the underdog, without illusions about men of power and their world, and incapable of identifying himself with any political party, perhaps it is not really surprising that he was twice booted out of editorial positions. It is not surprising from a Sri Lankan perspective. It is more than surprising, stunning in fact, from an international perspective. 
For here was a journalist widely recognized as exceptionally brilliant, a world-class journalist as we say, arguably even Sri Lankas greatest journalist, and he of all people gets sacked not once but twice, on both occasions from state-owned newspapers. That says a great deal about the vicissitudes of Sri Lankan journalism in our time. Mervyn experienced those vicissitudes at first hand and for a longer period than perhaps any other prominent journalist... 
The point is that Mervyn experienced it all at first hand and that is why he was the quintessential Sri Lankan journalist of our time... 
(First published under the title The Two Mervyns in The Weekend Express, Colombo, July 10-11, 1999)
I started writing this as I am about to emplane for Moscow and am now reviewing it from my desk at the ambassadorial residence above the Embassy. I visited Moscow many times as a boy, starting in the mid-1960s, running through the 1970s, in the company of my parents. On those occasions my father Mervyn was either a guest of the Russian Foreign Ministry or of the APN (Novosti) news agency headed in the 1970s by the formidable Latin Americanist, Kachaturov (whom I was privileged to meet). 
In the early 1970s my father was the first foreign journalist to meet the iconic foreign affairs expert and leading Russian Americanist, the head of Moscows USA and Canada Institute, Georgi Arbatov, when he returned from the last round of talks in Helsinki before the signing of the SALT 1 agreement. I was with him and my mother in Moscow at the time. 
As a young undergraduate I was fortunate to meet the finest Russian foreign policy thinker, Evgeny Primakov, who went on to be Russias Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, when he was still Academician Primakov, head of IMEMO, in 1976 in Colombo, when my father hosted him to dinner at the Capri Club. Academician Primakov invited me to study under him at IMEMO after I graduated from Peradeniya, but another destiny intervened. 
The diplomat-intellectual Izeth Hussains greatest encomium to Mervyn de Silva made explicit reference to a Russian intellectual, critical and journalistic phenomenon as point of comparison and affinity: 
But his greatest achievement, more than his writings, was surely the Lanka Guardian (LG). Through that small magazine, and against all the odds, he created democratic space in Sri Lanka. For some years I was perhaps the most frequent of all the contributors to the L.G. and some weeks before his death he reminded me that he had never hesitated to publish anything I wrote. After his death I recalled an LG article I wrote on the potential power of the mini-press. Alexander Herzens magazine, The Bell , I wrote, was the most potent instrument for forming Russian public opinion in the five or six years before the Russian Revolution. It has been written up as the most astonishing phenomenon in the history of Russian, and perhaps of world, journalism. At its height it circulation was 2,500. The LG s circulation was not much more, I believe. The LG is Mervyns claim to be regarded as Sri Lankas greatest journalist. 
(https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/an-intellectual-of-the-highest-calibre-a-fine-moral-intelligence/)
In an important sense therefore, my road to Moscow has been in the footsteps of my father. In a three quarter page polemic against my appointment to Moscow, Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya termed me a political gunfighter whose hunting ground is politics. This made me recall The Gunslingers Prayer in Stephen Kings The Dark Tower, in which the abiding sin which is warned against and has to be avoided, is having forgotten the face of my father. As I attend the International military tattoo at the Spasskaya Tower, hear the rousing cheer reverberating through the Red Square at night for the Sri Lankan Armed Forces band and especially the young Lankan army man bearing the Lion flag and singing Katyusha (the Soviet era tribute to the legendary rocket); shake hands with the guest of honour, much-decorated WW II veteran General Gennady Zaitsev of the legendary Spetsnatz Alpha Group (one of the worlds topmost counter-terrorist special forces); receive an exact replica of the key to the Spasskaya tower of the Kremlin; sit as a member of the Sri Lanka delegation across the table from Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Alexander Fomin at the Russian Ministry of Defence; and look across the Moscow river at night at the massive Stalin-eraHotel Ukraine (now the Radisson) where I stayed with my parents on our first visit in 1964, I have not forgotten the face of my father.

Their ire sends his plan haywire!
	

It is no longer news that a JO heavyweight from the Kalutara District created quite a sensation in political circles in recent times, when he boldly claimed that it was he who was the most qualified candidate next to the former strongman to run from his party for Number One, Number two or the Main Opposition Chair in the country.

This JO stalwart recently summoned a meeting of the partys district organization to discuss their plans for participating in the proposed mega anti-Government protest.
The party activist who compered the proceedings from the very outset had made several acid remarks about the former strongmans military sibling. However, the Kalutara stalwart had appeared giving the tacit nod to these remarks.
As the compere continued his attack on the military sibling, the audience had become restive. And a leading party activist in the district had told the JO stalwart amidst noisy protests: We are not going to vote the way that suits you at the coming poll. We are going to vote either for our big boss or the person he nominates! And all others had hailed his announcement in one voice.
However, the Kalutara stalwart had tried to adduce reasons for his claim, but the participants shouted him down, they say.

The reason is that some JO diehards are dead against having any truck with the Group.
Though the former strongman has overcome the vehement objections raised by the JO stalwart from Kandy, he has yet to still the protesting voices coming from the party heavyweights from Matara, Galle and Matale.
Seven to eight JO Diyawanna members who had gone through the worst of times are reportedly saying: We should not forget that these people deserted our ship when in stormy waters to grab high office in yahapalanaya. Now that we are smoothly sailing assured of reaching our destination, they want to come back on board. Have they got no shame
However, the former strongman who maintains that even the dregs of earth come in handy at an election is planning to iron out their differences at a roundtable to be held shortly, they say.

Twin poetic drives to reconfigure a shattered island
	
Hiniduma Sunil Senevi, Senior Lecturer in Sinhala, University of Sabaragamuwa, spoke at a book launch. He didnt deal with the text but as always he educated his audience.
Sunil Senevi traced the history of the English Poem in Sri Lanka. It was a revelation. He mentioned names I hadnt heard of before. He located these names in terms of the temper and fervour of the particular period of history and the issues that the various poets concerned themselves with. He lamented that the English poet is a relative that the Sinhala Poet does not converse with. He did not say that the English Poet or rather the English Poetic Circle not only does not talk to the Sinhala Poet, but is by and large ignorant of the latters existence or, worse, even if aware is somehow dismissive, not account of quality-lack but some other malady.

Book Review: (Dehamida Me Divayina) and Glimpses of a Shattered Island by Chulananda Samaranayake, Subhavi Publishers, 2017.

The event saw the launch of two collections of poetry, Glimpses of a Shattered Island and (Dehemida me divaina or Is this island really blessed) by Chulananda Samaranayake, a well-known translator and critic.
The simultaneous launching may have persuaded people to believe they contain the same verses, one being the translation of the other, but this is not so. There is a similarity in the theme of course, but the collections, however, stand independently of one another.
Chulanandas poetry should be assessed regardless of historical context and the cultural fixations of the present pertaining to literature and the language(s) of literature. He is convinced that Sri Lankan society needs to be overhauled and that only a political struggle can set things right. This requires, according to him, people with open minds committed to political engagement rather than those who have suspended critical faculties on account of political affiliation.

The title
Dehemida Me Divaina is actually a query. Is this island righteous he asks and interestingly has a toilet bowl cleaner on the book cover, suggesting intent. He wants to clean up and part of that exercise is pointing out the dirt.

Wearing white thats pitch black
flying so low, close enough to touch and yet leave untouched
landing now and then upon the drainage canal
picking delicately with beak the dirt
this good-hearted devout.
There is criticism and satire in his poetry. 
Consider for example this verse from
In the mind, there are fires burning
it is just ourselves subjected to scalding
the sun, dear son, is shining
and with arms folded we are waiting

Chulananda captures the pathos of those in the margins, the subalterns, the insulted and humiliated. Thats a theme that runs through the collection like a thread. The anti-establishment sentiment and antipathies to nationalism especially of the Sinhala Buddhist type comes laced with righteous anger (Arcade), empathy (The prostitutes lover at her funeral), tenderness (in most of the poems), pain on account of injustice of all kinds, a dash of nostalgia and prescription.
The poet is equally at home with the staid four-line rhyming format as he is with free verse. There are times when the strength of the poem is compromised by a tendency to detail and emphasize. The rhythm in the free verse gives more musicality and demonstrates command of the genre. Its the activist that takes center stage through it all.
Search (soyaw) which draws from a news item about body parts being found in different parts of the island. The translation should suffice to make the point:

Right hand on Darley Road
left hand on Cotta Road
right leg in Pitakotte
left leg in Pelawatte
lungs in America
kidneys in Russia
stomach at the Devram Vehera
heart in the State of China
as for the head, friend
it is yet to be found.

I feel Chulananda is best when he is frugal with words. Even the longer poems would read better if the frills and elaborations were left out. They could stand on their own as complete and effective pieces of poetic communication. Consider Our National Government, which could be translated as follows:

where canine swine asses mules
foxes bandicoots vipers and also chameleons
happily cohabit and progeny engender
a brothel it is, honorable

The title Glimpses of a Shattered Island is preface enough to the English poems. Comparatively, this collection seems more philosophical. Theres distance between poet and subject and yet the poems are consistent with the broad objective of political transformation. 
For example, a telling take on Mahinda Rajapaksa (obviously) points out the contradictions of the former presidents practices; he starts the day listening to pirith moves to the FCID, addresses the media complaining about revenge-intent and then dabbles in suspicious money transfers even as blames the government for inefficient financial management.

behind closed doors of his mansion
he polishes hypocrisy
[after a nap and a promise of protecting democracy]


Chulananda captures the pathos of those in the margins, the subalterns, the insulted and humiliated. Thats a theme that runs through the collection like a thread

To be fair, Chulananda does take down all politicians. He is however silent on the hypocrisy of the tribe he clearly identifies with (going by his pronouncements at various forums), the left. This is also evident in a play on costume change:

One day
he changed his dress to a national suit
What a miracle
He was honored as a Nationalist,
A pure BuddhistThough he was a rapist
sadist
nihilist
fascist

The problems of unnecessary elaboration are present in this collection as well and robs from extremely moving stanzas. Take for example this iteration of the common dismissal of war:

In the holy field of war
where large military boots are glorified
the tiny shoe shall be forgotten
history reserves no page for such sundries

The tiny shoe referred to was one at the bottom of a canyon (crater) created by cluster bombs.
As poignant and in this instance necessarily elaborated is the poets experiences of the 88-89 bheeshanaya and reflections on the same which he recounts more than two and a half decades later because he can now write the answer not permitted that day.
On that day he was called son of a whore, asked if he has ever seen a mass grave and told he would be buried in one. He points out the ridiculous nature of the question:

Dear Sir,
no point of asking such question
from a man who has already been buried

This collection is a welcome entrant to the world of English poetry written by Sri Lankans because it is at once a venturing to find fraternity even as it is a description of people, events, moments and things unseen, dismembered, misidentified or, if you want to be polite, considered inconsequential, differently remembered, differently identified.
He is not bridging a gap, as Sunil Senevi might put it. It wont hurt to say hello to this man, poetically speaking. He certainly persuades one to be hopeful, despite the gloomy elements of the present:

Settling comfortably

the end of a great wall.

WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD
	

What does the future hold for this country Two members of the Youth Parliament rape a girl and nothing happens!!! Conversely, in India two boys aged 20 and 24 years gang-raped an eight-year-old girl and were given capital punishment; the headline said DEATH SENTENCE FOR RAPE OF EIGHT YEAR OLD!!! This column has consistently advocated stringent punishment for rape but nothing has happened!!! By the time this Government decides to punish rapists, the incidents will be too many to count!!!

Forgotten, MR
The year 2020 is not far away and scrambling to get into the positions of power are the also rans and those who desperately want to get a look in.!!! Could we honestly hand over the governing of this country to a man who claims he does not remember Keith Noyahr Amidst all the untold atrocities, the fate of this poor man seems to have conveniently escaped MR!!! Therefore, in all conscientiousness, can we hand over this country to a man who finds it so easy to forget such an abominable inhuman atrocity committed on another human being More importantly, can MR, with no shame or qualms of conscience even think of ruling this country again He is probably in a dream world, or more likely, too frightened to confront his own nightmares!!! How many more Keith Noyahrs still remain unnamed

SOONER or LATER nothing NOW
As we said earlier, 2020 is not far away so lets take a pre-election look at what is happening!!! Suddenly the hierarchy is everywhere DOING THINGS, scrambling to get things done in the little time left to prove their mettle, that is if they have any!!! The Bond Scam is not the only Scam the country faces today but the Scams are all being conveniently pushed aside in a desperate bid to settle election promises!!! Real virtues like honour and integrity are defined by financial prosperity!!! Selfishness is portrayed as a strength and we are taught that in order to be successful we need to be wealthy!!! Enter the Bond Scam and every other imaginable Scam on Gods good earth!!! We wonder when and who will tell us why Ravi was originally made the Finance Minister; and why a second term was proposed for Arjuna Mahendran, who seems to be now calling the shots, demanding copies of Documents via Interpol!!! As if the atrocities committed by him were not enough, he dares to ask for documents!!! If he has guts why doesnt he come here and scrutinize the documents!!! Aluthgamage, the Kandy District MPs case fixed for further trial!!! Nishantha Chandrasena grilled for eight hours  outcome NIL!!! Private hospital charges to be regulated SOON!!! Please note everything is SOON OR LATER nothing happens NOW. All the other criminals are either hiding, gone abroad, or with cases postponed!!! We would do well to follow examples from other countries and ensure that JUSTICE, LAW AND ORDER ARE IMMEDIATE HAPPENINGS INSTEAD OF BEING CONSTANTLY PUT OFF TO HAPPEN SOON WHICH COULD EVEN MEAN NEVER!!!

Not in this country
We read that the New Zealand Prime Minister declined a $12,000/- raise, saying that they were pretty well paid!!! She further affirmed that they should put through a Bill BLOCKING THEIR OWN WAGES!!! A shining example of patriotic service to ones country!!! Could we honestly see something as PATRIOTIC or as CONSCIENTIOUS as this happening in our country Our President, recently awoken from a deep sleep, for once said NO to the salary increase for MPs!!! Would our Yakkos opt to pass a bill blocking their own wages Good Lord, not in this country, they wont!!!

End of times
We are living in a fabricated society, in a broken world where natural and unnatural disasters are a daily occurrence!!! The world was rocked when 11 Big Quakes hit Indonesia in a week!!! We had hardly held our breath over that when we heard that the Ice in the Arctic Sea was breaking up!!! The happenings are mind-blowing disasters!!! The situation in Kerala has still not abated, thousands homeless and starving, 1,200 dead as India counts the death toll from floods that devastated Kerala!!! A senseless shooting in Florida as three people are killed at a Video Game Tournament!!! Taking a precious human life seems to be the most horrifyingly easiest thing to do in the world today!!! Into this melee comes the shocking truth of an AIDS EPIDEMIC!!!

Animals higher than politicians
In this era where corruption comes first, we continue to see fabrication where wrongdoers are brought before the supposed Courts of Justice, now with High Courts also added, tried and sent to jail, only to be let loose and even allowed to go abroad!!!
The robotic culture clones who govern us, reward ignorance and glorify idiocy for real intelligence; welcome to a country where you are worshipped for your selfishness and taught to ignore what is important!!! I am proud to live in a country where literacy levels of animals are higher than that of most politicians!!! Suddenly we have ENTERPRISES AND ENTERPRISING MINISTERS POPPING UP EVERYWHERE, DOING THINGS THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF BEFORE, VILLAGES ARE BEING OPENED, THERE IS REALLY NO END TO HOW ENTERPRISING THE YAKKOS HAVE BECOME!!! THE BOTTOM LINE 2020 IS AROUND THE CORNER, SO WE ARE ALL AWAKE, WIDE AWAKE!!! WHILE ALL THIS ENTERPRISE IS LIGHTING UP SRI LANKA, OUR PRESIDENT IS CONTINUALLY OUT AND UP ON A SUMMIT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!!! SO CONSCIENTIOUS!!! They are even giving allowances to families of missing persons!!!

New Venue
Getting Married, Anyone TEMPLE TREES IS UP FOR GRABS SO YOU CAN DO IT IN REAL POLITICAL GRANDEUR!!! OOPS, SORRY FOLKS, YOU GOT TO BE AN HONOURABLE OR THE OFFSPRING OF AN HONOURABLE OR HAVE MONEY BAGS TO QUALIFY FOR THE TEMPLE TREES VENUE!!! PERHAPS OUR FORMER PREZ, OLD MR, SHOULD GET AN ACCOLADE FOR THE GRANDEUR AT TEMPLE TREES WHICH IS MAKING MONEY TODAY!!!


SPECTACULAR
In a Freddy video thats going viral, he says the Successes and Failures of this Government are both SPECTACULAR!!! He is so right, when they were doing nothing, they did absolutely nothing, now that they have suddenly woken up from a deep slumber; they are all over like an enterprising rash!!! As if that were not enough they are even adding Secretaries to every Ministry, hoping to get things done before the Nekath Time or guaranteeing that the Additional Secretaries will bring in the Additional Votes they are so desperately going to need!!! In the midst of all these happenings, the guys in Prison seem to be having a ball; first, they were dealing in drugs and now it is Social Media by one guy in Death Row no less!!! When and Where are all these happenings going to end

## Title: Will Kamer be cleared of accusations Shocking arrest of popular  Sri Lankan PhD student in Australi
## Section: Opinion

Will Kamer be cleared of accusations Shocking arrest of popular  Sri Lankan PhD student in Australi
	

Kamer was no simpleton; he was a bright, well-integrated PhD student and staffer at the UNSW.
	There must be evidence of actual preparation or an engagement or assistance to commit a terrorist act, which appears to be lacking in this case

It is too early to comment on the detention of 25-year-old Kamer Nizamdeen, a popular PhD student affiliated to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia as the matter is under investigation by the NSW Joint Counter-Terrorism Team. His arrest on accusations of planning terror attacks has shocked almost everyone in the University and back at home in Sri Lanka as his life in Sydney was a story of successes with robust achievements, respected and admired. 
It is bewildering that such a man could suddenly get radicalised almost overnight as widely publicised worldwide without any evidence of any extremist comment being heard from him at any time by any of his colleagues. It is well known that a radicalised person cannot hide his views though he can hide his conduct and activities. How is it that there is no independent corroboration from his associates or his closest circle in the university that Kamer was no longer the same man they knew 
The only evidence known so far on which he was arrested on August 30 (Thursday) was a notebook allegedly containing references to former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, references to Sydney Opera House, police and railway stations allegedly found in his room. Though the exact wordings are not in any media, the PhD student will have to explain what the notebook contents were all about. We do not know his version because we have not heard the police or the media quoting Kamer in their reports. 
It is difficult to believe that in a country where seven prime ministers were displaced in ten years and the last one Malcolm Turnbull was ousted by his own party colleagues on 24th August 2018, the Sri Lankan student could have had any ideological or religious reason to terrorise Turnbull. There appears to be no evidence that he had plans to terrorise the former Prime Minister or former Foreign Minister at any time they held office. 

PhD student
Kamer was no simpleton; he was a bright, well-integrated PhD student and staffer at the UNSW. It is mind-boggling as to how his alleged terrorism manifesto would be left in the open space of his shared room in the university premises carelessly for someone else to so easily stumble upon. 
Kamers brother, in a Facebook Post on Monday 3rd September, has expressed the view that Kamer was framed. His accomplishments within the university in UNSW speak for themselves and he would have had absolutely no reason to engage in such disgusting, hateful crimes to a city which has been extremely opening to him for the past 6 years, the brother wrote. 
Crime Reporter Sally Rowsthorne of The Sydney Morning Herald of Friday 31st August, noted those who knew the Sri Lankan postgraduate student were in shock after the arrest with multiple friends and neighbours saying that they wouldnt believe what Mr Nizamdeen is accused of doing. ABC also quoted the police saying that they do not believe that Kamer was capable of carrying out a terrorist attack. 
Except for the contents of the notebook, which are also capable of innocent explanations, there does not appear in the media any evidence of any previous expressions of opinion or conduct on Kamers part that would support the serious allegations made against this up and coming talented youth, whose future is on the brink of ruination. But then the investigations are continuing, we need to wait. However what is clear to this writer is that additional evidence notwithstanding, the sum total of the material against Kamer do not amount to even an attempt or a conspiracy to commit an offence known to the law as applied in countries which have not embraced oppressive Counter Terrorism laws or the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Law. Jotting down ones views in a notebook cannot by itself constitute an act of terror. 

The reported facts as distinguished from speculatory comments, such as alleged membership in the ISIS, do not appear to qualify as a terrorist or attempted terrorist act

There must be evidence of actual preparation or an engagement or assistance to commit a terrorist act, which appears to be lacking in this case. The reported facts as distinguished from speculatory comments, such as alleged membership in the ISIS, do not appear to qualify as a terrorist or attempted terrorist act under Australias Criminal Code Act of 1995 or under terror laws applicable in the New South Wales. Membership in ISIS itself is however, an independent terror related offence. There is no evidence of any intimidation to advance a political, religious or ideological cause and the act causes, the way a terrorist act is defined in the Australian Act. The phrase and the act causes would necessitate the act of intimidation causing actual intimidation, often ignored by investigators who probably want to demonstrate their smart detection to their superiors! But Australia as a country maintains a high standard of judicially supervised investigative mechanism. It is possible that he would be and should be cleared of the accusations, subject however to some extra ordinary, but unlikely links with a terrorist organisation being discovered or due to some external pressure from racist entities. 

Speculative comments
Dinoo Kelleghan in Sydney writing to The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka) of 2nd September 2018 has made reference to highly speculative comments spicing the story which are unsupported by evidence. One example is that Kamer acted as a lone wolf using his campus activities as a cover which earned a sub-title in The Sunday Times, leading to a permanent damage to a man who had networked into the university where he studied, worked and mentored students, and through projects that brought him plaudits by UNSW. Kelleghan reported further as follows: Police say the PhD student is affiliated with the IS but are not charging him with being a member of the terrorist organisation. But NSW Acting Detective Superintendent Mick Sheehy is quoted in the next sentence as having said, From the documentation we believe he would affiliate with the ISIS. 
One will easily see the propaganda hype to make the suspect appear to be linked to ISIS, the earlier one claiming Kamer is affiliated with the IS while the subsequent one stating that he would affiliate with the ISIS. 
Kamer Nizamdeen had no previous criminal records prior to August 30. But were the police rushed into arresting Kamer with such weak allegations possibly by external elements NSWs Surveillance Device Act of 2007 and other terrorist related laws permit the police to conduct surveillance to establish more sound and credible material against possible real terror suspects. Why was he not monitored at least for a few more days, which smart investigators often do before rushing to arrest What was the urgency Did the elements that may have pushed the police to arrest the Sri Lankan forthwith have an agenda to create a realistic impact on the then ongoing Defence Seminar in Colombo, which commenced here on Thursday 30th August 
Day Two of the Defence Seminar on Friday 31st August morning session had two relevant presentations to the subject under discussion in this article. One by Lt. Gen.(Retd) Orit Adalo, managing director of Adalo Consulting Ltd of Israel on Ideological Polarisation and the other by Maj. Gen. Roger J Noble, United States Army Pacific, Australia on Role of the military in Response to Violent Non-State Actors in a Destabilised International System. Space constraints do not permit a detailed discussion, which may be written off by some as conspiracy theories. The news of Kamers arrest however hit the news media here only at the conclusion of the two day Colombo Defence Seminar, perhaps a little too late.
