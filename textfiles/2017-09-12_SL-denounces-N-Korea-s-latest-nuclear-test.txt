Sri Lanka today denounced the sixth nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on September 3.

Issuing a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said the latest nuclear test, which was in repeated violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, threatens the peace and stability in the region and beyond.

“Sri Lanka joins the international community in urging the DPRK to refrain from further action of this nature to comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and to resume dialogue, facilitating the peaceful resolution of issues, which would be in the interest of peace, and the well-being and prosperity of the people of DPRK and the region,” it said.
