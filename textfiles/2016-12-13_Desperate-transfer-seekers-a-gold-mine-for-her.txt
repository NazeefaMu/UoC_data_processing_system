Desperate transfer-seekers a gold mine for her


	



 

This female white-collar one attached to a commission connected to public service wields much political influence and she has turned the officials calling at this office seeking transfers to stations of their choice into a veritable gold mine.

 


This female high-up collaring the officials who come to the commission seeking transfers offers to help them through parties known to her, which, of course, she explains, would cost them some money. Most transfer-seekers readily agree “to compensate her for her trouble.”  And she would take them to powerful political authorities who intervened to grant the transfers.


Although this female is well past her compulsory retirement age, she continues to hold her post thanks to her ‘correct connections’.  Besides, she has become ‘a law unto herself’ attending office only when it suits her and going out for shopping and marketing when she was expected to be at her desk attending to her duties.


The high officials of the commission have allowed the lady to have her way fearing reprisals given the political clout she wielded.
