Infrastructure development triggers threat of  deer  extinction


	



 

Environmentalists claim deer strolling across Trincomalee face the threat of extinction mainly due to infrastructure development. Although deer have always been a tourist attraction in Trincomalee, relevant authorities have failed to acknowledge the alarming threat to this endangered species.   


Commenting on this, Gonathota Environmental Organisation Chairman Anura Bandara told Lankadeepa that these animals have hitherto contributed to paint the beauty of Trincomalee.   


“After the end of the war, more tourists throng Trincomalee and a majority of them do not fail to snap at least one candid photograph with these tame animals. However, lunch sheets disposed in disarray by local tourists have fuelled the extinction of this species. These animals often devour leftovers on disposed polythene sheets, oblivious to the fact that what they consume ultimately determines their fate. However, the authorities have cleared arable land for infrastructure development efforts, thereby creating a scarcity of food for deer. It is sad to note that non-degradable polythene has been found in the digestive systems of deer carcasses. To add insult to injury, the many small tanks around Trincomalee from which deer used to consume water have been removed with the spread of the Dengue epidemic,” he said.

On a different note, Mr. Bandara said deer cubs fall prey to stray dogs. He suggests converting a block of land in the Fredric Fort into a sanctuary for this endangered species.   


Meanwhile, Sobadahama Environment Centre Secretary Niranga Wickremesinghe said in most countries, suitable enclosures were provided for animals and apt measures taken to preserve the environment.

Against this backdrop, the environmentalists have forwarded their proposals to the Trincomalee District Secretary, but to no avail.   


Trincomalee Assistant Wildlife Director Attorney Lalith Kumara said they were unable to implement these proposals due to the of funds. Thus, he appeals for assistance from volunteers and wildlife officers to save this extincting species.
