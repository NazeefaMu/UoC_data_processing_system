Human hand – trailblazer of Human Civilization

We have already discussed a series of favourable yogas formed on the palm beginning with the Amala Yoga and concluding with the Wimala Yoga. 


We propose to commence a new series of unfavourable yogas formed on the palm beginning this week. 


By the way, our readers would find it interesting that practically for every yoga be it favourable or unfavourable that comes in Astrology, there is an identical or corresponding yoga in Palmistry as well, giving similar results.


We propose to begin this series with Daridra Yoga, a yoga that comes in Astrology as well. 

Daridra Yoga: This yoga is considered present when all Mounts on the palm are flat or depressed with spots on the Mount of Moon and a sign of a star on the little finger.


Following formations are also considered as signifying the Daridra Yoga.


Fate and Sun lines are weak and broken


The Fate line is thick and it proceeds to the first phalanx of the finger of Saturn


The Mount of Venus is depressed and is marked by many obstructing lines


The Line of Sun is originating from the Mount of Venus


The Mount of Moon is depressed and there are two or more crosses on it.

Result: Person born with yoga would squander away all his wealth and is compelled to languish in poverty.

Kemadruma Yoga:  This yoga is formed when the Mounts of Sun and Venus are depressed while the Sun line is broken.

Result: Person born with this combination is compelled to lead a life of   misery and suffering. This bad combination would render ineffective all other good combinations if any, formed on the palm.  The subject keeps on committing mistakes in life and goes on repenting over them. He remains poor and is compelled to depend on others for his sustenance. 


According to ancient palmists, a prominent and clear Fate line can nullify the effects of Kemadruma Yoga. There are also other formations that mitigate the ill-effects of Kemadruma Yoga. They are: 


A Branch line from the Sun line proceeds to the Mount of Mercury


A line originating from a well-developed Mount of Moon proceeds to the Mount of Mercury


There are four full clear bracelets  

Asuba yoga:  A broken Sun line and a hardly discernible Mount of Sun produce this yoga.

Result: This yoga makes the subject lascivious and wrathful. He suffers from want. He is a cheat and believes in earning his livelihood by deceitful means. His life is a complete failure.

Papakartari Yoga: If the Mounts of Sun and Saturn are weak or depressed, the presence of this yoga is signified.

Result: Person having this yoga is a habitual sinner. He takes delight in cheating others and seeing them suffering. He is very wicked. He leads a life of misery and poverty.

Parashachatussagara Yoga: If the Sun, Mercury and Saturn Mounts are depressed and displaced, the presence of this yoga is signified.

Result: The subject always finds himself in reduced circumstances. He has no peace of mind and enjoys no comfort in life. All his efforts to do well in life end in failure, placing him in worse circumstances.


Napunsaka Yoga:A depressed Mount of Venus with a prominent spot on it signifies the presence of this yoga

Result: The subject is impotent and he would get no children 
of his own.
