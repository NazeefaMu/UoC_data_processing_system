The advent of yahapalanaya marked the dawn of a golden era for this young businessman affectionately called ‘Podimahattaya’ thanks to the right connection to a ‘lokumahattaya’. 

 


Some purohitas say that they do not grudge the sudden turn of the wheel of fortune in the young chap’s favour, but they are really concerned about the kind of business activity he is deeply involved in.


Meanwhile, a powerful purohita has discovered an exploit of ‘podimahattaya’. “The young man has purchased an aircraft manufactured by a Japanese company. It is parked in an airport in the city of the Lion which the family members often visit,” he confided in his colleagues. 


“Aney, don’t make false allegations against that boy,” another purohita had said. “It must be a toy plane for him to play with!”
