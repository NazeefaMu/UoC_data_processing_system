Mobitel was the Official Telecommunication Partner for the first-ever ‘YouTube Open Mic Night’ in Sri Lanka held at the Shangri-a - Colombo recently. Considering that this is YouTube’s first event in the country, the occasion witnessed the presence of YouTube celebrities, content creators, YouTube influencers, enthusiasts, brand ambassadors and social media buffs under one roof along with about 200 tech-savvy participants. As the official telecommunication partner, Mobitel facilitated a distinguished event powered by Google and hosted locally by Google’s Business community in Sri Lanka – Google Business Group (GBG) - and the local YouTube partners.

YouTube is the world’s leading video sharing platform with over 1.57 billion active users each month as of May 2018. YouTube has also become a hub for users, brands, entertainers and businesses to reach out to wider audiences, show what they do, what they offer and to keep audiences engaged across multiple devices and social platforms. 

In Sri Lanka, YouTube has over 2.5 million unique daily visitors and approximately 6.5 million monthly unique visitors in 2018. Local YouTube watch time grew by nearly 60% in 2017 and today almost 30 million videos are watched daily. This amounts to YouTube being one of the largest media facilitators allowing brand personalities, celebrities, businesses and influencers to tap into a wide and active pool of the digitally engaged Sri Lankans.



Commenting on Mobitel’s decision to partner the event, Prabhath Gamage - General Manager, Enterprise Business of Sri Lanka’s National Mobile Service Provider, said, “Mobitel is delighted to be part of  the first-ever ‘YouTube Open Mic Night’ as the Official Telecommunication Partner, making this one among the prestigious events we have partnered. YouTube is undeniably a powerful platform for communication globally and wields powerful influence over the world of entertainment, art and culture, business and so on. Mobitel is committed to catering to customer needs and by partnering an event of this magnitude, we are bringing the world closer to Sri Lankans.”
