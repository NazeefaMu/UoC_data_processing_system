Pop star George Michael has died aged 53 at his home in Oxfordshire. The musician's publicist said that he had 'passed away peacefully' at his property in Goring at 1.42pm today, the Daily Mail reported.

Michael's former manager Michael Lippman claimed he had died in bed as a result of 'heart failure.'

Thames Valley Police said officers were called to a property in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, shortly before 2pm on Christmas Day.

A spokesman said: 'Sadly, a 53-year-old man was confirmed deceased at the scene. At this stage the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.'

His Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley and close friend Elton John have lead the tributes to the star on social media.

Posting on Twitter, musician Ridgeley wrote: 'Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog. Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved. A xx'

While John posted a heartfelt message along with a picture of the pair together on his Instagram page.

He wrote: 'I am in deep shock. I have lost a beloved friend - the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans. @GeorgeMichael #RIP'

Michael, who was set to release a documentary in 2017, rose to fame as a member of Wham! who were known for their hits Club Tropicana and Last Christmas.

The singer - whose real name is Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - sold more than 100 million albums throughout a career spanning almost four decades.

In a statement, Michael's publicist said: 'It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period.

'The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.'

The singer's death comes as he planned to work on a new album with UK producer Naughty Boy.

In an interview with the BBC earlier this month, the producer, who has worked with a list of stars including Beyonce, said: 'I can't wait. I don't know what to expect. And, to be honest, he's more mysterious than anyone else so I'm actually excited.

'I reached out and then he got back.

'He's got an album coming out next year, and he's going to be doing something for my album as well.'

Naughty Boy paid tribute tonight by tweeting the title of one of Michael's hits, he simply posted: 'jesus to a child.'

While enjoying a glittering life onstage, Michael has endured a turbulent personal life and nearly died from pneumonia while on tour in late 2011.

After receiving treatment in a Vienna hospital, he made a tearful appearance outside his London home and said it had been 'touch and go' whether he lived.

Doctors had performed a tracheotomy to keep his airways open and he was unconscious for some of his spell in hospital.

He later told the Daily Mail: 'It almost killed me. On a subconscious level, it was very frightening and I'll probably never feel quite as safe in life again.

'But I also remember experiencing incredible guilt for my family and friends, because they literally spent weeks not knowing whether I was going to make it.

'Now, if that had happened to me in reverse, if I'd had to watch one of my sisters go through that, well... it would have devastated me.

For most of the time, though, I was pretty much out of it, so I didn't realise the danger I was in until after I'd come out the other side.'  

Michael had also struggled with drug addiction and admitted that during one period he was smoking 25 joints a day. In 2008, he was caught smoking crack cocaine in a public toilet.

As the world comes to terms with the loss of one of its greatest pop stars, celebrity fans have taken to Twitter to share their grief.

Ricky Gervais, who cast Michael in an episode of his sitcom Extras, wrote: 'Unbelievable. RIP George Michael.'

Hit producer Mark Ronson wrote: 'Other than a global pop phenom [sic], George was one of the true British soul greats a lot of us owe him an unpayable debt. Bye George xx'

Spandau Ballet's official account posted: 'We are incredibly sad at the passing of our dear friend George Michael. A brilliant artist great songwriter.'
