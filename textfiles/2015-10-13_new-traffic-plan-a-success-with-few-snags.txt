The new traffic plan along Sri Jayewardenepura Road from parliament and Battaramulla towards Colombo and Maharagama on the High Level Road was successful though some snags along the Sri Jayewardenepura Road near Baseline Road have to be straightened out, Police said.
DIG Traffic Amarasiri Senaratne said the new traffic plan in Maharagama on the High Level Road was a hundred percent success and added that alternative routes would have to be used if the traffic congestion at the Pannipitiya and Kottawa junctions increases due to the new plan.
He said some shortcomings were noticed along the Sri Jayewardenepura Road with severe traffic congestion along Baseline Road where vehicles coming from Sri Jayewardenepura Road crossed Baseline Road.
The DIG said they would have to discuss this matter and sort it out within the next few days.
The new traffic plan was introduced on Monday to be in effect from 7.30 a.m. to 8.45 a.m. to ease the traffic congestion in Colombo.
Under the new traffic plan all vehicles coming from Battaramulla to Colombo were diverted to Sri Jayewardenepura Road opposite the Welikada Police to the Ayurveda Roundabout while vehicles leaving Colombo were diverted to Cotta Road from Borella towards Battarmulla.
Sri Jayewardenepura Road from Devi Balika Vidyalaya to Horton Place Roundabout was made one-way for vehicles entering Colombo.(Ajith Siriwardana)
