Bond report - Without copies debate sure to fizzle out: NFF


	

National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera asked how the parliamentarians could debate on the bond commission report without knowing its contents because none of them were given copies of the report.

He told a media conference that no worthwhile debate could be held without sufficient information about the matter at hand.

“The information we have gathered is from the excerpts divulged by President Maithripala Sirisena during his special statement on the bond report. Some ministers may have gathered information from different sources but we can’t rely on such information on such a crucial matter,” the MP said and added that the government should not hesitate to punish those implicated in the commission report handed over to the President.
