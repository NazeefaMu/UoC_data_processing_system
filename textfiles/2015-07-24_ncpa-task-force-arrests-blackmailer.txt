The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Task Force has arrested a 27-year-old man on charges of distributing obscene pictures of a 16-year-old girl using his mobile phone.
The NCPA said the man had taken nude photos of the girl when they were having an affair and had distributed the photos among friends after marrying another girl. The girl had complained to the NCPA regarding the incident.
NCPA Chairperson Natasha Balendra said the man residing in Colombo was remanded for two weeks and released on bail after being produced in the Colombo Magistrate’s Court.
“However, we are investigating the incident and making arrangements to inquire into other such incidents. We are also looking at existing laws and whether they are enough to curb cybercrimes and bullying so that we can amend them if necessary,” she said.
Ms. Balendra said they would launch an awareness programme to make students aware on how to use the internet safely and to be safe from cyber bulling and crimes.
