The confidence the people in North placed on the government had begun to crumble, TNA Parliamentarians and Provincial Council members said at a media conference today (25).
They urged the government to appoint a District Secretary who is conversant in Tamil for the Vavuniya District.
This follows the appointment of former Commissioner General of Prisons M.B. Rohana Pushpakumara as the new District Secretary of the Vavuniya. He assumed duties on Tuesday (24).
TNA Parliamentarian Sivasakthi Anandan and Provincial Health Minister P. Sathyalingam spoke to the media conference held at a private hotel in Vavuniya.
Councillor Sathyalingam said they convened the media meeting to focus on the need of a District Secretary capable of understanding the problems of the majority Tamil speaking people in the district.
He said the Northern Provincial Council held a protest demonstration against the former DS Bandula Harischandra and expected the government would appoint a suitable person but that need had not been fulfilled.(Romesh Madushanka)
