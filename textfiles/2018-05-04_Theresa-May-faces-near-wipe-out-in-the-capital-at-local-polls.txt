UK, Daily Mail), 3 May 2018  
Voters are heading to the polls in what could be a difficult day for Theresa May as the Conservatives face losing ground to Labour in London in what could be a political wipeout.  


Experts believe the Tories could be left with just two councils in the capital, although pollsters say the party will present much stiffer competition elsewhere across the UK.The election in Southwark’s newly formed London Bridge and West Bermondsey ward has been halted following the death of Conservative candidate Toby Eckersley aged 76.   


London is the major battleground after recent polls pointed towards a substantial swing to Labour.Upsets are also possible around the country, with Labour also hopeful of taking power in town halls from Kirklees and Calderdale in Yorkshire and Trafford in Greater Manchester to Plymouth and Swindon in the south.
