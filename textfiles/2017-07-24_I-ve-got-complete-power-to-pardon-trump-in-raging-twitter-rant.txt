‘I’ve got complete power to pardon’: trump in raging twitter rant


	

The president defended his son Donald Trump Jr. and highlighted his ‘complete power to pardon’ while lashing out at the investigation into his presidential campaign’s possible ties to Russia in a Twitter rant on Saturday morning.  


Trump, who has continually used his presidential campaign rival Hillary Clinton as a foil, tried to throw the heat off his son, questioning why his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller were not investigating Clinton instead.   


‘So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Counsel looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 emails deleted?,’ he wrote on Twitter.   ‘What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.   ‘My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & the authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!’  


The FBI decided last year not to recommend criminal charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server. Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey in May.As the investigation closes in on Trump’s closest associates, the president has inquired about his authority to issue pardons to aides, family members, and perhaps himself, according to the Washington Post
