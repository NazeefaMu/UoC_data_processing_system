Tourism - a question of hospitality

We sat in the newly opened Restaurant, styling itself on the trendy Indian fast food concept, quick, clean and easy on the purse. And, my companion wanted a typical vegetarian meal-"the kind of meal they used to serve at Greenlands", a hot destination in the austere 1970s.
Born a Sri Lankan, Peter has chosen Australia, where he has now resided for over thirty five years, as his country of domicile. He was sixteen when he arrived there. The adopted country has been good to him. He holds a government job in the transport sector, and a public service career anywhere in the world is not dedicated to building fortunes. Yet, he is comfortable and secure; earning enough to indulge his passion for travel; Europe, South America, Africa, Exotic Asian destinations, the South Seas, Peter has seen the world. Like to most immigrants to the West, the adopted country has given him an attractive air of assurance, a 'let us fix it' spirit, discernible in those living in dynamic societies, open and accepting. "Why is this road flooded or that drain blocked? Why is that driver sounding his horn incessantly or this government department not replying my written inquiry?" These are not hopeless questions or situations to which he is only a passive observer. Something can be done and ought to be done.
Clean and secure environment
Although there is no one of his immediate family living in Sri Lanka now, Peter still feels the "pull" of his land of birth. Having no close relatives to visit or sites to see, he returns regularly only to spend his holidays travelling around the country with no particular plan or purpose. In the course of his travels Peter has gained unique insights into the realities of our tourism industry which maybe of benefit to those concerned with it.
Clearly, tourism in Sri Lanka is not a success story. Nature has been generous when bestowing her blessings on this small island. The things that the average visitor to the tropics seeks, the exotic culture, the beaches, the lush greenery, historical sites, are in abundance, and within short distances. In comparison, our roads, railway/taxi service, banking and medical facilities may not be up to the standards of advanced countries, although adequate for basic purposes.
Admittedly the quality of our infrastructure and services is both erratic and patchy at best and wont to break down under pressure. But that weakness or irregularity may be the reason a person travels, to experience something different to the accustomed efficiency and the predictability of his culture. This backwardness, the inefficiency of the systems, as long as it remains manageable, could add to the quaintness of the place, an interesting experience perhaps. But nevertheless there is a huge gap between potential and reality. Like the oil under the desert sands, tourism potential cannot be a success story without human ingenuity and application.
"As I see it, tourism is fundamentally a matter of service and hospitality. Without understanding the idea of service or living the concept of hospitality there cannot be a successful tourist industry. In many of the large shops I go into there is a kind of shop detective following you about.
I never buy from a shop which treats you like a potential thief. Shop lifting is a concern all over the world, although the percentage of those who commit the offence is very small in reality.
In other countries they have more sophisticated surveillance. The crudity of a man following a customer around is unbelievable. How will you react if a friend you visit treats you in that manner, having his servant to follow you about?"
Peter, I gathered avoided the more expensive five star type accommodation, preferring the smaller hotels. In Australia such hotels come with good amenities, the guest is assured of a comfortable stay in a clean and secure environment. But Peter's experiences in the smaller hotels here have been less than satisfactory.
"They were not exactly cheap; some of them were only a couple of thousand rupees less than the so called five star hotels. In many of these small tourist hotels you find out that the Air Conditioner does not function, taps leak, the bathroom is mouldy, the paint peeling and the overall standard of hygiene pretty low. Many a time, I noticed human hair on the bed sheets, maybe from a previous guest."
Peter was not the type of person to turn a blind eye to such neglect by a service provider.
"Did you not complain?" I inquired.
Huge cultural problem
"I did, however soon realized there was a huge cultural problem we confront. You know that maintenance and upkeep is not a strong quality here. It is always somebody else's job. The managers are told to listen to the complaints of the guests with a smile. They do that, but nothing happens. It has to be reported to somebody else who has to report it to yet another. The owner of the hotel maybe living in Colombo yet he has to be first told about the hair on the bed sheet!"
He paused "These hotels reflect something deeply symbolic of the way things operate in the country. In the front of the hotel they may have a neat looking security hut with a uniformed gateman guarding the entrance. The kitchen, which will be in a dingy corner, will be unsanitary. This inconsistency is something no body wants to grapple with or even think about." To page 20
