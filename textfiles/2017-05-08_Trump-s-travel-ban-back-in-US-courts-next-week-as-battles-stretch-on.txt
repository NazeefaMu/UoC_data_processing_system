HINDUSTAN TIMES, 07th MAY, 2017- Legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban on people from some Muslim-majority countries heat up again next week when two US appeals courts consider whether it is constitutional.


The legal fights may end up at the U.S. Supreme Court perhaps in the fall, many months after Trump first issued an executive order in January saying there was an urgent need to halt some immigration to the United States for 90 days while officials reviewed the visa process.
