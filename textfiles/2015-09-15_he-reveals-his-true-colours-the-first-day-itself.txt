He reveals his true colours the first day itself!


	


It is a well-known secret that this particular Blue party stalwart who once briefly occupied the main chair in the opposition expected a key portfolio of his choice, but finally he had to settle for one with a single subject connected to roads.
However, this Blue stalwart had called at his new office the same day he was sworn in. And the activists of the trade unions affiliated to the two main political parties had decorated the Ministry premises in both Blue and Green in anticipation of the visit of the new Ministerial one.  
On arrival at his new office, the Ministerial one observed that Green was more conspicuous than Blue and that got his goat. He ordered that all Green pennants and streamers be removed immediately leaving only the Blue decorations. 
Thereafter, he ordered the Green party trade unionists to leave the premises and asked the Blue party counterparts to present their pressing problems to him. He made critical remarks about his predecessor and also pulled up the secretarial one present on the occasion before leaving the office, they say. 
Meanwhile, the Green trade unionists who were chased away had made a beeline to the Green party headquarters where they had planned to stage a protest against the shabby treatment meted out to them.
However, the former Ministerial one who rushed to the scene had with great difficulty dissuaded the TU activists from taking any rash action that could cause embarrassment to the yahapalanya administration.
