Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who responded to recent statements made by Northern Province Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran, yesterday suggested that Parliament should get on with the task of preparing a new Constitution no matter what the Chief Minister or anyone says about it.

“It is the constitutional assembly and the steering committee which decides on the constitution and not the chief minister. There may be some who would oppose the proposals of the steering committee report and some who would welcome it. Therefore let’s get on with our duty,” Mr Wickremesinghe said in response to a question raised by Joint opposition group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene last morning.
“I arrived in the country last morning. I have been asked about a statement made by Chief Minister Wigneswaran. I have also seen some news items when I was in India that he had denied the statement issued by the media,” he added.

He said the new constitution was prepared by the House. “Let’s do it the way we want, some people may make statements. Even others have made statements in addition to the Chief Minister. It is better if everyone refrains from making statements,’ he further said. (Yohan Perera)
