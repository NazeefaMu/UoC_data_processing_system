Sri Lanka's underworld is nowhere else but in universities, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.

He told a news briefing that the masterminds of the underworld were inside the universities controlling the entire university system.

“It is because of a few students that the entire university system is in jeopardy. A few students take the initiative in organizing the protests which ultimately have no results. Much of the protest marches are not carried out with the intention of meting out justice but to fulfil the political agendas of bankrupt politicians,” he added.

“The Government spends about Rs.500,000 on a university student,” the minister said.

He said the prevailing crisis in the university was not the result of a failure in administration but in the ideology of a few university students who are motivated by politically-minded students.

Meanwhile, the minister said ragging had become a huge issue in the universities where a lot of students had been inconvenienced and even led to students having to forgo their university education.

“We hope to carry out stringent action on ragging under the Ragging Act,” he said.

He said a 24-hour phone line was available - 011 2123700 to lodge complaints by anybody who fell victim to ragging. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
