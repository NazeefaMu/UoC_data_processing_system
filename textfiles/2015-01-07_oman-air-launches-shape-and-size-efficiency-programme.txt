Oman Air launches Shape and Size efficiency programme


	


Oman Air has launched an efficiency programme, entitled Shape and Size, with the aim of achieving substantial reductions in the airline’s expenditure.The move is timed to coincide with the start of 2015 and the onset of new budgets for the year.
The Shape and Size efficiency programme is targeting cost reductions across all activities undertaken by the national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman. None of those reductions will affect the airline’s safety or the high standards of service offered to valued customers.
A total reduction in expenditure of more than 100 million OMR should be achieved by Oman Air over the next three years, bringing the company to an operational break-even point by the end of 2017.
The Chief Executive Officer of Oman Air, Paul Gregorowitsch said: “We are determined and committed to reshape Oman Air to become a more modern business driven enterprise- one that does not solely rely on financial injections from the Government of Oman.
“Oman Air contributed almost 420 million OMR to the Gross National Product of the Sultanate during 2014. We are also aware that we have to contribute to the infrastructure of the country by serving domestic airports like Sohar. Furthermore, and in line with the nation’s Omanisation policy, we are committed to developing for the future the educational and career potential of young Omanis. These important duties do not, however, constitute an excuse to run the airline as though it is a hobby.
“We all have to work hard and to make sacrifices to become an even better, service oriented, but self-supporting airline. We are in business to be customer and profit-driven.On January 15th, more than 400 Oman Air employees are to attend “To become the best”, a global event held in Muscat. Here they will be briefed on how to contribute more effectively to the development of an efficient, profitable and respected airline.
