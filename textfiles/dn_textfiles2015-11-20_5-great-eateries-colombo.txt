[5 Great Eateries in Colombo]

The Happy Belly Round-Up
Text and Pictures Shifani Reffai
Colombo is becoming a very exciting place, gastronomically speaking. Every month or so there seems to be a fun new coffee shop or restaurant to pig out at. There are too many to count but heres a handful of our favourite places that made our bellies happy. Email us on [email protected] to share your own Sri Lankan foodie experiences.
The Cakery
You can find this neat joint at 2A, Sulaiman Terrace, Jawatte Road, Colombo 5. One is always looking for places to have good dessert. The Cakery makes some delicious cakes, be it chocolate, meringue or cheesecake – but you’ll likely spend about Rs. 300 or more per hefty slice. More than their ready-made cakes, their fresh ones ordered a day or two before are absolutely flawless – they do a mean chocolate ganache cake. Considering the quality of the ingredients used, and the care put into making these sugary treats so perfect, you could argue that it’s worth the price tag. They also do some of the best cupcakes in town if you call them a few days in advance and order. Also, fun fact, just a few doors down from The Cakery is Skrumptious, a little eatery that does killer brownies and chocolate biscuit pudding. (For more information - 0112501344)
Tasty Caterers
Located at 88 Fife Road, Colombo 5, this is the underdog on our list. There’s nothing fancy about Tasty, but ever since we can remember they’ve doled out quality food at very affordable, for-the-average-wallet prices – be it rice and curry, short-eats or goodies for your sweet-tooth. Colombo is in no shortage of bakeries, but Tasty Caterers is the most reliable option out there in our opinion for fresh, warm pastries and short-eats in a range of meats and vegetables. The rice and curry is also top-notch and makes for a reliable, tummy-filling purchase for lunch. The eclairs here are arguably the best you’ll find anywhere, priced at only Rs. 40, featuring thin, delectable choux filled with oozings of fresh chocolate cream (FYI, you can get the same ones at Café On The 5th). But heads up – chances are all the shelves will be literally wiped clean by early afternoon, so if you’re heading there for food, run over early morning. (For more information – 0112580844)
Giovanni
On the road between Thimbirigasyaya and Baseline you get Giovanni’s at 145, Thimbirigasyaya Road, Colombo 5. There is good pizza, and then there is amazing pizza. Giovanni is a place where you’ll pay the bill and then go ‘hey, money CAN buy happiness’. This small restaurant is run by Dimuthu, a very vibrant, enthusiastic young entrepreneur, whose special recipes have driven foodies in Colombo wild. The pizzas are priced at Rs. 1000 – 1400, and are easily enough for two – you can see them getting cooked in a yellow clay oven downstairs, before they are sprinkled with fat, succulent layers of meats, cheeses and veggies. You are going to be utterly stuffed after just three slices. In terms of toppings, this place is the most generous in the city, and one visit is likely to make you a repeat offender.

Nihonbashi at ODEL
Located on the Ground Floor, ODEL, 5 Alexandra Place, Colombo 7 you get the ever so famous Nihonbashi. Japanese food has made a totally unprecedented mark on local palettes – Colombo loves it. Considering the meticulous preparations however – chefs can take years to master just slicing fish for sushi – it’s not the most affordable range of food to nom on. Still, Dharshan Munidasa’s little Nihonbashi outlet at ODEL, is not too harsh on the wallet, and if you are a fan of Japanese food, they do a flawless job at it. The fish comes delicately sliced and absolutely fresh, light and cooling – the salmon sashimi, especially, makes a happy meal. The sushi features rice with just the right amount of stickiness and a good meat-rice ratio. The okonomiyaki, grilled with strong savoury-sweet flavours, is a grander, more filling choice on the menu. If you love the cuisine and want quality with affordability, Nihonbashi at ODEL should be at the top of your list. (For more information - 0114718758)
Dolce Italia
Located at 147, Vajira Road, Colombo 4), Dolce Italia is a relatively new and unexpected addition to the local food scene. It’s a small teal and yellow themed eatery on a restaurant-ridden corner of Havelock Road, run by an Italian chef. No Italian style pizzas here – but everything else here is gold, from the gnocchi to the lasagna to the wide range of creamy, mouth-watering Italian pastries. The best thing about it is that it’s not as expensive as you’d think, for a high quality, authentic foreign restaurant – less than Rs. 1000 for a massive main. (For more information - 0112559900)
