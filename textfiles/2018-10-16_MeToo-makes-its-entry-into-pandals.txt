New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), 15 Oct 2018 - As the city gears up for the festival of Durga puja as well as Ram Leela, devotees thronging the pandals and the grounds set to burn Ravana effigies across the capital will be greeted by themes of women empowerment — inspired by the ongoing #MeToo movement that has taken the country by a storm.  


At the Lanka Dahan in Red Fort, a fourth effigy — symbolic of the men accused of sexually harassing women in the online campaign — will also go up in flames.  


Rahul Sharma, press secretary of the Nav Shri Dharmik Leela Committee, said, “Every year, we burn the effigy of one social evil. This time, we are focussing on symbolically destroying the evil that has been exposed by the #MeToo movement.”
