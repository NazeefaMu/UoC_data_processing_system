Champika’s stance on 20A is no concern of ours: JVP


	

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramnua (JVP) MP Sunil Hadunnetti said yesterday they were not concerned about Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka’s stance on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution because his stance from the beginning had been to retain the executive presidency.

He told Daily Mirror that they respected Mr. Ranawaka for revealing his stance clearly on the executive presidency and added that it was pointless talking to him on the matter.

“He is someone who supports the executive presidency. He is the only one who opposed the 17th Amendment to the Constitution,” Mr. Handunnetti said and added that those who did not respect democratic values were supporters of dictatorship.

“Mr. Ranawaka is dreaming of becoming a dictator. There are people who wish for dictators like Hitler,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
