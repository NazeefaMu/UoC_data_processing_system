EC must inquire into John Amaratunga's statement: JO


	

Joint opposition Parliamentarian Janaka Bandara Tennakoon said today the Elections Commissioner (EC) should immediately inquire into the statement made by Minister John Amaratunga.

"He had requested the people to vote at the forthcoming election without any fear because the government and the Police would be on their side and mentioned about the import of coconuts, rice and vegetables from foreign countries. This statement was a threat made against the people," the MP said.

He said these statements were made by politicians to de-stabilise the mindset of the people and referred to the minister's statement stressing the need to import vegetables, as an insult to the Dambulla economic centre saying it was the responsibility of the people to give suitable answers to these politicians at the LG elections.
