A group of Sri Lankans who are living in France had escaped unhurt from last Friday’s terrorists attack in Paris that killed about 130 people, in multiple attacks, BBC reported.
Speaking to BBC Sandeshaya, Janitha Dilakshana Rathnayake had said that they were 600 metres from the terrorists when the shooting started. “One of our friends only received minor injuries due to being hit with some object, thats all.”
Recalling the incident Janitha said, “They (terrorists) were dressed in black, but they had not covered their faces. They started by shooting everyone who was outside.”
“At first we thought they were fire crackers,” he said.
Janitha and his friends were in Paris to watch the football match between France and Germany.Courtesy - BBC Sinhala
