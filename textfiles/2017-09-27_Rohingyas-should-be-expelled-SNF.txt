An organization named Sinhalese National Force (SNF) today claimed that the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was intervening into matters related to the state’s sovereignty by allowing the accommodation of Rohingya refugees in Sri Lanka.

Holding a demonstration in Colombo against the accommodation of Rohingya refugees, the SNF urged the United Nations (UN) to take immediate actions to expel the Rohingya refugees of Myanmar from the country.

“There is a threat from these Rohingya Muslim refugees to our country’s sovereignty. That shows that the UNHRC is more powerful than the law in our country.

Meanwhile, SNF General Secretary Arambepola Rathana Thera handed over a ‘Sandeshaya’ to a UN official saying the detained Rohingya refugees should be expelled from the country.

“The Government and the Defense Ministry were in two sides and as a result the Rohingya refugees are staying in the country. The issue of Rohingya Muslims is a related to Myanmar and they were expelled from Myanmar because of an internal problem there”.

“Myanmar Muslim militants had reportedly attacked eighteen Police stations, an Army camp in their country. They have allegedly killed civilians and Buddhist monks in Myanmar. They had run away because of fear to facing the political and civil issues in Myanmar. They are actually a kind of terrorists,” the Thera said.

“According to the law of the country, we are not bound to provide shelter for refugees. For letting them to stay, the country risks deadly terrorists sneaking in”.

“Six children of those refugees are attending schools in our country but they have been in our country for two months. They have come to Sri Lanka violating the immigration and emigration laws. Even they did not have a citizenship in Myanmar.

“If those Rohingya Muslims used to spread terrorism in the country or if someone in our country gets killed by them, how do we take legal actions against them?

“They do not have a valid identity. It was reported that one baby was born at the Castle Street Hospital for Women in Colombo. There is an issue of providing a birth certificate to that new born child.

“Our country is not a slave island for refugees. We pay taxes to the Government. The Government is bound to provide us protection. “Instead of justifying the protection of the country, the Government and the Police is proving shelter for terrorists, while putting the national security in danger,” Rathana Thera said.

“The Government lied to people and mislead them on Rohingya Muslims refugee issue. The responsibility of those Muslim refugees had been taken by the UNHRC.

“The UNHRC is interfering in the country’s sovereignty. There is a threat from these Rohingya Muslims refugee to our country’s sovereignty. That shows that the UNHRC is more power full than the law in our country.

“Therefore we have gathered in front of the UN office in Colombo and informed them the real situation that our country is facing,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
