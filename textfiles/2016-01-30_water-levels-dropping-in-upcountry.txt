Water levels dropping in upcountry


	

The water levels in rivers, canals, tanks and reservoirs in the upcountry are fast declining because of the prevailing dry weather. The main waterfalls including St.Claires, Kadiyanlena, and Lovers Leap are also running dry.
However, the environmentalists said haphazard deforestation, setting fire to forests and the unauthorised construction in catchment areas were also some of the reasons for the drop in water levels and water falls running dry. They said the prevailing dry weather could also affect hydropower generation.
Meanwhile, the villagers in several areas who depended on streams and water ways said that they were also facing a shortage of drinking water. (Shantha Chandrasiri and Shelton Hettiarachchi)
