The Sri Lankan corporate sector has commenced the countdown to the arrival of best-selling author John Mattone, the coach of legendary Apple Founder Steve Jobs, with the keenly anticipated event, organized by Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing just two weeks away.

Known as the world’s leading authority on Intelligent Leadership, Mattone is scheduled to feature in two forums, namely ‘The Knowledge Forum’, on 12th June at Shangri-la Hotel focusing on “Intelligent leadership: Elevating the status-quo” for anyone who wants to be a true leader irrespective of  profession, and the ‘CEO’s Forum’, on 13th June 2018 at the Cinnamon Grand focusing on “Transforming Culture… A strategic imperative for future” for corporate spearheads, who are in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Finance officer, Chief Operating Officer, Entrepreneurs and the top level management. 

This rare opportunity has been afforded to the local corporate sector by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) and the two forums have already seen high demand from the Executive, Middle and the upper level management and entrepreneurs.  SLIM was inspired to approach ‘The World’s Top Executive Coach’ John Mattone by the unprecedented success of Ron Kaufman Live in Sri Lanka, which saw the participation of over 1,000 corporate professionals in 2017.

Mattone is one of the most highly sought after C-level (Senior Management Level) coaches in the world, having been consulted by more than 250 organizations and coached more than 200 Executives. He has a global reputation for possessing a unique ability to unlock and unleash greatness in leaders at all levels. Recently, John’s executive coaching blog was named the #1 executive coaching blog in the world by Feedspot and his leadership blog is also recognized as one of the best in the world.

He is the former executive coach to Steve Jobs, who made Apple Inc. a force to be reckoned with in the 1980s before his departure from the company. Several years later, he rejoined the company to engineer its resurgence, introducing the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and setting it up to become one of the biggest companies the world has ever seen by the time of his demise. In addition to his being a savvy businessman, he was a visionary who humanized personal computing and rewrote the rules of user experience design, hardware design and software design. 

Mattone’s services were also sought by other global business leaders, such as the revolutionary former CEO of PepsiCo, Roger Enrico, who sought John’s advice after his PepsiCo days in helping him transition to a coach and mentor for young leaders. Enrico was the driver behind the famous ‘Cola Wars’ of the 1980s and 1990s. 

Mr. Ranga Perera, Project Chairperson of the John Mattone Project, spoke about the value of this opportunity for marketers and the business community in general.

“We all are leaders. After all Leadership is not just a one person’s responsibility. The most powerful thing we can do in this lifetime is to grow our personal leadership skills. Thus ’John Mattone Live in Sri Lanka’, will be a groundbreaking event and a life-changing experience for the entire business fraternity in Sri Lanka. It will provide a splendid opportunity to the marketing and business fraternity to accelerate the development of Intelligent Leadership and penetrate world business while developing themselves to be true leader in their profession.”

Mr. Sanath Senanayake, CEO/Executive Director of SLIM, commented on how this event fits into the national vision of SLIM.

“As the national body for marketing, SLIM has an integral responsibility to add value to the nation’s ambitious development agenda. These forums will help to fill the gaps and drawbacks in the leadership culture in Sri Lanka. SLIM continuously strives to impart global knowledge and experience to the local business fraternity and featuring exceptional global personalities in Sri Lanka which is one of the main strategies in realizing this vision.”

The coaching strategy of Mattone focuses on igniting and strengthening the inner-self and talents of leaders, which enable them to realize four game-changing outcomes that they can leverage in their business and life: Altruism, Affiliation, Achievement, and Abundance (The 4 As). He is a respected advisor and coach to CEO’s who lead entrepreneurial organizations.
