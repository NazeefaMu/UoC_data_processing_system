MYTH: When there is extreme hair loss you could have cancer.  


BUSTED: “Usually hair loss is associated with cancer drugs. In some instances, hair loss could mean cancer, however it is not that common. With most drugs that we give for cancer, hair loss can happen. There are so many other reasons for hair loss as well. Even in a healthy person, up to a 100 hairs can be shed per day because of the hair cycle. Other causes could be iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency and hormonal disorders like low thyroxine and genetics. If you’re suffering from extreme hair loss, it is not a definite symptom of cancer,”
