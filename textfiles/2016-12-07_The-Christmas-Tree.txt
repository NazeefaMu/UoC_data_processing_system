The ongoing construction of the world’s tallest artificial Christmas Tree at the Galle Face Green had been halted today. The Cardinal said yesterday the construction of a Christmas Tree on Galle Face was a sheer waste of money, and those responsible for this work should be asked to use the funds to construct houses for poor people or provide scholarships to poor children.
