A change in attitude after mini-polls


	



 

A leading purohita from the South has of late become rude and discourteous to his constituents.

 


The queer behavior he has developed since the recent mini-polls has become a matter for both puzzlement and amusement of the people in the electorate, they say. 

When the constituents call at his residence on home turf, the purohita would berate them saying, “How much of work have I done for you people? But you defeated me! Get all your matters attended to by the people you voted for. Don’t come to see me hereafter!”

However, the purohita would call back the people he turns away after a tongue-lashing and would listen to their problems after telling them, “Remember before you cast your vote again that our government will continue in power for another two years!”
