Govt. suffering from vehicle mania: Gammanpila


	

The supplementary estimate presented in Parliament on Saturday seeking Rs. 790 million as expenditures for vehicles and foreign tours showed the Government was suffering from a ‘vehicle mania’ (Ratha Gaya) and a ‘foreign tour mania’ (Rata Gaya), the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.

PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said it was acceptable to present a Supplementary Estimate to cover up essential expenditures such as salaries, fuel and extra allowances but it was absurd to present one to purchase vehicles, furniture and to pay for foreign tours of the Government MPs.

“Ministers should clarify as to why they can’t utilize the furniture and vehicles they have till the end of the year. If the allocations for foreign tours have been drained, embassies could be used to execute a specific task,” he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
