With choices aplenty in Colombo, where does one go for the "perfect brunch", where options are varied and taste buds can have whatever it yearns for, be it exotic flavours of the Far East, sizzling aroma of local seafood curries, meaty carvery, home-made authentic Sri Lankan meal or extravagant international buffet?
Sri Lankan lunch at Nuga Gama
The answer is simple: Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
Acclaimed as Sri Lanka's premier five-star city hotel with 14 restaurants under its roof, Cinnamon Grand Colombo goes all out on the last day of the week; presenting their loyal guests with well-deserved late breakfast and lunch combos, that has, over the years, gained popularity for the extensive offerings catering to all palates.
Keeping to the theme of being a 'cheerful, sociable and inciting meal that is talk-compelling and puts you in a good temper; makes you satisfied with yourself and your fellow beings; and sweeps away the worries and the cobwebs of the week' - words of British writer Guy Beringer who is said to have been among the firsts to write about 'Sunday brunch' - Cinnamon Grand offers five options to choose from.
