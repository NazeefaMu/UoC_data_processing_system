An opposition Diyawanna member known for his nationalist fervour was walking out of an opposition side portal of the House when he met to his surprise a government member hailing from a prominent political family in the central hills entering the House through the same portal. 
The inquisitive opposition member inquired from the government member, a new comer to Diyawanna whether he was using the wrong entrance by mistake.
The government member replied: “It’s no mistake. When that member (he mentions a name) was raised to purohita status, they had to find an extra seat on the government side. And they asked me to sit on the opposition side unofficially for a while to facilitate the new seating arrangement…”  
“This is a hell of a change, a kind I have never heard of during my political career!” exclaimed the opposition member.
“What to do. I have to wait and see.” replied the government member who was forced to ‘switch sides’ temporarily .
