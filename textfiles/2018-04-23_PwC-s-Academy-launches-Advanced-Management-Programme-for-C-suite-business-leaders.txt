PwC’s Academy launches Advanced Management Programme for  C-suite business leaders


	


Having set its feet firmly in the Executive education industry in Sri Lanka, PwC’s Academy has set its sights on launching a revolutionary Advanced Management programme for trend setting C-suite Business Leaders.

 

As a senior business leader, you are at the top of your game. You have ticked almost all the boxes in your checklist to be at the top, learnt enough frameworks and models throughout your career and applied them in your business. Hence, you may wonder what more there is to learn.It is, however, a messy complex world out there with a whole new level of disruption, technologies and dynamic trends and in this new world of business, your next hurdle would be to develop a better sense of judgement and be more cognisant of your strengths and weaknesses as a leader.

 

You need new lenses and perspectives to make sharper decisions, adapt better and most importantly be mindful as a leader.At the Advanced Management Programme, that is what we aim to achieve as we focus more on enhancing your judgement and less on models and frameworks. 

 



 

Some of our latest research findings signify that CEOs and Business leaders tend to demonstrate specific behaviors that prove to be critical to their performance.

 

1. Decisiveness

 

High-performing CEOs stand out for being more decisive. They make decisions much quicker and portray a greater level of conviction regardless of ambiguity, incomplete information and uncharted territory domains. 

 

2. Adaptiveness

 

Willingness to learn and the ability to adapt and operate in changing multi-cultural environments are critical to CEOs. They should not only have a high level of intellectual awareness; staying current on market trends but also have a personal sense of flexibility and adaptiveness.

 

3. Mindfulness

 

In a fast paced world, mindfulness enables you to clear your mind of clutter, focus on what is important and be emotionally intelligent. 

 

Why is AMP so unique? 

 

Advanced Management Programme is not an ordinary executive education workshop. 

This elite programme is designed by an award winning educator along with a cohort of world class faculty from leading business schools across the world.

 

“Every once in a while, senior leaders need to get off the treadmill of work, decision-making and pressure, in order to step back and examine their leadership. 

 

Without that, leaders are prone to developing what psychologists call “cognitive depletion”, a state in which we are no longer learning. The antidote to this is to enter a state of renewal, in which we are able to re-store ourselves, re-examine our mindsets, and re-define our goals and strategies in collaboration with others. This is what exactly what we try to achieve during AMP programme”.
