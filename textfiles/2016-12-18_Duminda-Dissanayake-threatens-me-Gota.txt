Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa claimed that Minister Duminda Dissanayake had earlier threatened him to hand over the Chairmanship of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to incumbent President Maitripala Sirisena.

 “I don’t say President Maithripala had threatened me. But Minister Duminda Dissanayake told me to hand over the party Chairmanship soon after the election. If not so, Dissanayake told me, that he knew how to take it by taking it to court. ‘The government is ours,’ he said. This is how they establish the democracy,” he said.

“Their objective was to split the main Opposition and recruit part of the members to the government,” former defence secretary said while addressing the Sri Lankans in Japan.

Speaking further the former Defence Secretary said that the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime had eliminated underworld activities, which were a threat to the people.

“The present government vowed to established law and order in the country. But today it is the exact opposite that is happening,” he said.
