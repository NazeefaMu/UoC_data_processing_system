Coca-Cola celebrates 132 years around the world and revels in its status as one of the world’s best loved brands. The history of Coca-Cola has become something of a legend as have the various anecdotes about the brand and its associated symbols. Coca-Cola captured people’s imagination in Sri Lanka first in April 1961, when it was launched in the country. Since then, it has become one of the most loved beverages in the island-nation.

 

Following the introduction of Trademark Coca-Cola, other global brands were added to the company portfolio including Coca-Cola Light, Coke Zero, Sprite, Sprite Zero, Fanta, Portello, Cream Soda, Lion Soda, Lion Ginger Beer and Kinley water which provide consumers across the island with a variety of delicious and hydrating beverage options. A must-have at every celebration, Sri Lankans can’t get enough of the brand’s wide portfolio of refreshing beverages and the buzz surrounding it. 

 

In Sri Lanka, responding to consumer demand the company launched Sugar-Free options for all its sparkling and fruit flavored beverages. While Coke Zero and Sprite Zero were launched in 2017 Fanta, Portello, Cream Soda and Lion Ginger Beer, were introduced early this year providing consumers with more choice to enjoy the drinks’ natural flavors and a great, fruity taste without the calories. Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. is the first company in Sri Lanka to offer sugar free variants of all their great tasting beverages.

The concept of sustainable development is at the heart of Coca-Cola in Sri Lanka. Coca-Cola implements initiatives to promote societal wellbeing through Sustainable Communities of which three major objectives are; Water Stewardship, Economic Empowerment of Women, and Waste Management.  Earlier this year, in January Coca-Cola announced an initiative called “World Without Waste”. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Company’s global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centerpiece of the company’s new packaging vision in Sri Lanka as well. Through this the Coca-Cola system in Sri Lanka intends not only to make packaging 100% recyclable but also collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging in the country and work towards a cleaner and better environment. Our immediate priority and focus through our waste management program entitled ‘Give Back Life’ is the recovery and recycling of plastic PET bottles. Through this program, collection initiatives have been executed along with the government authorities and a roadmap is in place to ensure all the PET bottles Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. produces is collected and recycled.
