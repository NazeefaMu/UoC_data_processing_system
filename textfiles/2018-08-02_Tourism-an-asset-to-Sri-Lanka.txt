Tourism,  an asset to Sri Lanka


	




Much hype is created these days with respect to arrival of visitors from overseas to Sri Lanka, a paradise as mentioned by many departing visitors. Have we geared ourselves to meet the growing need of travel for visitors as well as locals who wish to explore the natural beauty of paradise. Modes of transport available for visitors are bicycles, motor cycles, three wheelers, cars, buses, trains, and by air. 

Travel within the country is slow in Colombo, outside Colombo leave alone the places of interest. The travel speed within the country is less than 30 km/hr. Kandy approx 4 hrs, Auradhapura 5 – 6 hrs, East 7 – 8 hrs so on, the exception being Galle / Matara due to the availability of a freeway. Travel by expressway entrance at Kottawa, Panadura, Kaduwela, Kadawatha from Colombo can take 30 – 40 minutes.  

There are many under-utilized air fields within the country controlled by the Air Force. Only a few are used for commercial purposes such as Ratmalana, Jaffna, Trincomalee, just to name three. The rest are well maintained by the Air Force but under utilized in domestic passenger air travel.  

If the Government and the Ministry of Tourism is interested in developing facilities for visitors who waste much of their time in the country on the road at great risk to life and limb. Economical domestic air transport must be encouraged and is a must in the future.  

There are air fields in the following areas which were developed by the British to facilitate their cover and rule within their empire such as Minneriya, Sigiriya, Iranamadu, Vayuniya, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Batticoloa, Ampara, Hambantota, Weerawila, Koggala, Katukurunda a total of eleven Under Utilized Domestic Air Ports within the Country. Air Force itself can start a Domestic Air Service which can give Cadet Pilot Training opportunity for Flight Cadets of the Air Force. By this method the Air Force can get additional revenue to maintain the airfields  

During the 2nd World War, Koggala Lake was used for flying boats such as Suderlands for transport of goods and Katalinas used in surveillance and Thunderbirds operated from Minneriya. Flight training was done from China Bay, Trincomalee, Ratmalana and Katunayake.  

 


Travel within the country is slow in Colombo, outside Colombo leave alone the places of interest. The travel speed within the country is less than 30 km/hr. Kandy approx 4 hrs, Auradhapura 5 – 6 hrs, East 7 – 8 hrs so on, the exception being Galle / Matara due to the availability of a freeway. Travel by expressway entrance at Kottawa, Panadura, Kaduwela, Kadawatha from Colombo can take 30 – 40 minutes  


 

There are many Inland Lakes, amphibious aircrafts can be used. Kandy, Nuwara Eliya can be serviced by amphibious aircraft. No need to build expensive airports as ventured out a few years back. Maldives runs the most profitable, efficient and largest amphibious aircraft fleet, of course outsourced to carriers.  

In order to be competitive a Domestic Open Air Policy must be implemented. There are many Private Sector Air Transport Companies in operation. They must be encouraged to have daily shuttle service at competitive fares. The current air transport charges for domestic flights is exorbitant thus discouraging domestic air travel. If domestic air transport is available end to end travel time can be reduced from the current 4 – 8 hours to under one hour. An Air Ambulance Service too can be started if necessary from all parts of the country. Private sector and Air Force operate Helicopter Service but the rates per hour are exorbitant and not attractive for domestic tourist transport.  

If the government considers investment in the Airports and Domestic Air Travel is expensive they can follow the model of England. UK’s two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, Edinburgh, Bristol, Aberdeen and Belfast are majority owned by foreign investors following airports of India are managed on a PPP model. Indira Gandhi International Airport – Delhi, Chattrapati Shivaji International Airport – Mumbai, Rajiv Gandhi International Airport – Hyderabad, Kempegowda International Airport – Bengaluru, Cochin International Airport – Kochin. Around 1,000 Airports of USA are privately owned and managed.  

Tourism can be one of the greatest assets of the country if infrastructure and rest room facilities at tourist attractions are improved.
