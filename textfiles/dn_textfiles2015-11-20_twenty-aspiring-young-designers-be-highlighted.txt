Founder and Organizer Zainab Ammarah commenting about this year’s entries said, “The stage is now set for Sri Lanka to witness creative talent expressing their exclusivity in one runway. It was indeed a tough task to select a talented 36 out of the 50 quarter finalists. It was even tougher for the judges to select the 20 talented individuals from the 36 semi finalists. It was a selection process of five hours through one on one interviews and design screening the panel of judges made their ultimate decision in selecting the best talent that would excel this year”.
