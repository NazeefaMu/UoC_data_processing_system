Ottawa police in Canada are investigating a report of vandalism at a temple after a Buddha statue was destroyed overnight, CBC News reported.

It said police were called to the Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Temple at 1481 Heron Rd. Friday morning after two monks who live there reported the damage.

The head of the statue, which sits outside the building, appears to have been smashed apart.
Manoj Da Silva, the temple's treasurer, said the statue was installed about four months ago and cost approximately $8,000 to purchase and ship from Sri Lanka.

He said an iron bar believed to have been used to damage the statue was found nearby.

Da Silva said he doesn't know if the attack was random or targeted, and that it has raised concerns about personal safety.

“I was very sad and we were shocked,” he said adding nothing like this has happened at the temple in its 20 years of operation.

“We have some activities going on during the day and there are some meditation programs going on. The temple was open at the time the vandalism happened. Therefore, anyone can step in at any moment. We are concerned about the safety of the resident monks,”

He said it could cost thousands of dollars to replace the statue.

Meanwhile, Ottawa police has said that the investigation is ongoing.
