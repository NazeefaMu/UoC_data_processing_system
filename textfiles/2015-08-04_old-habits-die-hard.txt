A few Yahapalanaya bigwigs and a number of stalwarts of the previous regime are brazenly misusing their official vehicles for electioneering, they say.
Election monitors have complained to the Elections Commissioner that certain bigwigs of both main parties, disdaining the example set by their party leaders and continue to misuse their official vehicles.
Some politicos are said to misuse their official vehicles even for activity that constitute serious violations of the election law, they say. 
Election observers say law enforcing authorities appear to have turned a blind eye to numerous election law violations being committed in the North, North Central and the Western provinces in  particular.
