The eight Sri Lankan crew members of the ship Al Khalidia which was apprehended in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are not under custody but were provided accommodation in Khorfakan pending salary dues and repatriation, Sri Lankan Consulate General in Dubai said.

Updating the Foreign Affairs Ministry on the situation, the Consulate General has said it was only the ship which had been apprehended and media reports of arresting Sri Lankan crew members were incorrect.

The ship, which is anchored in Khorfakan in the Fujairah Emirates in UAE, was apprehended some 20 months ago by the Fujairah Coast Guard following a complaint lodged by a third party.

“However, the ship had been apprehended and anchored by the time the Lankans had assumed duties on the ship. They have been provided accommodation in a house in Khorfakan and at the Khorfakan Port. The issues faced by the crew are salaries which have not been paid yet,” Consulate General has told the Ministry.

It said they were in touch with the shipping management company to ensure welfare of the crew and the company has informed that the salaries are yet to be paid because of the financial crisis faced by the company. However, it had agreed to settle the salary dues and repatriate the crew to Sri Lanka at the earliest.

On a previous occasion, another crew of 17 Sri Lankans had been recruited to the same shipping company last year and they had not been properly paid their due salaries.

Later the employees were safely returned with due arrears with the intervention of the Consulate General. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
