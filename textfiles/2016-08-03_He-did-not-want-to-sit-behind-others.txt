He did not want to sit behind others


	

Religious dignitaries from all denominations, purohitas of all ranks, Ministry secretaries, departmental heads and top brass of the security forces were among the distinguished guests who attended the opening of the Moragahakanda Multi-Purpose Development Project commissioned under the patronage of the top duo of yahapalanaya the other day. 



The white-collar high-ups who had organized the big event had arranged the seating on the stage strictly in order of precedence. Meanwhile, a departmental head in the Defense sector, finding that the seat reserved for him in a row of seats meant for Ministry secretaries and security top brass flew into a rage and ordered the security personnel on duty to place his chair in the front row. 
By the time this departmental head took his seat in the front row, a number of senior purohitas of Cabinet rank were already occupying the seats reserved for them in the second and third rows and some of them had taken immediate exception to the departmental head’s high handed act. This matter was due to have an echo at the regular weekly meeting of the top team of yahapalanaya, they say.
