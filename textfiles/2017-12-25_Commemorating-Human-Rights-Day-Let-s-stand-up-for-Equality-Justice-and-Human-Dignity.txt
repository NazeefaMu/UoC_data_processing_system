   Ven. Dr. Atipola Mangala Thera in his key note address said that Sri Lanka has a history of upholding values even as a kingdom. Kings never arrested anyone if they were in a temple or if they were being treated in a hospital but at present  things have changed and everything revolves around the greed for political power. As a nation we have suffered through the disasters in 1971, 1988-91 and during the 30-year-civil-war. “We should realize that at the end it is we that suffer without any differentiation, as a monk, I believe we have a responsibility to guide the society without being influenced by politicians and perhaps this may be our last opportunity”.   


Congratulating the 2017 award winners, the thera said “I do commend your involvement in this field and also remind you that this award is also a responsibility that is bestowed on you to continue the good work that you do and to inspire more people”.

The chief guest, Badulla Bishop Julian Winston Sebastian Fernando, addressing gathering said that it is unfortunate to learn that Sri Lanka is listed as the fourth most corrupt country in the world, an absolute disheartening piece of news. He further said that human rights have found its way into each country’s governing system and the UDHR has as a place in their respective constitutions and that has to be admired. “As we are preparing to celebrate the birth of Christ, let me remind you that Christ was born for everyone and he stood for equality and justice”.   


State Minister Eran Wickramaratne in his message, conveyed how honoured he was by the invitation extended for the Human Rights Salutation committee. He sent his deepest regrets for being unable to attend as he was unexpectedly requested by the President to head the Sri Lankan delegation to the “One Planet Summit” in Paris.   


The Protocol will allow for the regular inspection of the places of detention and to take necessary action to improve the welfare of the people detained on Judicial Orders...



“Sri Lanka acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment on December 5 2017 and it will enter into force in Sri Lanka on January 4, 2018. Signing of the Optional Protocol under the Convention demonstrates our determination to combat torture and our commitment to co-operate with international mechanisms. The Protocol will allow for the regular inspection of the places of detention and to take necessary action to improve the welfare of the people detained on Judicial Orders. There is much more work to be done and we cannot afford to falter, but I am hopeful about the future.”   


The parents of those who had disappeared, families of prisoners, torture and rape survivors and those who participated in various workshops during the year 2017 were also presented with souvenir’s to encourage and appreciate their commitment and consistency in their efforts to reactivate the dysfunctional justice system that constantly failed them in the past.
