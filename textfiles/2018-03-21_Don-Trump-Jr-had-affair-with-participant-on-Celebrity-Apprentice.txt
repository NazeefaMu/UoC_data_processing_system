US, (Daily Mail), 20 March 2018 -  Donald Trump Jr had an affair with singer Aubrey O’Day, reports Perez Hilton.  


That romance nearly caused Don Jr and wife Vanessa to divorce back in 2012 according to multiple sources, who said that the pair began their relationship when O’Day appeared on Celebrity Apprentice.  


Those same sources said that O’Day only agreed to the relationship because Don Jr told her that he and Vanessa were in the process of separating at the time.   


‘Apparently, the 40-year-old was very aggressive in pursuing the former Danity Kane artist - telling Aubrey he loved her and that he wanted to be with her,’ reports Perez Hilton.    The affair began in 2011 and lasted until March 2012 according to reports.   Multiple reps for The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.O’Day had previously hinted at having some damning information about the Trump family following the election.
