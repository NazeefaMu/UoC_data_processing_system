Fighting shy of Diyawanna council?


	



 

A young Diyawanna member has established a new record for high absenteeism from the council.

 


A member of a political family and a fluent orator, the young Diyawanna is a big one in a small party. 
This member who worked hard towards the victory of yahapalanaya, once during a visit to the deep South bragged that he could defeat even the former strongman at the latter’s home turf at an election.


Some people musing about the truant Diyawanna member wonder whether he has assumed that there is no harm in his being absent from the council as long as the other member keeps the family flag flying!
