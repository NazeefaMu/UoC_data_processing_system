Cargills Bank has partnered with Ria Money Transfer (Ria), one of the world’s leading money transfer companies, to enhance and strengthen its remittance services.


The partnership provides customers worldwide the convenience of sending money in minutes through Ria’s overseas locations to beneficiaries in Sri Lanka.


Beneficiaries can now collect cash remittances from 17 Cargills Bank branches and at over 330 Cargills Food City outlets island wide. In addition, for a limited time Cargills Bank will be offering beneficiaries a five percent discount on their Cargills Food City purchases when they collect cash remittances at any Cargills Food City outlet, open between 8:00a.m. and 10:00p.m., 365 days of 
the year.


“We are confident that this partnership will add value and deliver a superior service proposition to Sri Lankan citizens across the globe,” said Cargills Bank Retail Banking Head Buddhika Perera. “Remittance inflows to Sri Lanka have contributed immensely to the macro and micro-economic development of the country. With wide access to Cargills Food City outlets throughout the island, we believe our partnership with Ria will further boost these initiatives.”


Ria President and CEO Juan Bianchi added: “With Cargills Bank and their well-located Cargills Food City outlets, we are extending our reach and providing beneficiaries with more convenient options to collect their Ria remittances. We look forward to a successful partnership with 
Cargills Bank.”
