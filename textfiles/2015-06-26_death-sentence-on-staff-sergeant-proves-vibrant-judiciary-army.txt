The conviction and death sentence imposed on an Army Staff Sergeant on Thursday clearly indicated that Sri Lanka has an independent and exceptional judicial system, Army Spokesman Jayanath Jayaweera said today.
He told a media conference held at the Information Department that the government would not hesitate to bring to book any armed forces personnel with prima facie evidence against them of having committed acts of crime, violence or corruption.
“It is essential to have a disciplined and highly efficient army dedicated to safeguarding Sri Lanka’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. In such an environment there is no place for miscreants and law breakers,” Brigadier Jayaweera said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
