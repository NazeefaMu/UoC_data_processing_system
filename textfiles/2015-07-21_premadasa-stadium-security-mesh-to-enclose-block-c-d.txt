	A security mesh will be installed at the R. Premadasa Stadium enclosing block C and D as a measure to prevent objects being thrown into or out of the stadium, the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said today.
	SLC Secretary Prakash Schaffter said they would do their best to complete the work before the next ODI cricket match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan scheduled to be held at the Stadium tomorrow.
	A tense situation prevailed when two groups of spectators clashed during the Sri Lanka - Pakistan ODI match held on Sunday night. The police with the help of STF personnel managed to restore law and order.
	However, a number of vehicles parked outside and stadium were damaged by the pelting of stones. Four people were arrested and remanded till July 28. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
