Being called ‘fat’ is one of the worst nightmares for a person who is overweight. Well, it is true that there are many ‘fat’ people out there, and some of them enjoying being ‘fat’. However there are some among them who fret over their health, looks and the negative criticism directed at them. This article was written after facts were obtained from an interview done with Ayurvedic Doctor 
D. D. A. Hettiarachchi. He is a traditional Ayurvedic doctor from Ganemulla.  

The best remedy to burn fat
Horse Gram, locally known as ‘Kollu’ (Macrotyloma uniforum) is a legume seed with high energy, low calories and rich in proteins. It prevents cravings by stabilizing the level of blood sugar. Soak a handful of horse gram overnight and boil the content. 


Drink Kollu water on empty stomach in the morning. Continue this for a month, even if the results are not visible as expected, since it is an internal activity.  

 

Exercise
Swimming is the most effective exercise that promises slim figure. While engaged in swimming your entire body is at work. Walking and jogging keep your feet engaged, but doesn’t do much compared to the workout that swimming offers. It’s the best exercise if you need to tone your physique. 
‘Saarana’ (Trianthema portulacastrum ) a leafy green, which has urine purifying powers, can improve the performance of internal organs. This leafy green is said to be better than other common leaves like Kathurumurunga and Mukunuwenna.  

 

Make condiments at home
Do not buy chilli powder, chilli flakes, saffron and other powdered spices. Instead make those at home by yourself. The level of cleanliness is highly doubtful in products which are for sale. You must wash, dry, remove sand and other waste from spices and carefully prepare this at home. Various unhealthy materials are added to these products like wheat flour and dye to double the quantity and give a brighter colour. Therefore, prepare it yourself and then you will be able to enjoy tasty meals in addition to improving your health.  

 

Fat cutting greens
Some greens and food we can find from the home garden or local market (village fair) can dissolve fat stored in the body. Cooking the core of the ash plantain tree (Alu kesel bada) produces a yummy dish. This preparation can be mixed with dhal or with papaya. If this cooked banana meal is eaten once a month, (for a healthy person) you will be protected from a number of diseases.  

 

Gruel of Turkey Berry (Thibbatu)
Make gruel of it and drink for two days a week early in the morning. It is beneficial in reducing phlegm in the body. Having it cooked as a meal will also fight phlegm.  


Consuming any type of healthy gruel in the morning and consuming ‘green’ vegetables will keep your fitness at a higher level. By the way, some doctors have opined that coconut milk is unhealthy and people have got used to other types of oils like palm oil. Even experts today admit that coconut milk has the lowest amount of cholesterol. The consumption of deep fried food and highly oily food should be avoided. Oil is directly linked to weight gain.   

 

Don’t skip meals
Trying to shed pounds by limiting the intake of food might put you in trouble. Sometimes it will lead to Anaemia. If you know you are having a large portion of food, then limiting is permitted.  

 

A simple trick
First of all, check your cholesterol level and then start eating six or seven ripe Veralu (Ceylon Olive) fruits for an entire week, early in the morning on an empty stomach. Drink a glass of water immediately afterwards. Check the cholesterol level again in a week and see for yourself how effective this remedy is. This simple trick has reduced cholesterol, even in some who had this condition for years. I guess this this fruit will help you slim down too,” Dr Hettiarachchi said.  

 

Eating chicken?
Doctors have different opinions regarding consuming chicken. Some say it is necessary to have chicken due to its nutritional value. Anyway medical opinion promotes the idea that broiler chicken affects human health.  

 

Enemies of the slim figure
Phlegm has that superpower to puff you up like a balloon. Therefore, control phlegm to have your dream body as well as to be healthy. People do not consider phlegm as a dangerous disease. This is partly true, but it is better to get rid of it immediately. The level of phlegm in the body of an individual has a connection with his or her genetic inheritance. If you have phlegm, it means you are prone to a number of diseases.


The other enemy is the food you eat from fast food joints in the likes of kottu, Parata, fried rice, and varieties of food made of wheat flour and unhealthy oils flavoured with excess salt, sauces and other harmful additives. Try to avoid or limit consuming these highly unhealthy foods and eat home-made food as much as possible.
