The Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said today some 25 per cent of the vehicle drivers were known to drive their vehicles after smoking ganja also known as cannabis.

“This will affect the bus industry as well and is one of reasons for the increase in the number of accidents,” Mr. Wijeratne said.

There are several drugs and pills in the market which drivers are known to use and most of the accidents occur when they fall asleep at the wheel.” He said the Motor Traffic Act should be amended  to include regulations to punish drug adicts who drive vehicles.   

Mr. Wijeratne said a proposal had been submitted to Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
