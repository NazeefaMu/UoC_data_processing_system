Terror at Westminster


	



More than 12 people were said to have been hit by a vehicle on Westminster Bridge today after a Hyundai i40 drove into pedestrians and cyclists before crashing into the gates of the Houses of Parliament. An intruder described as 'middle-aged and Asian' then managed to break into Parliament's grounds and stabbed a police officer before he was shot. One woman victim is dead and the police officer who was stabbed is also thought to have died. An hour after the attack, paramedics removed one person from the scene after extensive CPR. Another body appeared to have been left on the ground covered by a red blanket. The attack came exactly one year after 32 people were killed in suicide bombings in Brussels. Pictured: An officer points a gun at the intruder on the floor while standing on a knife, a woman comes to the aid of a victim on the bridge and the emergency services help an injured person at the scene.
