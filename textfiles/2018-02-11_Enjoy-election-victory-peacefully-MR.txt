Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa a short while ago requested the stakeholders of the Local Government election victory, especially the candidates and members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), to celebrate the election victory in a peaceful manner.

“The victory should be celebrated in a peaceful manner without causing harm or inconvenience to the members of the other parties. As winners, it is our duty and the responsibility to enjoy the victory peacefully. We should set an example to others,” he said.
