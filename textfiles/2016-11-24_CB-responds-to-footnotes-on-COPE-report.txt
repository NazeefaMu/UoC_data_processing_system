The COPE, chaired by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti, submitted to its report to Parliament on October 28 holding former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran responsible for the scam. However, the UNP MPs representing the COPE has made certain footnotes to the report expressing reservations on some of the matters.

Against this backdrop, on instructions of present Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Kumaraswami, Assistant Governor H.A. Karunaratne has written to the chairman COPE clarifying on the footnotes. It is learnt that the Bank has adequately answered the points raised by the UNP MPs in their footnotes. The clarification was made on November 4.

Asked about it, Mr. Handunnetti confirmed the receipt of such a letter from the Central Bank.

“I received a letter. I referred it to the COPE,” he said.

Earlier, the Central Bank answered queries raised by both the COPE and the Auditor General on the controversial bond transaction that took place in 2015. (Kelum Banara)
