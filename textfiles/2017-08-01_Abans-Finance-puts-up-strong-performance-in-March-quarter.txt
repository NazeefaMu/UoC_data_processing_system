Abans Finance, a member of the Abans Group, has registered a pre-tax profit of Rs.197.4 million for the period ended 31st March 2017, compared to Rs.130.5 million recorded in the corresponding year of 2016, achieving a YoY growth of 51.29 percent. 


The post–tax profit of the company for the period under review has also improved by 48.2 percent, from Rs.90.1 million in 2016 to Rs.133.6 million in 2017.


The Abans Group consists of a large diversified set of companies and divisions overlooking the sales and financing of consumer durables/household appliances, motor vehicles, environmental services, logistics, hospitality and finance. The Abans Group places a strong emphasis on customer care and focuses on the paradigm of ‘Customer for life’. 


Abans Finance has also enhanced its stated capital from Rs.382.3 million to Rs.844 million during 2016/17 and further to Rs. 1,121.4 million during the current financial year of 2018. Ironwood Investment Holding (Pvt) Limited has invested in Abans Finance and currently holds 41.89 percent equity of the company with the conclusion of the mandatory offer closed in July 2017. Ironwood is a private equity firm that successfully raised a Sri Lanka-focused Private Equity fund of up to US$ 30 million in long-term (8-year) capital commitments. 


The company has continued to increase its profitability amidst external challenges such as increasing interest rates and slowdown in consumption. The increase in profitability was mainly due to favourable growth in net interest income.

Fund based income (FBI): A slight shrinking of Net Interest Margins (NIM) had an adverse impact on the Net Interest Income (NII) of the entire NBFI sector and Abans Finance was no exception to this trend.  Nevertheless, NII of the company recorded a remarkable increase of 


Rs. 162.98million or 23 percent during the period under review from Rs.708 million in 2016 to Rs. 871 million in 2017, aided by the significant expansion of the asset-base of the company since 2016, coupled with prudent liability management strategies.

Non-fund based income (NFBI): Net fee and Commission income which mostly comprises of fees, commissions and other fee based income decreased to Rs.19.4 million from being Rs. 34.7 million during the year 2016, reflecting a decline of 44.2 percent. The company introduced a number of unique value additions to its Hero Motor cycle leasing offerings during the period under review in order to remain competitive in view of the fact that most competitors have now made moves to the two wheeler motor cycle credit market to retain margins in a period of rising interest costs. 


A 22.5 percent growth was recorded in other operating income for the period under review as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Other operating income earned during the year 2017 amounted to Rs. 20.7 million, whereas in 2016it was Rs. 16.9 million. 

Operating expenses: Operating expenses of the company which stood at Rs. 372.6 million for the yearof 2016, increased to Rs. 470 million during the year of 2016, reflecting a YoY increase of 26.1 percent. This increase was mainly due to the rise in personnel costs. The Cost to Income ratio without VAT and NBT on Financial Services in 2017 has increased to 51.5 percent from 49.0 percent recorded in the previous year. The company expects to gain the benefits of the business expansion in the coming years and intends to improve on this ratio. 

Impairment loss on loan and receivables: The impairment charge on loans and receivables for the year 2017 amounted to Rs. 189.3 million which is a decrease of Rs. 36.4 million as compared to Rs. 225.8 million impairment charges recorded for the previous year. Recently implemented portfolio monitoring mechanisms including both single loan level monitoring and overall portfolio level monitoring improved the portfolio quality, which in turn supported the reduction of impairment charges during the year.   

Business growth: The year 2017 exposed the company to a challenging environment caused by intense competition, increasing funding costs coupled with the resultant pressure on NIM. Despite these challenges, the company’s total asset base grew by 21.8 percent during the year and stood at Rs. 7,486.2 million as at 31stMarch 2017. The loans and receivables also increased by 21.8 percent during the year to Rs. 5,825.6 million as at 31stMarch 2017. The total deposits showed a growth of 22.3 percent during the year to record a figure of Rs. 5,550.5 million as at the balance sheet date.
Performance ratios: ROE (after tax) declined to 14.64 percent as at 31st March 2017 compared to 15.82 percent recorded as of 31st March 2016 while ROA (before tax) improved to 1.96 percent compared to 1.65 percent recorded in 2016. The Basic Earnings per share for the year 2017improved to Rs.2.75compared to Rs.2.29recorded for the previous year reflecting a growth of 20 percent.
Capital adequacy: The Capital Adequacy Ratio improved during the year under review and was supported by an equity infusion of Rs. 461.7 million (by way of Rights Issue and a Private Placement) and by improvement in internally generated reserves. The total Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy Ratio was at 19.37 percent compared to 11.59 percent in 2016 and whereas the Core Capital Ratio stood at 19.41 percent compared to 11.59 percent in 2016, making Abans Finance one of the highest capitalized companies in the NBFI Sector.
