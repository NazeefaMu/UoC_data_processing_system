Security in the Hambantota Port, the proposed industrial zone and other land areas coming under the purview of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) will be handled by the Sri Lanka Navy under the provisions of the Concession Agreement, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.

“The island adjoining the port will never be handed over to the Chinese as claimed by certain media institutions. A new breakwater will be constructed at the Hambantota Port to facilitate the security arrangements by the Sri Lanka Navy,” he said.

He told a journalist at a news briefing held today the Concession Agreement inked between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Chinese on July 29 last year had no clause requiring to hand over the island to the Chinese company.

“The 12-day delay to deposit the last tranche was not related to any issue connected with the island near the port. The two companies had to sort out a few minor issues pertaining to the land area that comes under HPDP. The artificial island will remain under the SLPA. I was dismayed as to how the media carried this incorrect information on the alleged delay to transfer the last tranche of US$584 million,” the minister said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
