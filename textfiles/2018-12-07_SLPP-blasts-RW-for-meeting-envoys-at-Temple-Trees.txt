SLPP blasts RW for meeting envoys at Temple Trees


	

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today criticized United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe for meeting foreign ambassadors and high commissioners at Temple Trees on Wednesday.

MP Shehan Semasinghe said entertaining foreign envoys at Temple Trees was a misuse of public property.

“The UNP still continues to venerate foreign embassies and high commissions. How can a prime minister who was removed from the post entertain envoys at Temple Trees? Today, the official residence of the prime minister is being used for conspiracies. It has become a haven for conspirators," he told a news briefing.

Mr. Semasinghe said the UNP had failed to nominate someone other than Mr. Wickremesinghe to the post of Prime Minister because of an internal crisis in the party.

“President Maithripala Sirisena has clearly said he would not reappoint Mr. Wickremesinghe to the post of prime minister. But the UNP has been unable to put nominate another member because of internal issues," he said.

Commenting on the recent parliamentary sessions, Mr. Semasinghe said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should be held responsible for convening these sessions by spending tax payers money. “All these sessions were held to promote one political party,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
