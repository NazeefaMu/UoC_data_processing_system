Whither the balance of power ?

The ever changing domestic political landscape is set to undergo yet another transformation as the next elections to choose representatives to local government bodies throughout the country looms ahead and could be held as early as in March next year.
The poll also pits the two constituent parties of the government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) directly against each other. They were rivals at the August general election but the latter contested only as the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and President Maithripala Sirisena did not actively participate in that campaign.
The UNP, rejuvenated at the grassroots level after their victory at the general election despite not obtaining an overall majority, will be keen to restore the balance of power in local government institutions which has over the past decade passed on to the UPFA throughout the country with the exception of a few urban councils and municipalities. It will also be keen to use the poll as a barometer of its performance after more than a year in office, first as an interim government without parliamentary power and then as a more stable administration.
Allegations of corruption
It is in the UPFA and the SLFP that the storm clouds are gathering. This is because the rivalry between President Sirisena and his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa - already tested at the presidential and general elections - will emerge for a third time at this poll.
Although the UPFA contested as a single political entity at the August elections, it is no secret that there was a tug of war between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions. After much bickering Rajapaksa was granted nominations but the President went public with his sentiments stating that Rajapaksa would not be granted the Premiership that he was seeking. That spat was much ado about nothing as the UPFA emerged second best at the election.
However, the fact that most Rajapaksa loyalists - including those from outside the SLFP- secured impressive numbers of preference votes despite allegations of corruption against at least some of them while most supporters of the President lost, has not gone unnoticed. President Sirisena attempted to redress the balance somewhat, packing the UPFA National List with his nominees, some of them being defeated candidates at the general election.
The President now wants the SLFP to contest the Local Government elections on its own, instead of as the UPFA. In any event, several constituent parties of the alliance, such as the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (led by Wimal Weerawansa), Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (led by Dinesh Gunewardena), the Democratic Left Front (led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara), the Communist Party (led by D.E. W. Gunasekara), the Lanka Samasamaja Party (led by Tissa Vitarana) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (led by Udaya Gammanpila) are vehemently opposed to the current trajectory of the SLFP.
Rajapaksa loyalists
Conversely, Sirisena loyalists view these parties as parasites of the SLFP within the UPFA. They have only a miniscule national base votes but depend on the SLFP bulk vote to gain representation with their high profile stalwarts then getting elected due to the large numbers of preference votes they attract at the expense of long suffering SLFPers.
Because of this, the parting of ways between the SLFP and the UPFA may occur at the Local Government elections - and the divergence in thinking between the UPFA and SLFP is not the only reason for that: the ‘Rajapaksa factor’ will also come in to play quite decisively.
Although many Rajapaksa loyalists gained entry to Parliament at the recent elections, they were treated in different ways by the SLFP hierarchy. Some, who showed a willingness to co-operate with President Sirisena were elevated to Cabinet rank. This includes party seniors such as Nimal Siripala de Silva, Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, the latter duo being accommodated despite being blatantly loyal to Rajapaksa during the general election campaign.
Others, mostly those who have remained steadfast in their loyalty to Rajapaksa, have been side-lined. In fact, the President has told some of these parliamentarians that they could choose to sit in the Opposition if they wished to but that they should not violate party discipline. Throughout all this, Rajapaksa himself has kept a low profile.
The Local Government elections provide these political forces - those still loyal to Rajapaksa within the SLFP and the smaller parties of the UPFA - with an opportunity to converge. SLFPers who do so will no doubt face the wrath of the party leadership but it is left to be seen what action would be taken against them. President Sirisena failed to punish parliamentarians who flocked to the ‘Bring Back Mahinda’ campaign during the general election but, with no major national elections on the horizon for another five years, he may do so now. Again, in previous such instances, mostly in the UNP, aggrieved MPs have taken their cases to court and have been successful in safeguarding their parliamentary seats.
Local Government Councils
Rajapaksa loyalists are confident of a strong performance in the event a new alliance - with the former President as their undeclared leader - is formed. This is due to several reasons. Firstly, Local Government Councils have been packed with Rajapaksa loyalists over the past ten years. As incumbent members of their councils, they enjoy name recognition and some standing in the communities they represent. If these representatives continue their loyalty to a new alliance that enjoys Rajapaksa’s tacit support, their contribution would be vital. Again, not all of them will do so; some of them will invariably switch allegiance to the mainstream SLFP, like their colleagues in Parliament did.
The other reason that Rajapaksa loyalists feel they can register a strong performance at the Local Government elections is what they see as their main campaign issue: the government’s stance in co-sponsoring the recent resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva. Their campaign would be themed on accusing the government (the UNP, the SLFP and President Sirisena in particular) of selling out to western interests and of sacrificing war heroes at an inquiry into alleged war crimes.
Whether such a slogan which has a national context will reverberate with voters at an election that chooses representatives who manage their local culvert or their garbage collection is a moot point. It is also relevant to note that voters are now election weary, having participated in two hotly contested and distracting national elections already.
While the SLFP and its factions are gearing up for the polls, there is another argument brewing between the mainstream SLFP and the UNP as to how the polls should be conducted. A previous parliamentary committee headed by Dinesh Gunewardena recommended a ‘hybrid’ between the first past the post and Proportional Representation (PR) systems. The UNP is keen on elections on a PR system while the SLFP wishes for polls on a first past the post basis. This is a repeat of the dispute the two major parties had before the general election, with the SLFP pushing for the 20th Amendment to the Constitution incorporating electoral reforms and the UNP being not too keen to pursue them.
Traditionally, Local Government elections hardly inspire the masses, especially if they have been dragged through two bruising national elections already. This local poll might manage to do just that though, because it has the capacity to redefine the political forces in the country and provide an answer to a question that most Sri Lankans would like a definite answer to: is the country essentially a two party democracy or is there still room for a third party which could substantially influence the balance of power?
