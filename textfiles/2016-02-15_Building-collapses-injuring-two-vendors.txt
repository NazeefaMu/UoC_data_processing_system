Two vendors were injured when a part of a building at the Kirindiwela bus stand collapsed last morning after a private bus crashed into it.


Police said the haphazard manner in which the bus had reversed resulted in it hit the building.

The two vendors were rushed to the Radawana Hospital and transferred in a critical condition to the Watupitiwala Hospital. Kirindiwela Pradeshiya Sabha workers are clearing the debris. (Upali Ranaweera)
