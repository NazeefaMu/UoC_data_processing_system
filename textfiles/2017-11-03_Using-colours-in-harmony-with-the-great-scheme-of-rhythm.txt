A great numerologist has said that the beauty of a piano carries no worth if its keys do not produce vibrations or notes in accord with the proper scale. 

 

The way to realize the full human potential
According to Numerology, there is a great scheme of rhythm underpinning Nature and man being part of Nature has to act in harmony with this great scheme of rhythm if he is to realize the full potential as a human being. 


Not only words and deeds, but also the colours of our attire should be in harmony with this great scheme of rhythm. 

 

Mother Nature’s colour scheme
If you carefully look around you will observe a scheme of colours encompassing our environment.  How humdrum would be the world without Mother Nature’s colour scheme!

 

In harmony with the Birth Number
