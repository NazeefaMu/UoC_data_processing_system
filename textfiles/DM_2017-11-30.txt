Alleged Threat On Anika's Brother : CID Investigation Continues
	
The alleged death threat levelled on Anika Wijesuriyas family after her testimony at the Bond Commission with reference to a powerful former minister and Perpetual Treasuries owner Arjun Aloysius in connection with multimillion rupee property transactions, came to the spotlight again following a fundamental rights petition filed by Shanil Nethicumara and a B report filed by the Criminal Investigation Department.

[End of Recording]

The CID after recording a statement from Wijesuriya on the instructions of the Commissioners of the Bond Commission had filed a B-report at the Fort Magistrates Court (B 7357/ 17). The B Reports filed by the CID in this case provide details of efforts taken to locate Nethicumara, visits to several addresses and interviews with witnesses familiar with his whereabouts. According to the B Reports, it appears that the CID too had noted the telephone conversation between Nethicumara and Ms. Onella Karunanayake that took place moments before the recorded threatening phone call, and had indicated that further investigations into this offenceare continuing.
The voice recording, which has now surfaced regarding the alleged threatening phone call made by Don Shanil Lakkika Nethicumara to VijithaWijesuriya, brother of Anika Wijesuriya, in which the former is clearly heard saying that he will give with interest to the Wijesuriya family for what they (Wijesuriyas) have done to his Uncle Ravi. The recording states as thus, What you did to uncle, with interest I will give you all. remember that.
In the recorded call, according to the B report, Nethicumara is also heard swearing to thrash all of you and warns the Wijesuriya family, dont get caught to me. He explains his words by clearly stating that he is giving an open threat, which is in retaliation to how the Wijesuriya family acted after making hundreds of millions of rupees from Uncle Ravisapartment complex.
This recording was also mentioned in a submission made by Vijitha Wijesuriya to the Supreme Court as the 4th respondent to the Fundamental Rights application (SC FR 388/ 17) filed by Nethicumara on October 30, 2017 seeking an interim order preventing the CID from arresting him. The FR petition by Nethicumara was however dismissed by the Supreme Court on November 28.
In his limited objections, Vijitha Wijesuriya also made reference to a copy of Nethicumaras telephone records that was attached to the Supreme Court petition.
Its also evident that just before I returned the call of the Petitioner he had yet again spoken to Miss Ornella Karunanayake for 2 mins and 8 secs at 10.36 p.m. and only thereafter answered my call at 10.39 p.m. and proceeded to threaten me and my family with harm in retaliation to my sister testifying about the affairs of Miss Karunanayakes father, said Wijesuriya in his sworn affidavit to the Supreme Court.
According to Nethicumaras application, he had come to know about the allegation now levelled against him, through the media as to how Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC, had informed the Bond Commission on October 17, 2017 that he had made death threats against Anika Wijesuriya
Request to attest affidavit refused
According to a person familiar with this matter, since Wijesuriya could not obtain consular support by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Singapore, he flew to Colombo in the wee hours of October 24 (Friday), signed the affidavit before a Commissioner for Oaths, and then left the country again a few hours later. It is learned that this was done in order to meet the Supreme Court deadline for filing objections. The affidavit, with attached documents and several audio CDs containing the audio recording, were submitted to the Supreme Court by Wijesuriyas lawyers later that same morning.
In the original Fundamental Rights petition submitted to the Supreme Court by Nethicumara, he pleaded that he is faced with the immediate threat of being subject to an unlawful arrest under the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No: 4 of 2015.
Incident at night spot
In his petition, Nethicumara had stated that he hadnt had any contact with Wijesuriya, who is the 4th respondent, since 2014 until he met him on or about October 14, 2017 around 1.30am, at the Love Bar night spot at 58A, Horton Place Colombo 7. He charges that Wijesuriya, appearing to be under the influence of liquor, jumped out from behind a curtain and a started a quarrel with him over a personal matter. He has added that Wijesuriya had pulled him by his collar, threatened and insulted him in abusive and expletive language near the club washroom. According to Nethicumaras application, although he was provoked as a result of the behaviour of the accused, he hadnt sought to retaliate and managed to escape from the club where the dispute occurred.
In his submission, he had further stated how he telephoned Wijesuriya the same evening around 10.34pm on his mobile for the sole purpose of chastising him over his conduct at the Love Bar. According to the FR application, Nethicumara categorically denies that he threatened Wijesuriya in respect of Anika Wijesuriyas evidence at the Bond Commission, or that he has ever threatened anybody over the telephone.
According to Nethicumaras application, he had come to know about the allegation now levelled against him, through the media as to how Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC, had informed the Bond Commission on October 17, 2017 that he had made death threats against Anika Wijesuriya. Later on the same day, Nethicumara had lodged a complaint with the Cinnamon Gardens Police against Wijesuriya for assaulting and threatening him at the night club on October 14,
Nethicumara further states that he was surprised how a personal dispute has been deceitfully manipulated by Wijesuriya and other interested parties into an allegation of threats to a witness before theBond Commission.

Fabricated incident
According to the affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, Wijesuriya categorically denies the allegation of an altercation of any sort with Nethicumara prior to the threatening phone call, and posits that the petitioner fabricated the entire incident to muddy the waters and impede his arrest. It appears that he waited for 10 days after the alleged incident (24/10/2017) to request a copy of the CCTV footage from the Management of the Love Bar, waited for 4 days after the alleged incident (17/10/2017) to lodge his first complaint at the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station regarding the alleged quarrel, altercation, or brawl with me and made no reference whatsoever regarding this alleged quarrel, altercation, or brawl that took place at Love Bar on the 14/10/2017 during the telephone conversation I had with him at 10.39 p.m., just hours after the incident is alleged to have occurred, pleaded Wijesuriya, who submitted the audio recording as further evidence that Nethicumara didnt make any mention of the events he describes in his petition while
making the call.
The petitioner states that he believes and is reliably informed that the accused hadnt lodged a complaint with the police nor with any duly authorized authority at the time the Additional Solicitor General made the submission to the Bond Commission against him, which practice was highly irregular. He further states that he verily believes that the five respondents  the IGP, Director CID, OIC (Special Unit) CID, VijithaWijesuriya and the Attorney General have taken into account, an extraneous consideration and are attempting to arrest and prosecute him, without any reasonable grounds and without any material which would justify the same.
He further believes that the night club where the brawl occurred is owned by a friend of Anika Wijesuriya and there is a possibility of an attempt to destroy the recordings of the CCTV footage that could transpire the brawl that occurred on October 14. However, Wijesuriya pointed out that Nethicumara had waited over ten days before asking for these recordings, after which period many commercial CCTV recording systems have recycled their storage disks and lost older recordings.
Unable to hear
Although Nethicumara states that he believes Wijesuriya hadnt lodged a complaint either with the Police nor with any other authorized authority at the time the Additional Solicitor General informed the Bond Commission against him, the Daily Mirror is in possession of the complaint lodged by Vijitha Wijesuriya, Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the issuance and Disposal of Treasury Bonds, S. Udugamasuriya on the morning of Monday, October 17, 2017, the first day on which the Commission sat following the incident on Saturday night.
In his complaint, Wijesuriya states as thus, When Mr. Nethicumara first called me at 10.34pm, I was unable to hear him clearly as his voice was garbled. It sounded to me like he was shouting and the call got disconnected due to a bad mobile connection. Again I received another call from Mr. Nethicumara at 10.35pm, and the mobile connection was very poor and I could not hear him and the call got disconnected once again. I then attempted to call him back and his number was busy. I finally spoke to him at 10.38pm, and the conversation lasted a little over a minute. 
When I returned his call, I did so with my phone on loudspeaker mode while setting up another mobile device to record the conversation. While his voice was slightly garbled on that occasion too, Mr. Nethicumara appeared clearly and said what you did to my uncle machang I will kill all you.
Following this complaint, on the instructions of the Members of the Commission, Secretary S. Udugamasuriya on October 17, had written to the Director CID, SSP, Shani Abeysekera (Ref: PC/ CBTB/ Order) to take necessary action against those who were involved in the alleged threat under Section 8 and 9 of the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No: 4 of 2015 and to provide protection to the Wijesuriya family with immediate effect under Section 24 of the same Act and to keep the Commission informed on the progress of the directives by October 26.
In the original Fundamental Rights petition submitted to the Supreme Court by Nethicumara, he pleaded that he is faced with the immediate threat of being subject to an unlawful arrest


Anikas e-mail
Meanwhile, on October 18, Anika Wijesuriya in an e-mail to the Director CID had stated that she had to leave the country the day after she was testified. Her letter further states as thus, I am eager and willing to corporate with the investigation into this matter while I am overseas. I could provide written answers via e-mail to any questionnaire submitted to me by investigators, or make myself available to give a statement in person if investigating officers are in a position to travel overseas to record my statement.
In the affidavit submitted with his limited objections to the SC by Vijitha Wijesuriya on Friday October 24, he catergorically denies the averments contained in the petition and responding further, states that he briefly visited the Love Bar in Colombo 7, on October 14, 2017 with two of his friends. According to the statement, during the period when Wijesuriya was at the Love Bar, he dadnt met the petitioner nor had he any knowledge of the fact that the petitioner was present. I therefore vehemently deny the contention of the petitioner that I initiated a quarrel, altercation or brawl with him or had any interaction with him whatsoever. I state that the petitioner has preferred his application in bad faith and has attempted to mislead Your Lordships court in attempting to cover up the factual incident which took place as more fully described in this affidavit, Wijesuriya has said.
Through the affidavit, Wijesuriya categorically denies the averments contained in the petition and states that on October 14, 2017 around 10.34pm and 10.35pm, the petitioner attempted to call him on his mobile phone, but however was unable to have a conversation as the line wasnt clear. Wijesuriya in his affidavit had stated that he had produced the mobile phone and the recording device that was used during the communication with Nethicumara to the OIC (Special Unit) CID as evidence to the
ongoing investigation.
Supreme Court Dismisses Nethicumara FR Petition
The Supreme Court, comprising a three-judge bench, on tuesday(Nov.28) refused leave to proceed in the Fundamental Rights Application filed by Shanil Nethicumara pleading for an interim order to preventing the CID from arresting him on the allegations of threatening to attack Anika Wijesuriyas family in retaliation to Wijesuriya having testified against former Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Bond Commission.
Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris, appearing for Nethicumara, argued that the telephone call between Nethicumara and Vijitha was being taken out of context and said that it had anything to do with former Minister Ravi Karunanayake, but was related to a previous relationship between Nethicumaras sister Lakshi, and VijithaWijesuriya.
At the conclusion of the argument, the three-judge bench comprising Justices Eva Wanasundera, Buwaneka Aluwihare and Anil Gunaratne, ruled that there were no grounds to allow leave to proceed, and dismissed the application filed by Nethicumara.
Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris and Danushka Rahubadda instructed by Sanath Wijewardene appeared for petitioner Shanil Nethicumara. Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General, IGP, Director CID and OIC of CID Special Branch. Counsels Asthika Devendra and Dinusha Mohan, instructed by Lilanthi De Silva appeared for the fourth respondent VijithaWijesuriya.

Beer from rice: JO demands cancellation of Gazette
	
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane said yesterday the finance ministry had issued a Gazette notification on November 9 authorising rice, corn and fruits as raw material for beer production at a time when there was a shortage of rice for consumption in the market.
He told a news conference held at the parliament complex that they condemned the move taken by the government when people had faced difficulties due to the sky rocketing rice prices.
He said this was done to facilitate the distillery owned by Arjun Aloysius in Kalkuda, Batticaloa.
"We ask whether the President and the government approve the decision to use these essential food items as raw materials for beer production. We urge the government to cancel this gazette notification completely as there was a shortage of rice and the prices of rice were escalating. We urge the President to mediate in this regard," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

COPE uncovers fraud involved in aircraft lease: Bimal
	
It has been uncovered by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) that there has been a fraud involved in cancellation of the lease of aircraft for Srilankan Airlines, MP Bimal Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday.
Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget, Mr Ratnayake who is also a COPE member,said the committee is yet to determine the extent of the fraud.
"The fraud could be Dollars 50 million or might be even higher as 100 million dollars" the MP said.
"Both the present government and the last have robbed the national carrier. One government sold the airline and robbed from the deal while a successive government tried to show it is taking patriotic move to acquire Srilankan but also robbed from the deal. More frauds were involved in leasing aircraft and finally there has been a fraud in cancelling the deal, " Mr Ratnayake added.
He said no government had been able to maintain the national carrier. "The two main political parties which has governed the country has failed to maintain the Srilankan Airlines".
He charged that the current head of the national carrier had also failed to reverse the situation though he is paid a salary of Rs.7 million per month. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Dual tropical threats to SL, India next week
	
A newly formed cyclonic storm and second brewing tropical threat will combine to threaten parts of Sri Lanka and India with flooding and mudslides in next week, The Accu Weather reported today.
Cyclonic Storm Ockhi developed near Sri Lanka yesterday and has produced rounds of heavy rainfall across the country and neighboring parts of southern India since early in the week.
A slow track to the west will take the cyclonic storm south of India before it turns northward and moves off the coast of western India into early next week. This track will result in daily downpours across Sri Lanka and southern India through at least Saturday.
The heaviest rain is expected across Sri Lanka and southern and central Tamil Nadu as well as southern Kerala in India.
There will be a high risk for local flash flooding along with an elevated risk for mudslides.
These areas will get generally less than 50 mm (2 inches) of rainfall through Sunday.
While this first tropical threat sits over the Arabian Sea early next week, a new threat will approach Sri Lanka and eastern India.
Tropical development is possible as early as Thursday or Friday near the Andaman and Nicobar islands in the Bay of Bengal.
This potential cyclone will then have an opportunity to organize further and strengthen as it crosses the southern Bay of Bengal this weekend.
Eastern India will be at risk for impacts from the tropical cyclone as early as Monday night, with areas from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh at highest risk for flooding and damaging winds.

Looking back fondly:  Ho Gana Pokuna
	
The ideology that pervades our movies is an ideology of commitment  secular, cosmopolitan, sometimes contrived, rarely felt  and they tend to constrict your vision. Theres an intense desire on the part of their directors to talk about social problems, to let us know that there are people out there who are suffering in want. It makes us want to cower before their vision, full of intentions but also full of a rift between those intentions and their production values.
What Ho Gana Pokuna lacks is explicit political force
	Ho Gana Pokuna, may well be the most exciting Sinhala film released in the last three years
	No industry can flourish for long with practitioners who reject its commercial base
We want to do away with that rift, but the moment we try to we are lambasted as being escapist, fantasist, and tellers of fairy-tales. How could one be committed without resorting to explicit ideologies Its a tough call, but by extraordinary resolve some of our movie-makers have proved that one can be politically inclined without making his or her work a vassal to ideas. We already have a cinema of ideas. Now we want a cinema of life.
I saw Ho Gana Pokuna for the first time two years ago, in October, at the Savoy. The excitement on the faces of the child actors who were there, now grown up, was hard to ignore, and kept me expecting a great deal from it. I didnt know the story behind it, nor of its cast and crew. All I knew was that Indika Ferdinando, whose play The Irresistible Rise of Mr. Signno I saw before, had directed it. Depressed somewhat at the hardened, dichotomised world that directors his age tended to depict in film after film (awfully sincere, sincerely awful) I was, naturally enough I suppose, unconvinced of this ones prospects. I sat down, therefore, with a sense of tepid anticipation.
Two hours later I got up forgetting Id ever harboured such feelings. Ho Gana Pokuna then became, for me, the most exciting Sinhala film Id seen in the last three years.
In Sri Lanka, the gap between childrens movies and movies featuring children has blurred so much that no one cares to make this distinction any more. This is to be expected in any film industry where neither the critics nor the general public are selective in their preferences (the public just want to be entertained, the critics just want to be provoked). The fact that its normal and to be expected, however, doesnt mean that its not deplorable: The truth is that our film-makers use our children to spout out convenient posters and labels that belong to the political so much that those children become no more than instruments, messengers. Ho Gana Pokuna doesnt resort to this device. It teaches us just how imaginative our directors could be if they didnt use their subject-matter to depict their adulterated imaginings of them.
Writing to the Sunday Observer a few weeks after its release, Dilshan Boange contended that Indikas left-of-centre political sympathies showed, somewhat discernibly, in the film. This is true. But the intrusion of the political in Ho Gana Pokuna is mercifully short: all we have is a bunch of NGO officials gifting an expensive but useless piano to the school as part of a project. The piano isnt used; the children are instead taught by their rather irate principal (Lucien Bulathsinhala), who is also their only teacher, to fear it. Its an object of ridicule which only the idealistic teacher, Miss. Uma (Anasuya Subasinghe), resuscitates, which is why whatever political inclinations there are in the film come out through her. She is the political centre, and the periphery, of the narrative, since she represents the affirmation of ideology as well as the rejection of the labels that ideologues tend to harbour.
This is a novel message for a Sinhala movie. Elsewhere film-makers have been telling us that we need to be more open, more proactive, and to shout and protest with labels and dichotomies that never work out in reality. What Ho Gana Pokuna lacks is explicit political force: Even at its most forceful moments (as when Wasantha Muhandiram as the village headman [Grama Niladhari] refuses to let the children and the teacher use the bus for their trip) Indika pulls back, not because hes fearful but because he knows the experience hes pasted over his film is too magical to face such moments. Even the verbal encounters between Miss. Uma and the principal, when they decide (the former willingly, the latter begrudgingly) to inaugurate an Assembly outside the school for the students, are short (the principals contention is that by democratising the institution the children will grow up to rebel against becoming the farmers that their fathers are): We see them debate, her cheerful, him scornful, but there it ends.
The committed critic may well see in this a complete rejection of the political, a convenient erasure of reality by a saccharine-coated view of life, but this rakes up the question as to what the intentions of the artist should be. Our committed directors dont lack courage. They have enough and more of it and they are brave. But the fatal contradiction at the heart of their conception of the cinema is their inability to resonate with popular audiences. If we have not gone beyond the eighties and the nineties (which nurtured Dharmasena Pathiraja and Dharmasiri Bandaranayake, the twin peaks of our political cultural sphere before Asoka Handagama entered the field) its because our film industry has bifurcated between the critics who conflate ideological profundity with aesthetic merit, the same conflation that our writers in the Sinhala theatre sustain, and the audiences who wish to see something richer, and more satisfying, in our halls. Compared with the fat politician played by Saumya Liyanage in Vidu, for instance, how much more believable are the villagers in Ho Gana Pokuna! The tragedy is that complexity is often taken as a sign of the uncommitted. The even bigger tragedy is that it is the lack of such complexity, through the one-dimensionality those other movies reflect, which we are supposed to watch and, whatsworse, enjoy.
Its a view that certainly merits a second glance but its not the only view there is. The cinema thrives on plurality. Singleness, whether of intention or motive, isnt usually very helpful, and eventually saps a film industry of its ability to fascinate. The recent spate of local films that cant be categorised under that convenient artistic-commercialist divide our critics make is, I think, not a coincidence in that respect: from Ho Gana Pokuna right down to Adaraneeya Kathawak and Premaya Nam, there is an emotional resonance in them which easily wins audiences in a way that forced, unfelt political pamphlets and treatises cannot. No industry can flourish for long with practitioners who reject its commercial base, just as no industry can thrive with those who make money its only motive. Ho Gana Pokuna tells us, in its own special way, that theres really no need to be a slave to those other movies. We are tired of the vision they spout because we know that the only alternative to them are the vigilante escapist flicks that our popular directors churn out, from Ranja to Wada Bari Tarzan.
Miss. Uma, a transposed Julie Andrews/Maria von Trapp, and her children dominate the script because no one is a hero or villain in the village they inhabit: Everyone cowers before them, wilfully. Whatever problems she and they face  whether in the form of the principal, the Grama Niladhari, or Justin, the bus driver who lacks a licence  congeal gradually into their own solutions. In a way that lacks complexity, but when considering the alternatives  having her as a political ideologue or meandering to a set of happy-go-luck musical numbers  its more alive, more open, more textured. In contrast to many of those politically motivated films which are constricted, literally and metaphorically (many of them take place in tightly enclosed spaces, against a middle class milieu) Indikas film hence has room to breathe, to move forward. You cant blame people for becoming alert and alive to this kind of cinema because they want a work of art to keep them alert and alive. The political directors work from the premise that life is banal, following a depersonalised routine.
(Handagama, in Age Asa Aga, has the husband, wife, and daughter follow the same setup every evening, again and again, to the point of tedium.) Even as apolitical a director as Somaratne Dissanayake, in Siri Parakum, resorts to this banality, with entire sequences being repeated as if we didnt get them the first time. Whats so interesting in the end about Ho Gana Pokuna is that it wilfully, delightfully does away with such tedium. Theres nothing really consistent in the plot. The children, along with their elders, always rake up something new for us; they even tide over an unlikely twist towards the end when Justin, the bus driver they all toiled and taught so as to procure a licence, gets so carried away and drinks in exhilaration that he cant drive the children to the beach.
At the movies we are repeatedly, though inadvertently, made aware that what we are seeing in front of us is a falsification of reality. Some directors get away with it, others dont. When film-makers embrace the political passionately, ambitiously, zealously, many of them, particularly the more recent ones, tend to sacrifice the real for the verbal. They will spell out each sequence elaborately for the audience hoping that the audience will agree with their outlook. Repetition of sequences, slipshod camera movements, jerky editing: these are the hallmarks of the political director, and he resorts to them as frequently as the commercial artist resorts to the needs of his clients by polishing up his output. Indika Ferdinandos previous work, even as open-textured a play as Signno, bears out a political impulse.
But in Ho Gana Pokuna, which as I mentioned at the beginning may well be the most exciting Sinhala film released in the last three years, the audiences are alive to what they are seeing. The movie no longer has to spell out everything to them believing them to be gullible idiots. The ending is, I think, a distillation of the entire plot in this respect: the teachers call for action over lofty ideals may well be a statement against the serious artist, who in his enthusiasm for ideas over execution prefers to rant, to rave, to explicate, rather than to breathe.

22nd Death Anniversary of Murial Mildred Pollocks She left an irreplaceable void
	
It is with great sadness that I write this tribute to you. When we lose a loved one, we have to endure pain, grief, desolation and emptiness, in fact, a loss of a mother is irreparable and devastating, no matter how young or old the children are and remembering our mama who was always loving and devoted, understandingand affectionate.
Indeed, she lavished her love and care with material resources to keep the family happy and for the advancement of her children. Her guidance, advice, concern and her untiring efforts helped her children to come up in life.
Mama devoted her time skill, patience and love with generosity and magnanimity and we being her children wanted to honour her love, maternal affection, care and patience she gave us ungrudgingly.
Mummy had amazing powers and her forte was that she could face any problems without making any complaints. She cared for all of us withoutany demands.
Being benevolent and sweet by nature mama soon found her place in the hearts of everyone. Love and forgive, live and let live was her motto. In fact religion played a very great role in her life. Born to a devout Catholic family her faith was strong and whatever she did her promise to God came first. In Mother Mary Immaculate and Saint Anthony she had strong faith which helped her till the very end. She died on November 30,1995, clinging onto the Blessed Rosary at my sisters place in Kapuwatte, Ja-ela.
Indeed, the loss of our mother is painful and tearful. A light from the family is gone, a voice we loved stilled, a place is vacant in our home which can never be replaced. 
She saw the road was getting, rough, so she closed her weary eyelids and whispered peace be thine, it broke our hearts to lose her, but she didnt go alone, a part of us went with her, The day God called her home.
May I say, Goodnight, sweet queen and may the flights of Angels sing thee to thy restMalcolm Godwin Pollocks

84 private bond issues during last regime to be probed: PM
	
The Government intended to start up a probe on bond issues that had taken place from 2008 to 2014 totalling Rs. 5,147 billion, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
Making a special statement in the House, the Prime Minister said these bond issues had been made on private placements, without informing the Monetary Board or the Central Bank and Parliament.
He said 90 percent of those bond issues had been done on private placements, while issues have also been done through using EPF, ETF and National Savings Bank as captive sources.
"We will get the Finance Committee in Parliament to probe these bond issues, which have been done according to whims and fancies of certain persons. These are more or less similar to pyramid schemes," he said. 
The Prime Minister also informed Parliament that probes would be conducted on the frauds that had taken place in the stock market between 2008 and 2014.
He said bonds had been issued under direct placements only in four instances under the present regime, while there have been 84 instances of issuing bonds during the tenure of the last regime.
Mr. Wickremesinghe added that he has got all the details on bond issues from 2008 to 2014 from the Central Bank.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The Power of Dance
	
Dance is the hidden language of the soul of the body
Dancers are the messengers of the gods- Martha Graham
There is a clashing of cymbals. Like an instrument, the sound of chanting rises slowly in the air. An invocation ascends in a syllabic intonation, voices seeking a blessing. 
Bless me Gauthama Buddha!
Bless me Lord Shiva;
the Lord of the dance !
Bless me, dear parents
and teachers !
Bless me, members
of the audience !
Sinuous, sliding shapes appear before our eyes. Coiling and uncoiling, twisting and entwining, they come together and move away. The stillness hangs silently in the air. Slowly, deliberately, the shapes uncoil and stir into life. The beauty of movement begins. It is the dance of the cobra.
A conch shell blares, cleaning, purifying. Its waves echo the roaring sound of the sea. The reverberations continue, bringing prosperity, they take away the bad energy and announce a new beginning. It is the beginning of new performance by Natanda, Sri Lankas contemporary dance company. 
The most recent of Sri Lankas traditional dances, the Vannam dates back to the 18th century, to the reign of the Kandyan King Narendrasinghe (1707-1739 AD)
Drawing on the ancient classical tradition of Ves Natum or Kandyan Dance, Natanda fuses it with contemporary dance and modern ballet, to re-enact the Vannam, one of the great dance rituals of Sri Lanka. The most recent of Sri Lankas traditional dances, the Vannam dates back to the 18th century, to the reign of the Kandyan King Narendrasinghe (1707-1739 AD), renowned as a great lover and patron of the arts. 
The word vannam comes from the Sinhala word varnana, meaning descriptive praise. There are 18 Vannams. Each vannama is a recitation, inspired by nature, history, legend, folklore, art and religion; each recitation expresses a dominant idea. Melding drums, percussion, electro beats, rock and classical music with the traditional sound of cymbals, conch-shells and chanted verse, dancer and choreographer Kapila Palihawadana and his team recreate, innovate and reinvent.
Breathing new life into an ancient tradition, Palihawadana and his dancers perform their own versions of five of the Vannamas.
The Naiyadi - The Dance the Cobra.
The Gahaka - The Dance of the Conch.
The Gajaga - The Dance of the Elephant.
The Mayura - The Dance of Peacock. 
The Thuranga - The Dance of the Horse.
In ancient Sri Lanka dance was a communication with the Gods and with the Buddha; the messenger of the gods was the dancer. It is the same with modern dance. The great American dancer and choreographer Martha Graham (1894  1991), believed that Dance is the hidden language of the soul. In the Vannam each dance is an abstract movement, hinting at a deeper meaning within. It is this meaning that Palihawadana and his dancers try to explore. Using their bodies as their vehicles, they are interpreters and intermediaries, still the messengers of the gods.
Modern dance in the west began as a rebellion against classical ballet. It has its roots in America in the early 20th century. One of its founding figures was Martha Graham. For Graham, ballet was too European, too imperialistic, and too un-American. So she went onto to create her own unique style, reshaping American dance. In 1926 she founded her own school, the Martha Graham Dance Company. The oldest dance company in America, it has had a huge influence on contemporary western dance. One of its most brilliant products was Mercier Philip Merce Cunningham (1919  2009).
Merce Cunningham is perhaps the greatest influence on Kapila Palihawadana, the founder of Natanda. Dancer, choreographer, teacher and innovator, Cunningham transformed the face of modern dance in the second half of the 20th century 20th century. Like Martha Graham, he founded his own school, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. Inspired by the power of chance and random happenings, Cunningham introduced new techniques and new forms of movement, bringing sudden elements and unpredictable changes into the body of the dance. He did not believe that a dance needed a beginning, middle or an end. In a radical break with tradition, Cunningham also dissociated dance from music, creating moments of pure and silent movement. Inspired by Cunningham, Palihawadana brings in sudden change and pure movement into his rendition of the Vannam, fusing the past with the present to create something new. 
Modern dance in the west began as a rebellion against classical ballet. It has its roots in America in the early 20th century. One of its founding figures was Martha Graham
There is a rustle of movement. A hulking shape looms slowly heavily into view. The Gajaga Vannama. The Dance of the Elephant has begun. Calm, stately and full of power, the Tusker is the most majestic animal in the world. It appears slowly, swaying from side to side. Accompanied only by the piano, it walks with grace and beauty. To portray the beauty of Tusker the entire ensemble takes the stage. Suddenly the mood turns mad and angry as each and every dancer is overcome with rage and violence. Evoking Merce Cunningham, the two male dancers move without music. That is the end of the Gajaga Vannma. 
One of the most significant modern architects of the 20th century, the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange (1913-2005), was renowned for combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism. Tange once compared tradition with a
chemical reaction:
The role of tradition is that of a catalyst, which furthers a chemical reaction 
but is no longer detectable in the end result.
Kenzo Tange (1913-2005)
This is what Palihawadana and his dancers have done. Using tradition as an inspiration and a catalyst, they have sought to re-invigorate and innovate. It is the very essence of modernism. Deeply conscious of their roots butalive to the future, the dancers ofNatanda are the modern face of Sri Lankas ancientliving society. 
Natfest - An International Contemporary Dance Festival
Organized by Sri Lankas first contemporary dance company, Natanda Dance Theatre of Sri Lanka, the festival will be held from December 1 to 8 in Jaffna and Colombo. The festival is to commence on December 1 in Jaffna, and concludes in Colombo on December 8. International dance companies will be participating from United Kingdom, India, Russia, Indonesia, and Switzerland this year. There will also be six local dance troupes participating from Colombo, Batticaloa, Jaffna, and Ratnapura
