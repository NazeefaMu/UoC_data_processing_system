Govt. to issue statement on controversial CB bonds


	


	The Economic Affairs and Policy Planning Ministry will issue a statement today regarding a controversial bond issue of the Central Bank.

The statement will be issued in the wake of allegations that a party having close links to Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had unfairly benefitted from the bond issue. The Central Bank had issued 30-year bonds. Their interest rate had later shot up, allegedly giving disproportionate benefits to this party.
Asked about this bond issue, Economic Affairs deputy minister Harsha de Silva said his ministry would issue a statement during the course of today, giving full details. 
Asked whether there was any truth in the allegations, he said, “We will issue a statement through the ministry explaining the actual position.  Other than that, we won’t say anything.”(Kelum Bandara)
