LPBOA wants lane restrictions removed


	


	Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) today complained to the Human Rights Commission requesting that the regulation on lane restrictions enforced by the Police Department be removed.
	The Police Department now strictly enforces the law on lane restrictions in a bid to reduce traffic within the Colombo City limits.
	LPBOA President Gamunu Wijeratne asked for a separate lane for buses if the police continued to enforce the law.
	“It is the commuters who are inconvenienced by this law. The buses have to crawl behind smaller vehicles and this consumes more time,” he said.
	Nearly 13,000 buses enter the City daily, many of them are fined by the police under the recently enforced laws.
	Mr. Wijeratne said buses should be given more prominence on the road as it was a service that was provided to the people.
	He said the Police tested new traffic rules occasionally and the most affected were the buses and the commuters who travel in them.
	“If the police does not withdraw the regulations soon we will take legal action,” Mr. Wijeratne stated. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
