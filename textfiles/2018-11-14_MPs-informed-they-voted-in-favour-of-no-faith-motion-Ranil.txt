UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said voice vote was taken by the Speaker on the No Confidence Motion submitted in Parliament against the Government and that 122 MPs informed the Speaker that they voted in favour of it.

He told media that the NCM passed in Parliament with a majority could not be challenged and added that if anyone wanted to challenge the Speaker’s decision, they could move a resolution challenging his decision tomorrow.

“If they move a resolution challenging Speaker’s decision, we can put it to vote and defeat it. We can even pass another resolution saying that Speaker’s ruling is correct,” he said.

He said it was incorrect to say Parliament broke up without a decision and added that it was a breach of Parliament Powers and Privileges.

“When Parliament takes a decision, it should be recorded,” he said.
