Rough seas and heavy showers which may go up to 100mm are expected in the coming days as a result of a low level disturbance developed in the Bay of Bengal, the Disaster Management Centre said today.

Thunder showers that may go up to 100mm were predicted in the sea area off the coast extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Colombo, Galle, Hambantota and Batticloa. Seas were expected to be rough due to increase of wind speed up to 60-70kmph.

Thunder showers were expected in the Western, North Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North Central Provinces. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall was reported in many areas in the island last morning with the highest rainfall of 118.6mm recording from Kurunegala while Yatiyantota received a rainfall of 88mm, Kalutara 77.1mm, Anuradhapura 66.3mm and Colomobo 20mm.
