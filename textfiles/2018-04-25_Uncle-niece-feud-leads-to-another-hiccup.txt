Uncle-niece feud leads to another hiccup


	



 

A big row had broken out within the Pohottuwa party over the recent election of the chair for the major council in the gem city. 

 


Pohottuwa had returned the highest number to the council falling short of the necessary majority and its leaders had initially decided to take the chair of the council with the support of the Blue party members as the party had returned a majority to the council.


However, the Pohottuwa lady ruling the roost in the gem city district doing a secret maneuver had got a party candidate elected the chair with the support of the Greens offering the deputy chair to a Green in return for their support. And this had triggered fireworks in the Pohottuwa party.


The breach of the initial agreement to win the chair with the support of Blues has been attributed to the protracted feud between the lady and her Uncle John, they say.


The other Diyawanna members representing Pohottuwa in the district were soon up in arms and informed the Pohottuwa Chief, the former strongman that they would no longer acknowledge the firebrand-lady’s district leadership. 


The former strongman had later sent for the lady and given her a tongue-lashing.


Now that the lady has fallen from grace of the party leadership, the mantle of the district leadership falling on Uncle John, a foregone conclusion, is a matter of course, they say.
