Union Assurance launches CSR brand

A brand designed to raise awareness on the various health issues that are plaguing our nation has been launched as part of Union Assurance Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
The brand, entitled 'Union Manushyathwaya,' was launched on December 2 with the ultimate aim of creating healthy and happy communities around the country. The company achieves this objective by disseminating vital information to the public regarding how to protect themselves from diseases such as Thalassemia, Dengue, and Diabetes.
Accordingly, the company has arranged a series of diabetes camps to be conducted in Colombo, Jaffna, Vavunia, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Kandy, Batticoloa, and Matara between December 7 to 14. An island-wide leaflet distribution campaign will also be conducted during this period to raise awareness regarding Thalassemia and Dengue.
"We have already received an enormous amount of support for our CSR initiatives from the communities we interact with. We intend to further expand our efforts under a unifying name and logo, which clearly expresses our intent and end goal," stated Director and Chief Executive Officer of Union Assurance, Dirk Pereira. Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni, Chief Medical Officer of Health, of the Public Health Department of the Colombo Municipal Council added, "with the expansion of society and its increasing complexity, we have been able to observe many diseases spreading more rapidly than ever before. However, with proper information many of these diseases can be prevented. We appreciate the efforts that Union Assurance has taken to bring this vital information to the public."
"The best way to avoid Thalassemia is to raise awareness. We have been receiving the support of Union Assurance to spread information and awareness about this disease for quite some time now. I believe that under the new banner of 'Union Manushyathwaya,, these efforts will expand and continue to make a positive impact on communities," Dr. Nilam, Child Specialist of the National Thalassemia Centre, contributed.
Union Assurance Life's expressed goal of creating healthier and secure communities is in line with their overall ethos of building partnerships with their customers that is based on the delivery of transparency, respectfulness, and convenience.
