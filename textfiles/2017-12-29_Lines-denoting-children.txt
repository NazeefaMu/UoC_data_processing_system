Lines denoting children


	



 

Vertical lines immediately above the Marriage or Affection line or lines are lines of Children.
They are also called lines of progeny.

 

Hardly visible
The lines of Children are so thin and faint they are hardly visible to the naked eye. In many cases, it is necessary to use a magnifying glass to discern them. However, often one may see the lines of Children deeply marked in women’s hands.

 

Different types of lines and what they denote
Broad and deep lines of Children indicate sons and weak and thin lines daughters.


Straight lines denote strong and healthy children and faint and crooked lines children in delicate health. A broken line means the death of a child.


If one line stands out clear and distinct among other lines, the child indicated would be more successful in life than others.

 

Undeveloped Mount of Venus indicates childlessness
A person with an undeveloped Mount of Venus is not likely to have children. This indication is confirmed if the first bracelet is found rising up like an arch towards the palm.
