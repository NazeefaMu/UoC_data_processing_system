The strike launched by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Unions Collective was only called off temporary and would be launched again if the Government attempted to sell the CPC resources under-hand, CPC Trade Unions’ Collective said today.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror the CPC TU Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna said the strike was only temporary called off after the Prime Minister’s written assurance stating the Government would not go for any agreement with India regarding the oil tanks without consulting the CPC TUs.

However, he said that the trade union action had made the Government kneel down and reverse their stance on selling the CPC resources.

He said due to the strike the Government witnessed the CPC unions’ power and though the TU action was stopped the TUs would stay alert observing Government’s moves on the oil tank farm and other State resources.

He said that due to the circumstances they had learnt the value of alliance with other State and Non State trade unions and to expand their power to rise in a stronger manner in such situations.

HE said he had discussed with the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) and other several organisations.

He said if the Government broke the word it would face more consequences.

He said the public backed them in their struggle and the union action made them to be aware on the coup to sell not only the CPC, but also the other resources as well. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
