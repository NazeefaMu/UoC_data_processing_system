Sinharaja is Sri Lanka’s flagship for conservation of rainforests and it is the only National Wilderness Heritage area that receives the highest level of legal protection under Sri Lankan conservation laws. Despite its significance, Sinharaja forest is increasingly threatened by potential developments and calamities that occur naturally, triggered by anthropogenic activities.  

 
 It is in this regard that Environmental Foundation Ltd. (EFL) is publishing a book on the “Review of the Southern Border of Sinharaja; Contemporary needs against conservation.” The book will be launched on 7 December 2018 at the British Council Library from 6.30pm onwards. This book elaborates a study conducted to assess the present status of Sinharaja, the gaps in conservation and current practices with emphasis on utilising Sustainable Forest Management as a means of addressing the underlying threats posed to the southern border of Sinharaja.

 The publication on the southern border of Sinharaja forest aims at rekindling the intrinsic conservation values of the readers and stimulate discussions on conservation. As the passion for conservation emanates from an understating of the core benefits embraced by pristine rainforests such as Sinharaja, this publication seeks to create awareness which would trigger effective conservation.   


 The event will be graced by Mr. Anura Sathurusinghe, the Conservator General of Forest while the guest speaker for the evening will be Prof. Savithri Gunatilleke, a renowned Sinharaja conservationist.   


 The event is open to the public and entrance will be free of charge. The public is requested to RSVP by 5 December 2018 to mail@efl.lk
