D.V. Upul allowed to leave country

UPFA Southern Provincial Council Minister D.V. Upul who allegedly made threatening remarks to Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) officers was yesterday allowed to leave the country by the Colombo Chief Magistrate until the next Court hearing date.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya, the counsel who appeared for the suspect made a request that his client be permitted to leave the country.
Accordingly, he was permitted to leave the country until November 12. The case was also fixed for the same date.
At a previous occasion, the Court issued an order on the Controller of the Immigration and Emigration to prevent Upul leaving the country.
Addressing a public gathering on May 31, he had allegedly threatened to stone to death FCID officers once Mahinda Rajapaksa returned to power as the Prime Minister.
The CID launched an investigation into the statement made by Upul.
The Provincial Council minister made this remark in the presence of UPFA parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and several other politicians representing the Hambantota district. "Collect the name-list of FCID officers from the police constable to the DIG. They should be stoned to death when Mahinda Rajapaksa becomes Prime Minister. We are waiting till that day arrives. If someone in the government opposes that, we will take to the streets against the government," Upul told the gathering.
