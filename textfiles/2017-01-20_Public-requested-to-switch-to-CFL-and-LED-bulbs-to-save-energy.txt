The CEB was considering to remove the use of incandescent bulbs in a move to save energy and introduce CFL and LED bulbs, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda said yesterday.

He explained that incandescent bulbs wasted around 95 per cent of electricity that was supplied.

The CEB had requested consumers to replace any incandescent bulbs used by them with energy saving CFL and LED bulbs in order to save energy.

“About 20 percent of the population still uses incandescent bulbs which they have got used to. A majority of the people however is conscious of the environmental and energy costs and have already shifted to CFL and LED bulbs,” he noted.

Mr. Batagoda requested the people to stop using those incandescent bulbs at least for the next three months and to support the CEB to manage the electricity supply while the drought continues.

The CEB is hoping to buy one million LED and CFL bulbs and to distribute them free of charge to the people.

He also advised urban councils (UC) to switch on street lamps half an hour later than the usual time of illumination which is 6 pm in a bid to save electricity due to the prevailing drought.

Meanwhile it was announced that President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the CEB not to cut power even if the drought continues and water levels reduce to dangerous levels, Mr. Batagoda said.

He said they had made arrangements to purchase electricity from private suppliers in order to meet the additional power requirements of the country.

Addressing the media at the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda noted yesterday that electricity was being wasted as a result of street lamps being turned on earlier that necessary in many areas of the country.

He therefore requested urban councils to switch on street lamps only at 6.30 p.m and to ensure that they are switched off by 5.30 the following morning. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
