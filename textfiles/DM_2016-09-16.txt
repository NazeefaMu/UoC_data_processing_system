CEB looking to recover Rs.3bn of missing EPF funds
	
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said yesterday that they were looking for the possibility of filing a civil case over the incident in which Rs. 3 billion from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) belonging to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was misplaced.
The Minister earlier made a complaint to the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) as well over the alleged misappropriation of EPF funds belonging to the State institution.
Speaking at a news conference, Minister Siyambalapitiya said they had consulted the Attorney General (AG) and were awaiting his instructions in order to file a civil case to recover the missing funds.
The AG had asked the ministry to provide more documents in order to proceed with the case. We have already launched an internal investigation while the Ministry of Labour has also launched their own investigation in this regard, he said.
Commenting on the latest decision to put a stop to Sampur Coal Power Plant Project, he said the decision was only limited to the cancellation of a Coal Power Plant in Sampur and that a panel was still considering the possibility of creating a power plant using another power source.

'Entire health sector should be exempted from VAT'
	
In response to the amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT) which was announced by the government on Wednesday, a leading consumer rights group yesterday said the entire health sector should be exempted from VAT.
In a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena , the National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection said the entire health sector should be exempted in order to ease the tax burden of the people.
The amount of funds which the state spends for health could be reduced if the private sector health services are provided at an affordable price", the letter signed by National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection President Ranjith Withanage said.
We wonder as to whether you have also become helpless just like the poor patients despite being the President of this country, the letter added.
Meanwhile, Mr. Withanage when contacted by the Daily Mirror said the exemption of OPD charges, laboratory charges and dialysis charges from VAT is hardly sufficient as medicines and other equipment such as injections are often have to be purchased from the private sector even if a patient seek treatment from a state hospital.
Further Mr. Withanage called the statement made by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne on Wednesday that hospital and surgery charges will be regulated is a pledge which is not going to be kept.
The Minister has been saying this for some time but no concrete steps are taken to implement it, he added. (Yohan Perera)

No big change in amended VAT Bill: JVP
	
The amended VAT Bill which the Government assured was being prepared with the people's well-being in mind is almost similar to the Bill introduced some months ago, with the only difference being the few changes made to mitigate protests by traders, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP Propaganda Secretary and MP Vijitha Herath said the Government had not removed the VAT imposed on essential commodities, on healthcare and telecommunication despite mounting protests from all quarters other than to cater to the demands of the business community.
Even though the SLFP ministers claimed that the new Bill includes their proposals, they do not appear to have objected to the VAT imposed on essential goods and services. They have also been a part of the Cabinet which approved amended VAT Bill. We urge the SLFP ministers and MPs to vote against this Bill in parliament to prove they had objected to it, he said.
Mr. Herath said milk powder and air tickets had also been subjected to VAT while the VAT imposed on telecommunication remained the same.
He said the Government had blatantly broken its pledge to reduce indirect taxation and increase direct taxation to reduce the burden on the people.
Mr. Herath said the reason behind the VAT increase was to carry out the assurance given to the International Monitory Fund (IMF) to increase state revenue through taxation so as to fulfil the terms and condition of the IMF loan the Government hoped to obtain.
The new Government's economic policy is also a non-starter and in a mess just as that of the previous government. It has no alternative to solve the economic crisis faced by this country other than to impose tax, reduce concessions and obtain loans, he said.
Mr. Herath said the Government must formulate a mechanism to pay back the tax revenue collected from the people through the VAT increase before the Supreme Court stops it.
We are opposed to the new VAT Bill and we will vote against it in parliament, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would undertake an official three-day visit to New Zealand in early October, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key has announced today.
A press release issued by the New Zealand Government said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will visit New Zealand from 1-3 October.
Prime Minister Key said he was very pleased to welcome Mr. Wickremesinghe to New Zealand. This will be the first time a Sri Lankan Prime Minister has undertaken a bilateral visit to New Zealand, and is an important step in the growing relationship between our two countries, he said.
When I visited Sri Lanka in February, I was struck by the range of exciting opportunities for New Zealand, and an increasing number of New Zealand businesses are recognising this potential.
Under Prime Minister Wickremesinghes leadership, Sri Lanka has entered a new phase in its post-civil war development. New Zealand is keen to support the important steps the country is making towards reconciliation and rebuilding through increased political and economic contact.

PM wants to determine if political hand behind disappearance of youth
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has ordered the intelligence unit to determine whether any political group is behind the disappearance of the youth in Bandagiriya, Hambantota.
Sources close to the Prime Minister said he had told IGP Pujitha Jayasundara to direct the intelligence officers to carry out an investigation to determine whether any political force was behind the disappearance.
The premier and the government are reported to be of the opinion that the disappearance has been organized to put the government in difficultly prior to the UN General Assembly sessions. President Sirisena is expected to address the sessions in New York.
Further the premier had told the IGP that the police had to take the responsibility if the Hambantota incident created an adverse situation for Sri Lanka at the UN sessions.
In addition he had questioned the IGP as to why the police had taken one week to apprehend the suspects.
The youth was found at a Temple in Dikwella yesterday. (Yohan Perera)

PM was a puppet in previous regime: SLFP
	
SLFP Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said yesterday that it was the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who governed the country using executive powers sidelining the premier and going against democratic values.
He made these remarks in response to a statement made by former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa that the country should be governed either by the President or the Prime Minister without contradicting each other.
Addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters, the Minister said the prime minister of the previous governments had been kept as a puppet by the executive president.
It was the Executive which dominated the country though the sovereignty of the government must be based on the executive, legislation and the judiciary. These three branches of governance should work together and equally, the Minister said.
He said the three branches of sovereignty operate independently under the Yahapalanaya government today.
Therefore, the country is now stable politically, economically and internationally. Our country is now being recognized by the international community. The international respect is not for President Sirisena, but for the policies of the state, conventionalism and the democratic agenda, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

During the ongoing session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances noted that positive steps had been taken in Sri Lanka in relation to the right to truth for past disappearances; but that there was much still to be done, especially when it comes to accountability and bringing perpetrators to justice."
The Working Group made these observations in relation to their visit to Sri Lanka. The Working Group also presented its reports on Sri Lanka, Peru and Turkey, and the follow-up reports to the recommendations made upon past visits to Congo and Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Ravinatha P. Ariyasinghe said the country was pleased that the Working Group, in its Report, had appreciated the openness and cooperative disposition of the officials.
The Government considers its engagement with this Working Group as an important component of the reconciliation efforts in the country, he said in statement to the UNHRC.
"As stated in the Report of the Working Group, the Government has embarked on a comprehensive public policy based on a participatory framework with the objective of ensuring the right to truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non- recurrence. In this regard, the Government has already taken concrete legislative and policy measures to translate its promises to the people of Sri Lanka, into action even amidst the many challenges being posed by certain extreme elements who attempt to pose obstacles to the Governments sincere efforts at ensuring that the rights of all persons are promoted and protected and recurrence of violations that happened in the past are prevented, he said.

SL to continue issuing on-arrival visas to Bangladeshis
	
The Sri Lankan Government has assured it would continue issuing on-arrival visas to Bangladesh citizens, Star Online reported on Thursday.
Necessary instruction has been given to withdraw the landing endorsements immediately, Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva said.
In an interview with BBC, Dr. de Silva said the Sri Lankan Government has not taken any decision to scrap the on-arrival visa facility for Bangladeshi nationals.
He told the BBC that the Immigration Department Chief had on his own decided to scrap the on-arrival visas, but this decision had been withdrawn.
Diplomatic sources in Dhaka and Colombo confirmed that Colombo confirmed its decision to continue with the on-arrival visas as otherwise it would damage the islands tourism industry, which is recovering from the 37 years of armed conflict.
They said an official notice is expected to be issued soon confirmed that the on-arrival visa facility would continue.
There was no comment available from the Bangladesh Government.
In an abrupt move, Sri Lanka stopped issuing visas on arrival for Bangladeshis on September 7 without informing the Bangladesh government.
Visa on arrival facilities between the two countries began in 1980 following a bilateral agreement.
Expressing dissatisfaction over Sri Lankans unilateral decision to stop issuing of visas on-arrival facility for Bangladeshis, Dhaka has asked Colombo for a clarification for the reason behind the action.
Bangladesh has also retaliated by stopping similar facilities for Sri Lankans from last week.
Earlier, Additional Foreign Secretary (Bilateral and Consular) Kamrul Ahsan called Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Dhaka Yasoja Gunasekera on September 11 at his office to know the reason behind the stopping of the visa on arrival facility for Bangladeshi citizens from the Sri Lankan side.
Kamrul also asked for a clarification from Colombo regarding its decision.
However, the Sri Lankan envoy expressed his ignorance about the governments sudden decision and she reportedly told the Additional Foreign Secretary that she herself did not know the development.
She informed that she would inform the Bangladesh foreign ministry once she knows the reason after consulting with officials in Colombo.
However, the Bangladeshi foreign ministry sources said they heard this but was yet to receive any formal letter in this regard.

Special commodity levy on imported sugar increased
	
The Special Commodity Levy on imported white sugar has been increased to Rs 2.00 per kilogram and Rs 15 per kilogram on raw sugar with effect from midnight yesterday, the Finance Ministry announced.
The decision was taken as the locally produced raw sugar is coming to the market these days. 
Sri Lanka produces around 50,000 MT of raw (Brown) sugar annually which is less than 10 percent of the annual brown sugar need, the Ministry said in a statement.
It said even though the levy on imported sugar was increased there was no escalation in the selling price of sugar.
On the recommendation of the Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living the government had introduced maximum retail price for 16 essential items inclusive of sugar. Accordingly the maximum selling price of 1 kg of white sugar will continue to be Rs 95.00, the statement said.
