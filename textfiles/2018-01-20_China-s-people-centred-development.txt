China’s people-centred development


	



 

The Communist Party of China (CPC) has met every five years since 1921 to hold its National Congress. The party which commenced with fifty members is has a membership of 89 million today. Now its has 4.5 million party branches throughout China. In other words, it has become the world’s greatest political party.   


 At this party congress they evaluate the quantum of work done during the last five years and then elect new leaders of the party for next five years. New leaders will deliver the programme of work they will carry forward during the next five years.   


The 19th party congress was held at Beijing commencing on October 18, 2017. At this congress, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave an analytical description of work done during the last five years. China’s economy has been transitioning from medium to high-speed growth in the last five years. The average annual GDP growth rate from 2013 to 2016 was 7.2%, higher than the average rate 2.6% of the world economy and 4% of other developing countries. China’s total GDP of 73.7 trillion yuan (USD 11.2 trillion) in 2016 accounted for 14.8% of the world economy. It is obvious that China has passed very successful five years. The initiatives taken since 2012, especially the economic reforms, the Chinese dreams, the Belt and Road initiative and anti-corruption campaign account for the rapid development.

 At this congress, Xi Jinping was re-elected as the General Secretary of CPC. Also, this congress accepted his position as equivalent to the position held by Chinese great leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. He then laid down CPC future vision and programmes till 2050. The new theme has been branded as ‘Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a new era.’ The base for this new conception is Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong thoughts, Deng Xiaoping theories as well as Xi Jinping’s thoughts. CPC’s aim is to arrive at this target in 30 years and they laid different steps to achieve this.   


The first step is to turn China into a Moderately Prosperous Society in all aspects by 2020 (Xiaokang in Chinese). China has planned to eradicate poverty completely by 2020. CPC will celebrate his 100-year anniversary in 2021. They have eliminated nearly 800 million people from poverty during the last four decades. During Xi Jinping’s last five years, they have managed to eliminate poverty among 100 million people. The balance of some 50 million will be eliminated from poverty in 2020. This will be a landmark achievement of great China.   


Their aim is to establish a modern socialist country by 2050 and to convert China into a prosperous, strong, culturally-advanced, harmonious and beautiful country. Xi Jinping said at the collective study session of the CPC central committee political bureau in Beijing on December 8, 2017, “At the present stage, the basic feature of China’s economic development is the transition from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development.” According to CPC’s new vision, after 2020, every Chinese product should be eco-friendly and of high-quality. Human resources of the country should also be developed. Fiscal control should be brought to a sound level.All provinces of China should be equally developed. China will accelerate introducing innovations to the world. In the past, China has introduced many innovations to the world. Gunpowder, paper, printing and compasses are few of them. How China developed its speed train service during the last ten years stands testimony to this. Today, the most advanced high-speed train service is found in China. More than 24,000 kilometres are served by this train that travels at a speed of 300-350kmph. In America, a high-speed train could reach only 170kmph. President Xi Jinping pointed out in his report delivered to the 19th National Congress of the CPC that innovation was the primary force driving development and the strategic underpinning for building a modernised economy. Very recently, Mr. Yang Yuanqing, CEO of Lenovo said, “unlike in the past, China is no longer just a factory for the world, but makes as important contribution to global innovation.”  


Xi Jinping who rose to power in 2012 has managed to create much discipline in the country. Even at the 19th congress, he stressed the importance of creating discipline within the party and the country. He said corruption was a great hindrance for development. He insisted government servants to investigate the instances of misusing State funds. Some 240 high-ranking officials and about a million of ordinary officials have been investigated for corruption charges since 2012.   


For the first time in June, the CPC completed inspections within a five-year administrative term, covering CPC organisations in provincial level, Central CPC and government organs, major State-owned enterprises, central financial institutions and universities.   Today, China speaks of the wellbeing of other friendly nations.The ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative put forward by Xi Jinping in 2013 is a good example of this. Significant infrastructure development will take place in countries that come under this plan. It will make the economies of these countries stronger and with that in mind China has created the Silk Road Fund and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.China has expanded freight train services to Europe under the One Belt One Road concept. As a result, Chinese goods arrive at European markets quickly and vice versa. 


I would like to remind our former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar’s statement about Sri Lanka-China bilateral ties. He said, “When a relationship is based on mutual respect and affection, the size, importance and power of one of the two countries in that relationship does not have a disproportionate influence on the other. China has never sought to influence the domestic politics of Sri Lanka. Over the years, China has proved to be benign and sincere with no ulterior motives for befriending Sri Lanka. She has never tried to dominate undermine or destabilise Sri Lanka.”  


The leaders of China who assumed office after the People’s Republic of China was created in 1949 formulated their policies for the well-being of their people. They will definitely eradicate poverty by 2020. This is a message given to the entire world where poverty is rampant. By 2050, they have formulated policies to make every Chinese a happy and a content man. In 2049, they will celebrate the centenary of the creation of the People’s Republic of China. By then, the people of China would be one of the prosperous persons living in this world.
