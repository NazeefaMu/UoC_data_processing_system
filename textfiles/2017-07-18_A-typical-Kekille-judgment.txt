A departmental vehicle in which an audit officer had been travelling on duty had been damaged when another vehicle rammed it from behind. To his shock and dismay, the officer had later been ordered to pay for the damage caused to the vehicle, they say.

 


This audit officer with an illustrious service record in the department had been the assigned the vehicle with a driver and the accident occurred while on official travel, they say.


When there was the possibility of claiming compensation from insurance for the damage caused, some high-up had ruled that the officer should pay up the estimated cost of effecting the repairs.
The sympathetic departmental employees say: “This is a typical ‘Kekille’ judgment!”
