World's first washable smartphone to debut in Japan

 
JAPAN: Tired of those unsightly smudges and other dirt on your bacteria-laden smartphone?
A Japanese firm says it has the solution with what it describes the world's first smartphone that can be washed with soap and water.
Waterproof smartphones have been on the market for a while. But telecom company KDDI says its new "Digno rafre" phone -- to be launched in Japan next week -- is the only one that can withstand a soapy bath.
"Our development team washed the smartphone more than 700 times to test its durability," a company spokesman told AFP.
An online commercial aimed at proving its credentials features a child dropping the phone onto a plate of food topped with ketchup.
His mother assures her shocked family that those red globs are nothing to worry about as she soaps up the phone under a running tap. The 21,600 yen ($175) gadget is mainly aimed at parents who want to keep their smartphones clean for their small children, a KDDI spokesman said.
But he also cautioned that only certain types of foamy soap could be used on the device, which will only be sold in Japan for now. - AFP
