Finance Ministry angers MS?


	

President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to be perturbed over the Finance Ministry allegedly placing conditions for the allocation he sought for development work in the Polonnaruwa district.
The President submitted a Cabinet paper seeking financial allocations to execute the development projects in the district.
However, it is learnt that the Finance Ministry has reportedly made some reservations about the President's paper. In its observations, the Ministry has even asked for tender procedure to be followed in carrying out work in the district.
The President, apparently angered over the Ministry, conveyed his displeasure at the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
Referring to the award of contract to construct the first phase of the central expressway without calling for tenders, the President sarcastically asked for permission from the Ministry for his work in the same fashion, it is learnt. (Kelum Bandara)
