The Ministry of Defense did not decide to write off Rs 200 million out of the total of Rs. 853 million which the Avant Garde Company owed Rakna Lanka (which is owned by the ministry), State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene told Parliament yesterday.

Mr Wijewardene made this remark in response to an allegation made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake to this effect during the oral question session last morning.

“My ministry has not decided to write off any amount owed by the Avant Garde Company at any point,” Mr Wijewardene said while assuring that he will submit all details on the matter to Parliament soon.

Furthermore, the State Minister said security was being provided to all ships travelling through Sri Lankan waters by the Sri Lanka Navy. “These services are performed brilliantly by the Sri Lankan Navy,” he added.

He said the revenue generated by this service was credited to the government coffers by the Sri Lanka Navy. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
