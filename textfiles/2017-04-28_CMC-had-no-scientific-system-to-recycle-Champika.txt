Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) did not have a scientific methodology for garbage recycling.

He told parliament that the CMC had some 70 officials who were qualified enough to provide technical assistance on garbage recycling.

The minister said the Meethotamulla catastrophe had occurred because of several reasons including the continuous dumping of garbage in the area without any scientific methodology and the instability of the ecosystem by way of floods.

He said steps would be taken to stabilise the Meethotamulla garbage dump during the next six months so that there would be no reason to fear any further collapse.

He said there was a need to set up scientific waste management plants in the country such as the one in Dompe and requested all stakeholders to support these moves. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
