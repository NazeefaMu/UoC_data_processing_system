North Central Provincial Council UPFA member Peshala Jayaratne was sworn in as the new Chief Minister of the Province, a short while ago.
He was the former provincial council minister of Food, Cooperative, Industries and Rural Development.
Mr. Jayaratne was earlier removed from his ministerial portfolios by former Chief Minister Ranjith Samarakoon.
It was reported that Mr. Jayaratne had been sacked because of his close relationship with then common candidate Maithripala Sirisena. (Athula Bandara)
