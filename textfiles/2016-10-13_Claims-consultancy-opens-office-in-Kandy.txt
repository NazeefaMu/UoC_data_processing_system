Claims consultancy opens office in Kandy


	

An insurance claims consultancy service office is now opened in Kandy as a measure that fills a large gap in the services provided by insurance companies, brokers and insurance agents to the insuring public. 
Policyholders receive a prompt service prior to the issue of the insurance policy. However, when a claim arises, many policyholders have a difficulty in properly presenting claims to their insurance companies and obtaining settlement. 
Most insurance claims involve technical issues and the claimants encounter difficulties in submitting their claims to their insurance companies. As a result, many valid claims are rejected and in some cases legitimate claims are reduced and the claimant does not receive a full indemnity.
A team of highly qualified insurance professionals, engineers and lawyers, who can advise the claimants and assist them to obtain their rightful entitlement under their policies, is employed.
The office is managed by Hilmy Sulaiman, who counts over 50 years of experience in insurance both in Sri Lanka and abroad.
To date, such a professional insurance claims consultancy has not been in operation in Sri Lanka. Sulaiman believes that through these services, he and his team provide a social service to the policyholders who need such assistance, especially those aggrieved and who have been aggrieving.
