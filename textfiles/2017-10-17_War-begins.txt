A gun-toting sidekick of a provincial political high-up is reportedly terrorizing the latter’s political opponents in the area, they say.

 


The firearm being used by the sidekick is a weapon issued to the provincial high-up for his personal security and the sidekick had brandished it to strike fear into a group of supporters of the chief organizer of a main political party in the area recently appointed to replace his ‘master’.


The provincial political high-up, now an aggressive member of a splinter group was removed from his chief organizer post recently.
