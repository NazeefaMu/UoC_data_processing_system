I am exhausted: EC Chairman


	

Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said on Thursday he was extremely tired with all the work he had to do with the local governments elections and would prefer to handover his duties to someone else even for a month.

While referring to the continuous procedure of elections, Mr. Deshapriya told a news conference that he had felt that the time had arrived to get rid of these things.

“It is better if I can get a vacation from these proceedings at least for one month by handing over this position for someone else. The provisions in the Constitution do allow for it. I will consider it after completion of the procedures with regard to the gazette notification to decide the members of the council,” he said.

“There is no other reason, I am exhausted,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
