While claiming that the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary can’t find a solution to the prevailing political impasse, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma said it was only the people who could bring to an end this crisis by way of a General Election.

Addressing a news briefing, he said these three pillars of democracy had failed to end this crisis which had almost reached its climax.

“The prevailing political crisis has become worse and none of these three have been able to sort this out. The only option left is to go for a general election and let people elect their representatives,” MP Alahapperuma said.

“The UNP is saying that the solution to resolve this crisis is to have a presidential election. The presidential election won’t become an effective method whatsoever to end this political turmoil. It would only make it worse,” MP Alahapperuma added.

He further said that the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary comprise of 1, 225 and 335 members respectively whereas there are nearly 16 million people who have the franchise.

“Therefore, it is apparent that people should be given the opportunity by way of a general election to resolve this crisis by which the country can start a new political chapter,” he added.

Meanwhile, he said the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) had no moral rights to be in the Opposition in Parliament because they voted in favour of the motion of confidence presented in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.

“The TNA should forgo their post in the Opposition if this Parliament is to continue any further,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
