Police SC maintains recently found form

Police Sports Club beat CH and FC by 29 points to 17 in their Dialog League inter-club rugby match played at Police Park yesterday.
The law-enforcing team, who led 10-7 at lemons, collected their points from two goals and three tries while CH scored two goals and a penalty. The Maitland Crescent club team put up an improved performance in the return leg, compared to the 0-62 thrashing they suffered against the same team in the first round.
The first half was evenly contested with Police taking only a close three-point lead at the short whistle. But Police cut loose in the second half to add 19 more points. The winners scored five tries and two of them were converted by Riza Raseideen.
Joining the Police try feast were Chula Susantha, Joel Perera, Udara Chanaka, Mohammed Sheriff and Sudam Suriarachchi. The two CH tries were scored by Gemunu Hettinayake and Mohammed Rizwan. Janith Chandimal converted one of those tries while Sajith Bandara put over a penalty.
Thus, the high-riding Police SC maintained their superb form in recent matches, following their exciting wins over Army SC (47-45) and much fancied Navy SC (16-11) in successive weekends. Sheriff has played a significant role towards Police SC's recent success with some dynamic moves, irrespective of the position he plays.
He scored a try in yesterday's encounter as well while their forwards combined effectively with the back division to edge out CH.
