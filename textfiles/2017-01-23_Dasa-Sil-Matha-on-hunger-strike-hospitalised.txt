The Dasa Sil Matha who began a hunger strike on Sunday (22) was admitted to the Kandy General Hospital this evening due to being in a critical condition.

She had sat in front of the historic Dalada Maligawa in Kandy and embarked on a hunger strike alleging that the present government was trying to divide the country by amending the Constitution.

She has opted to remain anonymous and says she will continue to protest against the high-handed actions of the government. (L.B. Senarathne)
