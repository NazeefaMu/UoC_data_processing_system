Ambitious niece suffers a setback again


	



 

JO’s big guns in the City of Gems recently participated in a powwow held to work out their roadmap to win all elections round the corner.

 


Talks were proceeding smoothly when a remark made by a prominent lady from the area made a sudden diversion. The veiled remark the lady made clearly conveyed the message that the JO needed a district leader to direct the party activity and she was the ideal person to fill the bill. 


However, the other JO Diyawanna members from the district immediately took exception to the idea.

They said in one voice that John the Silent who was making a consistent effort to unite the Blue party deserved the district leadership and this chair should be kept vacant for him. Finding there were no takers for her veiled suggestion, the lady deftly changed the subject.
