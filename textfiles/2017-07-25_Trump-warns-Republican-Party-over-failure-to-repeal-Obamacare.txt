Washington, (Daily Mail), 24 July 2017 -  President Donald Trump has threatened Republicans over their failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.   


‘If Republicans don’t Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!’ he tweeted on Sunday.   


Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, is making a last-gasp effort to resuscitate the legislation after Trump insisted that senators not leave town for their August recess without passing a health bill.The process to repeal the healthcare law put into place by former President Barack Obama has proved harder than originally thought to undo.   


So far, at least three Republican senators have announced their intention to vote against a bill that would fully repeal the Affordable Care Act and a bill to repeal and replace parts of Obamacare - losing the GOP the majority they need.
