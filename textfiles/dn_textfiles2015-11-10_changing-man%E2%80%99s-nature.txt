Changing man’s nature

In the past, deceitful political leaders misled people with lies and omissions. They used manipulative behaviours to achieve their personal goals. The Buddha advised his followers: “You should not accept my words without examining them out of respect and regard for me”.
The Buddha taught us to observe: the course of wisdom (pragna) and practice compassion (karuna); to be conscious of the fact that we are subject to old age, decay, impermanence, sickness and death; that out of ignorance and pride we ridicule the unfortunate, the poor the sick, old or dead; that we should not look down upon the ill-fated ones or laugh at the man who is limping on the road because he has reaped what he had sawn – the effects of his own action in this birth or previously -the Karma. Karma literally means all that “thought, word, and deed”. The Buddha explained “I declare, that volitions is karma”.
The Buddha also preached “Karma is action. Vipaka - fruit or result is its reaction”. It is mentioned in Sanyutta Nikaya “According to the seed that is sown. So is the fruit you reap there from, Doer of good will gather good. Doer of evil, evil reaps. Down is the seed and thou shalt taste the fruit there of.” Accordingly, our own acts, good or bad, bear their own results.
The Buddha preached we should guide our lives righteously and earn our living virtuously to improve our life styles. We should also understand the pain of our fellowmen and empathize because Karma is a law in itself. We Sri Lankans have become so avaricious and it has no limits. It is a pity the majority, whether they are educated or not, they act blindly for selfish gain having totally disregarded religious, cultural, ethical and human values.
Karaniya Metta Sutta
We should also have no misgiving to treat everybody alike with respect and civility. It would be good for our politicians to take that to heart. All are our own brothers and sisters. Buddhism and other religions too teach us kindness, equality, sharing, love, affection, sympathy, giving and most importantly to be humane in all our dealings. The Buddha in the Karaniya Metta Sutta taught that “Let none deceive another, despise any being in any state! Let none by anger or ill-will wish harm to another”. It also goes on to say “Let him cultivate the boundless good towards the entire world, free from ill-will or enmity”.
An email, a timely one, received from a friend when I was writing this article is reproduced below:
“An anthropologist proposed a game to the African tribal children. He place a basket of sweets and candies near a tree. And made them stand 100 metres away. And announced that whoever reaches first would get all the sweets in the basket. When he said ready steady go…… Do you know what these small children did? They all held each others’ hands and ran towards the tree together, divided the sweets among them and ate the sweet and enjoyed them. When the anthropologist asked them why did you do so? They said ‘Ubuntu’ which meant – ‘How can one be happy when all others are sad?’ Ubuntu in their language means – ‘I am, because we are!’ A message for all generations. Let all of us always carry this attitude within us and spread happiness, wherever we go … Let us have Ubuntu Life…I am because we are…”.
Nelson Mandela, the first Black President of South Africa made sure that everyone clearly knew his goal - to unify the country and to end apartheid rule. He was a man who was true to his words and dedicated to progression, equality and peace. President Maithripla Sirisena too having announced his mission to the people is facing resistance similarly in his effort to eradicating corruption and establishing good governance. President correctly took the leadership of the party and got all his party men on board his ship. President has assured in no uncertain terms that he will serve one term and that he has a mission to be accomplished in the interest of the country and its people.
President introduced the 19th Amendment because he was one person who believed that the executive presidency had been one of the root causes for the present predicament. We must appreciate that an institutional framework has now been put in place with truly ambitious plans to take the country forward for the benefit of the people. The creation of Executive Presidency and the 1978 Constitution was the brainchild of JRJ. He however announced several plans including the improvement of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte to be the administrative capital. It was unfortunate that such impressive plans had to be abandoned. The war which intensified gradually was the excuse.
Self-interested politicians
I was personally aware there were proposals made to the former President JRJ to abolish Executive Presidency in the interest of the country before he departed from politics. Unfortunately, there were other aspirants who did not wish to do so. They saw to it that presidency continued. This is a message for the present government too. Wheels within wheels.
My greatest fear is that if the present trend continues it will be disastrous again. In other words, should the general public abandon the civic responsibilities and let organized political gangs and other perpetrators overrun the system in the name of democracy for their personal gain. We now need competent, magnanimous leaders, with foresight and vision, who behave responsibly by their constituents. We have had enough of self-interested politicians. They had destroyed our beautiful country. We need fresh air to come alive. You cannot leave everything in the hands of unscrupulous politicians alone. George Bernard Shaw had said “He knows nothing and thinks he knows everything. That points clearly to a political career.” This no doubt applies to a majority of our Sri Lankan politicos.
We must therefore ensure freedom, rule of law, good governance, democracy and human rights to all Sri Lankans in order to restore the basic human values in them. We should go all-out to strengthen and rebuild a divided nation. Let the politicians not deceive the masses anymore by telling dishonesties and escape without telling the truth. Blind shortsighted hostile politics should be replaced with love, understanding, sincerity and push the country to successfully overcome:
* Misuse and abuse of political power
* Corruption, fraud and bad governance
* Violation of human rights
* Misuse of perks, benefits and privileges
* Failure to curb growing violence and criminal acts
* Poverty related issues
* Unemployment
* Reduce governments’ top heaviness
and excessive recurrent costs
* Inefficiency and poor service delivery
to the general public
Being a democracy, we should now allow the citizens to speak their minds and shape their own and their children’s future. We have experienced regime-sanctioned hooligans always losing their battle in the face popular democratic vote. It could be either politicians or bureaucrats “the will of the people” should be respected, honoured and strengthened. If not, we have the right as citizens to be critical and demand change.
Charles Dickens said “subdue your appetites, my dears, and you have conquered human nature”. Human beings are not essentially evil.
In the past, the rulers appreciated that it is far better to maintain moral values, the culture and the religion. However, we now live in a politically fragmented and a disconnected culture where - politics are dreadful, religion is hated, economy is exhausted. It is embarrassing that there is no broad consensus among political leaders that true reforms should be introduced.
Religious leaders
President in a speech therefore said people must give up the practice of being war-like. He added we should learn to be loving, friendly, courteous, respectful and become non-violent. The spirit of peace, kindness, charity and better understanding among all communities should be strengthened. We should also learn to go beyond the boundaries of castes, race and feed the hungry, spread love and affection, lift the down trodden and extend a helping hand without being selfish to those in need.
The Buddha preached us to follow the middle path and avoid the two extremes and had spelt out very clearly that the greed is the root cause of all problems. We need to cultivate and strengthen cooperation and greater understanding among all communities. In fact, there is a serious threat to our country unless we could unite as ONE NATION.
We should build up a forum for all religious leaders to work together in the interest of the country and its people. The Buddha preached “The way is not in the sky; the way is in the heart”. We should seek the support and assistance of the religious leaders to restore our lost and distorted humanity by inculcating habits such as:
a) Healing the wounds of war which lasted several decades
b) Removing the feeling of insecurity with your neighbour
c) Developing human values and virtues and
d) Guiding the political leadership to conform to the best practices in governance
Sri Lanka no doubt is going through a difficult time.
The past regime failed to achieve viable democratic aims to proclaim the “will of the people”, which should be the “basis of the authority of government”. As we know, nominal democracies that maintained the outward appearance alone have been changed by the voters at elections again and again. This is a lesson for the present government too.
I quote: “There is a need for financial reform along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an economic reform to benefit everyone.
This would nevertheless require a courageous change of attitude on the part of political leaders.” – Pope Francis. May I add we now need to learn from our past mistakes and not live in it!
