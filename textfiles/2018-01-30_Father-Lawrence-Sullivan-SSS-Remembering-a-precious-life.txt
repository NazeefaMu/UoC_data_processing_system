 Born 04th December 1925   
 Went Home to God 30th January 2018   
The Precious Gift, One gift, above all others  
God gives to us to treasure  
One that knows no time, no place  
And one gold cannot measure.  
The precious, poignant, tender gift
Of Memory --- that will keep  
Our dear ones ever in our hearts  
Although God gives them sleep.  
 It brings back long remembered things   
A song, a word, a smile  
And our world’s a better place  
- - - because  
We had him for a while!  

You are remembered with love, respect and gratitude today and always (KAREN)
