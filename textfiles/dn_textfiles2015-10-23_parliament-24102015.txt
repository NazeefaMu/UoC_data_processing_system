MR knew UNHRC would commence international inquiry on war crimes against Sri Lanka - Gayantha
Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Disna Mudalige
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa called for a Presidential election two years before the completion of his term as he was very well aware of the adverse situation the country would have to face, as he did not fulfill the pledges he made to the international community, said Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake. He made this observation in Parliament yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by the government side on Thursday on the UNHRC resolution.
The minister said the former President knew that the UNHRC would have commenced an international inquiry on war crimes against Sri Lanka as he had not kept the promises he made to the international community.
"This trick had been used by leaders of many countries unsuccessfully to point out that they were popular in the country and what they were doing was the right thing," Karunathilake said. "But as Sri Lanka is not an unfortunate country, the people changed the regime and elected President Maithripala Sirisena, and then a new government."
The minister said good governance was then set up, 19th amendment was introduced an the background was created for national reconciliation.
He added these developments were commended in Geneva.
"It is a victory of the government that we could co-sponsor a favourable resolution to Sri Lanka which would provide an opportunity to inquire allegations within our judiciary system with the support of the international community," Minister Karunathilake said.
He said it was Mahinda Rajapaksa as an opposition member on October 25, 1990 who said in Parliament he would go before the UNHCR against the UNP government and urge to inquire into allegations of human rights violation.
"Following the example of the teacher, the Tamil Diaspora and the people in the North went before the UNHCR," the minister said.
"On the other hand a hybrid court is not a new concept.
International assistance was gained at inquiries into the Kobbekaduwa murder, Lalith Athulathmudali murder and SWRD Bandaranaike murder."
He added that due to this situation, there are no reasons for unfounded fear.
People spread racism for their survival - Anura
JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday that various people spread racism for their political survival in the past and the end result was that the country had to suffer from a 30-year long war.
We still do not know the number of people dead and the exact cost spent on the war. Finally, the innocent people had to pay the price, but not by those who spread racism.
Participating in the debate on the Geneva based UNHRC report, MP Dissanayake said it was compulsory to promote harmony among all communities if the country wished to move forward and to do so, we have to accept the fact that they too have equal rights. A solution to the ethnic problem may be impossible unless the fundamental needs of the people in the North and East are fulfilled.
TNA hoped that India would solves this problem. But it did not happen. They commenced a large number of projects in the North and East such as renovation of the Northern Railway track, but not a single job was given to the youth in those regions.
They have also exploited the fish of our innocent fishermen in the North and East. Not only India, but also many Western Nations, including the US had not genuinely helped us to solve our problems. This is only a part of their political agenda. Today Jaffna has turned into a den of India's "RAW" spy service. They attempt to create political instability in Jaffna. We should put a stop to it.
It is a right of every citizen to know what exactly happened during the post conflict period. If we do not expose them, the rulers would continue to repeat such mistakes. We wish to to know what really happened to those who had been abducted during the time of the war. Lalith and Kugan were abducted. We still do not known what had happened to them.
OHCHR Report:
Mangala failed to counter false allegations - Dinesh
The government by accepting the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka had also admitted the false charges it contained, UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment debate, Gunawardena said that Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, had failed to counter the false allegations made in the report, adding that Samaraweera had no guts to speak against the report.
"When we were in the ruling party, our government always shielded the motherland from international pressure. This government fully surrendered to international pressure," he added.
Gunawardena further said the UNHRC Resolution violated the Constitution of the country, adding that it endangered the sovereignty of the country. He asked why the Government hesitated to table the Paranagama Commission report before the Geneva Resolution.
Joining in the debate, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Al-Hussein, had been unaware of the contents of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, when he presented the report.
"We do not fully embrace the report of the Prince. However, if we are to prove the charges in it, we must hold an inquiry. Why are you afraid of a domestic inquiry? The final resolution that came out was a watered down version.
The stand of the SLFP is that the probe should be carried out adhering to the Constitutional framework of the country. We would not approve anything beyond that limit," he commented.
Foreign embassies shedding crocodile tears for Tamil people - Devananda
Foreign embassies located in Colombo did not attend to the grievances of the Tamil people when the LTTE was in function, said Opposition member Douglas Devananda.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, joining the adjournment motion moved by the government on Thursday, which lasted for 2 days on the UNHCR Resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka.
The previous government took measures to provide food and medicine to the people in North and East despite LTTE atrocities," said MP Devananda. "We attempted to protect the Tamil people when the LTTE was functioning and even after it was eliminated."
Parliamentarian Devananda further said they even protested near foreign embassies in Colombo so that they would take measures to protect the Tamil people from the LTTE.
But they did not give ear to their grievances. He also said those foreign countries were now shedding crocodile tears for the Tamil people.

Wimal has two passports, says Ajith
Power and Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera told Parliament yesterday, that an ordinary person usually has only one passport, but MP Wimal Weerawansa apparently possesses two passports.
He sees hybrid ghosts in everything, because his entire life is hybrid. He had another name when he was a journalist. Now his behaviour is hybrid, policy is hybrid. We know that he has many other hybrid things.
Participating in the Adjournment Debate on the Geneva based UNHRG report, he said information had been received that MP Wimal Weerawansa was gone to Italy to bolster an organisation that fuels communism. MP Dinesh Gunawardene said Wimal Weerawansa has been taken into custody by the CID, but we request he be allowed to go abroad as per assurance given by the Speaker.
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that he spoke with the Immigration and Emigration Controller and I believe the problem with the Visa, obtained on the new passport will be sorted.
He has been taken into custody while attending to this matter. Even the Immigration and Emigration Controller had not made any complaint in this regard.
Domestically designed war crimes inquiry by Sri Lankans for Sri Lankans - FM
The mechanism introduced by the UNHRC to inquire into war crimes would be completely domestically designed by Sri Lankans for the Sri Lankans, said Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
He stated that hypocritical opposition members failed to point out the fact that the final architect of this mechanism was Sri Lanka and the inquiry should be made under a Sri Lankan Judiciary system and Constitution of Sri Lanka.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, participating in the Adjournment Debate on the Geneva based UNHRC Report and alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war.
"Future historians in Sri Lanka would decide whether the unanimous resolution on October 01, 2015 before the UNHRC is historic." said Minister Samaraweera. "Forty five countries, including Russia, China, India and Pakistan have expressed their support to this mechanism that would bring about a reconciliation whereas during the Rajapaksa regime, we were supported by only 12 countries, including Congo."
The Foreign Minister stated that this co-sponsored resolution had put a full-stop that Sri Lanka is being cornered by the international community. "This is not an achievement by me or my ministry, but it was due to the new political culture brought about by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 08.
"We could make the US sponsored resolution, resolution by Sri Lanka for Sri Lanka," he said. "It was a great victory for this government. India, China, Russia, etc., commended Sri Lanka's move." He stated that the Udalagama and Paranagama Commission reports, include recommendations more worse than those in the co-sponsored UNHRC Resolution, adding that the Paranagama Report says that the Channel 4 footage on Sri Lanka's killing field is true and should be investigated.
He said that an office for the missing would be set up on Sri Lanka. The legal background would be discussed during next year. He said that an environment would be created for youth in the North and South so that they would not be misled again.
He said the assistance of foreign experts have been taken during inquiries into the S W R D Bandaranaike, Lalith Athulathmudali, Lakshman Kadirgarmar and Ravi Raj assassinations.
"The reputation of the armed forces could be protected only by inquiring into the allegations," Minister Samaraweera said. He said if allegations were not inquired into, the armed forces would be responsible for the wrong doings of an individual or two."
The Minister further stated that the people in the South too could request for an inquiry into the murder of 600 police personnel and other grievances by the LTTE.
"We stood with Mahinda Rajapaksa in the past due to the grievances of mothers in the South, for the rights of Wimal Weerawansa who was engaged in terrorist activities at a time with the support of the international community," Minister Samaraweera said. "So don't we have the right to stand for the rights of the people in the North of the country, he questioned."
'RAW active in the North'
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday, that India's spy agency research and Analysis wing (RAW) is engaged in a campaign to destabilize the North. Today Jaffna has become a den of the RAW. The international intervention in local affairs have always been detrimental to the national interests.
Jaffna people thought that India would help them. There was no such help when the conflict was worsening. Jaffna people learnt too late that India was - self-serving in the guise of helping them. Today the area is infested with RAW agents and their activities have been the target of destabilizing the North.

Democracy in the Digital Era
Address by the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Thilanga Sumathipala, Parliament of Sri Lanka on October 18, 2015, at the 133rd sessions of the Inter Parliaamentary Union (IPU), Geneva, Switzerland
Topic: Democracy in the Digital Era and the threat to privacy and individual freedom
Chairman, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen present at this august gathering, Greetings from Sri Lanka!
It is my pleasure to address you on the topic: 'Democracy in the digital era, and the threats it can pose to privacy and individual freedoms.'
As we all know, what we want for ourselves is freedom of expression which is a fundamental right at the heart of any democratic society.
However, it is also restricted by other important values, including the right to privacy and individual freedoms. Of concern is the misuse of private information, leading to infiltration of an individual's private life and family.
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), has 193 member states and according to the ITU, there are billions of mobile phone subscribers, around five billion people with access to television and tens of millions of internet users every year.
We have moved from Analog to Digital and the transformation has been remarkable. Digital democracy has flourished in almost all parts of the world and online sites have become the platform for vibrant
discussions and debates across the globe. In fact, some websites are engaged in exposing corruption and official excesses. They, thereby, contribute towards good governance while also ensuring the right to information.
In the digital era, social media has surpassed the print media as a purveyor of information. The internet, for example, disseminates news and opinions, including intimate, private information of individuals; similarly, social media blogs and other online sites also provide easy and free access to information - both public and private. As such, it has led to many people concluding that there is no recourse to legal protection. This has also led to the belief that there is potent threat to privacy, dignity and individual freedoms.
The latest statistics reveal that one in every four Sri Lankans, regularly use the internet while Facebook clearly dominates with over 2.5 million accounts as at end of December 2014. In addition, youth, especially, are predominant users of the Twitter, WhatsApp, Viber and Youtube.
You would be interested to know that of Sri Lanka's population of over 20 million people, 4.7 million are internet users, 2.8 million are active users of social media, there are 27.4 million mobile connections which show that there is a very large percentage of the population having more than one connection. In addition, 2.2 million people are active social mobile users.
But we have to bear in mind not only the good side of social media - it also has a bad and an ugly side to it - as witnessed globally - the use of bad language, promoting extremism and violence, exposure to pornography, among other negative practices.
As we are aware, the law is locked in a struggle to reconcile privacy, individual freedoms and free speech within a democratic frame-work.
In Sri Lanka, technological innovations have been used as a tool for a change towards democracy. Social media networks, through their penetration, have facilitated and spurred citizens to engage in organizing and generating awareness of political mobilization towards democracy, as witnessed during the Presidential and General Elections held this year. In my view, the digital world is more controllable -we have better clarity; better quality and I would like to emphasize, we can have better control! And regulation can be put in place. Even though technological advancements can pose a virtual threat to democratic rights, the digital world can be controlled, whereas Analog could not have been controlled. The ITU sets and publishes regulations and standards relevant to electronic communication and broadcasting technologies.
