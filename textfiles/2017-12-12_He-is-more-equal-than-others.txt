Many Diyawanna members from both sides of the divide visiting this inmate for lengthy chats has become a daily feature at this state-run lodge, they say.

 


All VIP visitors reportedly meet this inmate serving time for a major crime at the office of a very high official at the lodge.


Although the inmates are not allowed to have meals prepared elsewhere, the rule is not being enforced on this ‘star-class’ inmate who gets sumptuous meals brought from outside on a regular basis under the pretext they are meant for another person in remand custody.


Meanwhile, a reliable source says that a young government politician was seen recently having an intimate conversation with this special inmate for over one hour.
