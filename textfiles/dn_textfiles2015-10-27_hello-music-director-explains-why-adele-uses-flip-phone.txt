'Hello' Music Director explains why Adele uses Flip Phone

Since Adele released the music video for her new single, "Hello," on Friday, viewers around the internet have wondered: Why is she using a flip phone in 2015?!?!?
Xavier Dolan, the director behind the video, took to Twitter to let us know: Xavier Dolan @XDolan: Iphones in movies make me uncomfortable. Like I'm shooting a commercial. Now get it over it. #flipflopfreakout pic.twitter.com/3vZgbJ7qwD
Uhh.................................hmm.
Dolan explained his stance further in an interview with People on Saturday.
"It's just not that big of a deal," he said. "It makes me uncomfortable filming iPhones because I feel like I'm shooting a commercial."
"Those things: iPhones, laptops, all those elements, to me, they bring me back to reality: That's not what you want," he continued. "You want to get out of your own life; you want to enter someone else's; you want to travel somewhere; you want to be told a story. I'm realizing maybe I've been more distracting than anything else with that flip phone, but it wasn't intentional!"
We're sticking with our interpretation that the song just takes place in 2007 or something.
