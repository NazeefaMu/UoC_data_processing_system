Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake today noticed nine joint opposition MPs including Dinesh Gunawardana and Vidura Wickramanayaka to appear in court to inquire into a Borella Police report regarding a demonstration to be staged outside the Welikada Prison by the JO today.

The Police informed Court about the inconvenience that is likely to be caused because of the demonstration. They said the safety and secrutiy of prisoners being escorted to and from prison may also be affected.

They sought a stay order or some suitable order on the demonstration.

The Magistrate said the organisers should be given a chance to convey their views to the Court before deciding on the order to be delivered.

The nine JO members have been asked to appear in Court at 4.00 pm and if they fail to do so the inquiry is to be taken up in their absence. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
