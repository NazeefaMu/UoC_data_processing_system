[Young Voices]
Go green, but not with envy!

Wijewardena spends his spare time reading biographies and histories from the civil rights movements in America as well as books on World War II. He also listens to western music but this depends on the mood. It could be classical one day, opera or rock the next day, he said.
Ishara Jayawardane
Following the destruction caused by the 2004 Tsunami, Ruwan Wijewardene helped victims in his small way. With his friends, he collected whatever relief items he could find and went to Seenigama to distribute them. He made a big difference in a small way. 'Young Voices from Diyawanna' today features State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene. A stalwart politician, Wijewardene revealed insights into his personal and public life.
Early life
Wijewardene comes from a powerful family. He is the son of Ranjith Wijewardene, the Chairman of Wijeya Newspapers. His great grandfather D. S. Senanayake was the first Prime Minister of Ceylon and his grandfather Dudley Senanayake was the second Prime Minister of Ceylon. His paternal grandfather D. R. Wijewardena established Lake House.
Wijewardene has an elder brother and an elder sister. From an early age, he was interested in politics. He sat for his O/Level examination from S. Thomas' Prep School and studied for London A/Levels at Stafford International School. He later left for England to study Third World Politics at the University of Sussex. He also studied International Journalism at the City University of London.
He still has close contact with friends from school and university. He says a few of his close friends have been with him since pre-school times.
Key to success
"My key to success is being honest and saying what I have to say upfront. People are fed up with politicians who are dishonest and engage in corrupt activities. People appreciate honesty. Even when I was in the Opposition, I did my best to help people in my area. That gave me the encouragement to move forward. The people supported me throughout."
Challenges in life
The minister said one of the biggest problems he faces in life is lack of privacy.
"I guess in politics you don't have much of a private life. Everything is out in the open. Sometimes there are rumours. I believe in the freedom of expression. However, as politicians, we see unsavory stories being cooked up in the media that are totally untrue. This is just malicious mudslinging."
These are the challenges most politicians face. It is all a part of the game. Wijewardena knows that politicians just have to bear it and move on.
Message to youth
As a young parliamentarian and minister, he has a message to youths. "More than anything, put your country first. You must also excel in whatever you do. Remember to serve the country," he said.
Wijewardena was outspoken against those leaving the country and serving abroad.
"Unfortunately, we see a lot of youths trying to leave this country. This is because they feel they will prosper economically if they go abroad," he said. He added that it is important to convince expatriates to return and invest. "Whatever career you choose, do it right and be a good citizen. Whatever you do, put the country first," the Minister said.
Voice in Parliament
Wijewardena is keen on supporting ex -servicemen who have fought for the country.
"I am trying to do whatever I can through my ministry to support servicemen. I am here to do whatever I can for the country and the people. I want to see this country progress to its full potential. I think this country has lot of potential that is not being used. We have two great leaders now. If we go in the right direction, we will see a huge development."
Favourite historical figure
Abraham Lincoln is a person he admires. Wijewardena said: "He was a person who went through a lot of personal problems. He failed many times but never gave up. Even as a President, he chose people who were initially against him to his Cabinet. He got them closer and eventually they saw the great leader in him," he said.
"I think he is a hero. The way he managed the country during dark times with the civil war in the US is commendable."
Country's future
Sri Lanka has huge potential to be Asia's shining star. We have the right resources and our educational level is high.
Wijewardena added that the government is pushing for Sri Lanka to come to the standard of other countries with regard to technology. "We can surpass some of our neighbours as our policies are being re-thought. If we can get our economic strategies and technology sorted out, our country will be a leader in the region," he said.
New strategies and establishment of the rule of law would make the people feel safe. Women will have their place in society. Wijewardena believes that a country where a woman would feel safe to walk down the road in the middle of the night, would be created under this government. "I see a future where our children will receive the best education that we can give."
Books, movies and music
Wijewardena spends his spare time reading biographies and histories from the civil rights movements in America as well as books on World War II. He also listens to western music but this depends on the mood. It could be classical one day, opera or rock the next day, he said.
Hope for the world
"We live in the 21st century. World leaders should consider the possibilities of running out of food and water. They should work to establish world peace," the Minister said. "If you look at what is happening around the world, we seem to be going backwards. Terrorism is a huge problem, he said, referring to the Paris attacks and Syrian crisis.
"There are many things that should not be happening. I hope in the next few years, these conflicts will be resolved and a more prosperous era will dawn."
Female leadership
Wijewardena pointed out that Sri Lanka is no stranger to female leadership. "We were the first country in the world to have a female prime minister. Then we had Chandrika Bandaranaike as President. I think the USA is ready for a female president. Nobody thought they would be ready for a black president but Barack Obama became President."
Going back in time
"If I could go back in time, the one thing I would change is Black July. This spiraled the ethnic conflict to another level. The bombing of Hiroshima Nagasaki is also something that I would change."
A better world
Wijewardena is also an environmentalist. "We are not protecting our environment. We are slowly killing ourselves. Humanity is under threat because of global warming. I believe change is needed with regard to the human impact on the environment."
Leisure activities
"I love taking photographs. I like listening to music and maybe I would catch a movie or two. I also like reading and traveling. I am also a big rugby lover. I played rugby at school. I like football as well. You could call me a sports-lover."
Views on religion
Wijewardena is a Buddhist. He comes from a religious family, closely associated with the Buddhist temple. However, he believes that every religion teaches a person to be a good person.
"Religion has been used throughout history to obtain power. Religion has been distorted. Buddhism teaches how a person should behave - how to look after yourself and be a good human being. All religions teach this but people have interpreted religion to their convenience," he pointed out.
Life event that moved you
One event that moved me is the Central Bank bombing. It really shocked me. The other event was the Tsunami. My friends and I collected a lot of dry rations, clothes and water, and went down South. The destruction, bodies and the smell of death was harrowing. The smell did not leave me for weeks, Wijewardena said.
Admirable characteristics
Being open about oneself and being sensitive towards other people's feelings are traits that Wijewardena admires.
"Also some people let jealousy rule their emotions which is not healthy. If there is something that should be changed, it should be jealousy. This is the root cause of many social evils," he said.
