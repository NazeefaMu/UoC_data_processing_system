A leading foreign embassy located in Colombo has complained to the Foreign Affairs Ministry that residents living in the neighbourhood were pelting stones at the embassy premises across the parapet wall.

Sources said the embassy had reportedly complained to the police as well as the Defence Ministry over the incident.

The embassy was built on a land which had been previously occupied by squatters and there was a controversy over the ownership of the land for the past couple of years. The pelting of stones had been reported on several occasions. (Thilini De Silva)
