Fortifying with divine support before taking crucial political decisions!


	



A yahapalanaya strongman had consulted a prominent astrologer preparatory to taking a series of crucial political decisions.


The astrologer summoned to the mansion, had told the yahapalanaya bigwig that a series of planetary changes in the offing could make an adverse impact on him and advised him to conduct a special pooja to propitiate the deity Maha Vishnu.


The strongman who had taken the advice seriously had at daybreak the other day visited a Vishnu Kovil in Dehiwela area along with his wife sans the usual security contingent. 


After conducting a pooja, the strongman had also made a special vow, they say.
