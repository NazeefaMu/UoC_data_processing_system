President Maithripala Sirisena promised me the post of Ambassador to Qatar, Businessman and Sri Lankan Labour Party Leader A.S.P Liyanage said today.

"The President first wanted to appoint me as a provincial governor but because there were no vacancies, he said he would appoint me as an Ambassador and that he would submit the proposal to the Parliamentary High Posts Committee for approval before confirming the appointment. The President even wished me for the New Year,” Mr. Liyanage said.

The post has remained vacant since Dr. W.M. Karunadasa resigned as Ambassador to Qatar.

Mr. Liyanage, a Rajapaksa stalwart, was a former High Commissioner to Nigeria. Mr. Liyanage had even promised the former president his luxury ‘peacock mansion’ in Rajagiriya but later withdrew his offer.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
