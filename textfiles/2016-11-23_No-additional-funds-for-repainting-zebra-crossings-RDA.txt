No additional funds for repainting zebra crossings: RDA


	

Despite the current practice to call for tenders and additional funds for new projects, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said yesterday that additional funds would not be allocated to paint the zebra crossings white.

The RDA said all zebra crossings would be re-painted white from December 3.

RDA Chairman Nihal Sooriyaarachchi said they did not want to spend more than was necessary on the project, which had prompted the use of the funds that were already allocated for the purpose.

“We could have called for a tender and spent more money on this but we don’t want to do that. That is why we have requested a year to complete the project,” Mr. Sooriyaarachchi said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
