There is a grog manufacturing company said to be in default on a tax payment amounting to Rs. 20 million and a staff-member of the office of a very high authority is busy attending to documentation to take over the ownership of this company after clearing the tax commitment, they say. 

 


The operation of the grog manufacturing factory had been suspended for several months in Athe past for defaulting on tax payment and the staff-member in question, finding it a veritable gold mine had hastened to grab its ownership after clearing all dues to the State fallen into arrears.
