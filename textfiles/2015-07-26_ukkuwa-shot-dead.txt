The 38-year-old underworld gangster Indika Nilusha alias "Ukkuwa" was killed and two others were injured in a shooting at Tangalle last morning, Police said.
Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the three gangsters who were earlier arrested in connection with a killing had been released on bail last month.
He said they had reported to the Tangalle Police and were returning in a trishaw when some unidentified men in a car had shot them at Pallikudah in Tangalle.
ASP Gunasekara said the injured were admitted to the Tangalle Hospital and the Police are investigating.
The police had arrested 'Ukkuwa' and three others on last year in connection with several killings in Tangalle.
Police alleged that he was involved in the killing of a young man in Lebima and a bus conductor at the Tangalle bus stand and that of shooting an underworld gangster named Army Amila opposite the Courts complex in Tangalle. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
