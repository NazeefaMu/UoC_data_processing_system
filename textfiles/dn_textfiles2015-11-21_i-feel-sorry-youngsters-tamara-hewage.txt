I feel sorry for the youngsters - Tamara Hewage

Five times national champion and Sri Lanka player said that she feels sorry for the younger group of players who have no proper national coach to guide them.
"Our junior standard is really good they have a very bright future but our biggest drawback is that we don't have an independent national coach," said Tamara. "The coaches we have are all involved in private coaching and as a result they favour their pupils. When they go abroad the coach who accompanies the team concentrates more on their own players and if they are not in the team they don't push the other players to improve. This will not happen if there is a foreign national coach."
Tamara said that the officials at the Table Tennis Association were averse when she tried to bring down a coach from Switzerland to coach the national team.
"When I went as a delegate to the World Championships in Paris through the association in 2013 I met this Swiss national coach Pavel Rehorek and invited him to come to Sri Lanka and conduct two coaching camps in Kandy and two at the YMCA. All the ranked players from the Western Province and from the Central Province were invited and the coach was highly thrilled about the standard," said Tamara.
"There was this boy Udaya Ranasinghe from Vidyartha College who won all his age group titles and became senior national champion at the age of 14. He is a superbly talented player and the Swiss coach saw his standard and invited him for four months training in Switzerland. He came back and beat the Indian no. 1 and 2 ranked players. But surprisingly he was not selected for the Youth Olympics.
"When the Swiss coach wanted to coach our national team free of charge the association hardly showed any interest. I thought they were jealous. When we tried to do something for the sport they feared that we would get all the credit and become popular.
"In the association at that time Muthalib and myself were the only officials who had played table tennis, all the others were strangers. I didn't know from where they came. When we tried to explain something they showed no interest.
"The clubs are the ones who bring in these unqualified people so that some individuals in the committee will benefit.
"According to the rule politicians cannot hold posts as president only those who have played the game qualified to hold office-bearer posts but what happens is they still continued to get elected."
Tamara related an incident where a former national player Lilamani de Zoysa had come down all the way from Switzerland and wanted to serve the association. "After she spoke to this Minister who was then president she got fed up with him and nearly went crazy listening to him."
Likewise there have been other former national players who had wanted to serve the association but found the environment not conducive and backed out.
"I was abroad from 1982-1989 and when I returned I won the 1990 nationals. I stopped playing table tennis for 20 years and didn't know what was happening during this period," said Tamara.
"In 2013 when I came to the association as vice president I found that everyone was fighting with each other. Each one was trying to be superior to the other. I was shocked and surprised if they don't unite this game cannot improve."
Tamara expressed sadness the association continues to charge Rs 500 registration fee per player annually even after her proposal to charge only for the first year was minuted and passed at a meeting.
"Table tennis is played by a lot of poor children and if in a family if 3-4 children are playing the parents have to afford a lot of money that's why I suggested a fee only for the initial year. You cannot improve the game like this."
Tamara revealed that a table tennis racquet today costs as much as Rs. 25,000 compared to Rs. 150 in the seventies.
Whilst praising the excellent job done by the coaches at junior level she said they overlooked the physical training factor.
"When they train they don't' train for stamina and flexibility. They only do stretching exercises. That's not enough. That's why our players don't perform well at international tournaments because they are they are not fit," said Tamara.
"During my time I was played basketball and swam. Before a final I always ran one round at the Sports Ministry grounds before coming to play. I don't see the present players doing any kind of physical fitness. The coaches are only training them at the table and overlooking the physical fitness factor."
Tamara said that Sri Lanka should concentrate on trying to win medals at the Commonwealth Games, SAF Games and Youth Games but to achieve those goals first and foremost the officials must be disciplined.
"If the officials don't have discipline you cannot accept the same from the players," she said.
"Past Sports Ministers should take the blame for failing to take suitable action against errant officials who have brought the sport to its present status," said Tamara.
"There are a lot of talented junior players but they can progress only upto a point from there onwards there is no one to help them attain international standards," she said.
