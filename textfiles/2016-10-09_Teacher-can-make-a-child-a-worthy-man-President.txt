School is the place where the child, given birth by mother is converted to a philosopher, scholar, intellectual, artist, politician and leader of the people, while teacher is the one who makes the child a true human, President Maithripala Sirisena said recently.

It is the teacher’s main responsibility to develop the student with knowledge, disciplines, skills and thoughts, he added. That is why the teacher is respected in society not merely as a professional but as an honored person due to the task performed by him for the betterment of the society, he further stated.

The President made these remarks at the Guru Prathibha Prabha – 2015 felicitation ceremony held on Thursday (Oct. 06) at the BMICH to mark the World Teachers’ Day. The ceremony was organized by the Ministry of Education.
