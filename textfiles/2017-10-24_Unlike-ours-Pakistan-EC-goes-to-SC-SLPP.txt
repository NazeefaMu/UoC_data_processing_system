Unlike ours, Pakistan EC goes to SC: SLPP


	

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today Pakistan’s Election Commission Chairman had appealed to that country's Supreme Court about election-related matters, but our EC Chairman had failed to do so though the LG elections were being inordinately delayed.

Party Chairman G.L. Peiris said in Sri Lanka it were the common citizens filing lawsuits in the Supreme Court seeking an order on holding elections.

Commenting on Justice Mark Fernando’s 1998 judgement, he said the Judge ruled that elections should not be delayed and that the then Elections Department could take independent decisions.

“The Elections Commission should not wait for another year to take action with regard to the postponing of elections. It should act now and carry out its duties and responsibilities,” he told a news briefing.

Mr. Peiris said the SLPP was repeatedly questioned and asked to submit several documents and emails prior to being registered as a political party, but the EC had failed to identify Shalila Moonesinghe as a Britisher.

“We are not opposed to the EC asking us questions but what is surprising is that it had not been able to identify a Britisher appointed as the chairman of a political party which fielded two presidential candidates,” he said.

Mr. Peiris said the government fears an election defeat and therefore keeps postponing elections. “We urge the EC to hold elections for local government bodies and provincial councils at the earliest,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
