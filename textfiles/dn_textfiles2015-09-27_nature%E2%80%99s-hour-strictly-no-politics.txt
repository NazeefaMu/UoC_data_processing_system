NATURE’S HOUR STRICTLY NO POLITICS!

Relieved from the honks of the ‘polluting vehicles’, congestion of the traffic and pungent smelling air replete with hazardous carbon pollutants… the bus veered into the Parliament Road at Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. As I am employed in the House that harbours the supremacy of the SriLankan political system, taking that route is a part of my quotidian journey to office.

Brushing aside the hullabaloo for which this precinct often falls on the headlines…. The natural beauty cloaked around it is indeed a scrumptious delight to our senses which no one would dare to refute. Each morning is unique. That’s the ardent underpinning theory of nature. Each day is of its own with the awe striking beauty of the surrounding greenery. Each day vies for resplendence and sublimity against the previous day. Therefore each day is an inter display of colours that is afresh every morn.

The neatly asphalt laid Parliament Road is aligned on either sides with lush green Ironwood vegetation. Every tree serves a pallet of hues as that of a virtuoso artist…. The withering leaves bear a buff colouration while the tender ones tinge a light green so do the newly sprouting foliage adorn with a cherry red or Apricot orange. Moreover on a wintry monsoon morn, the cold trees shroud around itself a quilt of teal blue wispy fog which bespeak of subtle chrome.
Even after 8 o’clock when the sun warms up the earth energizing its inhabitants for the day’s chores, the wafting lethargic mist refuses to leave the sanctuary playing hide and seek against the combing rays of the apoplectic sun. The sun beams arduously penetrate every gap between the foliage and reeds in the bank of the Diyawanna to drive off the wisp. But the descending precipitation chills out the scorch of the sun by condensing the dew drops cozily perched on the cusps and trichomes of the leaves. Cool breeze flows around the sanctuary shaking off the rain.

The Blue lotuses in the reflection pond bobbles up and down as the heavy drops hit against their tender petals. A bunch of crows perched on frangipani trees drenched in the shower taking a monsoon bath. Tearing through the haze a surveillance boat catches my eyeball. It whizzes its way across the Diyawanna leaving a trail of a foamy wake. Cascading heavy rain drops drip down the decorative pair of metallic bells adorning the foyer. The drops droop around the rim of the bell lip resembling studded limpid pearls. As the wet road reflects the glowing headlights of the beetling vehicles, the sizzling droplets tickle on my face as my vehicle speedily heads to mark our attendance above the red line.

As the precipitation recedes the hibernating fauna comes to life. A giant monitor lizard with its kid waddles along the pastures of the green garden, wiggling its tail. They coyly scavenge along the place digging into the manicured garden much to the annoyance of the gardener. A skein of nidifugous lapwings scan the area for some forage. A group of stray dogs and proud cats coil themselves for warmth and emerge into deep slumber.
Along the causeway the buffeting white petalled flowers of the Ironwood tree fall on the black asphalt road forming a decorative polka dotted design, while the golden shower tree for its contribution cascades tiny yellow blossoms rolling out a plush yellow blanket. The ripples of the Diyawanna compose a water ballet of their own propagated by the scudding zephyr that blows across the water body. The grandeur of the performance is further elevated by the choppy droplets of the drizzle. Fluttering frolicsome butterflies and skittering dragonflies sing a libretto while they quench their thirsts with the nectar from the freshly bloomed blossoms.

By dusk the entire precinct adorns itself in its glittering finery. The subtle yellow gleam reflects on the brown walls of the edifice revealing a blend of illumination. Spherical lamp shades glow as gleaming buttons right around the territory. The birdies busily chatter about their day’s chores with all the usual hyperbole which we hardly could construe. Billowing clouds display shades of ash tinged with the golden splash of the dipping sun.
The full moon glares into its floating miniature reflection on the stark clear still water body. Yonder the snaking tarmac covered road seems busy with glimmering vehicles steering along the road like fluorescent fireflies beetling off. The national flag flaps in the breeze acknowledging the splendid beauty around. The lamp posts in front of the foyer resemble bunches of succulent golden berries glowing in the dark. It illuminates the façade of the Parliamentary building spreading a sheen of burnished copper.
 
As the amber lamp held high on the flag pole goes off depicting the conclusion of the day’s proceedings, my vehicle drives off its way fitting itself amidst in the clogged traffic. The Parliamentary building along with the national flag stands majestically alluring with arresting beauty etched against the backdrop of stupendous natural serenity.
