France knock Argentina out of the World Cup 4-3


	

France are through to the Quarter Finals after a 4-3 victory over Argentina.

In one of the games of the tournament so far France took the lead through an Antoine Griezmann penalty after Kylian Mbappe raced past Marcus Rojo and the Argentinian dragged him down. Argentina weren't really in the game until Angel Di Maria picked the ball up 30 yards out and fired the ball into the top corner. Argentina took the lead just after halftime when Lionel Messi took a shot at goal and it deflected off Gabriel Mercado and into the net.

France levelled things up with their own wondergoal through Benjamin Pavard, the ball was crossed in from the left and found its way all the way to Pavard who volleyed into the top corner. Mbappe then took the game away from Argentina with a couple of goals. The first came after the ball dropped to him in the area: he shifted the ball away from the defenders and fired past the keeper. The second came when a France counter attack led to Olivier Giroud poking the ball through for Mbappe to race away and slot past Franco Armani.

It looked as though the game was over but Argentina gave it a dramatic ending when Messi played the ball into Sergio Aguero who headed home, but it was too little too late.

France will now go into the Quarter Final to face Uruguay.
