One of the SIM cards recovered from the remand prison cell of Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena had been used by an underworld figure, who was allegedly involved with a recent killing in the South, Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) Haripriya Jayasundera said during the magisterial inquiry over the Bond Scam today.

While informing the court about the probability of further legal action being taken into the incident by the prosecution, SDSG Jayasundera said that the prosecution was still receiving the communication details of the five SIM cards from service providers to deal with the matter more intensively.

"The CID's investigations into the details of the SIM cards could lead to very important revelations as one of the SIM cards was used by an underworld figure who is believed to have been involved in a murder in the southern part of the country," a source said.

Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were ordered to be re-remanded till August 2 by the Magistrate over the Magisterial Inquiry in which they were accused of abetting and conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds worth Rs. 688 million during the Bond Auction held on February 27, 2015.
