144 years ago, Rev. Samuel R. Wilkin and Rev. D. Henry Pereira- the Founding Fathers of Wesley College Colombo – established the Leading Christian Methodist Boys School in Colombo. Throughout the years Wesley College has produced statesmen, national heroes, diplomats, great scholars, medical and legal luminaries, professionals, bankers, sportsmen, internationally acclaimed musicians, entrepreneurs, business leaders and many distinguished personalities in Sri Lanka.


The Old Boys of Wesley College Colombo (OBU) and the Old Wesleyites Sports Club (OWSC) come together each year to present the Double Blue Ball. This Event is one that is much looked forward to in both the OBU /OWSC calendars where Old Boys of Wesley College, in Sri Lanka and Overseas, come together in true Double Blue Spirit, to bond and enjoy the fellowship and camaraderie, which go beyond the borders and barriers of Religion, Language and Race. The event underscores the hallmark of the Wesley Spirit and the tradition of the institute.


The Double Blue Ball” which is the most glamorous event of the OBU/OWSC, is scheduled to be held on November 17 (Saturday) at the Cinnamon Grand Ballroom, from 8.00pm onwards.
