Farmers are now faced with double trouble!


	



 

People in Maduru-oya area who are being constantly troubled by rampaging elephants have been placed in a new spot of bother as well: several thousands of cattle have been driven to this area from the fast-developing South and their herdsmen too have become a law unto themselves, they say. 

 


These herds reportedly owned by a prominent political family in the South are freely roaming in the Maduru-oya often foraging on the crops of the cultivators.


A leading politico who visited the Maduru-oya area to see for himself the damage caused by the rampaging herds, had assured the cultivators that he would take necessary steps to drive away the cattle. Soon after vowing to rid the people of the new nuisance, the politico had turned to journos present and said: “Don’t report that I am now after the former Lokka’s cattle!”
