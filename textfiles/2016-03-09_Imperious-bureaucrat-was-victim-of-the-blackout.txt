Imperious bureaucrat was victim of the blackout


	



 

The entire country recently experienced a blackout like a bolt from the blue.  Now an inquiry is underway to ascertain whether it was the work of some saboteurs.

 


The country’s tallest building, Colombo World Trade Centre too was a casualty of this blackout.  An imperious white collar bigwig playing a big role in managing the country’s finances had been among those in the cage when an elevator of this building got stuck midway due to the power failure on 
that day.  


As the emergency power generator too failed to activate, this bigwig had to remain ‘imprisoned’ in the lift cage for a considerable time.  The complaint made by the furious white collar one to the authorities concerned later had gone a long way in galvanizing the officials responsible into action soon after, they say.
