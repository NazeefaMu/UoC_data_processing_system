May seals Brexit  pact on future  EU relations

Theresa May said she had ‘honoured the referendum’ today after dramatically sealing her Brexit deal with Brussels.   


The Prime Minister hailed the outcome after negotiators reached agreement on the final element of the package - covering future trade.   


In a statement outside Downing Street, Mrs May said: ‘This is the right deal for the UK. It delivers on the result of the referendum.’   


In a stark message to MPs as an historic Commons showdown looms, Mrs May added: ‘The British people want this to be settled. They want to get a deal that sets us on a course for a brighter future.   


‘That deal is within our grasp and I am determined to deliver it.’   


The rallying call came after EU Council President Donald Tusk said the ‘future framework’ outlining terms of a trade deal had been agreed by negotiators.   


It has now been sent to EU capitals ahead of a summit in Brussels on Sunday - which could yet be derailed by last-minute wrangling from Spain over Gibraltar.   


In possible concessions to help Mrs May get the deal through the Commons, the 26-page document makes clear that Britain will have an ‘independent trade policy’.   


And it stresses both sides’ ‘determination to replace the backstop’ for the Irish border with alternative plans in future -potentially reviving the ‘Max Fac’ solution favoured by Brexiteers.   


The pact confirms that free movement will end, which could be seen as a win for the PM - but also states that the UK will not discriminate between nationals from different EU countries.
