Emirates, a global connector of people, places and economies, has announced its second daily service from Dubai International Airport (DXB) to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA). 
The new service, EK227, which began on July 7 and is operated by a Boeing 777-200LR, will depart Dubai at 3:15 a.m. and arrives in Seattle at 6:55 a.m. The return flight, EK228, departs Seattle at 9:40 a.m. and arrives in Dubai at 10:55 a.m. the following day. The new service will supplement the current EK 230 Boeing 777-300ER flight departing Seattle at 5:40 p.m. and landing in Dubai the following day at 6:55 p.m.
“This new service will provide passengers with the convenience of both a morning and evening departure from both Dubai as well as Seattle,” said Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President Commercial Operations West Hubert Frach. 
“This second daily service will provide our passengers in the Seattle area even more choices when flying with Emirates and satisfy their demand for more flights from this gateway. Corporate travellers will also appreciate the ease of conducting business as a result of the improved connectivity between Seattle and a number of international destinations. So when corporate travellers are headed to an Emirates’ destination in the Middle East, Africa, or the Far East or when they require one of Emirates’ frequent daily connections to Hyderabad, Mumbai, or Delhi, the global business community will now seem much more closer to Seattle.”
Passengers coming from Dubai and beyond can connect to other US cities through Emirates’ partner agreement with Alaska Airlines (AS). Members of Alaska Airlines’ Mileage Plan and Emirates’ Skywards programmes have been able to earn and redeem miles for travel on either carrier since March 2012. These flights offer connectivity to points across the United States such as Portland, Anchorage, Honolulu, Billings and Boise as well as into Canada including cities such as Vancouver, Edmonton, Victoria and Calgary. 
Passengers flying into Seattle will spot the iconic Space Needle from the sky. Much like the souks in Old Dubai, Seattle visitors can taste the local flavours at a day spent at Pike Place Market. Ride along the Puget Sound on Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferry or zip from the Seattle Aquarium to Chinatown on the Seattle Centre Monorail, a World’s Fair legacy.
The second Seattle flight will be operated with one of Emirates’ Boeing 777-200LR aircraft, which will create a 75 percent jump in seating capacity with 4,340 weekly seats on offer to Dubai. This second flight will effectively move Seattle into the number two position in the US market in terms of seat capacity, behind New York John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Emirates’ Boeing 777-200LR features eight First Class suites, 42 Business Class lie-flat beds and 216 Economy Class seats. All passengers can enjoy over 2,000 free channels of films, TV shows, music, games and podcasts through ice, the airline’s multi-award winning in-flight entertainment system, regionally inspired gourmet cuisine and Emirates’ renowned inflight service from the airline’s multi-national cabin crew comprised of over 135 nationalities. Additionally, First Class and Business Class passengers can experience Emirates’ Chauffeur-drive service, available in over 70 cities worldwide.
The increased number of flights will also provide more connections to Emirates’ vast and growing network of destinations in Africa, the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, Asia and beyond. The additional service will also allow Emirates SkyCargo to carry an additional 15 tons of cargo per trip including locally grown cherries, electrical equipment and machinery, as well as medical equipment and aircraft parts.
Emirates launched service to Seattle just over three years ago in March 2012 and has since flown more than 600,000 passengers on the route. Emirates has a deeply rooted history with Seattle based company Boeing and was the launch customer of Boeing’s 777X. Emirates continues to be the world’s largest Boeing 777 operator, flying 145 of these aircraft with another 199 on order.
