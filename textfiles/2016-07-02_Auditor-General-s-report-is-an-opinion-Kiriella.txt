House Leader and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, commenting on the controversy surrounding the sale of Central Bank bonds and the Auditor General's report on the matter to the COPE, said the Auditor General’s report was "an opinion" and maintained that Arjuna Mahendran was innocent because in none of the cases filed against him had he been found guilty.

He said Mr. Mahendran was educated at Oxford and Harvard Universities and had compromised his lucrative foreign assignments to serve in Sri Lanka.

“How many people come like this? He is a person with international contacts. He knows what international trade is. He is a big asset,” the minister said.

He said those who pressed charges against Mr. Mahendran went to the Supreme Court last year.

“There was no evidence against him,” the minister said and highlighted the fact that the Supreme Court had exonerated him of the charges brought against him.

He said even the media could not find Mr. Mahendran guilty.

“The Auditor General’s report is only an opinion,” the minister said. (Kelum Bandara)
