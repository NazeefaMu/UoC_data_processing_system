The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) would contest the upcoming general elections under the name Bodu Jana Peramuna (BJP), BJP Leader and BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said today.
He said the BBS would remain as it is but for upcoming elections it would affiliate itself with the Eksath Maha Sabha Pakshaya (EMSP) which is a registered political party. The EMSP would in future be called the Bodu Jana Peramuna or the BJP with a new symbol and new officials.
The Thera told the Daily Mirror that new officials have been appointed to the BJP and was waiting the Elections Commissioner’s approval for its Cobra symbol.
“We have requested the Elections Commissioner to reserve the Cobra symbol for our newly formed party and looking forward to his approval,” he said.
He said the Elections Commissioner had earlier refused to register any new political party in keeping with election regulations and that was why they had affiliate with the EMSP. (Piyumi Fonseka)
