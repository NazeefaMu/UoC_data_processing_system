Refuting media reports that he would resign of his current minister post, State Minister of Housing and Samurdhi Dilan Perera yesterday said that such decision has not been made but he was uncertain to resign in the future over some personal reasons.
As he was satisfied with what he got from President Maithripala Sirisena, Mr. Perera said at the moment he is working together with the Cabinet Minister of Housing and Samurdhi Sajith Premadasa without any issue.
“Only because I’ve got a state minister post it is not a reason for me to resign over. Though I have some personal reasons I cannot reveal them as they are personal. No one can predict future. So, I don’t know whether I will resign over my personal issues or not,” Mr. Perera said.
Some media reports said that Mr. Perera is worried due to his not being given a cabinet ministerial position, not being invited for the discussion between President Sirisena and former president Rajapaksa.
As a result of disappointments of ministers, the media report also said Ministers Pavitra Wanniarachchi and C.B. Ratnayake will also resign from the government soon. (Piyumi Fonseka)
