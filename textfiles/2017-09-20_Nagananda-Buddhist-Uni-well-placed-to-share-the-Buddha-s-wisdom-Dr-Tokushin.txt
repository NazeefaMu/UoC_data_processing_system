The Nagananda Buddhist University in Kelaniya, Sri Lanka is geared towards teaching the Buddha’s wisdom to the world says Dr. Nobio Kasai Tokushin from Japan whose visit to the country started on September 14 and ends today (20). 

Dr. Tokushin has supported Sri Lanka to set up a “Social Work Institution” for Buddhist monks at the Kolambagama, Nagananda Buddhist University in Kelaniya.  

Several novice Nepalese monks were getting trained on Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka and after training they will commence Dharma Charika in Nepal and in other Buddhist countries as well, he said.  

He has shown immense generosity and contributed towards the social and economic empowerment of women in the fishing community on the North-Western coastal belt.


As a Buddhist layman, based on Buddha’s teaching I have contributed my  wealth and time to alleviate social and economic suffering of the poor  communities in many Buddhist countries

I am providing poverty alleviation programmes, education facilities and whatever else that is possible to eradicate human suffering 


Dr. Tokushin said he was proud of what Sri Lanka had already achieved and was achieving as it is a peaceful country and had geared itself towards development.  

Japan has been and always will be supportive of Sri Lanka, he said.  He has also generously supported UNESCO for archaeological research in Kapilavasthu and Lumbini. 

He has extended his services from Nepal - Lumbini to Sri Lanka and many other Buddhist countries in Asia. “As a Buddhist layman, based on Buddha’s teaching I have contributed my  wealth and time to alleviate social and economic suffering of the poor communities in many Buddhist countries.” “Most of the people in these countries are suffering socially and economically”, he said.  

Therefore, I am providing poverty alleviation programmes, education facilities and whatever else that is possible to eradicate human suffering, Dr. Tokushin said.
