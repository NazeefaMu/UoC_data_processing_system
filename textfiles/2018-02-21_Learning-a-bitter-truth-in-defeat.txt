Learning a bitter truth in defeat


	



 

The results of the recent local poll had left the former madam in a state of shock, they say.

 


What had greatly shocked and dismayed her was the party’s defeat in her very ancestral area, long considered a pocket borough of the family. 


The madam’s shock had given way to fury when she discovered that most hangers-on and domestic aides had disappeared as the election results were trickling in. 


Addressing a few faithfuls who had remained behind, she had said: ”My successor had crowds mobbing him wherever he went even after his defeat. Our fellows are a contrast! In victory they hang around like leeches and run away like frightened dogs in defeat!”


After giving vent to her anger, she got things ready to leave for her second home abroad, 
they say.
