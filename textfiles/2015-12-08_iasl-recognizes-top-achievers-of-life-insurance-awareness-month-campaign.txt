In celebration and commemoration of the success of the ‘Life Insurance Awareness Month’ campaign that was held during the month of September, the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) hosted the Life Insurance Industry Awards Ceremony recently, at The Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo for the first time. 
The principle objective of the event was to recognize and reward the top sales producers and sales officers of the life insurance industry, especially those who contributed to the success of the ‘Life Insurance Awareness Month’ campaign. Hundred top sales officers were presented with special awards during the ceremony. Thanks to the tremendous success of the campaign the industry achieved a 30 percent growth in new policies in the month of September 2015. 
LIMRA/LOMA Managing Director and Vice President Ian Watts presided over the ceremony as the chief guest while Indrani Sugathadasa was the guest of honour. Other principle attendees included IBSL Director General Damayanthi Fernando. 
The foundation of the campaign and the awards ceremony is the bond between all those in the insurance industry who worked tirelessly to ensure the development and enhancement of life insurance in Sri Lanka. This point was emphasized by Dirk Pereira, who congratulated the IASL on its “ability to bring everyone together” in his welcome speech whilst also thanking everyone for their contributions in order to ensure the success of the campaign. 
Watts stated that LIMRA and LOMA were proud to add in their contributions to what he termed “an outstanding achievement”. On the importance of life insurance, Watts had this to say, “Life insurance is the foundation of society. Those who’ve had tragedy should be protected. The insurance industry exists to rebuild and protect.”
He also went on to graciously acknowledge the contributions of those who’ve worked hard in the insurance industry.
Marketing and Sales Forum Chairman Samitha Hemachandra went on to list the number of targets achieved thanks to the ‘Life Insurance Awareness Month’ campaign. He also thanked a number of those present for their contribution in making the campaign a success and thus enhancing the growth of the life insurance industry in Sri Lanka.  IBSL Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa expressed her satisfaction regarding the success of what had been achieved.
