Commercial Bank of Ceylon (ComBank) is to reward customers for usage of the bank’s mobile banking facility, with Rs.1.5 million in cash prizes over the next three months.
Customers already registered for mobile banking, who pay a minimum of three utility bills such as electricity, water, telephone and Pay TV a month to the cumulative value of Rs.2,500 or more between January 15 and April 15, 2016, will be eligible to win 300 cash prizes of Rs.5,000 each, the bank said.
Draws are to be conducted after the 15th of the month in February, March and April in respect of each preceding month and each month’s 100 winners will have their prize money credited to their accounts.
Commercial Bank offers mobile phone users the convenience of accessing many of its services via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology, via the bank’s own sophisticated app for users of Apple or Android-powered smart devices and via SMS.
Available to mobile phone users on the Etisalat, Dialog and Mobitel networks, Commercial Bank’s easy to access menu-driven USSD-based mobile banking service offers greater convenience and functionality, enabling users to carryout numerous banking transactions including account balance and credit card balance inquiries, utility bill payments, fund transfers, exchange rate inquiries, PIN changes, mobile reloads and request micro statements.
Because these services are offered on the USSD platform, they can be accessed via virtually any mobile phone and do not require an Internet connection. Access the mobile banking menu by dialling #8823#.
