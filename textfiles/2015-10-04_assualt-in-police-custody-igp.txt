IGP N.K. Illangakoon had ordered the police to hand-over an interim report of investigations into the complaint lodged by 17-year-old school boy and 33-year-old man in Kotadeniyawa, alleging they were assaulted while in police custody.
Police said today the 17-year-old Suranjan Pradeep Senevirathna and 33-year-old Kelum Athanayaka who were arrested on September 11 on suspicions of Seya Sandewmi’s murder had lodged a complaint with the IGP alleging they were harassed and assaulted while in police custody.
Mr. Illangakoon had ordered the report to be handed over on October 7.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the probes will pay attention whether the Kotadeniyawa Police had sufficient evidence to arrest them especially the underage student in connection with the murder and to ascertain whether they were allegedly assaulted by police while in custody.
