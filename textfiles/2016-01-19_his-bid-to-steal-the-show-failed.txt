His bid to steal the show failed


	

The Ministry of a powerful purohita, who incidentally joined the national unity yahapalanaya from another political party, launched a major development project at a main city in the South.
Several roads were developed under this major project, and a date for their opening was fixed and all Diyawanna members and purohitas of yahapalanaya hailing from the district were invited to this event. 
Meanwhile, another purohita from the district keen on gaining political mileage organized a separate opening ceremony on the sly. 
However, the purohita responsible for the development project had come to know on time about the underhand plan to hold a separate opening ceremony sans his presence.
