A US Coast Guard Cutter would be transferred to Sri Lanka further enhancing US-Sri Lanka Indo Pacific Partnership, the US Embassy said today.

Ahead of the transfer, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas A. Shannon said this Coast Guard Cutter is a tangible symbol of growing partnership between the two countries and reflects shared commitment of the two nations to regional stability.

Mr. Shannon who visited Sri Lanka last month announced that the US would offer a second US Coast Guard cutter to the Sri Lankan Navy pending completion of Congressional notification.

The Secretary Class High Endurance Cutter would allow Sri Lanka to more effectively police its coastline and Exclusive Economic Zone and to protect its sea lines of trade and communication, US earlier said.
