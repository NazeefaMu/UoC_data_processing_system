Fulfilling its commitment to impart essential life skills and knowledge amongst the public, DFCC Bank is proud to continue its impactful CSR project, ‘Samata English’, which delivered impressive results during its inaugural year in 2017. Now in the second phase, the Samata English programme is currently underway in Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala. This CSR programme was conceptualized with the objective of teaching Spoken English to equip students with the knowledge required to enter into the workforce on a strong and confident footing. The second phase of the programme will benefit youth between the ages of 18-25 with improved English speaking skills over a three-month period. Education is a key pillar in DFCC Bank’s corporate social responsibility initiatives. In line with this, the Bank has actively supported education in the country through various initiatives over the years.

The selected students sat for an initial assessment prior to starting the course which consists of practical activities, presentations, skills development and free tutorials in classrooms with modern facilities. The English speaking course is conducted by Gateway Educational Services (Pvt) Ltd and the final assessment will also be conducted by Gateway with a CALSDA Certification. 

Commenting on the success of the Samata English programme, Lakshman Silva – CEO, DFCC Bank said, “Being able to speak in English is crucial for youth in order to succeed in the local or international job markets. DFCC Bank launched ‘Samata English’ to bridge the spoken English skills gap. A pilot project was held last year in the Kalutara and Gampaha areas, which was very successful and it was encouraging to see the trained youth scoring high in spoken English skills as a direct influence of the programme. Encouraged by the improved confidence and positive outlook that this programme instilled in the youth in Gampaha and Kalutara last year, we are pleased to continue the programme in 2018 as well. This year, we are focusing on youth in Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala to help them fulfil their professional aspirations.” 

In operation for over six decades, DFCC Bank remains dedicated to advancing financial inclusivity whilst supporting the growth and development of the nation. The bank continuously strives to create sustainable value for all stakeholders and provide its valued customers with a comprehensive range of innovative financial solutions.
