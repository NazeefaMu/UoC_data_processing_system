Cuddly bears show how to close life’s gaps


	



AIA’s regional presence in various towns across the island has become much looked forward to events for both children and adults, especially those who are young at heart. The most recent activations were held in two major towns – Kandy, the picturesque hill capital and Galle, the bustling administrative capital of the Southern Province. Residents in both the high-profile cities were able to have an enjoyable day out. 


The most important lesson they learnt amidst fun and games was a great eye opener as to whether they were adequately prepared to face life’s ups and downs – be it planning for retirement, the rising cost of education and health services or most importantly, the unforeseen loss of a breadwinner for the dependants. Many visitors to AIA’s activity realised there was a yawning gap between what they will most likely have and the amount they will actually need.  


How they discovered the need to plan ahead wisely and carefully was through a range of exciting activities that included giant cuddly bears, Micky Mouse ‘Jim Pappa’ and other popular characters. The kids were presented with balloons while their parents had a go at the Future Teller machine that calculated how much they would need when they retire to continue to live comfortably. There were interesting workshops for adults on healthy living and for children sitting for the scholarship exams as well as cricket-centred activations for youths. 


AIA Head of Marketing Suren Perera commented, “Our AIA in Town series of activations have proved to be real value additions to people’s lives. We’re delighted by the response we have had from the residents of Kandy and Galle who have participated with great enthusiasm and appreciated our effort to help them understand the importance of preparing to face the future, especially with regard to the education of their children.”
