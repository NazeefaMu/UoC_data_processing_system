A tree planting ceremony organized by the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) was held at Musali, Mannar in line with the ‘Wanaropa’ tree planting ceremony under the patronage of GSMB Chairman Asela Iddawela recently.
The condition of the land which was selected for the tree planting, had been deteriorating due to excavation and GSMB had taken measures to develop the land in several phases.
Accordingly, the GSMB had erected the fallen trees and the land had been prepared to retain water. Then it had planted around 5,000 plants endemic to the area.
GSMB Director General C.H.E.R. Siriwardane, Senior Director (Excavation) Eng. D. Sajjana de Silva, Chief Internal Auditor E.L Chandrasena, Musali Divisional Secretary, Chairman of the Musali Pradeshiya Sabha, Chief Engineer of the GSMB Anuradhapura Divisional Office Chamila Karunananda and officials participated in the event.
