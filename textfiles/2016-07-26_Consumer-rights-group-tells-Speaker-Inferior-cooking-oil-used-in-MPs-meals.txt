A consumer rights organization has informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that an inferior quality of cooking oil was being used in the parliamentary kitchen to prepare food for the MPs and requested him to investigate the matter.

Consumer Rights Organization President Ranjith Vitanage had complained that errant traders mix coconut oil with substandard palm oil to make undue profits when selling the oil to Parliament.

He said legislators should be served food which was of a proper standard because they were the people's representatives. (Kelum Bandara)
