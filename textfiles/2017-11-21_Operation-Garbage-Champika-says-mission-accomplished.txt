Festering garbage mounds in Colombo has been all cleared up and the city is now completely clean, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said today.

He said the Colombo Beautification Unit which was set up to carry out the task with the assistance of the tri-forces after the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed, had accomplished the task. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
