Cargills Sarubima receives Best Sustainability Project Award

Cargills Sarubima has won the Best Sustainability Project Award 2015 at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Best Corporate Citizen Awards held on November 26.
Cargills Sarubima is a fund established by Cargills (Ceylon) PLC in 2008 in Thanamalwila where the Company initiated a concept of giving-back 50 cents for each kilogram of vegetables purchased from the farmers in the community to be utilized for community empowerment.
Cargills agribusiness teams work directly with farmers to overcome challenges, providing knowledge and resources to help farmers to succeed.
Explaining the concept Ranjit Page, Deputy Chairman of Cargills said, " the relationships we establish with farmers is a bond Cargills has with the fields they sow, the families they nurture, the communities they live in and the schools where their children learn.
Cargills has therefore initiated the Cargills SaruBima fund which is used to empower agriculture communities and their children. "
From Thanamalwila the Funds were later extended to Ruwalwala, Boralanda, Jaffna and Kilinochchi.
"As at 2014 Cargills has awarded over 250 scholarships across all these locations which included many medical, engineering and commerce stream University students.
In addition more than 3,000 farmer families have benefited from community facilities provided through the funds.
Many would call it a CSR project but we have made it an integral part of our core business." For the year 2014/15 benefits included 204 scholarships with 35 University and Vocational education Scholarships, 65 Advanced Level Scholarships and 104 Year 5 Scholarships.
In addition 18 exemplary farmers were recognized for their service to agriculture and the local community with the Cargills SaruBima Farmer Citizens Award 2015 presented by The President.
Cargills has now extended the fund across all its fruit, vegetable and milk collection communities islandwide touching more than 20,000 farmers.
