Korea Programme on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre Director Dr. Byoung Choon Jang conducted a trial performance of the Korean rice transplanting machines recently at the rice model farm village in Rajanganaya, Anuradhapura. 
A total of three Korean rice transplanting machines were donated to the farm village by the KOPIA Centre. 
Under the KOPIA project to improve productivity and quality of rice in Sri Lanka, the trial performance took place and training programmes such as basic agronomic practices and transplanting machine use were provided for 30 selected local farmers. Those farmers began using the Korean transplanting machine in the paddy field and it is expected to save labour effectively in practice. 
On this occasion, Dr. Jang also introduced new technologies regarding paddy soil management, proper fertilizer application and post-harvest management, which will help Sri Lankan farmers develop their farming system. 
The KOPIA Centre was established by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of the Republic of Korea in order to cooperate with Sri Lanka for its agricultural technology development.
