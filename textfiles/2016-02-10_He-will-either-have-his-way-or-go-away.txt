Another conference over filling of the vacant main chair at Alutkade legal department was held at a high place the other day.  Tensions had run high at this conference attended by several purohitas including the one in charge of the subject and several civil society high ups.

 


A certain powerful purohita had insisted that the incumbent second in command in the department should not be appointed to this coveted post under any circumstances. A civil society high up had in response to this pointed out to the purohita handling the subject that problems could arise if the second in command was overlooked. He had suggested in the same breath that an outsider be appointed to the post.  However, the purohita in charge of the subject had rejected these suggestions and added that he would act in the matter of making this key appointment giving due respect to the time-honoured norms and traditions.  “If I am not allowed to act in the manner I want, I would rather quit this portfolio,” the purohita vowed, they say.
