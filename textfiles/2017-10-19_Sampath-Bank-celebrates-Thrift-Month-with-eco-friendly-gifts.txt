Sampath Bank, in its continuing commitment to emphasize the importance of saving, has introduced an exciting gift promotion that will both incentivize and help depositors save money. 


Once again Sampath Bank is celebrating ‘Thrift Month’ in October and during this period is rewarding general savings accountholders with SLS certified LED bulbs that will help them reduce their overall electricity bill while contributing towards an eco-friendly Sri Lanka.


LED bulbs consume less electricity than CFLs, have a longer lifespan and are mercury-free. These gifts were chosen by the bank for the dual purpose of combating the rising cost of electricity and to help accountholders go green.


Savings accountholders will receive one 7W LED bulb for a savings deposit of Rs 20,000 and two 7W and a 9W LED bulb for a savings deposit of Rs 50,000. The bank will issue special vouchers for accountholders to collect their gifts from over 700 dealers across the island.


Commenting on this exciting new promotion, Tharaka Ranwala, Senior Deputy General Manager – Consumer Banking, Sampath Bank PLC said, “As a national financial services provider we see it as our responsibility to encourage our customers to be fiscally responsible by instilling the habit of saving in them. 


“It is also important to consider our impact on the environment thus our choice in gift this year was a conscious effort on our part to help our customers to not only save more but also help them become more eco-friendly. Therefore, we see the introduction of this promotion as not only rewarding our customers but also serving the nation.”


This endeavour will coincide with World Thrift Day on 31st October.


Established in 1987, Sampath Bank has become a state-of-the-art financial institution that continues to be a market leader today thanks to their constant innovation and customer focused approach to business. 


Their unique tailor-made solutions, superior services and convenience of access have allowed Sampath Bank to further differentiate themselves from the competition and make them the bank of choice for many in Sri Lanka.
