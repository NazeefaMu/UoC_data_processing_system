A prominent politico had fallen asleep while participating in a very important conference at national level. 

 


Meanwhile, a picture of this politico in deep slumber at the very conference had appeared on the Facebook and his son had rung him up immediately to convey the disturbing news.


On hearing that somebody had posted his picture on the Facebook the politico had gone into a rage and interrupting the proceedings he had started blackguarding everyone in general for trying to bring him into disrepute.


The bigwig who was presiding over the conference had immediately ordered an inquiry into the incident.
However, it was rumored later that a sidekick of the bigwig who presided over the conference had posted the picture.
