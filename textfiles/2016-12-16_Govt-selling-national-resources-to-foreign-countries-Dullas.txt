The Sri Lanka Police, the Justice Ministry and the Prisons Department will be the only state-owned institutions if the government continues to administer the country till 2020, the joint opposition said today.

JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a media conference that the country's economic hubs would vanish if the government sells our national resources to foreign countries like the move to sell 80 per cent of the Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese company.

“During the tenure of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, the government annexed properties but the opposite is happening now,” he said.

Mr. Alahapperuma said the Yahapalana government was repeatedly breaking the promises it had made to the people.

He said the government remained silent on the alleged assault on a journalist by the Navy Commander at the Hambantota harbour.

“If it had happened during the previous government, the attack may have been interpreted this as an order from Mr. Rajapaksa,” Mr. Alahapperuma said.

MP Keheliya Rambukwella said Sri Lanka would be transformed into a Chinese, Indian and American colony by 2020 considering what this government was doing. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
