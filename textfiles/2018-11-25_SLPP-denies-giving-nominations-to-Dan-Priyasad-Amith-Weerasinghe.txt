The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today categorically denied reports which said it had given nominations to Dan Priyasad and Mahason Balakaya leader Amith Weerasinghe.
 
“We categorically deny reports fueled by the UNP stating that nominations were given to Dan Priyasad and Amith Weerasinghe from the SLPP. The nomination board has not yet begun accepting applications nor have they made a final decision on the candidates,” the SLPP tweeted.
 
"We request the public not to be duped by false claims geared towards tarnishing Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa's name and the party," it said.
