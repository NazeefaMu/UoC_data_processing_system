Infighting within the Tree Party based in the East and led by one from the central hills, has taken a turn for the worse, they say.

 


The party stalwart Segu from the East is said to have ignited the latest bombshell when he posed 10 questions to the party leader and the party’s supreme body relating to some accounts of party funds alleged to have been cooked up at the party headquarters. 


High brass from the party are already engaged in talks aimed at replacing the present leader with someone from the East if acceptable answers to the 10 questions are not forthcoming.


Meanwhile, moves are being made by the high-ups of the party led by the wizard of Wilpattu fame to hook several big names of the strife-torn Tree party.
