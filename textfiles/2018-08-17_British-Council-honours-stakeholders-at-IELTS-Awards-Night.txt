The British Council in Sri Lanka held its IELTS Awards Night on Tuesday, 14August at Kings Court, Cinnamon Lakeside. Initiated in 2010, this annual awards ceremony is hosted by the country’s leading IELTS test centre, with the intention of recognising and celebrating its partner network across the island.

Globally recognised by universities, professional bodies, immigration authorities and other government agencies, IELTS (International English Language Testing System) conforms to the highest international standards of language assessment and is the world’s most popular English language proficiency test for higher education and global migration. The test is recognised by more than 10,000 organisations in over 140 countries including the USA, with over 3 million tests conducted over the world in 2017 alone.

Commenting on the IELTS-British Council success story, Gill Caldicott, Country Manager of the British Council in Sri Lanka and Chief Guest at the ceremony said: “IELTS is a flagship product of the British Council and the interest in taking an IELTS is growing worldwide at a rate of 11% per year. The British Council is proud to be facilitating and supporting an internationally recognized English proficiency test for Sri Lankans who are looking for opportunities around the world to accesstheir further education, boost their careers, and realise their ambitions.”

The IELTS-British Council partnership scheme, ADDvantage, enables individuals and organisations across the country to register IELTS candidates on behalf of the British Council, and in turn offers members a number of benefits, including access to information sessions, promotional material, as well as teacher, brand, and registration system training.
