Personal security officers providing security to three Northern provincial councillors including the Opposition Leader have been withdrawn without an earlier notice, Northern Provincial Councillor Anandi Sashidaran claimed today.
She said the police officer who was serving in her personal security division since last April has left yesterday citing that he had been summoned to the particular police station where he had been serving.
“The police had not informed me with regard to the security withdrawal. They should have given me reasons for the sudden decision,” Ms. Sashidaran said.
Further, Northern Provincial Opposition Leader Sinnadurei Thavaraja and another Provincial Councillor Kanagarathnam Vindan had also claimed that their security had been withdrawn with effect from last afternoon.
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran had been informed by the three PC members regarding the security withdrawal. (Romesh Madushanka)
