Kumara to trigger Privilege issue in House tomorrow


	

UPFA MP Kumara Welgama would raise a Privilege issue in Parliament tomorrow over the incident in which Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) officers inspected his residence in search of unauthorised vehicles belonging to the Government, the Joint Opposition (JO) said today.

The JO said the Police had raided the Matugama residence of Mr. Welgama on an open warrant without giving a specific reason.

“An MP, who had obtained 200,000 votes, should not be treated as a criminal.  The Police officers should have at least consulted the Speaker prior to the raid. The Speaker should ensure the safety of the MPs,” MP Bandula Gunawardane told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
