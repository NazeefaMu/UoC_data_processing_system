UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra today alleged that a person had called her aunt, who was residing abroad and had threatened to put an end to her political career if she failed to accept a Ministerial portfolio.

Ms Premachnadra told a media briefing that her aunt had told the caller that she would not accept any portfolio.

“My aunt had told the caller that her niece cannot be bought over. Then the caller said they would destroy my political career,” she alleged.

She said she had been made many offers to join the new Government by many individuals.

“I have recorded all phone calls given to be offering various things but I don’t want to reveal them to the public now as the true face of some Buddhist Monks and even Christian priests would be revealed if I did so,” she said.

Referring to the speech made by President Sirisena on Monday, Ms Premachandra said one should not refer to another’s private life. (Yohan Perera)
