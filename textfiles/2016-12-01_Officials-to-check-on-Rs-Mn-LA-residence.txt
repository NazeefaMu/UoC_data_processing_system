Officials from the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington will be sent to California to investigate the alleged spending of Rs 27 million on a residence for the Consul General in Los Angeles at the time the post fell vacant in 2013, informed sources said today.

This comes in the wake of Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera disclosing in Parliament on Wednesday that Rs.27 million had been spent for the utility bills of this residence even though there was no consul general occupying the residence.

He alleged that former defense secretary Gotanaya Rajapaksa's son had occupied this residence during this time.

However Mr. Rajapaksa denied this allegation.(Yohan Perera)
