New laws to curb social media slander

The Justice Ministry is contemplating new laws to control defamation and slander over social media following a proposal by the Law Commission to consider such cases as offences punishable under the criminal law.
More than 2,000 complaints involving Facebook and Twitter were reported to the authorities in the first seven months of this year, newly released figures revealed. According to Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT CC), officers across the country saw a sharp rises in the number of people complaining that they had been abused, harassed and threatened on the popular social media sites. The soaring volume of crimes associated with Facebook and Twitter has placed increasing pressure on the authorities.
Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe responding to the proposals by the Law Commission at a public event said his ministry was currently studying several proposals in this regard and hinted that new laws might be drafted soon.
According to Police, Facebook slander has been the main reason for several suicides which occurred in recent times, with the victims mainly being youth.
Meanwhile, SLERT CC says that around 80 percent of social media complaints revolve around fake accounts.
