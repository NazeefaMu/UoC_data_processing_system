Denying allegations made by the government MPs that there are private armouries in Hambantota, the UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday said violence were unleashed in the area only during the 1980s.
Mr. Rajapaksa was referring to some allegations made by Minister of Housing and Samurdhi Sajith Premadasa in Parliament yesterday.
Also Mr Rajapaksa requested the government MPS not to insult the SLFP youth movement. He however accepted that the Nil Balakaya was engaged in canvassing during the presidential elections but pointed out that it never engaged in any political violence.
He recalled that SLFP had won several elections in the past but never unleashed violence on the losing rivals.
Mr  Rajapaksa questioned as to why the present regime is unleashing violence on SLFP members when the party had pledged its support for the hundred day programme.
Earlier Minister Premadasa said there are several privately owned armouries in Hambantota. He listed out the names of some underworld figures who led violence during elections.
Mr Premadasa accused the Nil Balakaya which he called Sunaka Balakaya of engaging in violence during the presidential elections. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
