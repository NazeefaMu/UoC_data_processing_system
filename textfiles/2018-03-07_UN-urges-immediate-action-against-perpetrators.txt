The United Nations in Sri Lanka today urged authorities to take immediate action against perpetrators who ignite violence and requested the government to ensure that appropriate measures are swiftly taken to restore normalcy in affected areas.

“The UN is concerned about the recent incidents of communal violence and condemns these acts in the strongest possible terms. The UN also urges authorities, and all citizens to ensure that the rule of law is upheld, human rights are protected, and security and safety is ensured for all,” it said.
