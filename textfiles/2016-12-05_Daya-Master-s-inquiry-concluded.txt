Daya Master's inquiry concluded


	

The case against former LTTE Spokesman Daya Master was concluded by Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya on the instructions of the Attorney General today.

The CID informed court that the Attorney General had already filed a case against Daya Master in Vavuniya High Court over detaining civilians in the LTTE custody as hostages during the last stages of the war, therefore asked to finish the Magisterial inquiry.

The Magisterial inquiry was initiated by the CID against Daya Master and former interpreter of LTTE George Master, when they surrendered to the Army at the Omanthai Army Post in April 2009. 

George Master was earlier discharged from the inquiry on AG's instructions. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
