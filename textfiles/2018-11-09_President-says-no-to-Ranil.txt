President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly told the TNA parliamentary group yesterday that he would not reappoint UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister even if his party secured a majority in Parliament.

He met with the TNA delegation on Wednesday and discussed the current political situation. He reportedly asked the TNA to abstain from the vote of no confidence if it were moved.

However, the TNA said it had taken a decision to vote against the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. In response, the President is reported to have said that he will not reappoint Mr. Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.

Meanwhile, the President assured the parliamentary of his UPFA on Wednesday evening that he would, for sure, secure the required majority to form a stable administration, and therefore no one in the party should worry about it. (Kelum Bandara)
