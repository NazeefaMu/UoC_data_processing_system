The UNP would form a new unity Government by Monday (9) with SLFP and other constituent partners who would not support the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said.

Minister Senaratne said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe would begin the selection of Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers from Thursday (5) itself from the UNP and from among constituent partners of the Yahapalana Government, who had not insulted and spread various lies, fabrications and distortions against the Premier, against President and against the Government.

Addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing in Parliament today, Minister Senaratne said the people in the country would witness a totally different and new approach of the Yahapalana Government that would fulfil all their aspirations, hopes that they expected from the Government in 2015.
