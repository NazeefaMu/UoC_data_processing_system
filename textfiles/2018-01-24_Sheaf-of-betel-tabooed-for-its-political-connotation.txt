Sheaf of betel tabooed for its political connotation


	



 

The Pohottuwa activists across the country have received an order from the party headquarters not to make the customary offering of a sheaf of betel when welcoming their party leader, the former Number One in the country, they say.

 


This taboo on the sheaf of betel may appear preposterous at a glance. But the party has imposed it with good reason; when one is offered a sheaf of betel as a token of welcome, the recipient would raise joined hands holding the sheaf to acknowledge the greeting. And the betel leaf is the symbol of the Blue party-led alliance, the main rival of Pohottuwa


Of course, Pohottuwa has suggested an alternative; to offer a Lotus flower bouquet to the party leader as a token of their welcome!
