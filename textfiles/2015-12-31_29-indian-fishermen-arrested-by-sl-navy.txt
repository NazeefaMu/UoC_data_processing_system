Sri Lanka Navy has assisted the Sri Lanka Coast Guard to arrest 29 Indian fishermen along with three fishing trawlers poaching in Sri Lankan waters in the Northeast of Kokilai on Wednesday.
Navy Spokesman Captain Akram Alevi said the arrested fishermen were brought to Trincomalee along with the trawlers and handed over to the Trincomalee Harbour Police.
Indian media reported that this is the third such incident in December. On 17 December, four Tamil Nadu fishermen were arrested for fishing near Delft Island and two days after, six fishermen were arrested off the Pudukottai district by the Sri Lankan navy.
