Yoshitha Rajapaksa, one of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s sons, carried out a motor spare parts business through the State-run SriLankan Airlines abusing his father’s powers, UNP Spokesman and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam alleged at a media conference today.
The Minister levelled the accusations based on the recently issued Weliamuna Report, which highlighted many transactions, manipulations of service contracting, recruitment of unqualified staff and major in-flight security breaches at SriLankan Airlines during the time of former government.
The Minister said that the SriLankan Airline's London Manager, who noticed and opposed Yoshitha’s business, had been transferred with immediate effect as a result of an order from the former President.
“The order had been given by the former president. We don’t want to take revenge from anybody. But, people should be aware of the truth and what the whole Rajapaksa family did to our country by exploiting public money for their satisfaction. Even flights had been changed by them for their personal matters,” Kariyawasam said.
He also thanked Attorney J.C. Weliamuna for finishing the report on time so that government would be able to file criminal action against the wrongdoers.
The statement on the report, issued on Saturday by the Prime Minister’s office, charged gross abuse of power by Airline’s former Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe. (Piyumi Fonseka)
