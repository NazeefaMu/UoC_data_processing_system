Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva opined that the life imprisonment sentence should be brought in to punish reckless drivers in the same way that President Maithripala Sirisena had proposed the re-introduction of capital punishment for drug traffickers.

The minister made this observation when he declared open a new computer-based driving license examination centre at Werahera yesterday. He said the time had come to implement harsh punishments for reckless drivers.

“There are situations which we cannot prevent vehicle accidents. But driving in an irresponsible manner cannot be considered normal,” he said. Referring to a head-on collision involving a bus at Gokarella recently, Minister De Silva said more than 60 passengers were injured and it was a clear act of negligence that caused it.

“In these circumstances there is no need to charge those drivers under the Motor Traffic Act for negligence. They should be charged under the penal code for homicide," he said.

Therefore, I request the law enforcement authorities to submit a comprehensive report which would enable the reckless drivers to undergo severe punishments. They should be charged for a non-bailable offence, he said, adding that a procedure should be formulated to punish these offenders after considering the seriousness of the accident.
