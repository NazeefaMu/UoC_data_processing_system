Commenting on President Maithripala Sirisena's request for Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to take up the post of Army Commander or Overall Commander for two years, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said the President was not speaking seriously and was only joking about it.

Addressing the weekly Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) media briefing today Minister Dissanayaka said the request for the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for the post of Army Commander was not needed and it was not a serious appointment by the President.

“I personally admire appointing Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for the post. After we finished the 30 year civil war, there will be no serious situations except for protests.

“If there is anything serious we will also get involved without doubt. There is no need of having special units. The appointment is fine to streamline the services of the Army,” Minister Dissanayaka said.

Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday President Maithripala Sirisena had requested Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to quit the ministerial portfolio and take up the post of Army Commander or Overall Commander for two years to discipline the country.

There he told that Field Marshal Fonseka was known as a well-disciplined personality in the country and that he would expedite investigations over several issues as well.

He however said it needed creating Special Acts of Parliament to do so.

But nothing can be done in the country even if there was a special unit. There is law at present in the country to establish such units, he said.

“Otherwise the white-van culture should be taken up as the previous regime,” he said.

However addressing the media, Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said the request should be treated as a serious matter.

“Several underhand forces are operational to hinder the development of the country. For that there should be special forces to suppress them,” Minister Zoysa said.

Accordingly, President’s thought it was a serious thing. The Government should be strong to protect the country.

“The Government’s main responsibility is to protect the civilians,” the minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
