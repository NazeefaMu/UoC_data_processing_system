The air traffic controllers today decided to continue their work-to-rule campaign due to the unsuccessful discussion with the interim committee appointed by the Minister, Sri Lanka Air Traffic Controllers’ Association (SLATCA) Vice President Tharindu Gajadeera said.

He said a meeting with the interim committee which was appointed by the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva was held today at the Ministry.

“During the meeting, the Ministry was unable to provide an acceptable interim solution for the allowance anomaly and therefore discussion was unsuccessful,” he said.

After the discussion the SLATCA had informed the Ministry secretary that it had decided to continue their work-to-rule campaign after 4.45 p.m. this evening,” he said.

The discussion was held with the Transport Ministry secretary and with the presence of Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) at the ministry today.

Yesterday the SLATCA decided to suspend their work-to-rule campaign which commenced on Monday (3) after the Minster assured a favourable response for their issues within a week.

“The Minister had admitted that there was an anomaly in the payment of allowances in mid June 2015 and promised to provide a favourable reply within a week” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
