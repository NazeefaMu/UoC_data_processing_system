Police in Washington State were searching for at least one gunman Friday evening after at least four people were shot and killed at a mall north of Seattle.

Washington State Patrol spokesman Sgt. Mark Francis told KCPQ that the victims were shot inside the Macy's store at the Cascade Mall in Burlington shortly before 7 p.m. local time.

Francis tweeted that the suspect was described as a Hispanic male wearing gray who was last seen walking toward Interstate 5. Francis added that there may be more shooters and police were in the process of clearing the mall.

It was not immediately clear whether there had been any non-fatal injuries. Francis told KCPQ that authorities had to clear the mall before EMS personnel could enter the building.  

Authorities have closed all access roads and streets surrounding the mall until further notice.

Burlington is located approximately 65 miles north of Seattle. The Cascade Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Burlington, Washington that opened in 1990, according to the mall's website. It features J.C. Penney, TJ Maxx, and Macy's stores, among other stores, restaurants and a movie theater. (Fox News)
