State Minister of International Trade and Development Strategies Sujeewa Senasinghe today suggested that all journalists who reported on the proceedings of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) should be summoned to Parliament to determine as to how information was leaked.

“There is no provision to report on the proceedings of COPE as it is not open to the media," he said. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
