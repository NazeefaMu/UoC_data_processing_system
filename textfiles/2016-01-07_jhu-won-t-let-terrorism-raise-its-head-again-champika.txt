The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today it would not allow terrorism to raise its head again or allow clauses in the Constitution concerning the unitary state and giving priority to Buddhism be amended.
“Only a PSC will be appointed on January 9 to seek opinions on introducing constitutional reforms to the present Constitution which gives priority to amend the election system. We will not allow any changes to the unitary state or giving priority to Buddhism which will need referendum to do so,” JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Commenting on the rumours that a new constitution would be brought without the unitary state and priority to Buddhism on January 9, Minister Ranawaka said that no new Constitution or Draft Bill would be brought on that day but only a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to seek opinions on introducing constitutional reforms would be appointed.
He said certain racist groups in the South were trying to spread rumours that separatism and terrorism was raising its head again while Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran was also trying to give life to the separatism.
“Even though some racist groups were spreading rumours about terrorism raising its head again, there is no such thing happening in the country. Such racist groups have no place in society now,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
