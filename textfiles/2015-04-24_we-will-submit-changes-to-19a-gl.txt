In the wake of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee (CC) deciding to support the 19th Amendment on a matter of principle, the party said it would support the enactment of the constitutional amendment subject to the incorporation of certain provisions it had proposed.
SLFP CC member G.L. Peiris told a news conference today that the party would submit these amendments on Monday.
He said the government had sought to prohibit MPs crossing over, but even though political crossovers were unacceptable as a matter of principle, the MPs were entitled to act according to their conscience.  
Mr. Peiris said such rights cherished in representative democracy, should not be subdued under the iron fist of their political party leaders.
He said that based on a proposal by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardane the opposition would call for the appointment of only MPs to the Constitutional Council instead of outsiders.
Mr. Peiris said the government had sought to reduce the size of the Cabinet to 30 but through the new constitutional amendment, the number could be increased in the event of a national government. He said this was not acceptable to his party.
“Today, we have 77 MPs holding portfolios. We cannot allow that to happen. There cannot be a national government formed by two parties,” Mr. Peiris said. (KB)Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
