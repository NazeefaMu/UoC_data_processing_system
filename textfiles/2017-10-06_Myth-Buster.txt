MYTH: Wearing someone else’s spectacles can damage your eyesight.  

BUSTED: “No, it will not cause any harm to the eyes. If you wear someone else’s spectacles it may not be compatible and there might be some discomfort.. If you wear a spectacle that is compatible for you, for example if the person is myopic lets say 1.5 and the other person is wearing the same lenses then nothing will happen. If the type is different then there will be a certain amount of discomfort but nothing will happen to the eye. When you remove the glasses the discomfort will go,” explained Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital.
