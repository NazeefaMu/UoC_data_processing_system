MYTH: Acne will disappear when you are an adult.

BUSTED: “This is partially true. When it comes to acne, it will usually disappear when you are past your 20s in about 90% of cases.You get acne due to hormonal changes that occur during adolescence. But there is a percentage of people who develop acne in their 30s and 40s. In these cases, acne is caused by hormonal disorders or cosmetics applied to the face. A small majority of people who have had severe cases of acne in their childhood can also develop acne in adulthood. For some people, their food intake and acne can be related.”
