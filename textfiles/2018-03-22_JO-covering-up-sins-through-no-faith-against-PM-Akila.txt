JO covering up sins through no-faith against PM: Akila


	

The joint opposition is attempting to cover up its misdeeds by moving a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, said UNP Deputy General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.

While vowing to defeat the no-confidence motion, Minister Kariyawasam said the joint opposition was trying to dodge legal action over its past frauds, corruptions and carnage.

“The joint opposition is attempting to wash away its sins through the no-confidence motion. UNP MPs will not support this cause. I hope there will never be such brainless people in the UNP. Parliamentarians who are faithful to the UNP and willing to punish the culprits will never support this motion,” he said.

The joint opposition yesterday handed over the no-confidence motion, signed by 55 parliamentarians (51 JO and four SLFP MPs), to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
