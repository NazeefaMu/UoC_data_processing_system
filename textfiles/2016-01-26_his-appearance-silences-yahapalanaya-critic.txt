The former Madam was paying her last respects to the party veteran from Kantale when she came face to face with a certain political party leader and a Diyawanna member whom she had not met for a long time.  
After exchanging pleasantries, the threesome found themselves engaged in a discourse on the topical political matters. The Diyawanna member who was more articulate than the other two told the Madam that he was not happy about the way the government was running its affairs. 
The former Madam who played a decisive role in bringing the yahapalanya to power was quietly listening making an occasional nod, but made no response, they say. 
While this discourse was in progress, the Big Boss turned up at the funeral house to pay his last respects. And the Diyawanna member who was critical of yahapalanaya immediately faded from the scene, they say.
