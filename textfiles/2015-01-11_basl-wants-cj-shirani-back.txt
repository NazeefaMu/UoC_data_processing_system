The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) had urged the newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena to arrange necessary measures to reinstate the 43rd Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, who was impeached by Parliament in January 2013.
BASL Secretary Ajith Pathirana told that the BASL made this request at a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday (10).
He told the Daily Mirror that it received a positive response from the President and Prime Minister and further stated the matter would be discussed at the BASL Executive Committee Meeting soon.
Pathirana stated that the BASL made a request to reinstate 43rd Chief Justice since she was subjected to political victimisation and lost her position through a wrongful impeachment procedure.
The BASL observed that the President of the republic has power to appoint the judges of the Supreme Court in accordance with the article 107 of the constitution.
Parliament voted to remove 43rd Chief Justice from office in January 2013 through an impeachment motion alleging corruption.
It was carried with 155 voting in favour and 49 against. However, she has denied the allegations. (LS)
