Happily using official vehicle even after retirement


	

The brother-in-law of a former senior purohita from Wayamba who headed an Apprentice Training Centre had taken away with him the Centre’s vehicle when he went on retirement, they say.




The training centre had taken this vehicle on rent and the retired head is said to be using the vehicle for private transport purposes while the Centre is regularly paying a monthly rental of Rs.186,000.


The Centre had paid the last month’s rental too though the vehicle is no longer available for its official purposes.
