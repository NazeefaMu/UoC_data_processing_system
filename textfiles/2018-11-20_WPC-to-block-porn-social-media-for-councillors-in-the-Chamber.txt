Steps have been taken to block access to websites with pornography and social media from the computers of the Western Provincial Council (WPC) Chamber after some councillors had reportedly watched porn during the Budget presentation, Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said today.

It was reported that when the Chief Minister was presenting the Budget for the year 2019 at the council’s new chamber, some councillors had allegedly watched porn from Chamber’s computers.

Chief Minister Devapriya said he had instructed Western Province Chief Secretary to look into the incident and conduct an investigation.

“If such an incident had taken place, specially during the budget presentation, it is regretful. Computers and other facilities were not given to watch social media or to watch films. Those facilities were for the use of council’s work. I have instructed the Chief Secretary to obtain a report from relevant institutions which can look into the searching histories. The councillors should have paid attention to the budget presentation,” he said.

He said initially he had informed the Sri Lanka Telecom which is the network provider for the computer devices to block social media and unnecessary web sites from the chambers computers.

“ It a fault of the SLT as well if they haven’t blocked these sites even after I instructed them to do so. However, we are still looking into this,” he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
