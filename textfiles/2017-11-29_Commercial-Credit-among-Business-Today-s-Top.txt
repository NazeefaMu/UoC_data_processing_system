Commercial Credit and Finance PLC, one of Sri Lanka’s premier financial services organisations was presented the prestigious Business Today Top 30 award for the year 2016/2017.


The Business Today Top 30 awards recognise the contribution made by Sri Lanka’s corporates to the economy of the country.


This year, the Business Today Awards commemorated its 20th year at a gala function held recently at the Shangri-La Hotel under the patronage of Chief Guest Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe. Awards were conferred on listed companies within diverse fields in the private sector.
“We are honoured to be selected for this coveted award for the first time. To be chosen among the best has proved that our efforts have been recognised and appreciated by the business community and our country. Our dreams of reaching the zenith of the corporate sphere are gradually becoming a reality,” said Commercial Credit Chairman Cecil Perera.


A trailblazer in the corporate sector, Commercial Credit has set the benchmark for the highest standards of service and performance. Having established itself in 1982 as a finance company in Kandy solely focused in the agriculture sector, the company has, since its strategic change in management in 2010, been on an upward trend emerging as a strong member in the corporate sector of Sri Lanka.


Perera said that this award is a gigantic achievement in the revolutionary journey which began six years ago consequent to a change in management. “At that time, the company had 100 employees spread over 12 geographic locations. Through a gradual process of making dreams a reality, staff strength has grown to over 3500 members operating within 118 locations”.


Backed by an expert and experienced team of professionals, Commercial Credit is dedicated to offering pioneering and innovative solutions designed to enhance the requirements of its ever-growing clientele.


Commercial Credit strongly believes in its purpose of ‘building leaders to uplift the lives of people through simple acts of love’ and made innovative changes to the organization and culture. Among the most inspirational changes made within the company structure has been the reduction of the levels in the organisation. Irrespective of their levels, all employees in a particular department have the same designation and workstations without cubicles. Commercial Credit also places immense value on all employees who are treated with respect. In order to develop them on a regular basis, Commercial Credit invests heavily in trainings and also plans to invest in building a state-of-the-art residential training centre in the near future.


During the 2016/2017 financial year Commercial Credit received national and international awards in recognition of the brand and the ability to live according to the principles set forth. Noteworthy awards include Best Advertisement of the Year at the SLIM Neilsen Peoples Awards 2016, Most Effective Brand of the Year at the Effie Awards 2016, Marketing Campaign of the Year at 6th CMO Asia Awards, National Winner - Marketing Company of the Year at Asia Marketing Excellence Awards 2016. The company also figured in one of the biggest transactions on the Colombo Stock Exchange when Group Lease PLC of Thailand acquired a 29.99 percent stake for Rs.10.5 billion.


“Our dreams began as small steps and are now becoming reality through sheer determination and team work along with the ability to satisfy the multi-faceted needs of each of our valuable customers whose confidence and patronage we value greatly,” Perera concluded.
