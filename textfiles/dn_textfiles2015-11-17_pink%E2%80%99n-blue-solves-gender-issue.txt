Pink’n blue solves a gender issue!

Do you think as adults we actually control the show? Ask the kids. They really imagine I am a pushover and that they rule the roost? Well here is a news flash. Many of them do. I realised the other day that I do not call the shots in my home at all. Actually, I will go as far to say that our 21 month old is a tyrant. Although she is extremely beautiful, funny, smart and brave she runs the house with an iron fist. It is either her way or the highway as far as she is concerned.
In fact, she didn’t talk to me for 25 minutes the other morning because she did not feel like she had to wear shoes and socks to playschool. No matter how much bribing I did, or how many promises I made, she stood her ground or rather plunked her bottom on the floor looking into the distance. So we carried her out to the car shoeless.
Then there is the story about little Kingco. One morning, our then one-and-a-half-year-old opened the bottom bathroom drawer. Upon finding his grandmother’s makeup, he began breathing heavily with excitement and began staggering around.
What a haul! What loot! Imagine his disappointment when, just as he was about to pry the shiny cap off a red lipstick, I picked him up and carried him out of the bathroom. I didn’t congratulate him on his discovery. I didn’t point him in the direction of the hallway’s white walls and say, “My home is your canvas. Go forth and create.” Instead, I ruined everything for him.
My friend Domani hates kids. And they don’t take much of a fancy to him either. He must have been around about 18 when his aunt handed him her baby. “Here, hold her,” his aunt said as she held out her baby. “No, thanks,” he said. Oh, come on, she likes you!” The baby smiled at him with a goofy baby grin.
“No, really, she’ll break somehow,” Domani intoned. He knew that as soon as he held the kid there would be an earthquake. He imagined the shaking ground would pop her out of his arms and out of the window into the bushes below. “Come on, surely you’ve held a baby before?” his aunt said.
Mothers always want people like Domani who hate babies to hold their babies. He thinks that they think it will get him all excited about babies and that maybe he’ll run out of the door and propose to a beautiful woman. In his own words Domani says: “The mothers think I might run to the nearest attractive woman and say: “Hey, I just held a baby! It was wonderful! What do you say we have five or six of our own!”
Poor old Domani. He thinks that babies aren’t built for holding. He says that the baby head is too big for the baby body. According to him it swivels and swings around like a tethered ball. And the hands are too small to grip on anything well. So they hold on to his ears and twist them like they are tuning a radio. He says that it would be easier if you could grab them by the back of the neck like a cat picks up a kitten. Or there should be handles on their shoulders like a bowling ball bag.
Now attempting to hold his aunt’s baby he was as wary as a bomb disposal expert. He held her at arm’s length like a bottle of nitroglycerin. “You’re doing it all wrong. Hold her like this,” his aunt said, taking her highly explosive baby back to demonstrate. “You put your arm underneath her butt to support her.”
Just then her husband chimed in, “ Hey, did she go yet?” Domani was perplexed. Go? Where is the kid going to go. For gosh sakes, she’s only eight months old. Domani’s aunt hoisted the kid in the air and sniffed the back end of her expensive designer label overalls. “No, she’s fine.”
Domani was listening to this major topic of conversation about parental waste management. Did she go? When was the last time she went? Does she need changing? Then they hold her up and smell her and thump her butt like a melon at the supermarket. Yeah, she’s ripe! Just watching his aunt sniff the baby’s rear end gave Domani the creeps. He adamantly refused attempting to hold her again until he put on a full body eco-suit.
Domani suggested spraying the kid down with some Lysol and was tempted to ask for a pair of yellow rubber gloves. Then there was little Kingco who at three visited his twin cousins for the first time. The babies were in a single bed. Little Kingco wanted to know whether they were boys or girls. His sister Moya said she did not know.
“How could you tell the difference. They are just tiny babies?” Moya said. Kingco answered: “No I’ll just climb into their bed peek under the covers and find out.” He carefully manoeuvred himself into the babies’ bed and disappeared between the blankets. After a while he resurfaced with a big grin on his face. “Well,” asked Moya, “did you find out?”
“Yes,” said Kingco pointing to one twin . “This one is a girl and the other is a boy.” Moya looked at her little brother with admiration: “You are so clever. But how can you tell?” The little guy replied: “It’s quite easy really. One has got pink booties and the other’s booties are blue.”
