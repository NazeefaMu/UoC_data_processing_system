The government said that the controversial Port City Project–Colombo has been ‘automatically stopped’ as there were many unanswerable questions on the project and many shortcomings in the Environment Impact Assessment Report as well as the feasibility study report.  
Speaking to journalists at yesterday’s weekly cabinet news briefing, acting cabinet spokesman, Minister LakshmanKiriella said the government would re-visit and re-negotiate the project based on the mutual consent of both China and Sri Lanka.  
“The Port City Project has been automatically stopped as there were so many shortcomings in the EIA report. We must go through it and rectify those shortcomings before re-start the project,” Minister Kiriella stressed.  
Commenting on the next week’s official visit to India by President MaithripalaSirisena, Minister Kiriella said that both China and India were close friends and allies of Sri Lanka and had a mutual relationship with Sri Lanka. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
