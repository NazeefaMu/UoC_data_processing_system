BoardPAC, the Sri Lanka-developed iPad-enabled board governance portal, recently participated in the annual Corporate Governance Conference of Chartered Secretaries South Africa (CSSA) for the second consecutive year, gaining further exposure to top corporate entities in that country.
BoardPAC was the only Sri Lankan company at the two-day event, which was held at the Wanderers Club, Johannesburg.
The conference was attended by a distinguished group of more than 200 directors, company secretaries and delegates from leading companies in South Africa. The conference provided a platform for regulatory representatives and distinguished business leaders to share their experiences in their respective areas of expertise.
“Forums like the CSSA Corporate Governance Conference are most appropriate for the demonstration of BoardPAC’s sophisticated and highly secure features that enable paperless board meetings and facilitate corporate governance,” the company’s CEO Lakmini Wijesundera said.
“We were delighted to be back at this forum and to further consolidate our position in the South African market.”
Also present at the conference was Entelect and Converged Infrastructure Solutions (CIS), two leading software solutions providers that are BoardPAC’s partners in South Africa. Entelect CEO Shashi Hansjee said that apart from secure electronic delivery of board materials, BoardPAC has a robust capability to handle large volumes of sensitive information.
“The availability of a dedicated help desk, provided by Entelect’s technical professionals means that we are on hand to ensure that any board member will be able to navigate and access secure documents anytime,” he said.
A National Best Quality Software Gold award and Green IT award winner, BoardPAC provides users the ability to view and approve papers from the ease of a Board Member’s iPad. It has a host of features such as collaboration, meeting management and RSVP, the ability to search and refer to past board papers, as well as to annotate and approve documents and update agendas. The solution meets with the highest security standards including the ISO 27001 certification.
The solution already has the largest market share for board meeting automation in Sri Lanka and in Malaysia and is emerging as a strong player across the globe and in South Africa as well with Deloitte & Touché, one of the big four companies in that country and the Banking Association of South Africa (BASA) using it. BoardPAC is a trusted board automation solution used by leading companies in Sri Lanka, including Carson Cumberbatch PLC, John Keells Holdings, Commercial Bank, Nations Trust Bank, Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Telecom, Hemas and MAS Holdings as well as the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
