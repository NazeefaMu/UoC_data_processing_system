'Gammanpila, MR's nemesis'

The same fate that befell the proverbial goat who got his head stuck inside a pot will befall former President Mahinda Rajapaksa due to the antics of the group led by Udaya Gammanpila, said Rural Economy Minister P.Harrison.
The Minister said so addressing a meeting held at the Animal Production and Health Department office at Gannoruwa on February 2.
He said the Wimal , Gammanpila duo who had won elections by getting onto the SLFP bandwagon were trying to hang on to Mahinda Rajapaksa continuously because they had no future.
Instead of visiting the Abhayarama temple and indulging in politics it would be better for the former President bow out of politics gracefully and enjoy life in retirement.
Minister Harrison said the country spent nearly Rs 40,000 million on milkfood imports annually which amounted to a daily expenditure of about Rs 10 million. As such steps should be taken to further improve local milk production to ease this heavy burden on the country's exchequer.
He said a programme had also been launched on the initiative of the President to make the country self sufficient in green gram, kurakkan, meneri and ground nuts.
Ministry Secretary Renuka Ekanayake and Hewaheta UNP organiser Shanthini Kongahage were also present on the occasion.
