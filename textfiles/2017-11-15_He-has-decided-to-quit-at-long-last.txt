Diyawanna members would meet in the lobby to have a friendly chat or to have a laugh over some tit-bits floating around whenever they get a break from their day’s work. There are times when some of them come out with even top state secrets by way of amusing anecdotes at these gossip sessions.

 


A group of backbenchers who met in the lobby the other day were discussing the endless squabbling between some Greens and Blues in yahapalanaya when one of them brought up the latest news about a senior Blue party purohita hailing from an oft-flood-hit region in the country. 


This senior Blue purohita is said to be much down-hearted these days due to all his persistent efforts to re-unite the two factions having gone down the drain. He had been pursuing this goal undeterred despite constant nagging by his better half to quit yahapalanaya and throw in his lot with the former big boss. 


The latest news is that this senior purohita has now decided to make the move that he had been postponing for a long time; to quit yahapalanaya and had already conveyed the happy tidings to his better half!


He has timed the exit to coincide it with the announcement of the day for the local polls, yes, of course, to trigger a pro-JO opinion wave. One or two colleagues of his too will follow suit making a dramatic effect on the political scene!
