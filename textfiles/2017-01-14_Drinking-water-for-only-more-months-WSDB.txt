Drinking water for only 2 more months: WSDB


	

The Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB) has cautioned about a possible water scarcity and curtailment of water supply if the prevailing dry weather continued, while insisting that drinking water was now available for only two more months.

If the present conditions continue to prevail restrictions on water supply would have to be enforced and divisional engineers in vulnerable areas have been requested to send in their suggestion in this connection, the Board said.

The distribution of water in areas of Kurunegala has already been curtailed.

Meanwhile the WSDB has taken measures to supply water by bowsers in areas where water resources have been badly affected due to the drought. (Jayantha Samarakone)
