First aid convoys reach Syria’s Ghouta


	



 

BEIRUT (REUTERS) March 5-Aid convoys reached a crossing point into Syria’s eastern Ghouta on Monday, a witness said, bringing the first relief to the besieged enclave since one of the deadliest government assaults of the seven-year war began two weeks ago.   


 A World Health Organization (WHO) official said government authorities had stripped most medical material from U.N. vehicles, preventing surgical kits, insulin, dialysis equipment and other supplies from reaching the enclave of 400,000 people.   


 President Bashar al-Assad vowed on Sunday to continue a military push into the biggest remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus, saying the offensive did not contradict five-hour ceasefires arranged each day by his main ally Russia.   


 A wider, full ceasefire backed by the U.N. Security Council has not come into effect during the campaign, which began with massive government air strikes two weeks ago and has continued in recent days with a ground assault.
