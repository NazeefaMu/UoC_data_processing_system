Pakistan's Amir in Bangladesh on redemption road

DHAKA, MONDAY: Mohammad Amir's last appearance on a cricket pitch outside his native Pakistan led to a six-month sentence in a British prison for corruption.
Five years on, the paceman was the headline act in the opening match as Bangladesh's Twenty20 league staged its own comeback after a fixing scandal. But as Amir and the Bangladesh Premier League look to turn over a new leaf, one of cricket's most respected figures, Kumar Sangakkara, says the game could "die" if spectators are not convinced matches are clean.
Amir, playing for the Chittagong Vikings against the Rangpur Riders, took four for 30 on Sunday, delighted to be competing once more against stars such as Pakistan's Test skipper Misbah ul-Haq whom he bowled with a perfect yorker at Dhaka's national stadium.
Amir, now 23, was jailed in 2011 after admitting bowling no balls the previous summer against England at Lord's in exchange for cash. AFP
