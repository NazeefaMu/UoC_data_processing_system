Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should take charge of penalizing those found guilty of the Central Bank bond issue, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament today.

He welcomed President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to appoint a Special Presidential Commission. "We are thankful to the President for appointing a commission even though it comes late in the day," the MP said.

He said the probe must inquire into how Perpetual Treasuries earned Rs.21 billion in 21 months and as to why the EPF risked people's hard-earned savings to purchase bonds from Perpetual Treasuries.

The MP urged the government to cancel the primary dealer license of Perpetual Treasuries and said arrangements should be made to recover the losses incurred by the government from those involved in the controversy.

He revealed that the Auditor General was subjected to threats by some COPE members during its investigations,” he said.  (Yohan Perera)
