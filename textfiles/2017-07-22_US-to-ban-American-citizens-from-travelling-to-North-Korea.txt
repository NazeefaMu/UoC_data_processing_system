US, (Daily Mail), 21 July 2017 -  Two tourist agencies that operate tours to North Korea said on Friday the U.S. government will soon ban its citizens from travelling to the North.  


Koryo Tours said the ban would be announced on July 27 and would go into effect 30 days later.   
It said the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which handles consular affairs for the United States in the North, informed it of the ban, but did not say how long it would last. ‘But it does seem to be the case that in just over a month, it will be impossible for Americans to visit as tourists,’ said Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockrell.  


Another tour operator, Young Pioneer Tours, said on its website that it had also been informed of the ban, citing the same date.   


It is expected that the ban will come into force within 30 days of July 27th.
