Trump stokes Britain’s Brexit turmoil at start of visit


	



 

Donald Trump began a protest-laden trip to Britain Thursday by questioning whether Prime Minister Theresa May will deliver on UK voters’ intentions when they decided to quit the European Union.   


Ignoring all diplomatic niceties, the convention-shredding US president set up the four-day visit with a rebuke of his beleaguered host as she battles to stop her government falling apart over Brexit.   


Shrugging off the plans for mass protests, which on Friday will include a giant baby-shaped blimp bearing Trump’s features, he said in Brussels: “They like me a lot in the UK. I think they agree with me on immigration”.   




He said Britain was “a pretty hot spot right now with a lot of resignations”.   


The US President arrives after giving NATO leaders a tongue-lashing in Brussels over defence spending and controversial comments about Britain being in ‘turmoil’.   


He said he got along with Theresa May ‘very well’, but suggested he might make time during his UK visit to speak with his friend Boris Johnson, who has just rocked her Government by resigning as foreign secretary.    It was ‘up to the people’ whether or not they want Mrs May to stay as Prime Minister, he added.   


Yesterday Buckingham Palace announced details of the President’s meeting with Her Majesty. The monarch will meet the American leader and Melania in the Quadrangle of the historic Berkshire royal residence on Friday afternoon.    Afterwards Mr and Mrs Trump will join the Queen for tea at the Castle in her private apartments.
