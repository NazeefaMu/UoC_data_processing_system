The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement on the recent developments in the Maldives - of which some have impacted Sri Lanka – has expressed deep concern over Sri Lankan soil ‘being used to initiate questionable action against political and social media activists’.
“Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about recent developments in the Maldives and events that have impacted on Sri Lanka, including the recent arrest of two Sri Lankan nationals in the Maldives, the questionable removal of a Maldivian social media activist who was in possession of a valid Sri Lankan visa, the stabbing of a Maldivian national in Sri Lanka, as well as the state of emergency that has been declared in the Maldives and the impeachment of the Vice-President,” the statement issued by the MFA notes.
In the statement, the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has also expressed concern over the State of Emergency declared in the Maldives and its impacts on the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution of the Maldives. While urging the Government of the Maldives to uphold the commitments it has made GoSL has emphasized the importance for the Government of Maldives to recognize that  dissent it an integral part to the effective functioning of a democracy.
“It is in this context that the Government finds it deeply disturbing that Sri Lanka, a country which has always maintained the closest friendly relations with the Maldives is being used to initiate questionable action against political and social media activists,” the MFA statement reads.
Furthermore, the GoSL has encouraged the Government of the Maldives to ensure that recent developments are not allowed to escalate into a source of regional instability.
“Having endured similar challenges in its recent past, the new Sri Lankan Government is committed to the principles of democracy, good governance and the rule of law. . . Unlike the previous regime in Sri Lanka which silenced dissenting voices in the guise of fighting terrorism, the new administration is committed to the fundamentals of democracy,” the statement reads while adding Sri Lanka hopes Maldives would take steps to end the state of emergency, initiate measures to respect and protect freedom of expression and ensure that recent developments will not reverse Maldives' hard-won democratic achievement.
