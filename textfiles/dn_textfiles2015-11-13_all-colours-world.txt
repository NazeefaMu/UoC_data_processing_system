Ulagalla Organic Cooking Class
All the colours of the world

I, having heard about the legendary Ulagalla Resort set in the heart of Anuradhapura decided to book a stay so I could take a lesson in their fabulous organic cooking class, but discovered on arrival that the wild elephants had beaten her to it.

Ajith, Ulagalla's accomplished masterchef, stands gracefully over the wonderful array of colour and form that is the meal-to-be's finer trimmings. How could all this go into one meal I wonder, thinking I should perhaps paint them rather than cook them, before I'm off on a walk around the organic vegetable garden to pick what I am about to cook.
Wildlife treats
A garden surrounded by various wildlife treats like the group of peahens protecting their poults, pink exploding lilies, a monitor lizard unhurriedly hampering our progress to pick ladies fingers, a snake slithering away so fast from our noisy presence so we only see the undergrowth moving as it passes, and I learn there are wild elephants not too far away as I have been warned that the organic vegetable garden is not so abundant today owing to a midnight feast for five of them.

The entrance to the garden is marked by high poles arranged in a square, rather like the gateways to Wild West towns, with plenty to feast the eyes on behind it. There is absolutely no symmetry to this vegetable garden in stark contrast to fussy allotments, market gardens and western vegetable gardens but here, in the jungle, this feels infinitely more real and at one with nature. Different vegetables are afforded different bedding and fencing and it's almost as if the most favoured ones are given the most elaborate enclosures - such as the chilies which are set in terraced circular beds higher up than the rest, confirming its status as the most important ingredient of a vast array of Sri Lankan dishes.
At the other extreme, one random patch of gotucola, a beautiful light green explosion of colour, had no fencing or bedding whatsoever and was amoebic in shape, perhaps reflecting the status of a more lowly salad. As we passed each patch the gardeners expertly picked or sliced off ladies fingers, lemongrass, chilies, beetroot, spinach, curry leaves, limes from the trees and sweet potatoes. It was by the last of these that I was introduced to the evidence of the previous nights pillaging. Large croquet sized balls of elephant dung lay carelessly discarded amongst the muddy patches where sweet potato plants once flourished. The elephants had made no effort to disguise their oversized presence as the Buddhist philosophy allows them free access to such a garden of delights where any attempts at deterrence would probably be futile anyway.
Cooking begins
Arriving back at the hotel, Ajith adorns me with a white apron and immediately sets me to work on the cutting of vegetables into an old pan set upon a skew whiff gas hob that I think to be a deliberate means to hold the pan at a strategic angle until later on when I discover the mysterious visit from one of the other kitchen staff has resulted in the magic growing of the fourth supporting leg.
As we fill the first pan with water, salt, curry powder and sliced sweet potato for a 20 minute boil, we also start work on a portion of dhal, initially blending coconut oil with onions, curry leaves and cinnamon sticks to give off the most heavenly pungent aroma I've smelt since I can remember, reminding me that there is nothing quite like cooking freshly picked ingredients straight from the garden nearby. Ajith could see by this stage that I hadn't really entered into the spirit of the cooking class as I was juggling my camera, a notebook, the pan and the cutting knife all at once so he took over the cooking, albeit leaning across from the client side, whilst my able eight year fellow student, handled the cutting up of the various ingredients. The latter was doing a fine job until he had the idea of augmenting the ladies fingers with his own whereupon first aid was nearly called. Ajith, having realised we were unconsciously acting out a Laurel and Hardy sketch, decided at this point to cook from the usual aspect and take over the more dangerous slicing jobs, leaving only the lowly gotukola for me to cut very carefully for the next vegetable curry dish.
Little go in
Traditional cooking
 
This of course, was really a cunning plan on my part to get the most delicious possible meal cooked by a true master of the kitchen, whilst capturing the enthusiasm of my highly photogenic sidekick, getting his fingers into everything possible.
What struck me was how little seemed to go into each of the pans to make these delicious meals, and how much we seemed to end up with at the end. Also it appeared that within half an hour we had six fabulous dishes of curry chicken, ladies fingers tempura, dhal, a delicious lemon salad, devilled prawns and curried sweet potatoes all ready to eat. A table was set for us by the beautiful infinity pool with the monkeys and peacocks playing in the trees nearby. By now we were a party of six and everyone ate their fill with plenty left over.

Ajith was the perfect gentleman, at all times reading the situation and adapting his style to suit his students. The whole journey from the plant growing in the Ulagalla organic garden to plate can be booked through www.ugaescapes.com Staying at Ulagalla and doing the wonderful cooking class that even wild elephants want to feast, I discovered during my two hour cooking class with Ajith the sheer delights of bringing plants to plate in such a beautiful setting that is a tastebud's treat as you enjoy picking the truly fresh ingredients, which is a very satisfying 'bringing of order out of chaos' experience that no-one should miss.
