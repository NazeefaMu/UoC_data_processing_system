Right combination is about to come right


	



 

Purohita Mangie had wanted to make a certain request to Number One ever since taking over the Finance portfolio and he was patiently biding his time.  And the opportunity had come in his way quite recently and he had told Number One that he, as the person handling Finance wished to deal with the closely allied subject of Banks as well.

 


Now that the main bank which had been a charge of Number Two had already been brought under the Finance portfolio, Number One may have had considered that it was nothing but logical to bring the other banks too under the purview of Finance purohita, they say.


So, a gazette notification bringing the entire banking sector under the Finance is expected to be issued shortly.
