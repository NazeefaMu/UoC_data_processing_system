Fonseka to sue Wijayadasa for Rs. 5,000 million

Democratic Party leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said he would sue Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe demanding Rs. 5,000 million as damages. He made this observation at a press conference at the Democratic Party headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
Field Marshal Fonseka said he would sue the minister for making defamatory and false allegations against him. "If an attorney is worth Rs. 500 million, a Field Marshal is worth Rs. 5,000 million," Fonseka said. "Wijayadasa Rajapakshe misled the media by saying that Danuna Thilakaratne (who is no more a relative now) had asked permission to release Rs. 80 million belonging to Hicorp," he said. "It was a letter seeking permission to release Rs. 6 million that he had saved in his bank accounts which was later sealed by court."
Fonseka said it was also contempt of court.
He added that Thilakaratne too could sue Minister Rajapakshe.
"Wijayadasa Rajapakshe had attempted to translate my rank of Field Marshal into Sinhala in a funny manner," Fonseka said. "There are only a few Field Marshals in the world which includes Prince Charles."
He said Rajapakshe attempted to humiliate President Maithripala Sirisena by humiliating the rank offered to him for his services rendered to the country.
Fonseka said the name Wijayadasa could be translated into English as "Victory Servant" if it was translated in that funny manner that Wijayadasa translated the rank of Field Marshal into Sinhala.
He said Rajapakshe's business friends gave him only Rs. 5 million during the 2010 election period.
"If the businessmen gave him Rs. 50 million as he says the rest might have been stolen by him assuring the businessmen that the money was given to me," Fonseka said.
He added that Rajapakshe gave him only five national suits and not 25 as he told the media.
Fonseka said the clothes were not of good quality as those given in prison.
He added that his security guards used them to wash his car.
"It was so useful and I thank him for the same," Fonseka said. "People who speak later of what they give are called Hene Mama (Uncle from Chena) in my village. What do you call such people in your villages?" Fonseka questioned.
"I was not given Rs. 8,000 million for my election campaign in 2010 as Rajapakshe said but Rs. 250 million," Fonseka said.
"I had to pay Rs. 12 million for the office opposite Royal College, Rs. 40 million for T-shirts, Rs. 100 million for electronic media advertisements and Rs. 80 million was taken by the then government".
He added that he did not steal them like Rajapakshe.
Fonseka said he never requested Rajapakshe to arrest Gotabhaya Rajapaksa or anybody else.
He added that he openly urged to take action against those who committed offences.
Fonseka said he openly said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had committed offences when constructing his parents' monuments and from the Api Wenuwen Api Fund.
Field Marshal Fonseka said there was nothing wrong in LTTE suspects and convicts being released under certain conditions.
He added that they have served a sentence for years.
Fonseka said if the second in command of the LTTE like KP was living freely, the others too should be given the same freedom.
