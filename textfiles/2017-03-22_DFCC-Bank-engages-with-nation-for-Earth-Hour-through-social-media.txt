DFCC Bank will celebrate Earth Hour on March 25 by switching off power between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. across all its branches. 
In order to promote greater awareness about Earth Hour, the bank has also launched an interactive social media campaign to encourage the public to suggest innovative energy saving tips that are practical and demonstrate their commitment to responsible energy consumption. Selected winners will receive a DFCC Bank Gift Certificate worth Rs.2,500 as their reward for valuable energy-saving tips. 
DFCC celebrates Earth Hour with enthusiasm every year. Earth Hour is a global event organised by the World Wildlife Fund and encourages businesses and households to turn off non-essential lights and other electrical appliances for one hour, to raise awareness on the need to take action on climate change.  
DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando says, “We are happy to participate in this worldwide campaign in consideration of the one thing we all have in common – our planet. As a bank committed to delivering sustainable and responsible solutions, Earth Hour provides DFCC Bank with the ideal platform to demonstrate its responsible approach to consumption of resources and to encourage all stakeholders to take a proactive approach to protecting the environment.
We believe that our inclusive social media campaign will build engagement and awareness of the power that people have to reverse climate change. DFCC Bank extends this Earth Hour commitment to 365 days of its operations and our sustainability commitment continually drives us to explore innovative ways to cut back on electricity consumption.”
