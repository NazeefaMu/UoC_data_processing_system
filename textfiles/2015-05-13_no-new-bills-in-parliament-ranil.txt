	New legislations will not be tabled in the current parliament because there were some elements awaiting an opportunity to sabotage these Bills, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.
	According to sources at the premier’s office, Mr. Wickremesinghe had said this when he met a group of Foreign Media Association representatives on Tuesday.
	He said these elements were also attempting to dilute people-friendly legislation tabled in parliament and that this was what happened to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said that in view of these attempts at sabotage even the Right to Information Bill would only be tabled in the new parliament that would be set up after the upcoming general election.
	He said he believed that the current parliament would be dissolved soon.
	Representatives from several International Media Associations including Article 19, Centre for Law and Democracy in Canada, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), Open Society Foundation, South Asia Media Solidarity Network (SAMSN) were among those who met the Prime minister at his office.
