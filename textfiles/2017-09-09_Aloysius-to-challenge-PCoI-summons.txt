President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne appearing for PTL owner Arjun Aloysius yesterday informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) that he would file a legal submission on Monday challenging the PCoI’s order summoning Mr. Aloysius to give evidence at the PCoI.

Mr. Premaratne said this when the PCoI asked him to prepare an affidavit by Monday before Mr. Aloysius gives his evidence.

He said there would be legal aspects before the Commission on Monday to re-consider its order.

For the purpose of preparing an affidavit, he sought the Commission’s indulgence till the conclusion of Mr. Aloysius’ interrogation by the CID.

Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said the recording of statements of Mr. Aloysius would probably be concluded by Sunday.

PC Premaratne said President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana would also appear on behalf of Mr. Aloysius to lead evidence in addition to his representation. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
