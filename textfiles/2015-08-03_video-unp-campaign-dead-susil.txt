UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha today said the UNP’s election campaign was now defunct.
Premajayantha said the UNP had promised their supporters that a group of individuals would be released from prison.
“Many of these individuals were arrested for grave crimes,” he said.
“The Kotahena incident is a clear example that the UNP is engaged in its usual form of election campaigning,” he said. Video by Sanath Desmond
