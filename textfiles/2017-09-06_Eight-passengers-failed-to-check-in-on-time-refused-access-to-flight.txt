The SriLankan Airlines today said that eight passengers scheduled to fly in flight UL195 from Bandaranaike International Airport on Tuesday had failed to check-in on time and therefore, had not been allowed to get on board the flight.

In a statement, the Airline said this group of passengers had reported to the check-in counters after the check-in counters had been closed.

“The SriLankan staff at the counters informed them that the airline is unable to accept them on the flight due to the closure of the counters. The safety and comfort of all passengers is of paramount importance to SriLankan Airlines and we regret any inconvenience that the passengers may have undergone,” it said.  

However, it said that the Airline cannot accept passengers after check-in counters are closed as it may cause a delay and/or disrupt the departure procedures of the flight.

“The ‘Conditions of Carriage for Passengers and Baggage’ clearly state that all SriLankan check-in counters close one hour prior to the scheduled time of departure and advise passengers to arrive well in time for check-in,” it said.
