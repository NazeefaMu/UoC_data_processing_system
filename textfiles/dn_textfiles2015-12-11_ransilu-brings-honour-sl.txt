Ransilu brings honour to SL

Iron man and powerlifting prodigy Ransilu Jayatillake brought honour and glory to Sri Lanka when he won six gold medals in two separate competitions in powerlifting at the Commonwealth Games organized by the World Powerlifting Federation and held in Vancouver, Canada.
Twenty nine year old Ransilu Jayatillake a product of Kingswood College and has had his training in borth powerlifting and weightlifting at the Kandy YMCA and also under his father D U Mohotilal Jayatillake who has represented the country in four sports and is the holder of a large haul of records. Ransilu Jayatillake is now employed at Commercial Credit Company Limited who gives him all the encouragement.
Ransilu Jayatillake’s first championship event was the Row Championship where no equipment is used and in short the competitor has to display bull strength in raw and he was pitted against competitors from China, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Phillipines, Canada and many other countries.
Bulky Ransilu Jayatillake was not at all concerned of the muscle and strength of the fellow competitors and he maintained his cool. Competing in the under 105 kilogramme category his performance is as follows:
Squat 255 kilogramme – gold medal Bench Press 120 kilogramme – no medal Dead Lift 305 kilogramme – gold medal Total 680 kilogramme – Silver medal
The next competition was the Equipped Powerlifting in which equipment could be used and the wearing of safety equipment like knee guards, ankle guard, thigh guard etc could be used. Competing in the 120 kilogramme category his performance is as follows:
Squat 220 kilogramme – Gold medal Bench Press 140 kilogramme – Gold Medal Dead Lift 300 kilogramme –Gold medal Total 760 kilogramme – Gold medal
When you analyze his performance in the two different competitions, he has set up a few records and one of them is a possible Asian record which has to be clarified by the relevant authorities. His lift of 305 kilogramme in the Dead Lift in the Row competition is the best by a Sri Lanka and will go into the Sri Lankan record books and possibly into the Asian record books.
The total 740 kilogramme is the best over by a Sri Lankan in any competition and becomes the first Sri Lankan to pass the 700 kilogramme mark. This was in the Equipped competition. His winning four gold medals is itself a record which is unsurpassed any powerlifter in this country.
Ransilu Jayatillake was one time an essentially a weightlifter who switched on powerlifting a few years back as he had the brute strength to work on both iron games where you utilize your strength and muscles to lift the iron and the bar bells.
Ransilu Jayatillake is a high performer in the iron and at the Commonwealth Games Weightlifting championship held in Samoa in 2012 he won two gold medals in the Junior Category the first Sri Lankan to win a medal in weightlifting in this competition.
In 2011 when he lifted 300 kilogrammes in weightlifting he became the first Sri Lankan to reach the triple century mark. He started weighting at the age of 10 has set up over 100 records when he graduated from the teens to the National and International in weightlifting.
In powerlifting he has set up over 30 records and is presently the powerlifter with the highest lift.
