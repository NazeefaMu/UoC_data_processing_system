A Criminal Court in Doha, Qatar has sentenced a Sri Lankan expatriate to one year in jail and ordered his subsequent deportation for counterfeiting an official document, the Gulf Times reported yesterday.   

According to Arabic daily Arrayah, the defendant had submitted - in the relevant attestation department - a university degree certificate in Economics in his name to get it officially stamped.

However, the official there doubted the authenticity of the document and informed the authorities concerned about the matter. Eventually, the document was found to be a counterfeited one.

The court convicted the man of colluding with unidentified persons for counterfeiting an official document and submitting it knowingly to a government entity.
