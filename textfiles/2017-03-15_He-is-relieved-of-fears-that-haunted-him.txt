He is relieved of fears that haunted him!


	



 

Several parties from within yahapalanaya had reportedly put spokes in the wheel of the Sino-Lanka deal on the Magampura port and the purohita in charge of the subject of ports was one of them, they say.

 


So the authorities in the highest echelons had decided to move this purohita out of this portfolio.
Upon hearing about the move afoot to remove him from his current portfolio, the highly disconcerted purohita had met Number One to ascertain from the horse’s mouth itself what was in store for him. He also had apprised the boss of the legal opinion made available to him that the proposed deal would not be legally valid if it were put through without suitably amending the relevant Act.   


The purohita had also explained to Number One the repercussions that could result from resorting to amending the existing Act. Later the purohita had received instructions from above not to take any action designed to amend the Act in question. Highly elated over these latest instructions, the purohita is said to be chanting in a refrain: “I have no fear now! I have no fear now!”
