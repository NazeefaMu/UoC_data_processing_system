Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said he would not deviate from the path of reasserting national independence, ensuring the territorial integrity, restarting the stalled process of economic development and re-establishing national self respect  even if he and his entire family was imprisoned.

In his National Independence Day message, Ex-president Rajapaksa said since 8 January 2015, Sri Lankans were again being used by foreign powers for their purposes and that the separatists, who could not achieve their aims after nearly four decades of terrorism, now hope to achieve their aim with the help of these foreign powers.

“Since last year there has been an unending procession of foreign dignitaries visiting their latest ‘conquest’. Due to the influence of these foreign powers, dangerous LTTE detainees have been released and members of the armed forces have been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Furthermore, plans are afoot to prosecute our war heroes for war crimes,” he said.

Mr. Rajapaksa said leaders of several foreign funded NGOs had met leaders of the present government and insisted on the arrest of members of his government on corruption charges before February 4 this year.

“My son Yoshitha, my Press Secretary Rohan Welivita, Nishantha Ranatunga and two directors of the CSN TV Channel Ravinath Fernando and Kavishan Dissanayake have been arrested under an omnibus provision in the Criminal Procedure Code enabling the police to arrest individuals to conduct investigations,” he said.
