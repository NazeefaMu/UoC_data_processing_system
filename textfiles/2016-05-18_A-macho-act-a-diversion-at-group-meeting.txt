The Green party Diyawanna members took up for discussion vital issues such as the VAT increase at their regular group meeting held at the council complex the other day. 

 


While a serious discourse on the topical key issues relating to the country’s economy was underway, a certain popular young member with deputy status seated among the fair members at the rear put up a display of his macho prowess, they say. 


While the deputy was flexing his muscles to demonstrate his physical strength another member had videoed the entire display.


The video footage of the macho act staged while a serious discussion was on is due to be released to the media shortly.  However, this footage will come as a surprise to the deputy who staged the act, they say.
