Colombo port income used for Htota loan settlement: Minister
	
	Though the Colombo Port has earned an income of Rs.26 billion this year, a significant portion of it will go to settle a loan obtained from the Chinese government for the construction of the Hambantota Port, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga today said.
	Addressing the media in Colombo Port, after ceremonially marking the handling of the five millionth container at the port, the minister said the means to improve the welfare of port employees had also been hindered because of the issue.
	Even with inadequate and old equipment, the efforts of our employees had borne fruit. Thats why we have been able to handle more containers than last year. Though we have earned Rs.26 billion this year, we have to utilize them at harbours where there are losses and Hambantota Port is the main issue. We will have to keep paying for years to settle the loan obtained for that harbour, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

	Asserting that only 20 per cent of Advanced Level qualifiers could enter the State Universities, he said more and more opportunities should be made available in the higher education sector.
	We wont interfere with the university affairs. The Vice Chancellors are given a free hand to run them, he said
	The Minister said a number of foreign universities had expressed willingness to put up their branch campuses in the country.
	The previous government also sought similar agreements with foreign universities at that time. Then, Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake even tried to amend the present laws to provide for the establishment of non-state universities. (Kelum Bandara)

HNB wins CIOB Green Mark  Gold Plus award
	
Piyal Hennayake, Deputy General Manager,Services of HNB and Prashantha Hewapathirana, Senior Manager, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of HNB accepting the award from   Dr Sarath Amunugama, Minister for Special Projects.  
The Jaffna Green Building of Hatton National Bank (HNB) won the prestigious CIOB Green Mark  Gold Plus award at the 2nd CIOB Green Mark awards ceremony.
This is the tenth occasion, and the fifth consecutive year, that the premier private sector commercial bank has been recognised locally and internationally for its unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability.
The award was accepted on behalf of HNB by Deputy General Manager  Services  Piyal Hennayake and Senior Manager  Mechanical and Electrical Engineering - Prashantha Hewapathirana at the CIOB Green Mark Awards Ceremony held recently at Hotel Galadari.
The Green Mark is awarded to buildings and projects that meet the green building standards set by the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), the premier organization for building and construction professionals in Sri Lanka. The award is accredited by the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore, Council of Research and Innovation in Building and Construction of Netherlands, Green Building Council of Singapore, the Chartered Institute of Builders of UK and the Central Environment Authority of Sri Lanka.
The HNB Jaffna Green Building received this award in recognition of its remarkable focus on environment sustainability and energy efficiency. The building has succeeded in reducing its use of energy by 27.61 percent and the use of water by 53 percent, while generating 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources.
The building was commissioned in 2013 and accommodates the Jaffna Metro Customer Centre, the Northern Regional office, a private banking floor and a fully equipped training centre. It was a trailblazer in the Northern Province as it was the first building to employ integrated sustainable services monitored by a Building Management System (BMS), the first building to have a state-of-the-art 260-seat auditorium, and the first building to have elevated gardens along with a solar sensitive automatedlouvre system.
Architecturally, the landmark building established a new post-war regional architecture trend which went beyond the Dravidian architectural style popular in Jaffna. It carefully conserved the spatial characteristics of local domestic architecture while employing an ultra modern design on par with any modern international building. The double screens on the eastern and western sides of the building reflect glare and excess sunlight while the thick vegetation of vertical landscaping filters all polluted air. The Chilled water Central Air Conditioning System consists of a high efficiency water cooled chiller connected with variable temperature and variable water flow, while a chilled water piping system and an air side includes pressure independent Variable Air Volume (VAV)
terminal boxes.
Furthermore, a sophisticated solar shading system enables the building to react to changes in the weather and the sun<U+0092>s position to optimize the flows of heat and light through the faade. This, in turn, reduces heat gain and glare and enhances the use of natural daylight, reducing the building<U+0092>s operating costs. A 15kVA roof mounted solar PV system with net metering facility generates 1,800 kWh of electricity. A separate overhead tank collects rain water from the roof and uses it to water the plants, and waste water is treated and used for thesame purpose.

He said these companies were concealing their profits from the State and was nothing but a ruse to justify their decisions not to increase wages.
The minister said these companies were managing estates each 20,000 hectares in extent.
"Even when plantations were managed by the Europeans, it was only about 5000 hectares each. Now it is 20,000 hectares. These estates will be taken over if the wages are not increased in compliance with the government policy," he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Ravi must become US Treasury Sec. to stabilize rupee: Udaya
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila today requested US President Barack Obama to appoint Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake as the US Treasury Secretary so as to help stabilize the Sri Lankan rupee in a reverse procedure.
He told a news briefing that though the government was fighting to stabilize the Sri Lankan rupee which had fallen sharply in value against the US dollar, the solution was not far away but within the government itself.
Since January, the SLR has depreciated in line with the new government policy for floating the currency. I have a solution which I strongly believe will be enough for Minister Ravi Karunanayake to solve the problem in a reverse order. If he can become the US Treasury Secretary he could bring down the value of the US dollar to the level of the SLR, Mr. Gammanpila said.
He requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss this matter with US President Obama. (Piyumi Fonseka)

SL request India to extend currency swap facility
	
	Sri Lanka has requested for an extension of the time of the US $ 400 million currency swap facility provided in March this year.
	Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake recently said this request had been made in the face of impending global situation. The minister told Parliament over the weekend that Sri Lanka will have to manage its reserves wisely in the face of Chinas plan to devalue its currency against the dollar while USAs Federal Reserve planning to raise its interest rates. This he said in response to an oral question raised by Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardene in the House during the weekend.
	The Minister however assured that Sri Lankas foreign reserves are safe and said that the government would do its utmost to see that the countrys foreign reserves are safe in the face of any global crisis.
	Going by the English word swap, means exchanging of currencies and in this instance India and Sri Lanka is engaged in exchanging currencies. While India had provided Sri Lanka US dollars, Sri Lanka is to provide a similar amount of funds in Sri Lankan Rupees in lieu of this.
	This is an Indian cooperation for a short-term growth of Sri Lankas dollar reserves. Sri Lanka has increased its foreign reserves while utilizing the US dollars obtained from India.
	While Sri Lanka could utilize these US dollars obtained from India for imports from any country or fulfil its dollar requirements, there are no limitations that this should only be used for transactions with India.(Yohan Perera)
