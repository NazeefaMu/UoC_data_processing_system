HINDUSTAN TIMES, 15th JANUARY, 2017-Britain’s Prince William is getting ready to quit his part-time job as an air ambulance rescue pilot to become a full-time royal.


The second-in-line to Britain’s throne will leave his job with the East Anglian Air Ambulance this summer, according to The Sunday Times.


The 34-year-old Duke of Cambridge and wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, will also make Kensington Palace in London their permanent base from later this year when their son Prince George starts school.


Their daughter, Princess Charlotte, is also expected to attend a London nursery.


The move follows months of discussion within the royal family, who are said to have been “very supportive” of William’s decision.
