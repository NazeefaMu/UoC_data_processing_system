Our care for others is the measure of our greatness - EDITORIAL


	



 

eligious leaders have told us that anyone who wishes to be a leader must be ready to be the servant of all and that our care for others is the measure of our greatness. Our political leaders especially need to reflect on this in their hearts and minds as Sri Lanka goes into a crucial period in our history.   
President Maithripala Sirisena, when he was elected to office in the historic presidential election of January 8, 2015 pledged he would be a servant leader. That means to serve the people selflessly, sincerely, sacrificially and with commitment to work towards a peaceful, just and all inclusive society through unity in diversity.   
Often in the world, we see leaders whose main aim is to seek personal gain or glory, prestige, popularity and wealth. But such leaders have ended up in the pigstys of history.   
When parliament resumes sittings next month after the prorogation, the President and other government leaders need to sincerely recommit themselves to the principles of servant leadership. That means we would see a spirit of honesty and integrity among them. We would see a gradual liberation from self-centeredness so that they could sincerely and selflessly serve the people for the common good of all. This may not happen overnight but if the President, the Prime Minister and other leaders set the example the others will follow.   

 

 


As part of this servant leadership, we need to see a simple and humble lifestyle or the hallowed concept of ‘Alpechchathawaya’. We have not seen much of this during the past seventy years since independence but we need to see it now if Sri Lanka is to move steadily towards a sustainable, eco-friendly and all-inclusive development.   
The leaders and other politicians need to avoid wasteful expenditure, luxuries and extravagance. They need to tell or order their supporters or stooges also not to indulge in such vices at a time when millions of people are struggling on or below the poverty line.   
Besides honesty, sincerity, integrity and simple lifestyles, the leaders need to ensure that politicians or officials do not indulge in bribery or corruption, fraud or other political crimes. Stern action needs to be taken against those who indulge in such vices whereby they plunder the wealth and resources of the people. 

 

 


This was one of the main failures of the present government. During the campaign for the January 8 election, Mr. Sirisena, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and other ‘rainbow coalition’ leaders pledged they would act effectively to bring to justice the former regime’s VIP politicians and officials who allegedly plundered billions of dollars from public funds and deposited them in secret accounts. But almost three and half years after assuming office, little progress has been made in this direction and instead we saw the Central Bank bond scam, which joint opposition leaders justifiably described as the biggest bank fraud in history.   
Last month, the Justice Minister introduced a Judicature Bill to set up at least three special High Courts with three-judge benches to hear political corruption cases. The Bill made provision for the special high courts to meet daily, morning and evening, so that the cases could be completed within three months instead of several years but with the prorogation of parliament, this bill lapsed and will have to be presented again while the Supreme Court has ruled that certain clauses need a two-third majority. The government may not be able to get a two-third majority now, so the bill will have to be amended.   

 

 


We recall again the much quoted speech of the late Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar when he took oaths as Foreign Minister in 1994. He said this country, a paradise island had given him much – free health services, free education and other blessings. Now he would focus his heart and mind on what he could give back to Sri Lanka. Political leaders, other politicians, religious, social or business leaders and indeed all responsible citizens need to experience a transformation in their attitude or approach to life and ask what they could give to the country instead of what they could grab. Any and all who act in that way are servant leaders while their care or concern for others and the country will eventually be the measure of their greatness.
