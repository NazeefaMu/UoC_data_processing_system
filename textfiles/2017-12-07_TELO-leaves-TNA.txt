In what appeared to a further split of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) decided to leave it to join hands with other Tamil parties to contest the local government elections, it is learnt.

The TELO’s politburo that met in Vavuniya on Tuesday took this decision.

The 21member presidium council of TELO concluded that, TELO could not be any more ‘a co-traveller’ with the ITAK in the Tamil National Alliance.

A four member committee comprising former MPs, Jana Karunakaran Vinonoharalingham, M.K. Sivajilingham and also Prasanna Indrakumar were appointed to discuss and explore possibilities of joining hands with other like-minded Tamil groups.

The TELO delegation has already held discussions with EPRLF and also with TULF and planned to negotiate with PLOTE, prior to coming up with their decisions at their proposed presidium meeting in Jaffna later.

Earlier, the EPRLF led by former MP Suresh Premachandran left the TNA. (Kelum Bandara)
