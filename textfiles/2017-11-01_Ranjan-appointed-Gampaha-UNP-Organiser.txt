Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake was appointed as the United National Party (UNP) Organiser for Gampaha District by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today.

Addressing the media in the Parliament premises, Minister Ramanayake said he was asked to be removed from his former organiser post following several petitions received by the party which had claimed that he was struggling against several under world groups.

“Then I inquired from the UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim about said petitions against me,” he added.

Earlier, he was the UNP Organiser for Divulapitiya and was recently replaced by Kithsiri Manchanayake.

Mr. Hashim told the media that false rumours had been carried by the media saying that Minister Ramanayaka was expelled from the party.

While rejecting those claims he said that Ramanayake was a valuable person to the party.

“Therefore, we decided to appoint him as the District Organiser not only for the Gampaha District but to cover up the whole country. Following a request of him we decided to appoint Kithsiri Manchanayake as the Divulapitiya organiser,” he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
