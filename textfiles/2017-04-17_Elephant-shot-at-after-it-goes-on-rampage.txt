The Wildlife Conservation Officers opened fire at a she-elephant when it went on rampage after being saved from drowning in an abandoned well at Kombuwaittakulam in Omanthai.

Wildlife Officers said they were compelled to open fire at the elephant to save the people from any possible danger.

They said a tusker, a she elephant and two baby elephants that roamed into the human habitat in search of water had fallen into the abandoned cultivation well, and that the wildlife officers saved and drove them into the jungle. However, the she-elephant had returned charging, compelling the officers to open fire. (Romesh Madusanka)
