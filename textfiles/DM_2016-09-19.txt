Deutsche Bank to fight US $14 billion demand from U.S. authorities
	
REUTERS: Deutsche Bank said it would fight a US $14 billion demand from the U.S. Department of Justice to settle claims it miss old mortgage-backed securities, a shock bill that raises questions about the future of Germanys largest lender.
The claim against Deutsche, which is likely to trigger several months of talks, far exceeds the banks expectations that the DoJ would be looking for a figure of only up to 3 billion euros (US $3.4 billion).
The demand adds to the problems facing Deutsche Banks Chief Executive John Cryan, a Briton who has been in the job for a year.
The bank only scraped through European stress tests in July and has warned it may need deeper cost cuts to turn itself around after revenue fell sharply in the second quarter due to challenging markets and low interest rates.
Deutsche Bank shares, which have lost around half their value this year, tumbled 7.6 percent to 12.10 euros in Frankfurt on Friday, with analysts saying the bank may need to raise fresh funds from investors or sell assets to shore up its capital ratios.
The cost of insuring Deutsche Bank debt against default rose by around eight percent.
The bank, which employs around 100,000 people, said it regarded the DoJ demand as an opening shot.
Deutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited, it said in a statement.

Hatton National Bank launches HelaSaviya innovative banking solution for Hela Group

Hatton National Bank which has been in the forefront of innovative banking in Sri Lanka for several decades has launched yet another innovative banking solution exclusively for the staff of Hela Clothing.
Aimed at strengthening the companys hard-working staff, the HelaSaviya programme aims at offering them banking facilities to realise their aspirations towards a better life.
Traditionally, a garment factory worker would not be considered a credit-worthy customer by a bank. Over the years, HNB has however created a tradition of investing in human capital and supporting the vital cogs of Sri Lankas economy. It is a tradition built on the simple philosophy of taking banking beyond transactions.
Today, Hatton National Bank has progressed from being the banking partner of the Hela Group of Companies to becoming the financial partner of the entire Hela Family.
Outlining the aspects of the offering, Thimal Perera, Deputy General Manager  Retail & SME Banking at HNB said, The HelaSaviya programme brings to all employees of the Hela Group, greater access to the products and services of the Hatton National Bank through its extensive branch and ATM network across the country, as well as a large array of offers from partner merchants. On the identification of being a member of the Hela Family, HNB staff at any of our branches across Sri Lanka will accord to them the special facilities available to the Hela Family members.
This unique banking proposition, unlike any other offered by a bank, includes  savings accounts, debit cards, a co-branded credit card, a one-of-a-kind leasing proposition and special rates on personal loans, housing loans and microfinance. Additionally HNB has brought together industry leaders in their respective fields to bring a truly unique banking proposition for the employees of the Hela Group which will see Abans offering discounts on direct purchases or swipes when purchasing home appliances and electronic appliances, Next Campus offering attractive discounts for a wide range of higher education programmes; Associated Motorways (Pvt) Ltd., offering special rates on cars, three-wheelers and motor cycles which will be financed by either HNB or its subsidiary HNB Grameen.
SLIC has also come forward to offer life insurance policies and medical insurance schemes that cover entire families of Hela employees.
Hela Clothing is a British owned apparel manufacturing group operating in Sri Lanka for over two decades. They have more than 10,000 employees and manufacture over 100 million units of apparel annually at 13 manufacturing, printing and embroidery plants across Sri Lanka and two factories in Kenya and Ethiopia.
Dian Gomes, who took over as Chairman of Hela Clothing early this year said, The contribution of the apparel industry worker to Sri Lankas economy is unrecognised and unappreciated. They have been sacrificed at the altar of corporations in search of greater profits. Internationally, they are identified as underpaid workers who stitch clothing for developed countries. This should not be the case. We should change these perceptions and attitudes by our actions. We expect HelaSaviya to be a comprehensive programme that will not only strengthen the Hela Family members, but also give them dignity and recognition as key stakeholders of the nations economy.
Through this programme we are even encouraging them to become entrepreneurs themselves and we will give all the help they need including financing. Whats more, we even give them the know-how so that they can make a strong start, ThimalPerera added. All this is done in partnership with the dynamic management of the Hela Group.

His lawyers had informed Court that he had been unable to appear in court as he was suffering from a heart ailment.

MR on VAT: Milking the sick
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who expressed his opposition to the Valued Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, urged the Government to reconsider its proposals at least at this stage.
Issuing a statement, he said the VAT on goods and services would increase from 11% to 15% and cause hardship to consumers if the Bill were to be enacted.
This increased VAT is to be imposed even on private medical care, which had always been exempt from VAT, he said.
This imposition will cause an immediate 15% increase in private medical costs. For example, a by-pass surgery that presently costs about Rs.700,000 would in future cost Rs.805,000. Many ordinary people make use of private medical services today. This tax attempts to raise revenue through sickness and suffering. The more serious the illness, the more money the Government would be squeezing from the hapless patient, he said.
The increased VAT is to be imposed on the small and medium wholesale and retail trade as well. My Government charged VAT only on wholesale and retail establishments with a turnover of around
Rs. 2,800,000 per day, which ensured that the tax applied only to the largest up-market retail businesses enjoying economies of scale. However, by slashing the threshold to just Rs. 138,000 a day, the Yahapalanaya Government has brought all wholesale establishments, and a good number of retail establishments within the ambit of VAT.
This will cause a rapid escalation in prices throughout the country and in a short time, bring about a reduction in consumer demand. Previous Governments never imposed VAT on the small and medium wholesale and retail trade because of the negative impact it will inevitably have on the economy.
Commodity prices have been declining all over the world but in Sri Lanka the prices of goods and services will be going up because of these tax hikes imposed to finance the various concessions that the Yahapalanaya Government gave out to win elections.
Thus the people themselves are being forced to bear the cost of the deception that was practiced on them. We can in no way agree to the increase in the VAT rate, it is unconscionable imposition on the sick and the elderly, and its imposition on the small and medium wholesale and retail trade without any concern for the all round price increases that it will cause. There is still time for the government to amend these oppressive VAT proposals, he said.

New York bombing suspect named as Ahmad Khan Rahami
	
US officials are looking for Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalised US citizen who was born in Afghanistan, for questioning over explosions in New York and New Jersey on Saturday.
The FBI warned that the suspect is "armed and dangerous".
Further devices exploded in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in the early hours of Monday as a police robot investigated a bag. No-one was injured.
The FBI has been searching the 28-year-old suspect's family home in Elizabeth.
The bomb that hit Manhattan's Chelsea district on Saturday evening injured 29, and an unexploded device was found nearby.
Early on Saturday a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town ahead of a charity race. No-one was hurt.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has urged jittery Americans to be "vigilant but not afraid".
"It is crucial that we continue to build up trust between law enforcement and Muslim American communities," she said.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said there were "certain commonalities" between the bombs.
New Jersey State Police said that the FBI was linking the Manhattan explosion to that in Seaside Park, New Jersey.
Millions of New York residents received a phone alert on Monday morning after the Notify NYC alert system was used to name the suspect.
"Anyone who sees this individual or knows anything about him or his whereabouts needs to call it in right away," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on CNN.
Both the bomb that went off in New York on Saturday and the unexploded device found four blocks away were shrapnel-filled pressure cookers, according to US media.
Mr Cuomo said on Monday that there might be a foreign connection to the Manhattan attack. Officials had said over the weekend there were no confirmed links to international terrorist groups.
President Barack Obama, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, is being kept up to date with the investigation, a White House spokesman said.
Early on Monday, a New Jersey police robot inspected a backpack found in a bin near the railway station in Elizabeth, causing it to explode.
The bag had been picked out of the bin by two men on Sunday evening. They thought it could contain something of value but saw wires and notified the police.
"That was not a controlled explosion," said Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage. (BBC)

SL failed to take advantage of JR's economic concepts: PM
	
Asian nations will account for 50 per cent of global GDP by the year 2050, as a result of first steps taken by countries such as Sri Lanka during the time of late President J R Jayewardene, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
The Prime Minister came up with this remark at a ceremony held this evening to mark the 110th birth anniversary of the late President J R Jayewardene who introduced the free trade system. Mr. Wickremesinghe called this a system where there are capitalist zones in a socialist country.
The most important thing which JR introduced was the free trade zone. He told us that he did not want to change socialism.
He said his intention was to keep socialism till the open economy is introduced gradually. Until then he said he would introduce free trade zones. Accordingly he allocated six electorates in the Gampaha District and set up such zones.
Subsequently, the Katunayake and Biyagama zones were opened. Usual laws in these zones were abolished and they were subjected to special laws. J R brought foreign investments and introduced an open economy amidst socialism. But today we dont have that concept as the whole country has been subjected to market economy, he said.
He said J R Jayewardenes concept was accepted by Chinese revolutionary and statesman Deng Xiaoping. Mr Xiaoping worked at a tractor manufacturing factory for many years. He came back to power in 1979. He made changes to the Marxist economy in China. He studied how Singapore and Philippines handled their respective economies. He sent a delegation to Sri Lanka as well to study the economy. He took the Greater Colombo Economic Commission and free trade zones system in Sri Lanka as role models for China and introduced a capitalist zone in China. With this China started to go forward and it is going forward even today. China had become a leading economy by 1997/9, he said.
The premier said former Indian PM Narasimha Rao also did the same. Former Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao ( the then minister of foreign affairs) came to Sri Lanka as a special envoy of late Premier Indira Gandhi after 1983. He inquired about the reforms in Sri Lanka in the 1980s. Mr Rao became Prime Minister of India in 1991. Indian economy was in shambles. They had to mortgage its gold reserves. Rao followed Sri Lanka and China. Later Vietnam also followed through, he said.
These countries have become major players of the global economy today. They will account for 50 per cent of the global economy by the year 2050. Late President Jayewardene has played a leading role in this future development, the Prime Minister added.
However he said Sri Lanka has not been able reap the maximum benefit of the economic concept introduced by late Mr Jayewardene and the present government will strive towards bringing this maximum benefits to the nation. (Yohan Perera)

SLFP supports VAT Bill
	
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) said yesterday the Valued Added Tax (Amendment) Bill was redrafted well in consultation with it, and therefore it had no reason to oppose it in Parliament.
The government has redrafted the VAT Bill to be enacted in Parliament.
SLFP Vice President Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Chandima Weerakkodi told Daily Mirror the government excluded services such as diagnostic tests, OPD charges from VAT based on proposals by the SLFP.
The Minister said the government also increased the threshold for VAT liability on retail and wholesale trade from Rs. 12 million to Rs.50 million as the SLFP proposed.
Therefore, we have no reason to oppose the VAT bill in the present form. We submitted our views at the respective Cabinet meetings, he said.
The government is planning to present the Bill in the House this week. It has the required majority to pass it comfortably. The VAT rate is slated to be increased to 15 percent from the current 12 percent in this exercise.
Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) have already raised objections to the VAT bill. (Kelum Bandara)

Whom to trust Gammanpila
	
Top government leaders had different opinions on the unitary character of the country and the prominence given to Buddhism which had resulted in utter confusion, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
He said the President and the Prime Minister had assured to leave the prominence given to Buddhism and the unitary character of the country as it is but former President Chandrika Kumaratunga had expressed contradicting sentiments.
Mrs. Kumaratunga is the in-charge of reconciliation. She recently said she wanted to create a federal yet a semi-secular State in Sri Lanka. This contradicts what the President or the Premier had stated. We dont know whom to trust anymore, he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
