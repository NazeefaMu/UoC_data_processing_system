He is an irksome barrier to them!


	



 

A khakied one playing sentinel at the residence of a high political authority in Rajarata is reportedly chasing away the constituents calling over there.

 


This cop, who seems to hate the very sight of the hoi polio calling over, seeking the help of the politico has made it a practice to rudely turn them away saying that boss is not in, they say.


However, some constituents assured that the politico is available inside because of the presence of his security detail and official vehicles outside, would boldly head for the residence brushing aside his objections resulting in frequent noisy altercations, they say.   

   
People in the area have reportedly complained to the politico about the rude conduct of the cop, but no action appears to have been taken against the man so far.
