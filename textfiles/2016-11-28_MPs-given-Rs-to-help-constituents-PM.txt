The monthly payment of Rs.100,000 to be given to each MP is not a take-home allowance but one which will be used to help the people in their constituencies, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.

He said this allowance would be given to MPs for giving gifts to the people in their constituencies.

"MPs are usually invited to weddings in their constituencies. They attend funerals as well. The proposed allowance is to be used for giving wedding gifts and making donations for funerals," the Prime Minister said.

He emphasized the fact of there being a need to increase the salaries of MPs.

"The Daily Mirror has published the story about the payment of Rs.100,000 to the MPs. Its editor and the others had requested for a pay hike last year. There is no issue when their salaries are increased, but give the impression that it is wrong to increase the salaries of MPs," the Prime Minister said.

"These newspapers encourage extremism and hit out at me because I am not an extremist."

He also responded to a comment made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake, who said the Prime Minister had threatened the Daily Mirror on several occasions.

The Prime Minister said he would not hesitate to hit out at the media if they hit out at him.

"I cannot attack the Wijeya Newspapers or burn the press. These are properties that belong to my uncle. Sirasa belongs to my one-time friend Kili Maharajah who has attacked me several times but did I burn it?" he asked.

"I will only hit back verbally if the media hits me and will never go beyond a verbal retort," (Yohan Perera)
