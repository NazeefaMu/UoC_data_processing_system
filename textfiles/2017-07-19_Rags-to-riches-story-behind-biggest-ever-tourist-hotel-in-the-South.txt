Rags to riches story behind biggest ever tourist hotel in the South


	

A fortunate member from a very high family in the country has begun putting up the biggest-ever tourist hotel in the South at a uniquely scenic sea-side spot.

 


The multi-story high-end hotel due to come up on a sprawling land several acres in extent overlooking the Sothern blue ocean is estimated to cost about US$20 million, they say.


This family member who started from scratch as a small-time dealer in an essential foodstuff has grown into an owner of a chain of high-end hotels today. 


“I have come up in life the hard way - by the dint of my own perseverance, not due to patronage from any high-up,” says this business tycoon who goes by a first name that reminds us of a former Prime Minister in the country.
