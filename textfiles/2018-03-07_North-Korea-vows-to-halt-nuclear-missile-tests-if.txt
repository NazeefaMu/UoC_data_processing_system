North Korea has said it will not need to keep its nuclear weapons if military threats against the country are resolved and it receives a credible security guarantee, South Korea has said today.


The promise was made to a delegation of South Korean officials during a two-day visit to Pyongyang where they held talks with dictator Kim Jong-Un.


The head of the delegation also said Kim had vowed never to use nuclear and conventional weapons against South Korea, and agreed to a meeting with president Moon Jae-In in April.


North Korea also expressed willingness to hold a ‘candid dialogue’ with the United States on de-nuclearisation and diplomacy, and pledged that it would freeze its nuclear and missile testing programme while such talks with 
are underway.


The summit talks, which are to be held at the border truce village of Panmunjom in late April, will be the third inter-Korean summit talks ever held - and the first in over a decade.  Kim Jong Un seemingly put on a charm offensive when meeting the South Korean delegation yesterday, as images released by North Korean state news shows him grinning broadly as he grasps the hand of one of the visiting officials.He also appeared to be in a jovial mood later in the day, when he hosted a dinner with his wife, Ri Sol-Ju, where one of the officials had Kim’s sister Kim Yo-Jong as his 
dining partner.
