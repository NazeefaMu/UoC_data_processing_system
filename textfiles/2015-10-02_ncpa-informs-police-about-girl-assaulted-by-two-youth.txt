The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) said today the information it had obtained on the young woman attacked by two youth, as seen in a video gone viral in social media websites, would be sent to the Police Child and Women's Bureau for further investigation.
On Wednesday which was also the World Children’s Day, a video showing two young men assaulting the young woman while another person was recording the incident went viral on Facebook.
The NCPA official who wished to remain anonymous told Daily Mirror that according to the information they had collected, the girl was over the age of 18 and therefore the NCPA was not authorised to take legal action regarding the incident.
Police requested public assistance to identify the girl who was attacked so that they could investigate the incident.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekarra told Daily Mirror that at the moment police does not have any information about the incident or the identity of the girl and therefore they are unable not initiate an investigation.
“Anyone with information about the incident and the identity of the girl or those who assaulted her should contact nearest police station and inform them,” ASP Gunasekara said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
