Qatar Airways commenced direct seasonal service to the island of Mykonos on 30 May 2018, making it the third Greek destination on Qatar Airways’ rapidly expanding network. Mykonos, an ideal destination for holidaymakers, is renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty and vibrant atmosphere. The Myconian Collection Hotels & Resorts is a family-owned group of nine luxury hotels, offering visitors to Mykonos a refined level of hospitality. 

To enter, participants need to simply upload their favourite picture of Mykonos between 22 July and 2 August 2018 on Instagram or Facebook and tag @qatarairways and @myconiancollectionhotels, with the hashtags #MykonosTogether and #MyconianCollection. The winner will receive two Economy Class round-trip tickets from the winner’s nearest Qatar Airways gateway to Mykonos, to be used in September 2018. 

In addition to the round-trip tickets, the lucky winner will also receive a three-night accommodation package for two people at the Myconian Collection Hotels & Resorts, where they may immerse themselves in magnificent Aegean views, sandy beaches with crystal clear waters, superb spas, and five-star gourmet restaurants.



Residents of countries eligible to participate in this global promotion include Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Australia, Qatar, India, Sri Lanka, China and Malaysia.

Qatar Airways currently operates four weekly seasonal flights to Mykonos International Airport until 14 October 2018, with an Airbus A320, featuring 12 seats in Business Class and 132 seats in Economy Class.

The award-winning airline has received a record number of accolades recently, including ‘World’s Best Business Class’ by the prestigious 2018 Skytrax World Airline Awards. The national carrier of the state of Qatar also won a raft of other major awards at the ceremony, including ‘Best Airline in the Middle East’, ‘Best Business Class Seat’ and ‘World’s Best First Class Airline Lounge’.

Qatar Airways currently operates a modern fleet of more than 200 aircraft via its home and hub, Hamad International Airport (HIA), to more than 150 destinations worldwide. Earlier this year, Qatar Airways revealed a host of forthcoming global destinations in line with its expedited expansion plans, including Tallinn, Estonia; Valletta, Malta; Langkawi, Malaysia and Da Nang, Vietnam.
