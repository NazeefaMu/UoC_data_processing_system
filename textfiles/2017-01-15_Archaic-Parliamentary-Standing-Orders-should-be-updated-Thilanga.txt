A significant improvement in the overall behaviour of our representatives, their access and engagement during the debates has been achieved with the introduction of live telecasting of parliamentary proceedings and as a result peoples’ appreciation about their representatives has been enhanced, he said.

He also said the code of conduct now before Parliament will be adopted after discussion with all the MPs in the House.

The Mahanayaka Thera of the Malwatta Chapter had expressed their willingness to give a block of land belonging to temple to be used as a premises for a sports research unit for the advancement of sports in the country.
