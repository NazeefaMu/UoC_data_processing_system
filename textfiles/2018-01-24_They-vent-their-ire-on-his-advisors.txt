Legal experts and the colleagues who advised Number One to seek SC opinion on the duration of his term of office have incurred the wrath of some Betel leaf seniors.

 


These angry seniors have blamed four colleagues hailing from Colombo, Ruhuna, Rajarata and Uva for giving a dead rope to Number One. They had turned their fire particularly on the Colombo colleague who is considered a legal expert. They had also advised Number One not to listen in future to the client-less lawyers who pose as legal pundits.
