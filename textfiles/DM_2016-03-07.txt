Carrots have been dangled
	
While questioning how the statements of the youth into the Rajagiriya accident were changed after four days later from the first statement, the Lawyers Collective member Namal Rajapaksha said some politicians have attempted to gain political mileage by bribing these youth.
Writing to the Police Chief, Lawyer Rajapaksha requested a proper investigation into the discrepancy of the statements and an inclusive investigation into the accident.
Two politicians of the Opposition control these youth on the promise of foreign employment and money, he told media after handing over the letter to the Police Headquarters.

Former US First Lady Nancy Reagan dies at 94
	
Nancy Reagan, the former actress who was fiercely protective of husband Ronald Reagan through a Hollywood career, eight years in the White House, an assassination attempt and Alzheimers disease, died Sunday at age 94, the Reagan library said.
Reagan became one of the most influential first ladies in U.S. history during her Republican husbands presidency from 1981 to 1989, Her husband, who affectionately called her Mommy while she called him Ronnie, died in 2004 after a long struggle with Alzheimers, the progressive brain disorder that destroys memory.
As Nancy Davis, she was a Hollywood actress during the 1940s and 1950s and married Reagan, a prominent film actor, in 1952. She then served as first lady of California during her husbands stint as California governor from 1967 to 1975 before moving into the White House after his decisive victory over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in 1980.
Her most publicised project as first lady was the Just Say No anti-drug campaign. After her husband developed Alzheimers disease, she became an advocate for discovering a cure.
She was diminutive and publicly soft spoken but Nancy Reagans strong will, high-tone tastes and clout with her husband made her a controversial figure during his presidency.
As Reagans wife, political partner and adviser, she became one of Americas most potent first ladies, alongside the likes of Franklin Roosevelts wife, Eleanor, Woodrow Wilsons wife, Edith, and Bill Clintons wife, Hillary.
I see the first lady as another means to keep a president from becoming isolated, she said in 1985. I talk to people. They tell me things. And if something is about to become a problem, Im not above calling a staff person and asking about it. Im a woman who loves her husband and I make no apologies for looking out for his personal and political welfare.
Tiny and frail in her later years, Reagan devoted her time to caring for her ailing husband at their home in Los Angeles exclusive Bel Air enclave. She was always a stickler for protocol and detail and stoically presided over the former presidents weeklong funeral and celebration of his life in June 2004.

Gammanpila says Indian High Commissioner should be removed
	
Opposition MP and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya general secretary, Udaya Gammanpila yesterday asked President Maithripala Sirisena to request the Indian government to recall its High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Y.K. Sinha, for what he called 'interference in domestic affairs.'
He said this while criticising a statement made recently by Mr. Sinha that he was surprised by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Oppositions stance on the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) between India and Sri Lanka. Mr. Sinha had taken a swipe at the joint opposition's Prof. G.L. Peiris saying that he should have stuck to his academic work rather than getting into politics.
Mr. Gammanpila said, Mr. R. Premadasa, when he was president, had got an Indian High Commissioner recalled for interfering in our internal affairs -- thus violating diplomatic norms. He said President Sirisena should do the same. He said people were waiting to see whether the present leadership had the guts to do so.
He said though Sri Lanka had a much smaller population than India, Sri Lankans comprised the greatest number of tourists to India. He warned India not to let the situation escalate to an extent that Sri Lankans boycotted Indian foods and stopped visiting India.
The Hindu reports:
Referring to reported observations of the former President and members of the Joint Opposition against the ETCA, Mr. Sinha, who did not mention the name of any Sri Lankan leader opposing the pact, told members of the Sri Lanka-India Society on Friday that he was surprised to come across Mr. Rajapaksas statements in sections of the local press on the issue.
It was Mr. Rajapaksas government that held negotiations with India over the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which had included trade in services. He described as quite amusing the statements of members of the Joint Opposition, some of whom were ministers during the Rajapaksa regime, when the CEPA, he said, was negotiated.
Mr Sinhas response was in the context of views expressed in certain quarters that the proposed ETCA would deprive job opportunities for Sri Lankans in a host of fields, including information technology; and that the Free Trade Agreement, effective since March 2000, had not been beneficial to Sri Lanka.
Qualifying his rebuttal, the diplomat said, I hesitate to get into the political controversy but that he felt constrained to join the debate because I do not think we should let naysayers take all the public space on this issue without anyone else trying to put the facts. (Piyumi Fonseka)

HIV rumor: Akila says child will be admitted to new school
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today the Government had decided to provide a school for the six-year-old boy, who was deprived of a school over rumours that he was HIV infected, and to meet his expenses throughout his schooling.
He said the childs mother would be provided with a new home near the childs School.
While criticizing various posts against him on social media web sites, Mr. Kariyawasam said no one seems to know the background to his statement.
I am also a father and yes I know how parents love their children. But, we should think about other issues as well. If this child is infected with HIV, it is not good for the child and the others. My hometown is Kuliyapitiya and when I checked about this matter, I found that the child did not have a good family background. I am not trying to blame his mother or father. The seriousness of the problem is still there. As Education Minister, all I want is the best for Sri Lankan children including this child, he said.
The minister requested the people not to judge without knowing all the facts of the story.
He said a private company has volunteered to sponsor the childs educational requirements.
However, the minister denied having refused to divulge the name of the school which had agreed to admit the child out of fear that the other parents would also contemplate withdrawing their children from the particular school. (Piyumi Fonseka)

I will inject myself with the blood of the child: Ranjan
	
He would have injected himself the blood sample of the child, who had been rumoured to have congenital HIV/AIDS, Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
If it is necessary to prove that the child had not infected with HIV/AIDS, I have would have done so to demolish the rumours among the people of Kuliyapitiya, he said.
If anyone challenges to prove that the child had been infected with HIV/AIDS, I will inject a blood sample of that child to open their eyes who claim that the child has AIDS, the Minister said.
The Minister visited the mother and son in Illukhena, their village, on Saturday.
The Minister shared a chocolate with the child to demonstrate to the people that HIV/AIDS cannot be contracted through even saliva.
Meanwhile, the President had issued a directive to the Ministry of Education that the child be admitted to any school in the country without any obstacles.
The Minister said according to the doctors reports they confirmed the child had not been infected with HIV/AIDS.
In fact we dont know how many Parliamentarians, Pradeshiya Sabha Members or Provincial Council Members were infected with HIV/AIDS. But if so we will never chase them away. We will look after them, the Minister said.
I have conveyed the situation to President Maithripala Sirisena. Some schools in London have come forward to accommodate the child if schools in Sri Lanka refused admission on the basis that the child had AIDS, he said.
By letting our country is sending out a message to the world that we are not caring about HIV/AIDS patients. It creates a bad image of the country. Then I thought on intervening, Minister Ramanayake said.
This is not my electoral seat. I came to the site not for any election promotion, but to find justice to the innocent child, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Indian tribunal revokes ban on Lankan docu-drama
	
Sri Lankan film Muttrupulliya, a docu-drama that portrays the life of the Tamil ethnic population in post-war, has won its appeal with the Indian Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in Chennai refused to certify it.
Directed by Sherine Xavier, a Sri Lankan national, the film was screened at the Jaffna Film Festival in Colombo, but it could not be premiered in India as the CBFC said it was glorifying the bad effects of the bloody conflict that killed about 100,000 people in a 23-year-long military campaign.
The picture will affect the neighbouring country relations. It also refers to real political leaders of Sri Lanka, said the CBFC.
Ms. Xavier along with her producer T.S. Subramanian challenged the CBFCs decision at the FCAT, which passed a ruling in their favour on February 1 but imposed some conditions for screening in India.
The film-makers have agreed to morph the LTTE flags, cut out photographs of its slain leaders, issue a health warning against narcotics and put up a disclaimer that the film is a work of fiction inspired by real events.
M. Mathialagan, Regional Officer at the Central Board of Film Certification in Chennai, told The Hindu that the film was banned after extensive consultation with senior censor board officials, which included its Mumbai-based chairman Pahlaj Nilhani.
They [film-makers] have shown an Indian girl rolling a hundred rupee note of Indian currency and snorting drugs through it. How can they disrespect our currency, said Mr. Mathialagan.
There is a picture of Prabakaran and the LTTE flag in a couple of scenes. It is a clear PR exercise for them [Prabakaran and LTTE], he added.

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today its General Secretary, and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka was not in his vehicle at the time of the Rajagiriya accident.
Minister Ranawaka was at his official residence at the time of the accident, Party National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said responding to a question at a news conference.
He said certain media institutions and MPs such as JHU breakaway Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa were attempting to tarnish the image of Minister Ranawaka by misusing the incident.
These are the people who have cases against them at the CID and other courts. But today MP Gammanpila is holding news conferences displaying maps to depict how the incident had occurred. It appears he is the one who seems to be judging the incident today, he said. 
Meanwhile, Legal consultant of the party, Tudor Perera claimed the two youths who met with the accident, had told the Police in their first statement that Minister was not in the vehicle.
He denied commenting further on the matter saying it was unethical to comment more since the Minister was yet to make a statement to the Police.
The Police are still probing the accident and if a requirement arises, they will summon the Minister to record a statement, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Ray Tomlinson, email inventor dies aged 74
	
Ray Tomlinson, the inventor of email and the man who picked the @ symbol for addresses, has died aged 74.
A true technology pioneer, Ray was the man who brought us email in the early days of networked computers, Raytheon spokesman Mike Doble said in a statement confirming his death.
Doble said Tomlinson died on Saturday morning but he did not know if he was at home and did not have a confirmed cause of death. Tomlinson worked in the companys office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The tech world reacted with sadness over the passing of Tomlinson, who became a cult figure for his invention in 1971 of a program for ARPANET, the Internets predecessor, that allowed people to send person-to-person messages to other computer users on other servers.
Originally from Amsterdam, New York, Tomlinson went to school at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and MIT in the 1960s, and was working at research and development company Bolt Beranek and Newman  now Raytheon BBN Technologies  when he made his email breakthrough.
The program changed the way people communicate both in business and in personal life, revolutionising how millions of people shop, bank, and keep in touch with friends and family, whether they are across town or across oceans, reads his biography on the Internet Hall of Fame website.
According to a 1998 profile in Forbes magazine, Tomlinson showed a colleague his invention and then, famously, said: Dont tell anyone! This isnt what were supposed to be working on.
At the time, few people had personal computers. The popularity of personal email wouldnt take off until years later but has become an integral part of modern life.
Tomlinson chose the @ symbol to connect the username with the destination address and it has become part of the international language of communication.
Around the time email started to become a household word, Tomlinson began receiving worldwide recognition for his achievement.
In 2000, he received the George R. Stibitz Computer Pioneer Award from the American Computer Museum. From there followed honors that included a Webby Award from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Science, and an Innovation award from Discover magazine, and the Eduard-Rhein Cultural Award, according to his biography.
He lived in Lincoln, Massachusetts where he raised miniature sheep. Attempts to contact his family were unsuccessful.
While more general email protocols were later developed and adopted, Tomlinsons contributions were never forgotten.
He was pretty philosophical about it all, Kuzman said. And was surprisingly not addicted to email.(The Guardian)

TPA seeks non-territoria council for Tamils outside NE
	
The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), a political party representing Tamils of the Indian origins, has proposed the setting up of a non-territorial council with legislative powers to fulfill the aspirations of the Tamil people living outside the North and the East.
Out of a population of 3.2 million Tamils some 1.6 million live outside these two provinces.
TPA Leader and National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said this was one of the proposals which a committee appointed by the TPA had wanted to be included when changing the Constitution.
What we have proposed is that the non territorial council should include Tamil MPs, provincial councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha members, he said.
The experts committee appointed by the TPA to prepare constitutional proposals to meet the aspirations of especially the Lankan Tamils of recent Indian origins is expected to handover the proposals to Mr. Ganesean next week. Mr. Ganesan said these proposals will be presented to the constitutional assembly to be set up soon.
The committee had also proposed the compulsory allocation of one ministry in central, Western, Sabragamuwa, Uva and North-Western Provincial Councils for the Tamil community, setting up a second chamber other than Parliament, the devolution of wide powers within a unitary state and an affirmative action plan for all the marginalized under privileged segments of society including the plantation workers.
The draft proposals of TPA will be discussed and finalized at its working committee meeting.
The 16-member experts committee is chaired by social activist P. Muthulingam comprises Professors M. Sinnathamby, S. Sandiresekaram, M. Mookkiah and T. Danaraj, Dr. S. Chandrabose, Senior Lecturer S. Vijesandiran, Lecturers Gowri Palaniyappan, Umadevi, senior civil servant M. Vamadevan, socal activist Bala Gowtham, former deputy minister V.
