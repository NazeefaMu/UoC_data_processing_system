A Maldive national who was suspected in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate Maldivian president Abdulla Yameen was arrested last night in Nedimala area by the Emigration and Immigration Department along with Boralesgamuwa police.
The police have deported the 18 year old suspect, Ashraf Mohammed to Maldives for investigations.
Emigration and Immigration officials said investigations had been initiated following a request made by the Maldives Embassy to arrest the suspect, cancel his visa and deport him to Maldives.
Ashraf Mohammed has been staying in Sri Lanka for one and half months, in Nedimala area with his mother and his girlfriend.
However, the FBI had said there is no evidence to confirm that last month's explosion aboard the Maldivian president's boat was caused by a bomb.
