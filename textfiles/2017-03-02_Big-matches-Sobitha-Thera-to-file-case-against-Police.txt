Founder of the Sri Bodhiraja Foundation Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera yesterday said that he would file a case against the police and other authorities for neglecting their duties and not banning school big matches.

The venerable thera had earlier called for the banning of school big matches as they promoted alcohol and immoral behaviour.

Sobitha thera said he had resorted to legal action as relevant authorities had failed to take any action to prevent malpractices from taking place under the guise of big matches in schools. “Law enforcement authorities have turned a blind eye to all the deteriorative practices involving big matches. They have disregarded the nuisance caused to the public and ignored the numerous traffic violations reported during the big match season.

Therefore I will file a case against the police, for the wilful neglect and omission of their duties,” he said. (Kalani Kumarasinghe)
