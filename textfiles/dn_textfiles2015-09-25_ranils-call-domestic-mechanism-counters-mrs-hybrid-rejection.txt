Ranil's call for domestic mechanism counters MR's hybrid rejection

The major political debate today is about UNHRC's latest report on the Sri Lankan situation. It is not surprising that the new MP from the Kurunegala District, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has called for its total rejection. This has been the pattern of Sri Lanka's reaction to UNHRC resolutions relating to this country from 2011, which is what has, in large measure, contributed to the assessments, criticisms and recommendations made in the current report.
It is encouraging that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has said in no uncertain terms that Sri Lanka will only agree to a domestic mechanism to investigate and take action, if necessary, on any matters where such action is needed. When the call for a "hybrid mechanism" for such an investigation has been made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, this statement by the Prime Minister puts the debate in the correct perspective, encouraging better debate.
In a confused and tedious response, Mahinda Rajapaksa states his government did not cooperate with the UNHRC investigation mainly because it was instituted outside the established procedure of the UNHRC. The question that arises is what on earth the Sri Lankan Foreign Service was doing to ensure the appropriate procedure was followed. One is aware that our representative in Geneva, who remains unchanged, tried his best to see that Sri Lanka displayed the proper attitude towards participation with the UN and its agencies. However, those in the Ministry of External Affairs did not think of any such policy, except for hybrid responses.
Futile effort
What the Rajapaksa administration did was to push ahead with rejection, while in a futile effort to build strength in the UN with new diplomatic links with African countries, refusing to look at any improvements within Sri Lanka to meet the expectations of the international community, which does not mean that we had to (or have to) give in at every stage to US and EU pressure on matters of national importance.
There are reports that the lobbies in Geneva pressing for an even stronger call for an international investigation into the Sri Lankan situation, will make every effort to obtain support from the countries of the EU for something stronger than the proposed "hybrid mechanism". It will be useful for the countries of the EU approached in this regard, to note that the UNHRC report has also made strong charges against the LTTE, for what it refers to as alleged human rights violations, alleged war crimes, and violations of humanitarian law. The EU countries in focus should be aware that these pressure groups remain committed to the separatist terrorism of the LTTE, with not even a minimum acceptance of the process of reconciliation.
The verbose call for rejection of the UNHRC report by Mahinda Rajapaksa also questions the Independence of the OHCHR because it is not funded by the UN, but rather through "voluntary contributions" from Western states that have sponsored resolutions against Sri Lanka, and that the staff positions in the OHCHR are largely held by Westerners. This is hardly the response one would expect from a former Head of State of Sri Lanka, who has been associated with, and also contributed to the current crisis very much, during his period in office, both in the final stages of the war against the LTTE, and especially after its defeat in May 2009.
SLFP and LLRC
Even if one is to agree with this thinking of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who for official purposes remains a prominent member of the SLFP, the leader of which is the President of this country, there is yet an important question to ask both him and the SLFP, as to the failure of his government to implement the most acceptable recommendations of the Lessons Learnt an Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), which was appointed by him, and submitted a far reaching report with enough time for good and effective implementation. One recalls here the observation by the leading SLFP member, and then Leader of the House, Nimal Siripala de Silva, and informing Parliament that the Government is not bound to implement the LLRC recommendations, although it was government appointed Commission. Subsequent events show that this was the thinking of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his government, on matters that were vital for post-war reconciliation, foreign relations and proper governance of Sri Lanka.
The continued rejection of international opinion, brought forward in the reports and resolutions of the UNHRC, the failure of the then government to take adequate steps towards reconciliation within the country, to improve the image of the county abroad, and failure to implement the recommendations of its own LLRC, are in fact the issues that continue to haunt the country today. The result is Sri Lanka now having to face the issue of a "hybrid mechanism" and the necessity to ensure a domestic mechanism for any future probe into these matters.
This has come about as a result of the previous government playing politics with this issue, in the belief that rejection of the UN resolutions, cheating or hoodwinking UN institutions, and talking about unreal dangers to the Head of State, would bring it more popularity and help support the government continue its policies of corruption, nepotism and disregard for law and order, and good governance.
Shame of the past
There are questions being raised today about the United States changing its position on the nature of the inquiry into the Sri Lankan situation from a "domestic mechanism" to a "hybrid mechanism", despite assurances by the US Secretary of State John Kerry and Assistant Secretary of State, Nisha Biswal very much in favour of a domestic mechanism. President Sirisena, in his first meeting with the media in April this year, made it clear the government was working on a domestic mechanism. The nature of this was conveyed to the UN HC on Human Rights Zeid Ra'al Al Hussein.
What is important to know is that the UNHRC's report was not written by the US, whatever the allusions to a western conspiracy by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters. It is true that the US representatives saw the changes in Sri Lanka after January 8, and were ready to express satisfaction at the steps taken towards good governance and reconciliation, with the promise of more in the future.
Yet, there is a larger reality of the immediate history of Sri Lanka, the extended pre-January 8 period of nearly a decade, which would have influenced the UNHRC report that calls for a hybrid mechanism. These are the shameful realities of the past, especially with regard to the rise in control and influence over the judiciary, displayed to the world, especially during the Rajapaksa period.
It would not be possible for those making any study of Sri Lanka, especially with regard to judicial independence, to close their eyes to the manner the last Chief Justice of the country, Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, was removed through a highly manipulated Select Committee of Parliament, the outright rejection of the Court of Appeal judgments against what took place, and the appointment of her "successor" Mr. Mohan Peiris. These are stand outs in the ugly nature of the Sri Lankan judiciary, which will create the worst impressions about the country, not easily erased by the changes after January 8.
It is necessary to go even further to look at the decline of the independence of our judiciary, which began when Justice Mark Fernando was not appointed Chief Justice, which was his due. The later appointment of Justice Sarath N Silva, as Chief Justice, certainly adds to this bad record. Those who did any studies on Sri Lanka's recent judicial tradition could not have missed his judgment in Mahinda Rajapaksa's Helping Hambantota issue. This was brought to the limelight by Sarath Silva himself in the campaign for the election of Maithripala Sirisena as President in the January 8 polls; and also how the same Sarath Silva switched sides to support MR to be Prime Minister in the August 17 general election. Apart from these highlights of a bad judicial record, there remain questions about the judiciary, when one considers recent questions in Parliament.
Another aspect that would not have missed the UNHRC is the behaviour of our Parliament, which saw its worst period after January 8, when the world was looking at Sri Lanka with better tinted glasses than the dark tint of the past.
The behaviour of the majority of MPs in Parliament at that time, are not matters that give any good marks to Sri Lanka. One must also realize that the current 'hybrid coalition' - bartered through Cabinet office, is not the best example of good democracy.
We are caught in a hybrid political combination of the good and the bad, the past and the present. It is now the overall task of the political leadership to work out a domestic mechanism for good governance, as we call for a domestic mechanism with best safeguards for sovereignty and democracy, to handle what ultimately comes from Geneva on September 30th.
