They informed Court that none of the suspects received any financial benefits from those transactions which fact was not considered by the Magistrate and had resulted in the suspects being in remand for more than a month.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa had also filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order directing the Kaduwela Magistrate to release him from remand custody. This petition is to be considered in Supreme Court on June 4 and 5. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

Video: Debate no-faith motion against Ravi on Wednesday - Bandula
	
Some United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs today urged Speaker to allow the No-Confidence Motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to be debated on Wednesday (3) without allowing it to lose its value and significance.
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said the debate was important because the minister is continuing to act in a manner which was detrimental to the countrys economy.
We will also urge the Opposition Leader to make provisions to debate the motion when parliament meets tomorrow. The no-confidence motion should be taken up even before matters relating to the Constitutional Council or the 20th Amendment are taken up in parliament, he told a news conference.
Commenting on Central Banks sale of 10-year International Sovereign Bonds at a yield of 6.125 per cent to raise US$650 million, Mr. Gunawardena said the 6.125 was excessively high and the highest since the end of the war.
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as the then finance minister sold CB bonds to raise USD$1,500 at a yield of 5.125 per cent last year. Mr. Karunanayake at the time charged that Mr. Rajapaksa had received a commission of 2 per cent. If that is so then it appears that the current finance minister has received a commission of 3 per cent, Mr. Gunawardane said.
He said the investments under the new government had decreased, inflation had sky-rocketed and interest rates increased. These are the results of economic mismanagement. This is why we need to debate the no-confidence motion against finance minister without further delay, Mr. Gunawardena said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Govt. heading for financial crisis: GL
	
The government will run into a serious financial crisis as it has failed to give legal effect to the taxes proposed in the budget to raise revenue for the financial year under review, former External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris said yesterday.
Addressing a meeting in Tangalle yesterday, Prof. Peiris said though the government proposed various taxes such as Super Gain Tax, Mansion Levy and all, none of them had been enacted in Parliament in the form of laws to give them legal effect. Therefore, he said, none of these taxes would be valid.
"The budget is a fairy tale. The government cannot raise revenue now," he said.
Commenting on the Treasury Bond issue, he said , for the first time, a person who had renounced loyalty to Sri Lanka, had placed his signature to the currency notes of Sri Lanka. He said this situation had arisen with the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran, a Singaporean, as the Central Bank Governor. Prof. Peiris held Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responsible for this appointment, and said it warranted a no-confidence motion against the government.
Also, he said the proposed electoral reforms should be enacted in the form of 20th Amendment through a majority government, and the present minority government should be replaced through a no-confidence motion.
Once that is done, he said, President Maitripala Sirisena could appoint someone commanding the majority support in Parliament as the Prime Minister.

Indias RBI set for third interest rate cut of the year
	
AFP - Indias Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates for a third time in five months when it meets this week, confident that inflation is stable enough to weather the summer monsoon.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already lowered its benchmark repo rate, the level at which it lends to commercial banks, by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent this year.
And analysts believe the RBI will snip rates again at its next meeting on Tuesday in a bid to encourage greater lending to businesses and increased consumer spending, stimulating
the economy.
I expect the RBI to cut the rate by 25 basis points, Ashutosh Datar, an economist at IIFL Institutional Equities, told AFP.
Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Services, agreed, saying she believed the Mumbai-based bank would opt for a modest cut.
Given the uncertainty concerning oil prices and the depreciation in the rupee, which have a high inflationary potential, I dont think many people are expecting a 50-point cut, she told AFP.
The RBI, led by governor Raghuram Rajan, sliced 25 basis points off the repo rate in January -- the first reduction in 20 months -- before a surprise repeat cut in March.
It kept the key rate unchanged last month, citing inflation concerns and a failure of most commercial banks to pass on lower borrowing costs to customers in Asias third-largest economy.
But Nitsure said 20 banks were now heeding Rajans call to reduce their base rate and another cut would motivate others to follow suit.
Inflation not a threat
There is a need for borrowing costs to come down because demand is so low and inflation is not a threat, she said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modis right-wing government swept to power last year pledging to reform and revive a flagging economy.
It received a major boost on Friday when data showed that Indias economy grew 7.5 percent in the first three months of the year, overtaking China. The government would like the RBI to cut rates further but Rajan has so far made controlling inflation a priority, setting a target of bringing it consistently below six percent by January next year.
In April, consumer inflation fell to a four-month low of 4.87 percent, well within the RBIs target range. Last week Indias top economic advisor suggested that had implications for interest rates.
Arvind Subramanian added that food stocks were plentiful enough to help contain inflation even if the three-month monsoon, expected imminently, is weakened by the El Nino weather phenomenon as forecast.
Monsoon rains are vital for Indian crops and a particularly dry season can reduce farm output, raising food prices which can be crippling for the tens of millions of Indias poor.
It is possible to contain (inflation) going forward even if the monsoon is not going to be as good, Subramanian added.
Datar, the economist, said the current retail inflation level gives the RBI enough headroom to be able to cut rates to try to stimulate demand.
He added that if monsoon inflation is not as bad as feared then theyll probably cut them again later in the year.
Not all experts agreed that a cut this week would be the right way to go though. Arun Singh, senior economist at Dun & Bradstreet, told AFP the monsoons inflationary risk meant the RBI should wait until it had passed.

	Former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa responding to the Siriliya Saviya allegations stated that political opponents of the Rajapaksa government had alleged that the three individuals including Mrs. Rajapaksa authorized to sign cheques on behalf of the NGO had provided false NIC numbers to the Peoples Bank.
	The names and addresses of all three signatories in the banks system are correct but an error has obviously been made in entering the identity card numbers into the computer system, the office of the former President in a statement said.
	The full statement;
	Mrs. Shiranthi Rajapaksa gave a statement to the FCID this morning to assist in an investigation concerning Siriliya Saviya an NGO run by her. The FCID was informed that Siriliya Saviya is a charity; an NGO registered with the National Secretariat for Non-Governmental Organisations and is financed by local and foreign donations.
	Mrs. Rajapaksa also stressed that no state funds were utilised in running this organisation. The Carlton Suwa Udana Programme is a part of Siriliya Saviya and was started with the aim of building a childrens hospital with residential facilities for the mothers who look after their sick children.
	A fund was being raised for this purpose. Mrs. Rajapaksa also said in her statement that owing to the freezing of the Siriliya Saviya bank account, she has come to know that three patients who had been receiving financial assistance from the organisation had died.
	Political opponents of the Rajapaksa government have alleged that the three individuals including Mrs. Shiranthi Rajapaksa, authorised to sign cheques on behalf of Siriliya Saviya had provided false national identity card numbers to the Peoples Bank Suduwella Branch. When the bank account was first opened by officials of the organisation a copy of Mrs. Shiranthi Rajapaksas passport was given to the bank and the other two signatories Mrs K. H.A.N.Jeewani Kumari and Mrs S.K.K. Dissanayake, provided copies of their national identity cards to the bank.
	The names and addresses of all three signatories in the banks system are correct but an error has obviously been made in entering the identity card numbers into the computer system. Cheques issued by Siriliya Saviya were not signed by non-existent persons. All three authorised signatories are real people who still serve the organization.

Three Lankans held for trying to smuggle ganja
	
	The Q Branch police in India have arrested three Sri Lankan Tamils, including two refugees, when they attempted to smuggle 11 kg of ganja from Thonikarai seashore near Mandapam in Ramanathapuram on Saturday night.
	Acting on a tip-off by local fishermen, a special team, led by Q Branch Inspector R. Kennedy, detained the Lankan Tamils when they reached the seashore to smuggle the contraband to Talaimannar via the sea route.
	The police identified the accused as A. Chandran (48) from Guru Nagar in Jaffna, P. Ashok (30), a refugee staying in Mandapam camp since 1997, and Rogans alias Anil (38), staying in Gudiyatham refugee camp since 1990. They were looking for a vallam (country boat) to take the contraband to Sri Lanka, when the Q Branch police detained them with the narcotic substance.
	Mr. Kennedy said the modus operandi of the accused was that they would take the contraband to the sea after crossing the shallow waters and their contact from Jaffna would receive it at mid-sea. He said that Chandran flew down from Colombo on April 20 with a valid passport and three months tourist visa for the purpose of smuggling the contraband.
	After staying in his brothers house in Madurai, he contacted his cousin Ashok and procured the ganja at Kaviapalli in Andhra Pradesh through Rogans.
	The trio later reached Mandapam and reached the seashore on Saturday night for smuggling the contraband.
	Chandran told the police that he had asked his son Dinesh, who had a fibreglass boat, to come to mid-sea at the early hours of Sunday and receive the drugs.
	Chandran had earlier visited Tamil Nadu in June, 2013, on a tourist visa but claimed that this was his first attempt to smuggle the contraband, Mr. Kennedy said.
	They were handed over to Mandapam police, who booked them under Sections 8 (c) and 20 (b) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), 1985.
	They were produced before the local magistrate court and remanded in judicial custody, the police said.(The Hindu)

UNP sticks to 225 MPs
	
Amid uncertainty over the changes in the electoral system which are to comprise the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, the United National Party (UNP), the dominant party in the government, announced its stand yesterday, saying it was opposed to increasing number of parliamentary seats from the present 225.
Earlier, President Maitripala Sirisena , in a Cabinet paper, had proposed to increase the number of seats to 255. To these, he proposed that 160 MPs be elected from single member constituencies and five from multi-member constituencies according to the first-past-the-post system; another 31 according to the proportional representation system (by district), and 59 from the National List.
Leader of the House and Plantations Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Daily Mirror yesterday that his party wanted a combination of the first-past-the-post system and the proportional representation system, but did not want the number of seats increased.
"We are for the election of 125 members from the constituencies and the rest according to the proportional representation system. We cannot agree to increasing the number of seats. Public opinion is against it. If we increase the number, it will be a burden on the people. There are 400 provincial council members serving as people's representatives in addition to the MPs," he said.
Mr. Kiriella said there were only 550 MPs in India which had a population of 1,300 million.
"We have only 20 million. So why do we need more MPs" he asked.
