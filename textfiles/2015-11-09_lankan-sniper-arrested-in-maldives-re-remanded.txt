Maldives Criminal Court has again extended the remand of the Sri Lankan sniper arrested in Maldives allegedly hired and brought into the country as part of a plot to assassinate President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, Haveeru online said.
Confirming the arrest for the first time, police said in a statement Saturday that the 27-year-old man was arrested on October 24. He has been remanded by the Criminal Court for 15 days, the police added.
The police, however, did not reveal any further details. Maldivian authorities, however, neither confirmed nor denied the arrest at the time.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror newspaper quoted the country’s defence ministry as saying Friday that the sniper in question was not attached to the Sri Lankan military.
Some Sri Lankan media outlets have even reported that the man was an importer of Maldives dry fish.
The Sunday Times identified the sniper as 24-year-old Lahiru Madhushanka.Maldives police showcase on October 31, 2015 several weapons including an assault rifle seized during a raid on an island in Baa Atoll, which is being developed as a resort, in connection to the blast aboard the presidential speedboat in September.
Reports of the Sri Lankan sniper’s arrest came a day after Maldivian security forces confiscated assault rifles and hand guns in what has been the biggest weapons bust in the country’s history. The weapons had been seized from Hibilhadhoo Island in Baa Atoll being developed as a resort.
The army had confirmed that two assault rifles found in the weapons bust belonged to the state armoury.
The items showcased during a press conference last week included several hand guns, a T56 assault rifle and a MP5 sub-machine gun. In addition, a large quantity of bomb making materials was also displayed at the press briefing.
