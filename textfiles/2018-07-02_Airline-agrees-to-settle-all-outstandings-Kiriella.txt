In response to threats by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to stop the supply of aviation fuel on credit to SriLankan Airlines, Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the national carrier had agreed to settle all overdue payments amounting to more than Rs.1 billion. However, he said the payments would be phased out or carried out on a staggered basis.

Mr. Kiriella told Daily Mirror that he would discuss this matter with the relevant authorities in an effort to sort it out.

He said his ministry had planned to restructure the national carrier.

“I will discuss it with the Cabinet when it meets on today. I have informed the CPC authorities of our plan to curtail overall expenditures of the national career. We will close flight operations on unprofitable routes,” the minister said. (Kelum Bandara)
