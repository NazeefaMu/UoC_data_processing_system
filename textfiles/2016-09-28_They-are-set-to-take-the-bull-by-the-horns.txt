Amidst the much publicized moves by the JO group to form a new political party headed by the former strongman, there are reports about persistent efforts being made by a group of Betel leaf seniors to bring about a friendly understanding between the former strongman and the Compassionate one leading to the restoration of unity in the split Blue party.

 


These seniors complain that certain secretarial ones and some others hailing from the Rajarata and the central hills have become a big impediment to their peace moves. They charge that these office-bearers of the party would quash the progress of the months of reconciliatory efforts on their part with one single irresponsible public statement.


The group of party seniors having decided that enough is enough is planning to meet the Big Boss who is also the party chief to urge in one voice to take decisive action against those sabotaging their well-meant efforts to re-unite the party. 


The group armed with a district by district analysis of facts and figures also proposes to explain to the Big Boss the fate that awaits the party at a future election if it remains divided.
