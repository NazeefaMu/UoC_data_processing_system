Abduction of man: 8 suspects, except Hirunika, accept charges


	

Eight out of the nine suspects who were accused of abducting a man in Dematagoda in 2015, accepted the charges levelled against them before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe today.    

MP Hirunika Premachandra was the only suspect who did not accept the charges.

Counsels appearing for the suspects requested the Judge to mitigate the punishment, citing that the eight suspects had accepted the charges when they were produced in court the first time.

The next hearing was fixed for November 24. (Farook Thajudeen)
