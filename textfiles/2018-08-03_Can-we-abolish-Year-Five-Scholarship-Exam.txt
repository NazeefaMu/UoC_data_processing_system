Can we abolish Year Five Scholarship Exam?


	



 

 

The Grade Five Scholarship examination has become a debated topic in Sri Lanka’s educational system. Some have strong views that this examination must be abolished in order to relieve students and parents of undue pressure. However, it’s important to analyse both the advantages and disadvantages that this examination brings. It’s this writer’s belief that academics have a moral obligation to share their views about this controversial topic. Even last week, an article on this topic was published in the Daily Mirror.   
In Sri Lanka, there are about 9,904 schools, of which 335 are national schools. About 36 of these academic institutes are labelled most popular schools (e.g. Joseph Stalin, CTU,). The Grade Five Scholarship examination provides an opportunity to gifted and talented students to gain admission into these popular schools. Students from rural or remote locations and those coming from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds depend on this examination to provide them with the opportunity of realising their dreams of gaining admission to such academic institutes.   

Need for distinct teaching styles

Research reveals that, based on learning ability, students can be pooled into two groups – fast learners and slow learners. It is always better to categorise students on this basis and teach them separately, as both groups require distinct teaching styles. When both groups of students are combined, this could demotivate the students and adversely affects their academic performances. This scholarship examination helps to identify the learning ability of students and teach them in the most effective manner.   
Scholarship examinations are not restricted to Sri Lanka. For example, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the State Government conducts the Selective School Examination in Grade Six, where students compete for a place across 19 ‘Fully Selective’ and 29 ‘Partially Selective’ schools, where they will complete their Secondary Education. Although this examination is administered and assessed in a slightly different manner, the overarching purpose is very similar to the Sri Lankan equivalent.   


Despite these advantages, it is undeniable that there are several issues that need to be addressed. It is becoming increasingly evident that the Grade Five Scholarship Examination brings stress upon students. In addition to school hours, students preparing for this examination spend long hours at coaching centres. Some parents send their children to multiple coaching centres, in an often misguided effort, to boost their chances of success. Students may attend back-to-back classes, as they manage their increasingly busy schedules. During this time, the participation of students in extra-curricular activities, such as sport, music, reading and social activities, is severely restricted, or eliminated at worst. Students are left both physically and mentally exhausted, and deprived of the ability to enjoy their childhood, or unwind from the increasing pressure applied on them.   


Parents cite many reasons to support their decision to send their children to coaching centres. Parents and students have an incorrect perception that if their child is not successful at this examination, they have a bleak, or no, future. This misguided perception is worsened by the competitive tension among students, and worse, parents. However, there is no signi<U+FB01>cant evidence to support any positive correlation between the performance at the Grade Five Scholarship Examination and future academic performance or career prospects.  Social stigma has led to this examination to gain elevated importance. This leads to what can only be described as a vicious self-perpetuating cycle – where the society believes that this examination is extremely important. Therefore parents want their children to pass it at any cost. As a result, parents place immense pressure on children to succeed in this examination, thereby giving this examination the same importance as other exams that drive their actions.   
In Asian cultures, most parents send their children to coaching centres because they believe that education obtained at school is insufficient to pass competitive exams. Competition and comparison, both of which have deep roots in Asian cultures, also encourage this behaviour, and create a similar self-perpetuating cycle.   

Coaching centres

Parents are continually looking for any means necessary to give their children a competitive advantage over others. Coaching centres are considered the best place to obtain this competitive advantage. These centres emphasise how to prepare children for examinations. Most of the time student attending sessions at these centres are spoon-fed. When students pass this exam their efforts add to the centre’s name thus ensuring <U+FB01>nancial success.   
Examinations that focus on evaluating rote learning will continue to encourage this ‘coaching centre culture’, as parents will forever believe that education obtained in school will never be enough to succeed at these examinations. If examinations were to redirect their focus on evaluating students’ critical thinking, analytical and problem-solving skills, then the additional value added by coaching centres over learning in the school environment would greatly diminish. Therefore, this will reduce the importance of coaching centres and in turn reduce mental and physical pressures on students and parents.   

 


"In Asian cultures, most parents send their children to coaching centres because they believe that education obtained at school is insufficient to pass competitive exams"


 


For example, consider Finland, where students are given little to no homework in school, and private coaching centres are extremely scarce. There is no ranking of students, thereby diminishing competition. Every school has the same national goals, and has access to the same talent pool of university-trained teachers. As a result, inequality is eradicated – every Finnish child has an equal opportunity at obtaining the same quality education, no matter whether he or she lives, whether it be in a rural village or a university town. Finland’s education system seeks to prepare children on how to learn,not how to pass examinations (Lyn Nell Hancock,2011). Focus has been shifted from a lifelong learning culture promoting learning for the sake of knowledge enrichment to learning for the sake of succeeding at examinations. This approach to education has resulted in Finland achieving 6th position in the Programme for International Student Assessment(PISA).   


As the saying goes, “Rome wasn’t built in a day” – change is possible, however it will not happen overnight, and requires long-term planning, resources and commitment. As a short-term policy, eliminating the Grade Five Scholarship examination is an unthinkable task, however in the long-run it is possible with radical changes in Sri Lanka’s education system. By ensuring that our education system promotes learning beyond passing examinations, to learning to sustain personal and professional development – deep seeded cultural values and the importance given to certain examinations as milestones, can be changed. This will help to alleviate the physical and mental burdens placed on both students and parents, ensuring that students maintain a healthy balance between academic and extra-curricular activities. Ultimately, this will ensure that present day students are adequately prepared to serve as the leaders of tomorrow – both on a national and global scale.
