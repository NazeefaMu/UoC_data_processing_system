The Foreign Affairs Ministry today denied reports of former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed meeting President Maithripala Sirisena or any other Sri Lankan politicians.
Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said Mr. Nasheed was only on transit in Sri Lanka while on his way to Britain for medical treatment.
Several media reports earlier published a photograph showing President Sirisena and Mr. Nasheed together claiming they had met during Mr. Nasheed’s transit through Sri Lanka. It was later revealed that the photograph had been taken some time ago.
However, Mr. Nasheed held separate meetings with the British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Maldives, James Dauris and US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Atul Keshap in Colombo on Tuesday.
