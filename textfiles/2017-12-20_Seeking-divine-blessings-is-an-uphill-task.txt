Seeking divine blessings is an uphill task


	



 

There is a leading politico in the upcountry estate sector who makes frequent visits to Kovils dedicated to the pantheon in the neighbouring country. His latest pilgrimage was to Lord Ayyappan Kovil at Sabrimale in Kerala. 

 

Devotees visiting this Kovil are required to observe the traditional rite of climbing a hill on the way to it, dressed in black. This leading politico too had started climbing the hill to gain access to the Kovil and had trekked only a few yards up the hilly terrain when he found himself too exhausted to proceed any further. 
The politico did not want to climb down nor could he clamber up the steep hill. Meanwhile, a small group of young men had come forward to carry the politico on a palanquin up to the Kovil, of course, for a substantial payment. 


At the Kovil he had conducted a pooja and said a fervent prayer for divine intervention leading to the offer of a high government position of power and authority to him in the near future, they say.
