JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake today said National Integration and Reconciliation Minister Maithripala Sirisena, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D .M. Swaminathan and National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan should resign from their portfolios for having failed to spend even half of the funds allocated to their ministries.

"I propose that if Parliament had powers, these three ministers should be removed from their portfolios immediately," he said claiming that the three ministries were vital in promoting national reconciliation.

He told Parliament that the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry had spent only Rs. 328 million of the allocated Rs. 3,532 million last year, which was only 9 per cent while Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry had spent only Rs. 6,000 million of the allocated Rs. 10,167 million.

He said the National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry had spent only Rs. 434 million of the allocated Rs. 1,603 million. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
