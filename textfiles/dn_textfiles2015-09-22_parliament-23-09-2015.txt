UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena requested the Speaker to facilitate a fair time to debate the Bills stating that they refer to many new taxes and levies.
“These are related to the interim budget proposals, but the government failed to pass them during the 100 day interim period of the government. They should not be passed hurriedly. We need a fair time to debate the content of each Bill,” he said.
UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the Bills presented cannot be moved for debate till seven days are spent with regard to the Parliamentary tradition.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the Bills will not be taken up for debate this week.
Temple Trees provided jobs during previous regime - Handunnetti

DNA MP Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament yesterday that Temple Trees was an institution that provided political appointments during the previous regime. The ministers of then government did not have powers to appoint persons to the statutory bodies that came under them. They had to get approval in writing from Temple Trees, he said.
MP Handunetti said so while participating in a debate at the time of adjournment of the House.
The government should follow a systematic mechanism in recruiting people to the public sector.
Even former Ports Ministers Rohitha Abeygunawardene wrote letters to MP Namal Rajapaksa to get permission to recruite people to the Ports Authority.
That is why the people defeated the previous regime on January 8.
The present government is also doing the same thing. It has not learnt a lesson from the past.
The government recruited 275 persons to the NSB Bank as clerks through telephone calls without following proper recruitment procedures during its 100 day programme. If the government continues this policy, people would give them the result they deserve soon.
Public Administration Deputy Minister Susantha Punchinilame said that plans are drawn to set up a mechanism which will allow only those with merit and qualification to get public sector jobs.
TNA MP Mavai Senadhiraja said the unemployment rate in the North and East is high. The government should take action to provide solutions to the problem, he said.
