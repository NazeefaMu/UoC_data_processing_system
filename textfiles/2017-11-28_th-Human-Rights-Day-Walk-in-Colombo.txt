70th year


This year marks the 70th International Human Rights Day. Thus this will be a wonderful opportunity to reflect on how human rights has been protected worldwide. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was established in 1948. Ever since it has acted as a guideline to protect humanity and uphold human dignity, which form the foundation for ensuring human rights.  


Each one of us has instilled a sense of pride and dignity within us and that is human nature. The established regulations of human rights ensures that your dignity is upheld during any situation whether it is; family, school, work place, hospitals and even the bus stop. Thereupon we can come across 30 situations when people are entitled to their human rights, all because they’re human. The humanity within us demands the need to protect each one of us.  


This pops the question ‘where is Sri Lanka placed on the road to human rights? Are our children treated humanely enough? Are our women protected? Are our labour rights protected? Do you earn a satisfying salary for your services? These questions will be best answered by the rising annual rape rate in our country which is 6.75%. Other points that can help answer this question are the vast unemployment and never-ending plea for favourable wages. Just consider the protests made and the petitions that grieved parties have forwarded.   

 


 

 

No one is alone 


Still, in such a world of technology and development, people’s minds are narrow enough not to understand the fragility of children and the social responsibility they have towards protecting them. Child abuse not only takes place in the form of violence, they are abused verbally and mentally too. We tend to neglect our children and run to our workplaces. 


We neglect our children, our wives, our husbands, our siblings, our parents and our friends. If we stop a minute to understand the difficulties they experience and build up a communication network, no one will have to face their fears alone.   


It’s time people come together and educate themselves and the youth about the basics of human rights. These rights were set forth by the United Nations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The purpose of the ‘walk’ is to unite people and make human rights a reality. Through education we can end a war, discrimination and intolerance. Yet 69 years on, children aren’t educated about human rights at school.  Youth and adults still aren’t aware of basic Human Rights. The walk for Human Rights is an awareness program and the largest to be held, in connection with this day, in Sri Lanka.  


 

We neglect our children, our wives, our husbands, our siblings, our parents and our friends. If we stop a minute to understand the difficulties they experience and build up a communication network, no one will have to face their fears alone


 


Join hands with us in creating a network of support and care. Be present at independence Square on this day by 4.00 pm clad in white to create awareness and celebrate humanity.
