The Sri Lanka Customs today destroyed forfeited stocks of ninety kilogrammes of Indian Swiftlets nests and precook feathers at the Madampitiya cemetery. There were about forty kilograms of edible Indian Swiftlets nests, which had been seized during several detections made by the Customs officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) destined to far eastern countries. Bird’s nests were protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance and the Forest Ordinance. Pix by Kushan Pathiraja
