Ukraine’s ambassador to Delhi, Dr Igor Polikha, on Friday became Delhi’s latest snatching victim.   
Polikha’s iPhone was snatched while he was taking photographs of the Red Fort.  


The thief, police said, snatched the phone by approaching Polikha on the pretext of taking a selfie with him.   


Police said they had strong clues regarding the identity of the thief, but no arrests had been made and the suspect remained absconding three days after the crime.  


Police said Polikha was on a morning walk at the Ukraine Embassy premises in Vasant Vihar on Wednesday morning when he suddenly decided to visit the Red Fort.  


He left his driver and car in a parking lot in Daryaganj before wandering towards Angoori Bagh. A photography enthusiast, Polikha climbed up a small Hanuman temple as he thought he would get a good shot of the Red Fort from the temple’s roof.
