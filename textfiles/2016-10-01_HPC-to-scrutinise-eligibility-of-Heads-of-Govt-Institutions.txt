HPC to scrutinise eligibility of 54 Heads of Govt. Institutions


	

The Parliament High Posts Committee (HPC) will scrutinise the eligibility of 54 officials appointed as Heads of Government Institutions, sources said yesterday.

They said Peoples Bank Chairman Hemasiri Fernando and Bank of Ceylon Chairman Ronland Perera were among the 54 heads of State Institutions.

Mr. Fernando and Mr. Perera were appointed to their posts in 2015. There have been issues pertaining to some of these 54 appointees.

Parliament sources said this was the highest number of appointments which the Committee was examining in recent times.

In keeping with Standing Orders the committee examines officers of the rank of ambassadors, secretaries to ministries, heads of government corporations and other enterprises, advisers and consultants to ministries.

When a person is selected for such a post the Parliament Secretary General is informed of such an appointment so that steps may be taken to have the appointment scrutinized by the High Posts Committee. He then requests the person so nominated or appointed to furnish certain information about him or herself to the Committee. Subsequently the public are informed of the appointment through the print media so that a person who wishes to make representations may do so. The committee takes all these facts into consideration before making its report about such appointments. (Yohan Perera)
