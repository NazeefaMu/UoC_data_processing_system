As before -- Ambagamuwa PS will administer Sri Pada


	

Sri Pada will continue to remain within the Ratnapura District and under no circumstances would it be administered by the Nuwara Eliya District despite the carving out of three new pradeshiya sabhas from the Ambagamuwa PS, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said.

He said under the new delimitation process, there was an unfounded belief that Sri Pada would come under the Nuwara-Eliya PS and thus a voter had filed a petition in the Court of Appeal on this matter.

The minister told the media that he would reveal the true position in the Appeal Court and vowed not to allow the LG polls be affected because of this case.

“Mischievous elements are attempting to create a religious and ethnic tension using the delimitation process. The setting up of three pradeshia sabhas from the Ambagamuwa PS will not affect any of the religious or ethnic group,” he said.

The minister said he would present another amendment to the Local Government Bodies Electoral (Amendment) Bill today in Parliament to remove certain discrepancies among the Sinhala, Tamil and English drafts of the Bill and would in no way affect the LG polls.

He said his ministry has become one of the most efficient and active ministries with Rs.22,164 million being spent on various development projects in the nine provinces. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
