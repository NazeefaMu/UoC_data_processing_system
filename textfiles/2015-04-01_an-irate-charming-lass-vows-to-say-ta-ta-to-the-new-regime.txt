An irate Charming Lass vows to say ta-ta to the new regime


	


	The senior Banda from the Hills who too was elevated to Ministerial status recently came under flak from the Charming Lass from Kolonnawa the other day.

She charged that the top brass of the new government committed an unpardonable blunder when they accommodated in their Cabinet a person who wanted to have the pleasure of seeing the former Madam parade the streets in the nude. The former Madam herself had taken the Maithri regime to task over the same issue.
Speaking at the Western Council, a visibly angry Charming Lass complained that the new regime appeared to be turning a deaf ear to their protests.  “If this government continues to proceed in a wrong direction, we will have no alternative, but to say ta-ta and sever our links with it,” she added.
