Life insurance market leader Ceylinco Life has opened its new eco-friendly four–storey purpose-designed branch building on company owned land in Bandarawela, strengthening its presence in the Badulla district and demonstrating its commitment to the environment.
The 8,880 square foot new office building at 327, Badulla Road, Bandarawela accommodates five sub branches of the company with over 80 sales and non-sales staff and offers ample parking space for customers.
The building’s energy requirements are provided entirely by solar power, with energy efficient air conditioning and lighting systems minimising consumption of electricity. A rain water harvesting facility provides water for the washrooms, which also use water recycled via a sewerage treatment plant, reducing the threat of earth slips in the vicinity, the company said.
The new building also has a conference facility that can accommodate up to 50 people at a time, to facilitate training of staff.
To celebrate the opening of this ultra-modern building in Bandarawela, Ceylinco life is conducting a regional art competition covering the Bandarawela, Badulla and Welimada areas. An exhibition of entries received is to be held at the new building towards the end of September.
Ceylinco Life operates the largest branch network in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every one of the island’s 25 districts.
The company already owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia and is constructing new branch offices on company-owned land in Trincomalee and Wennappuwa.
Independently rated one of Sri Lanka’s most valuable brands, Ceylinco Life has maintained its leadership of the country’s long term insurance sector from 
2004 onwards.
