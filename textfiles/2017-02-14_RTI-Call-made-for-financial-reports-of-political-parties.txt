A civil society group has asked for the financial statements of all political parties in the country under the Right to information (RTI) Act.

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) Director Sankhitha Gunaratne told Daily Mirror that her organization had officially requested the Elections Commission (EC) to submit the financial statements of all political parties by February 7.

“We met the EC Chairman. He gave us a file number and assured us that the information will be given as soon as possible. The EC is well prepared to provide the information asked for under the RTI and appears professional in its approach,” she said. (Yohan Perera)
