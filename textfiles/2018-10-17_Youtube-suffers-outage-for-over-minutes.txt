Youtube suffers outage for over 30 minutes


	

YouTube experienced widespread broadcasting issues, affecting YouTube, YouTube TV and YouTube Music, with the Google-owned streaming service down for almost two hours.

YouTube said it was looking into reports of issues with its services, as users contacted them complaining about the website being down from about 1.30am GMT.

Some users trying to access the YouTube homepage received an error message appearing saying: “Sorry, something went wrong. A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with this situation.” Other attempts led to the homepage opening but no video content being displayed.

YouTube responded to questions about the system breakdown by directing the Guardian to a tweet posted on the YouTube homepage. “Thanks for your reports about YouTube, YouTube TV and YouTube Music access issues. We’re working on resolving this and will let you know once fixed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will keep you updated.” (The Guardian)
