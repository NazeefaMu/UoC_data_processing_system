Paying private debts at public expense!


	



 

There were three hopefuls in the running for the EP governor at the outset. And of the threesome, the one heading the list was Atha of the old left hailing from the Kegalle district. When it appeared that he was the most likely choice for the coveted post, many yahapalanaya stalwarts had fallen over one another to extend their well wishes to the veteran politico. 

 


Meanwhile, an ASP (not of the khaki tribe) practicing diplomacy in the Arabdom too had entered the fray.  In fact, he had come back home to conduct Poojas to invoke the intervention of deities on his behalf. 


However, all interested parties had a surprise and the two hopefuls a jolt when a controversial turncoat character was suddenly appointed to the post. 


Informed sources say that the appointment was the result of a recommendation that had come from a very high level. They say that this high office offered to the lucky one on a platter is a token of gratitude for a good turn done to a high authority some time ago. And a certain person with close ties to Sangha also was behind this unexpected appointment, they say.
