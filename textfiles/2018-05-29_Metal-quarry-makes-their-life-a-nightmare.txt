Metal quarry makes their life a nightmare


	

Residents in several villages north of the upcountry main city have become victims of sound pollution and lung disease because of a metal quarry now being operated in the area by a close buddy of a very powerful political authority, they say.




No action has been taken so far, either to close the metal quarry or provide necessary safety measures in the interest of residents of about seven to eight villages located around this metal quarry either by the authorities sporting Dharmachakra insignia or those committed to “the vision of a clean and green environment through service excellence” despite numerous complaints made to them so far, they say.
