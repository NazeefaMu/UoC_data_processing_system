The government was ready to hold elections for local government bodies and three provincial councils this year, UPFA General Secretary and Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.

Amaraweera refuted claims that the election was postponed due to the instability of the government. “We have no reason to be afraid of holding the elections. It was delayed because of the delimitation report,” he said.

Speaking of the rumors of a cabinet reshuffle, Amaraweera said the government had not made such a decision, but the possibility of a reshuffle was present as the President and Prime Minister could do so without a warning at any given time.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
