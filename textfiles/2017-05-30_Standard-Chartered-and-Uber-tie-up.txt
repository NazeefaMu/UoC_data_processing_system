Standard Chartered is delighted to bring to its credit cardholders a 20 percent cash back on Uber rides with a saving of up to Rs.1,500 a month, for cardholders with total monthly retail spends of a minimum Rs. 40,000 on their credit cards. New users who download the Uber app – one of the world’s most popular transport apps, and register with their Standard Chartered credit card will be rewarded with the first 2 rides free, up to a maximum of a total of Rs. 600.
Bingumal Thewarathanthri, Head of Retail Banking, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka, commenting on the Uber offer said,“As we grow ever more conscious of providing desired solutions and money savings to clients, we are delighted to partner with a service provider such as Uber to bring this cash back offer to our credit cardholders. There has been a dramatic shift towards digital and cashless payments across the region and we are seeing success in the seamless integration of the bank’s services in our clients’ everyday life.”
Standard Chartered’s digital agenda focuses on delivering simple and convenient banking through digital channels for increasingly tech-savvy clients. The collaboration with ride hailing service providers such as Uber will allow access to the bank’s clients to what is fast becoming a mainstream feature of transportation globally. Uber has captured a significant market share of the taxi services sector in a short span of time with its interactive and efficient mobile app and has a transport network operating in more than 425 cities, and Standard Chartered’s partnership will provide its cardholders with an added saving each time they use the service.
Standard Chartered constantly seeks new ways in which to delight its clients and deliver greater value and provide a more seamless travel experience for the bank’s cardholders. Given the shift towards cashless transactions, there is strong demand for more accessible digital payment options, and with this partnership, Standard Chartered cardholders are rewarded with convenience and cash back when they go cashless with Uber.
Terms and conditions apply to this offering including that the maximum cash back amount per month is limited to Rs. 1,500 per cardholder, and the eligibility for cash back is only on one credit card. The cardholder must have a minimum monthly retail spend of Rs. 40,000 to avail themselves of the Uber cash back benefit. 
Transactions that are excluded include cash withdrawals, balance transfers, loans on card, fees, interest and charges levied by the bank.
