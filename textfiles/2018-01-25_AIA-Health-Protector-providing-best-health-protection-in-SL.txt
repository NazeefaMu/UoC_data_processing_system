No one plans to get sick or hurt, but most people would need medical care at some point, and if that time comes, its best to be well prepared.


AIA CEO Pankaj Banerjee stated: “Medical inflation in Sri Lanka is increasing at an alarming rate with a very large portion of all healthcare expenditure being out of pocket and not funded by insurance or government. Also, the health insurance penetration in Sri Lanka is quite low. That is why we want to step in and create a safety net against any unforeseen medical expenses you may face.”


“With the rise in NCDs and other lifestyle diseases, it is very important to invest in a good health insurance. Not having health insurance or having an inadequate cover can leave you vulnerable with the cost of medical treatment either consuming all the savings or people having to borrow. You must have a health Insurance that will empower you to do what’s right by your family,” he added.


With a host of ‘best-in-industry’ benefits, AIA Health Protector provides comprehensive health with life insurance. A key feature of this product is worldwide coverage (all countries excluding US and Canada) for hospitalisation and surgery, which covers for up to Rs.20 million, rest assured that one could get the best treatment in Sri Lanka or overseas.


Customers can also enjoy the convenience of cashless hospitalisation at over 60 hospitals in Sri Lanka, so they don’t have to worry about hospital bills when they have a medical emergency to deal with. Pre and post hospitalisation expenses which are directly related to the customer’s hospitalisation, such as doctor’s appointments and medical tests are also covered. Not forgetting the daily cash income of up to Rs.20,000 a day, which can be used for any unexpected expenses due to hospitalisation or loss of income. The policy covers 250 surgeries as well as 136 one-day surgeries, and if one has the misfortune of having to face a critical illness such as cancer, heart attack, stroke or kidney failure, then that too is covered. In fact, the policy covers 37 major critical illnesses.


In the event that a policyholder passes away, their family will receive the Life Benefit and Health Fund which will give them the financial security they require in sudden and unexpected circumstances.
Of course the best option is to try to stay healthy. That is why AIA rewards customers for staying healthy, with an attractive ‘No Claim Privilege’ that increases protection each year the policyholder is free from illness, and doubles the coverage over ten years. Furthermore, when the policy matures, the loyalty will be rewarded with a significant Loyalty Reward which will leave a larger Health Fund.
