An Indian soldier and three suspected rebels died in a shoot-out along the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir with Pakistan early Thursday, the army said.   



 

Soldiers deployed along the heavily militarised frontier known as the Line of Control (LoC) shot and killed the three suspected rebels when they tried to cross into Indian-administered Kashmir from the Pakistan side.   


One soldier also died in the exchange of fire, the army said in a statement.   


The deaths came a day after Indian soldiers killed three combatants as they tried to cross into the territory.   


India regularly accuses Pakistan of arming militants and pushing them across the LoC to launch attacks on its forces.   


Islamabad denies the allegation, saying it only provides diplomatic support to Kashmiris seeking self-determination.   


 Both claim the territory in its entirety.
