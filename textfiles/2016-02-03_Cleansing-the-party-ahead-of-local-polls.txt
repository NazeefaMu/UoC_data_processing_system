The new Big Boss is set to appoint new electorate organizers for the party he leads. And most Diyawanna members now paying Pooja to the former strongman are to get the chop in the process, they say.

 


The Big boss has already given the red light to these dissident members by overlooking them in the matter of appointing authorities to the electorate level development committees. He will next proceed to replace the current party organizers at two or three selected places. 


Of the party organizers loyal to the former strongman, the first to get the walking papers will be a stalwart from a political family in the Gampaha area. This politico is said to be highly inspired by an astrological prediction that he is a potential main purohita of the country. He is to be replaced by one of his siblings as the electorate organizer.


The tuition master now functioning as the party’s organizer for Homagama is to be replaced either by the lesser known Tilakasiri or the better known megapolis pilot, they say. However, it is a cinch that the tuition master is out of the picture.
