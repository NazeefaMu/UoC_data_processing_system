Gnanasara Thera surrenders to court

General Secretary of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Ven. Galaboda Atte Gnanasara Thera surrendered to the Fort Magistrate this morning, after an arrest warrant was issued against him for not appearing in Court.  
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday issued a warrant for the arrest of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galaboda Atte Gnanasara Thera for not being present in Court in connection with two cases filed against him and several others.
In one court case, BBS general secretary Ven. Galaboda Atte Gnanasara Thera and seven others had been named as the suspects in connection with disrupting a media conference organised by the Jathika Bala Sena (JBS) at the Nippon Hotel on April 9 last year.
In the other case, the prosecutors alleged that the BBS General Secretary had allegedly made a defamatory statement to Islam and the Holy Quran on April 12, 2014 near the Slave Island police station.
When the two cases were taken up before Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage, Ven. Gnanasara Thera and the third suspect in the first case were not present in Court.
