Two wrongs make one right for him!


	



 

There is a white collar high-up, a political appointee, serving in the country’s diplomatic mission in a foreign country.  He has misused his official position to secure a job for his wife in that country, they say.

 


Although the white collar ones in his service are transferred out after serving a three-year stint in one foreign country, this one has managed to remain in this posting for a long period far in excess of the stipulated stint thanks to his connection to a powerful political authority, they say.
