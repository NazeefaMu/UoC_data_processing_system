A tug-o-war over a proposal that deterrent action be taken against a powerful person of the previous regime is underway, they say.



Several team members at the top table are said to be pressing for action against this former bigwig who exercised much power from a secretarial level. Meanwhile, the two main factions in yahapalanaya, Green and Blue are embroiled in a protracted debate over the pros and cons of the proposal. However, the duo at the top are yet to give the green light for action against the former powerful one. 


Meanwhile, a source close to the highest echelons said: “The last regime committed a big blunder by throwing the army chief into jail. Why should we commit a similar blunder?”
