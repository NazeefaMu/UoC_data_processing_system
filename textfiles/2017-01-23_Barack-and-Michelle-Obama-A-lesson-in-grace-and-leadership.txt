Barack and Michelle Obama  A lesson in grace and leadership


	

The American democratic process is flawed. Democracy means one person one vote. Democracy is at its best when all of its citizens vote. It is a travesty when in the world’s beacon of democracy, the United States of America, one candidate can win the presidency by losing the popular/people vote and winning the electoral college vote. But this is the flawed system now in America. In this flawed system, America has Donald John Trump as its 45th President.   
This democratic system also gives the right to 50 elected representatives of the people to choose to boycott the Inauguration of the new President. The civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis told the world that Donald Trump was “not a legitimate president”. Over 50 % of America did not vote for the new President. The reality is that the former reality show star and real estate billionaire is now the President of the USA and leader of the free world!!! Will he lead? He wants to “Put America First”. The campaign is over. He did it HIS WAY and even danced with his wife at an inauguration Ball to Frank Sinatra’s “MY WAY”!! The dance is over. Now the hard work begins of above all uniting a very divided nation. Let us see if he can “Make America Great Again”.   
The Democrats produced a very flawed candidate with arguably the most powerful resume of any candidate for president in recent memory, Hillary Rodham Clinton. The overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in the election, the yet inexplicable behaviour of FBI Director James Comey, the clouds hanging over the Clinton Foundation, the unprecedented ugliness of the Trump Campaign and the distrust of and many missteps of Hillary Clinton, clearly cost her the election. She along with her husband Former President Bill Clinton now appear to have lost their lustre. It is sad.” Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely”.   
With all the ugliness and bitterness in the Presidential Campaign, the world has just witnessed an unbelievably graceful transfer of power in the most powerful nation in the world. This is a lesson for the world. This would not have happened if not for the grace and leadership displayed by now Former President Barack Obama and the amazing First Lady Michelle Obama. Donald Trump was the man who for years questioned Obama’s legitimacy as a President and led the movement demanding to see the President’s birth certificate. Trump and the birther movement believed that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and not in America! Two weeks ago, I was invited to a men’s Christian prayer breakfast in Southern California. The vast majority of the 200 participants believed that Barack Obama was a Muslim! How could Obama embrace Donald Trump who addition to questioning his legitimacy as President promised in his campaign to undo the entire Obama legacy which included the Affordable Care Act, the Iran Nuclear Agreement, the Trans Pacific Trade Agreement, etc etc???

Business and government leaders must know when to let go with grace. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, whatever one might think of him, did not have to resign. But he chose to let go and resign with grace.   
What is grace? The biblical definition is ‘Unmerited favour”. A good thing is done to us that we do not deserve or earn. Every human being on earth is moved to tears when the Christian hymn is sung: “Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me; I once was lost but now I am found; was blind but now I see”. Grace is also defined as follows: Smoothness and elegance of movement; courtesy, politeness, decency, breeding, respect; to bring honour or credit to someone or something by one’s action, attendance or participation. Barack and Michelle Obama may have given grace a new meaning.   
 Who can forget the images of Barack and Michelle Obama with Donald and Melania Trump at the inauguration especially during the welcome to the White House for tea and the departure of Barack and Michelle on Marine One which took them to Andrews Air Force Base for the Air Force One flight to California. Because Barack Obama was no longer the President, the plane was not called “Air Force One”!! The New American President and his wife must also be given credit for their graciousness to the Obamas at the inauguration. However, it was the incumbent President, Barack Obama, who took the lead and gave instructions to his staff to make the transition peaceful and graceful putting all the ugliness behind.   
How many leaders in Sri Lanka can you think of who have grace? How many leaders know how to let go and depart the stage with grace? How many leaders in Sri Lanka resign or leave the stage because it is the right thing to do? Doing the right thing with grace is at the core of leadership and must be taught in every pre-school, high school, college, university, professional institute, government organization, business organization and every church, mosque and temple.
