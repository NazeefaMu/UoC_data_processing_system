Accountability must be addressed before framing new Constitution: Wigneswaran
	
The Chief Minister of the Tamil-majority Northern Province, C.V.Wigneswaran, has said that accountability for the war crimes allegedly committed in the last phase of Eelam War IV must be established before the Sri Lankan government formulates a new constitution to address the basic political question, Indian Express reported.
Addressing the Tamil Peoples Council in his capacity as its co-chairman in Jaffna today, Wigneswaran said that the constitution planned by the government will not be drafted to the Tamils satisfaction unless accountability issues were satisfactorily addressed prior to that.
He told the council that he had heard from someone involved in the constitution making exercise that the government is planning to brush accountability under the carpet by showing the international community before the September session of the UN Human Rights Council, that it is seriously working on a new constitution to address the political grievances of the Tamils. The plan is to get the new constitution passed by the March session of the UNHRC. By doing so, the government hopes that it can divert attention from the accountability issue and urge the Tamils to look to the future rather than look back at the past.
Wigneswaran said that it is essential for any Sinhalese-dominated government in Sri Lanka not to be seen letting down the predominantly Sinhalese armed forces. Therefore, every effort will be made to dodge the issue of accountability or water down the accountability process.
Government has already said it will not allow foreign judges. But the Tamil people cannot rely on the impartiality of Sri Lankan judges when the accused are military personnel as exemplified by the recent acquittal of six army officers in a case relating to the slaughter of 24 Tamils in Kumarapuram in Trincomalee district in 1996, Wigneswaran said. The Tamils must insist on having foreign judges in the proposed Judicial Mechanism, he emphasized.
On the importance of accountability for the Tamils ,Wigneswaran said that fixing responsibility for the conduct of the armed forces during the war is a duty owed to the young militants whose sacrifices had brought the Tamils issue to the attention of the world.
As regards the new constitution ,Wigneswaran said that the Tamils must insist on the adoption of a federal structure with the unification of the Northern and Eastern Provinces to form a single Tamil-speaking province. The Chief Minister said that even if the term federal is not used, there could be an arrangement to give self rule as adopted in Spain after the ouster of dictator Franco.
Justifying the call for the merger of the North and East, Wigneswaran said it is necessary to keep the culture and integrity of the Tamil speaking people against encroachments by the majority Sinhalese. Within the united North and East, the Tamil-speaking Muslims could have separate autonomous unit, he added.
Wigneswaran called for vigilance against attempts by the Sri Lankan government to divide the Tamil-speaking people and by-pass the NPC in taking decisions relating to matters pertaining to the Northern Province. When experts recommended that the Northern Economic Zone be located at Omanthai and the NPC agreed, a certain Central Minister insisted it should be in Thandikulam. This finally led to the setting up of an Economic Zone in two places.
When the NPC objected to the project to build 65,000 prefabricated houses for war displaced saying that they are uninhabitable, the Sri Lankan government said that the houses would be given to the displaced Sinhalese and Muslims, thus dividing the displaced. The government also formed a separate committee to resettle displaced Muslims and Sinhalese.
Now an attempt is being made to identify ancient Sinhalese villages in the North on the basis of evidence of Buddhist practices, with the aim of settling Sinhalese in these villages. Wigneswaran pointed out that the so-called Sinhalese villages were actually Tamil Buddhist villages because the Tamils were Buddhists in ancient times. (Indian Express)

Darren Sammy sacked in 30-second phone call
	
Darren Sammy, who led West Indies team to World To glory, posted an emotional video on his social media handle to share that his captaincy had been taken away from the selectors.
In his post, he said that the selectors had reviewed his captaincy and later informed that Sammy wont be part of the West Indies team anymore.
I got a call yesterday morning, it was probably 30 seconds, from the chairman of selectors telling me that theyve reviewed the captaincy of T20 and I wont be captain anymore of the T20 team, [and] my performances have not merited selection in the squad, Sammy said in the video.
Thats okay, Ive always believed West Indies cricket is not about Darren Sammy. They are looking to the future and I wanna wish the new captain  I dont know if its out yet so I wont call any names  all the best as he looks to lead West Indies cricket and take it forward.
Obviously, throughout my captaincy, winning the two T20 World Cups has been the highlight. And these memories I will cherish for a long time. This is not me retiring from one-day or T20, its just me thanking the fans and my players and the coaches Ive worked with and WICB foryeah, letting me lead the side for the last six years. But for now the captaincy has come to an end and thank you people.
I just know I played with my heart and soul whenever I stepped out on the cricket field.
In the recently concluded CPL tournament on the Caribbean soil, his team St Lucia Zouks lost to Trinbago Knight Riders in the finals. He also stated that he wanted his players to know that he was proud of their performance and should always hold their head high.
Six years ago I was asked to captain West Indies, a task which I fought [and] would be the biggest challenge in my career, in my life, Sammy said. A task which I know would be so difficult but guess whatI took it head on. I embraced the challenge, I embraced the difficulty. I turn up at the office which is my playground, the cricket field, every day and put in the work.
The exclusion of Sammy from the team comes just few days before India takes on West Indies in a two match T20 series in Florida at the end of August. (Indian Express)

Over 200 held for protest near SL embassy in Chennai
	
Tense situation prevailed at Nungambakkam in the Chennai city yesterday, after members of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam held a protest in front of the Sri Lankan deputy high commission.
The Indian media reported that the cadres demanded for an inquiry into the deaths of Lankan Tamil refugees. Speaking to reporters, the party's general secretary Kovai Ramakrishnan said, "There should be an international inquiry into the suspicious deaths of 104 persons in refugee camps".
Stating that there is no difference between the functioning of the erstwhile Mahinda Rajapakse regime and that of the incumbent Maithripala Sirisena, he said, "Both the government function against the interests of the Lankan Tamils".
Seeking safety of the Tamil community in the island nation and in camps, Ramakrishnan said, "The international court of law should investigate into the deaths of the 104 persons after the 2009 Lankan war, as doubts continue to linger if the deaths were caused due to vaccination or other foul motive".
Even as the protestors attempted to march forward into the embassy, the city police put a check and apprehended them. As per sources, about 200 members were taken to custody by the police.
