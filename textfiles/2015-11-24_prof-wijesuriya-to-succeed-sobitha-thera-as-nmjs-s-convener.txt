Professor Sarath Wijesuriya had been appointed as the convener of the National Movement for a Just Society following a unanimous decision of the executive committee of the movement, said Sisira Jayamaha its general secretary.
The post fell vacant with the demise of the Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, the Viharadhipathi of the Sri Naga Viharaya, Kotte.
The executive committee had met on Monday at the Sri Naga Viharaya and unanimously appointed Professor Sarath Wijesuriya as its convener. In addition, the Ven Ittepane Dhammalankara Thera, the Mahanayake of the Kotte Sri Kalyana Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha was appointed as its chief patron, and Kotte Sri Naga Viharawasi, the Ven Udakalakande Ariyaratane Thera as its patron. These appointments, too, were unanimous.
The general secretary said that 47 parties and organisations which had worked closely with the National Movement for a Just Society before the presidential election, and 110 organisations that worked with it during the general elections would hold discussions relating to the future programme of the movement, as agreed on at the executive committee meeting.
