President Sirisena should resign from SLFP leadership - Gammanpila

Sri Lanka Freedom Party members are of the view that President Maithripala Sirisena should resign from the party leadership to protect it, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader and Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila.
Opposition member Gammanpila said it is ambiguous as to who attempts to reverse the decision on the school students' uniform taken at the Economic Management Committee headed by the Prime Minister.
He made these observations at a press conference at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya party office at Pita Kotte yesterday.
Gammanpila said they see the leadership of the SLFP and its General Secretary as invaders. He said they took over the power of the party by exploiting the power they gained at the elections.
"The General Secretary of the party cannot tell members not to work with sister parties. We all contested as the United People's Freedom Alliance," Gammanpila said.
He said as long as President Maithripala Sirisena is in the party, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya would not contest
under the UPFA banner.
"If the CEPA is signed, the economy of the country would collapse. The unemployment rate would rise," Gammanpila said.
"We are ready to discuss the matter with government officials," he said.
