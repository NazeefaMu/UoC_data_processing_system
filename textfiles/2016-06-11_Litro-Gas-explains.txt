In response to the Daily Mirror article titled “Litro Gas Open Tender Raises Eyebrows,” which appeared on June 8, 2016, Litro Gas Lanka Limited has sent the following clarification:

“On May 27, 2016, the LPG tender was closed at 3.00 p.m. Around 3.15 p.m. the box containing the bids were brought to the head office auditorium.

At the time of opening the bids, the Chairman of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd and the Managing Director of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd together with the Directors of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. --Procurement Manager, Managing Director Litro Gas Terminal (Pvt) Ltd, an official from the Ministry of Public Enterprises and eight representatives of the bidders were present.

It is pertinent to note that this is the first time in the history of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd where a representative of the Ministry was present and the representatives of the bidders were allowed to witness the opening of the tender.

The purchase of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) is not purely dependent on the price. There are many aspects of technical evaluation in its totality that qualifies as the best price coupled with the best technical evaluation would be considered in making the final award.”
