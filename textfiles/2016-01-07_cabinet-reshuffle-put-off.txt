	The anticipated Cabinet reshuffle is likely to not take place as President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had decided to put it off.
	Informed sources said this decision was made by the duo after a discussion. The two leaders are of the opinion that the opposition will get political mileage out of a cabinet reshuffle if it frustrates some Ministers.
	However, it is expected that some joint Opposition members who are likely to cross over to the government will be given cabinet port folios soon. It was previously reported that Opposition MP Geetha Kumaraisnghe would be appointed as the Chairperson of the Galle District Development Committee after her anticipated cross over to the government.
