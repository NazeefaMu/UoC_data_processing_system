The world’s first digital art museum opened its doors to the public in Japan earlier this month, allowing patrons to step all the way into the artworks.

Attendees are able to move freely through the 9,000-square meter interactive gallery. The exhibition itself is linked in real-time to the real-world seasons, which means that no two trips to the museum will be the same.

The installation is located in the Digital Art Museum: teamLab Borderless in Tokyo’s Mori Building and is a collaboration between Japanese art collective teamLab and Tokyo-based urban developer Mori Building. Tthe Jakarta Post)
