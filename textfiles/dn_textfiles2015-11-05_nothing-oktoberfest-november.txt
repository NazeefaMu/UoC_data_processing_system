Nothing like an Oktoberfest in November

Authentic German food, lots of brew, Bavarian Music, German entertainment and a festive ambiance is what it is all about at Hilton Colombo’s original and authentic German food festival - the Oktoberfest. Going on their 22nd consecutive year it has been a full house jam packed event every single day at the hotel’s Sports Centre Arena.
You guys have until tomorrow, November 7, to enjoy this great feast that is really one of the most looked forward to event of the year!
The 7 member Bavarian band playing Oom-Pah music has been keeping the crowd going crazy on the tables and chairs with their heart felt and soul shaking music. These are some of the highlights of the opening night.
