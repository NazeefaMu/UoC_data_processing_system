March 15, 2016 saw the wrapping up of the Sri Lanka Investment Summit in Singapore on a high note. Attended by 100s of professionals from various corporations in the financial industry, the summit hosted a number of prestigious speakers, including high-profile members of the Sri Lankan government and notable personalities of the finance and commercial world. 
Investor confidence received a huge boost at this summit, increasing Sri Lanka’s chances of positioning itself as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia.
This was aptly demonstrated in the month following the summit, where the country experienced a complete turnaround with a net inflow of Rs.15 billion, stemming what was a steady decline with outflow of nearly Rs.270 billion in the 12 months preceding the summit. “Sri Lanka is the next best thing just about to happen and when it takes off, Sri Lanka will not need to have marketing or promotions of any sort as it will take off faster than a rocket. But until that moment, the pearl of the Indian Ocean needs to earn and build up a level of trust with the investor. We believe, in Sri Lanka, it’s a matter of time before everyone else does,” stated Perpetual Treasuries Limited CEO/Head of Group Treasury Kasun Palisena.
Perpetual Treasuries has made it its mission to connect both local and international investors with opportunities in Sri Lanka’s debt and equity markets and to support the growth and development of Sri Lanka’s capital markets through the provision of specialized investment services. 
Driving this, it was one of the prime sponsors of this recently concluded investment summit in Singapore.
