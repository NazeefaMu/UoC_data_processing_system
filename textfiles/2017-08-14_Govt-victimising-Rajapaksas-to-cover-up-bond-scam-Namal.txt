“Sri Lanka government using Rajapaksas to cover up bond scam. Former First Lady, Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Rohitha called to CID/FCID this week,” he tweeted.

The Police said today the CID asked former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s wife Shiranthi and their son Yoshitha to report to the CID to record statements in connection with the defender jeep which had allegedly been used to provide protection to a VIP after it was given to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation by the Red Cross in 2011.

They said Rohitha Rajapaksa was asked to report to the FCID tomorrow to record statement over an ongoing investigation.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
