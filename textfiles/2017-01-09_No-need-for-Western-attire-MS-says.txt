No need for Western attire: MS says


	

President Maithripala Sirisena said today he would cancel the circular issued by a former president making it mandatory for high-ranking public servants to be clad in western attire when reporting to work.

He said in future it would not be necessary to wear the blazer and tie except on special occasions should the need arise.

“I attended an annual Pirith ceremony held on December 31 in Polonnaruwa. It was almost midnight when I arrived at that place. I saw our divisional secretary in a tie listening to the chanting of Pirith. I asked him why a tie at this hour. I believe the circular issued by the former president may be the reason for doing so,” he said.
