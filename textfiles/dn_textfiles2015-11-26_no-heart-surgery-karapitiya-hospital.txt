Until CTU relocation
No heart surgery at Karapitiya hospital

Consultant Cardio Thoracic Surgeon Dr. Namal Gamage attached to the Karapitiya General Hospital told the media that heart surgeries will not be performed at the hospital until the Cardio Thoracic Unit (CTU) is shifted to another location and the surgeries have been suspended due to purely scientific reasons.
According to Dr. Gamage who has performed over 14,000 heart surgeries,it is essential for patients to be kept in a sterilized environment after surgery.
"This is because they are extremely prone to various infections after surgery due to the very low immunity. If a patient gets infected with germs, there is 98 or 99 percent chance of the patient dying. Therefore, such patients should be kept away from all forms of germs," he said. Dr. Gamage said three of the children who underwent heart surgery at the Karapitiya Cardio Thoracic Unit died due to infection.
"At present, there is a three month old infant in my ward in critical condition due to an infection after heart surgery," he said.
"A specialist doctors' team from Guys Hospital, Britain who recently visited the Karapitiya Hospital were appalled after observing the poor hygienic condition in the unit," Dr.Gmage said. He said the prevailing condition cannot be approved at all.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne visited the unit a few days ago, inspected the condition and promised to relocate the unit.
