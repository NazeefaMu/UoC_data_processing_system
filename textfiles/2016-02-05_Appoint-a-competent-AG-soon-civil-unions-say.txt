Appoint a competent AG soon, civil unions say


	

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) today urged the government to immediately appoint a talented and independent person to the post of Attorney General which was vacated by acting AG Suhada Gamlath.

Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, Professor Sarath Wijesuriya said that the legal institutions in the country were still not strong enough even though they had spoken several times to the President and the Prime Minister regarding this matter.

“The request made by Cabinet to dissolve the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) cannot be accepted. The ones who made this request may be those who had engaged in these crimes. So, the Attorney General’s Department, which is the most important state unit to implement law, should be led by a very responsible person. In order for good governance to prevail, the Government should make legal institutions more powerful,” said Professor Wijesuriya.

However, the NMSJ members praised the government’s decision to sing the National anthem in Tamil during the Independence Day Ceremony which was held at the Galle Face Green on Thursday (4). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
