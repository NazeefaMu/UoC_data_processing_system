The areas within a radius of one kilometre from the Salawa Army Camp are likely to return to normal by Thursday.

This was said at the Pahathgama Divisional Secretariat Office meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

As many as 1,783 families had been affected by the major fire which broke out at the armoury of the army camp with some 1,120 people of 186 families still displaced and sheltered in the welfare camps at Padukka, Bopitiya and the Wataraka Schools.

It was also revealed that nearly 2,300 households were without water. The Army assured that all affected areas would be cleared up within 48 hours. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
