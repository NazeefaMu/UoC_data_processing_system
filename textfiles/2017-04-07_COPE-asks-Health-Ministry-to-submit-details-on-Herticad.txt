The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has ordered the Health Ministry and the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) to submit  clinical and purchase details of the questionable Russian-made ‘Herticad’ vaccine on May 24 on reports that the vaccine was harmful to cancer patients.

“We have summoned officials of the Health ministry and the SPC to inquire into the quality of the vaccine,” COPE Chairman Sunil Hadunnetti said.
