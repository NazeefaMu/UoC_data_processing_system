It has come to light that a Diyawanna member in yahapalanaya is the livewire behind providing food and drink to a group of employees now on a protest fast at a key point decisive for the country’s imports and exports. 

 


This member holding a high post in the august assembly has been supplying food for the fasting employees from a restaurant he owns, they say.


Three people well-known for three different kinds of activities are directly involved in this catering service on the sly.


The Diyawanna member, daggers drawn with a purohita has found that a congenial way of hitting at the latter is to back the fasting employees, they say.
