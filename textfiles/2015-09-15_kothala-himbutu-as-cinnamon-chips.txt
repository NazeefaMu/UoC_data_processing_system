Three suspects including a wharf-clerk, a businessman and an exporter from Colombo 11, were arrested. The consignment had been declared as 1,600 bags of Cinnamon chips to the customs.
	The Customs had brought back the 20-foot container after the investigations had revealed that arrangements had been made to send the container to Japan from Malaysia. Pix by Kushan Pathiraja
