BUSTED: “This hasn’t been proved although most of our women believe in it. It was something said in the past and was a traditional belief, but it’s not true. Foods that should be avoided are those that are not fresh, food that has decayed, food that have been contained for a long time in preservatives, unhygienic food which is contaminated with bacteria and fecal matter, food that hasn’t been tested, uncommonly eaten food. Food and drinks that contain a lot of sugar and alcohol should be avoided. Also if you don’t know the composition of the food, it is better to not eat it. In addition to this the foods that contain trans fatty acids and deep fried food should be avoided. This is because it can be a problem to both the mother and the baby. Another food that should be avoided is the food that contains heavy metals such as deep sea fish, which contain a high level of mercury. Half boiled eggs also should be avoided,” said Dr. U.D.P Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital
