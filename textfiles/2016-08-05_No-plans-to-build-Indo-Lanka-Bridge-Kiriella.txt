No plans to build Indo-Lanka Bridge: Kiriella


	

Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella has denied claims by the joint opposition that there are plans to build the Indo-Lanka Bridge, connecting the two countries.

"There are no plans to build the Indo-Lanka Bridge. The joint opposition hung on to the Bond issue, the VAT and Foreign Judges being brought down to Sri Lanka. Now they are clinging on to a bridge. In the end they will end up hanging onto Hanuman's tail. There is no reason to build that bridge. We have a lot of bridges to build within the country," the ministry said in a statement quoting Minister Kiriella.
