A parliamentary delegation, serving in the two watchdog committees, will undertake a tour of the European Parliament next month, an official said yesterday.

There are two watchdog committees- the Committee on Public Enterprises and the Committee on Public Accounts. These two parliamentary bodies supervise the financial activities of the state institutions.

Secretary General of Sri Lanka Parliament Dammika Dissanayake told the Daily Mirror that five from each of these two bodies would undertake a visit to Brussels next month to study the functions of the European Union Parliament.

“This is an invitation extended by them. Altogether ten MPs- five from each- will travel next month,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
