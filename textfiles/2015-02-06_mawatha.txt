The official residence of former minister Keheliya Rambukwella (on Keppetipola Mawatha Colombo 7) is to become the official residence of President Maithripala Sirisena, government sources said.
This building was earlier used by D.B. Wijetunga as his official residence when he was president. It is reported that the premises are now being renovated.
Mr. Maithripala Sirisena had announced, some time ago, that he would not reside at President’s House or at Temple Trees if he were elected President.
Sources also said that the residence occupied at present by President Sirisena, on Wijerama Mawatha Colombo 7, which he had occupied since the time he was a minister would now be handed over to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.(Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
