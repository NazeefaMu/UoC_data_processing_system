At least 45 people have been killed after 14 carriages of an Indian express train derailed in northern Uttar Pradesh state, reports say.

More than 100 people have been reported injured.

It was not immediately clear what caused the coaches to derail.

Krishna Keshav, who was travelling in the train, told the BBC: "We woke with a jolt at around 3am. Several coaches were derailed, everybody was in shock. I saw several bodies and injured people."

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted: "Anguished beyond words on the loss of lives due to the derailing of the Patna-Indore express. My thoughts are with the bereaved families.
