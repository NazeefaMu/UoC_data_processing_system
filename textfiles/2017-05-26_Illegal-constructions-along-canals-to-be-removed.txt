Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today ordered the authorities to remove all illegal constructions that built blocking the canals and waterways.

Minister Ranawaka said due to the heavy showers received, the water level of Kelani River has rose and therefore a flood risk has been erupted in the Colombo, Kolonnawa, Kaduwela, Wattala and Kelaniya areas.

The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLRDC) and the related institutions were instructed to remove all the illegal constructions that were built blocking natural waterways and canals. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
