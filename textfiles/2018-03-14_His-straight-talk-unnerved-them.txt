His straight talk unnerved them


	



 

It is no longer news that there was a move afoot in the recent past to offer the law and order portfolio to the politico-turned-war hero. 

 


The news that the war hero was to be placed in charge of Police had sent several parties into jitters. Meanwhile, a number of purohitas and Diyawanna members and members of the country’s highest political family had risen in revolt against the proposed appointment. 


Several top cops too had informed the big boss that they would not feel comfortable in a set-up where the war hero could have his watchful eye on them.  The war hero who got worked up on hearing about the reaction of the top cops had rung them and inquired from them why they were opposed to his becoming their political authority. 


Some top cops had got highly unnerved by this inquiry directed at them pointblank and had remained tongue-tied for some time before they could stammer out a suitable reply, they say.
