The government had decided to consider the employees of the Hambantota Port, who were staging a protest as having vacated the post, if they failed to report to work before 2.00 p.m. today.

Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the government could not lose any income to the country because of political needs.

“We have had to send several ships away from the Hambantota Port and one ship was sent to the Colombo Port due to the protest. Several more ships will arrive tomorrow,” he said.

He said if the employees reporting to duty were less, some more people from Hambantota would have to be recruited and added that until then some employees from Colombo would be called on to Hambantota.

The Minister said damage had been caused to the computer system of the port and floor area due to the sabotage by the protesters.

“We will assess the loss caused to the Port due to sabotage by the protesters and take legal action against them. The loss of income to the Port due to the protest will also be revealed by next week,” Mr. Ranatunge said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
