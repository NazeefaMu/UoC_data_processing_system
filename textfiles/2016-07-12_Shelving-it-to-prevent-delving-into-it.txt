Shelving it to prevent delving into it!


	



 

Some elements in yahapalanaya are making a determined effort to suppress a sensational report carrying incriminating findings about a bigwig who held a high office in the government, they say. This report currently lies in the custody of a high Diyawanna authority.

 


The interested parties have decided that the damning report if allowed to go public would certainly place their political party in a bad light and they should leave no stone unturned to shelve it as a secret document.


Under the normal procedure, a report of this nature is referred to the council library as a public document after its presentation in the House.
