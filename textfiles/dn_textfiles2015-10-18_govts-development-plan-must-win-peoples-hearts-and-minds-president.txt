Govt's development plan must win people's hearts and minds - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said the government is duty bound to develop the country while winning the hearts and minds of every ethnic community.
"This Government's efforts has been widely appreciated and supported by the international community. The government will expedite development work," the President said.
The President was speaking at the Muslim Central College, Kaduruwela yesterday. Construction work of a two storied building commenced at the school under the "Pibidemu Polonnaruwa District Development Programme" under the patronage of the President.
The President stressed that the best investment for the future is investing on education. Therefore, the government is launching a proper mechanism to offer the best education for students, while engaging in the developing of every school as a developed school. President Sirisena added that the country's development plan may change from time to time due to political decisions which is not healthy situation for a country which is driven by development. Therefore, it is a timely need to bring the country forward with a common mechanism, which is free from political background.
The President while highlighting the need of identifying development priorities said that several four way carpet-roads constructed in the last regime are not properly utilised since the failure of identifying the development priorities prior to commencing those development projects. The government is engaging in building a peaceful environment suitable to live peacefully and happily for every ethic in a brotherly manner.
No room will be left to have conflict again. He said that unlike the past no room is also left for ethnic hatred, he stressed.
