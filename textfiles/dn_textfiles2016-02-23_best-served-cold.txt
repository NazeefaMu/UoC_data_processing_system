BEST SERVED COLD?

 
Leonardo DiCaprio has an Oscar finally in sight! Director Alejandro González Iñárritu has finally presented the ‘Titanic’ star a challenging role in which he is able to prove his acting proves rather than glide through the scenes using his blond good looks!
Vengeance, as they say, is a dish best served cold and that is exactly what ‘The Revenant’ signifies. The opening scene itself sends a chill through our bones. We are taken to a campsite in which furred beasts are massacred. It is something out of a nightmare that González Iñárritu has created and promises that more gruesome scenes will follow.
The next major set piece in the film depicts DiCaprio's bearded tracker Hugh Glass's near-demise at the paws of a wild bear that takes him for a threat to her cubs. The scene is one of the finest in the movie simply because the bear’s behavior is questionable here. It is a wonder whether the animal knows what she is doing when she snared Glass, puts a paw on his head while pressing hard on him and drooling all over him. Though the visual effects are a little jarring in a movie that's otherwise entirely practical, nature red in tooth and claw has rarely been captured like this on screen. It's a devastating bout of savagery that leaves Glass with bones broken and skin rent open in an awful manner.
Glass is left for the dead by his company and keepers. He is lifelong enemies with John Fitzgerald. Glass’s son is murdered by Fitzgerald and Glass is on hot pursuit for revenge. However the odds are stacked against Glass.
The imagery is sublime. Primal landscapes straight out of an Albert Bierstadt painting and weird wastelands pulled from Glass' subconscious unfold on screen.
The supporting cast: Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Lukas Haas, Dave Burchill, Melaw Nakehk'o, is terrific. Poulter in perticular looks on the verge of tears at all times. Hardy emanates menace as the half-scalped villain of the piece. But the movie belongs to DiCaprio for his raw performance. He may have uttered only a handful of dialogs but his torn throat and courage has the viewers rooting for him with all their heart!
‘The Revenant’ is not for everyone. Only those who can stomach it should watch it. It is a powerful trip but make sure that you mind and spirit is ready to endure it. Unapologetically cruel and startlingly realistic with its violence, ‘The Revenant’ will test your emotions.
Sadly, like Fitzgerald and destiny, the film can't escape its own deadly script. Rich imagery and lithe camera movements are thwarted almost at every turn by unconvincing details and leaden dialogue. The film can't be seen outside the context of its Oscar ambitions.
