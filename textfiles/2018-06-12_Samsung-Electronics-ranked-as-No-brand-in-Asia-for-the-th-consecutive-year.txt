Samsung Electronics topped the ‘Asia 's Top 1000 Brands’ leader board for the seventh year in a row, in a survey by Hong Kong-based communication marketing company, 'Campaign Asia Pacific' and  Nielsen. Samsung's brand strategy that pursues "social goodness" has played a major role in the company's product competitiveness.  Samsung Electronics ranked 17th in the survey in 2004, but has steadily climbed to the top for three consecutive years since 2009. The survey was conducted from 16th March to 11th April 2018 amongst consumers from 14 countries including Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, who were asked to name their most trusted brands across 15 industries. In order to ensure an accurate representation through this study, the survey targets age, gender and monthly household income to establish a balanced survey landscape.
 
Addressing evolving consumers’ needs and wants is essential in helping Samsung pave the way as a forerunner of the industry, with community engagement being an integral part of maintaining the rapport Samsung has with the communities it is involved in.

Every year, Samsung invests around US$14 billion in Research & Development to ensure that they are at the cutting edge of innovation. More than a fifth of their staff works in R&D and this dedication allows Samsung to remain at the top of their game, with their recent launches (listed below) reflecting the unwavering pursuit of excellence Samsung pursues. 

Samsung Sri Lanka was awarded the People’s Youth Choice brand of the year award at the recently-concluded SLIM Nielsen People’s Awards. This accolade is a reflection of the electronics giant’s ability to lead the industry in Sri Lanka as well. Its recent introduction of Infinity Display to the local market has taken the brand to an aspirational level, since it understands consumer needs better than any other brand. This year, Samsung was focused on mobile digital advertising with products targeting and meeting the needs of the youth of Sri Lanka. Samsung mobiles offer diverse features for youth who are continuously craving better camera quality and advanced options when it comes to taking images or selfies to highlight their lifestyle and multitasking. Samsung is the only brand to cater to a wider audience with not only mobile devices but Gear VR which creates a virtual reality of experience for the audience.
