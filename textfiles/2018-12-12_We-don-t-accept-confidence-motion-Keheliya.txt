UPFA MP Keheliya Rambukwella said that they don’t accept the motion of confidence presented and passed in support of United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament today.

Addressing a news briefing, MP Rambukwella said they were not in a position to accept anything done and said in ‘an illegal and undemocratic parliament’.

“Anything passed in this parliament becomes null and void. That is the very reason why we have been boycotting the parliamentary sessions,” Rambukwella said.

“Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has been partial and bias to the UNP and acted according to their agenda in Parliament which is undemocratic,” the MP said. 

He added that the Speaker had violated the Democracy, the Standing Orders and the Tradition of parliament when considering his recent tactics. 

“That’s why we reiterate that the only solution to resolve this prevailing political impasse is to let people elect their representatives by way of a general election,” he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
