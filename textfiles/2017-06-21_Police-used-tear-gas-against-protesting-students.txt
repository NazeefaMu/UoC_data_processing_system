The protest of the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) went violent with over 85 students being hospitalized after the police used battons, teargas and water cannons to disperse the students who surrounded and took over the Health Ministry building.

The university students forcibly entered the Health Ministry building at Maradana in violation of the court order issued by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.

Earlier today, the Magistrate issued an order preventing IUSF students from forcibly entering state institutions and causing a public nuisance during their protest.

The protesting students renewed their demand to abolish the private medical faculty at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
