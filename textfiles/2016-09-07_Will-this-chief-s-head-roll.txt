The Second in Command in yahapalanaya recently participated in a multi-purpose party programme held in Diyatalawa. 

 

While the programme was underway, the party’s bigwigs hailing from the province complained to the party leader that they were getting shabby treatment from the chief purohita. They also explained how the Greens were being discriminated against by the provincial chief both at administrative and political level. “Even some Betel leaf members of the council have got sick of this provincial chief and even they will readily give evidence against the man if an inquiry is held,” they added.


Informed sources say that the Green leader had taken this complaint seriously and he would report the provincial chief to the authorities in the highest echelons shortly.
