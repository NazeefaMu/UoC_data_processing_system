The Colombo Chief Magistrate today served the draft charges against NFF Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa and six others for protesting at Bullers Road opposite the UN office, on the arrival of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zaid Raad Al Hussain of the UNHRC on February 6, 2016.

When the matter was called for an inquiry today, Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake issued a copy of the draft charge sheet to the Counsel of the suspect for scrutiny and perusal.

President Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing with Counsel Kapila Gamage informed the Magistrate that his clients would file objections if there were any against it.

The Magistrate considering the submissions of the Counsel for the defense fixed his order for November 12 and ordered the suspect’s Counsel to file objections if any, one week before the next case date.

The seven suspects Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenaike, Roger Seneviratna, Mohamed Muzammil and Don Lucian were alleged to have caused a public nuisance during the protest. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
