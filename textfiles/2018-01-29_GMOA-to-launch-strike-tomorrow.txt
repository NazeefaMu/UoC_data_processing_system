The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today threatened to go ahead with the planned 24-hour countrywide token strike tomorrow over various demands including that of rectifying salary anomalies.

It said if the government failed to provide a reasonable solution they would launch an indefinite countrywide work stoppage on a date to be decided upon.

The token strike will begin at 8.00 am tomorrow at all the government hospitals excluding maternity hospitals, Cancer Hospital, the Lady Ridgeway Children’s Hospital, Army Hospitals and the emergency services and Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Units. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
