Former minister and Sri Lanka Freedom Party MP Mahinda Samarasinghe today claimed that a mob led by United National Party (UNP) MP Palitha Thewarapperuma had forced an Agalawatta Pradeshiya Sabha UPFA member to kneel down at the Agalawatta town and then assaulted him.
He said the incident had taken place yesterday morning prior to the opening of a SLFP party office in Agalawatta.
“The mob had arrived on bicycles and in vehicles attempted to remove the decorations that had been put up. PS member Murugan Pushpakumara was also there. The mob led by the UNP MP had dragged Murugan to the town, forced him to kneel down and then assaulted him,” Mr. Samarasinghe told a news conference today.     
SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said UNP supporters including some of its MPs were continuing to intimidate and assault SLFP supporters in the aftermath of the presidential election. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
