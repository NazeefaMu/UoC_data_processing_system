Just in time for the holiday season, Nations Trust Bank American Express cards once again declared its extended settlement plan programme. Cardmembers can convert any travel-related transaction into a 12-month interest-free payment plan with their choice of travel agent, tour operator or even online. This offers cardmember travellers an opportunity to splurge more on on-trip activities and to see the world on their terms, while creating memorable experiences.


Perennial favourites and exciting new locations are trending this year, according to Nimesh Fernando, Head of Cards at Nations Trust Bank, sole acquirer for American Express.


“Topping the list of trending destinations this year so far is London, a lasting favourite for its famous landmarks and culture, with Rome as a close second,” revealed Fernando. “While exotic locations such as Morocco, Seville and Barcelona in Spain that offer enriching experiences are also becoming sought-after get-a-ways,” he added.


For the ‘travel bugs’ the promotion timing cannot be better. A survey carried out by a few travel agencies in the country show that family travel during school vacations had increased in 2015 over the past years. The survey also spotlights family vacations being most popular while cruises were also making waves in recent times.  Card members can avail themselves of this offer until May 15, 2016.
“Airline travel costs are the single largest down payment that a family has to put down and we are delighted to offer our cardmembers the benefit of ease of payment with our 12-month interest-free instalment plan. Our cardmembers can now travel the world absolutely hassle free,” said Fernando.
