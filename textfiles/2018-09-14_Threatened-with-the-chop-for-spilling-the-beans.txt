Employees of a distillery belonging to a businessman involved in a major financial fraud are these days under a constant threat of being laid off at any moment, they say.

 


The businessman owning this distillery, by the way, is a buddy of a leading politico in the country.


The management had been holding the sword of service termination over the neck of the employees ever since the excise sleuths had begun making surprise raids on the distillery.


The raids had begun following complaints that they had been using tabooed artificial base materials and ingredients for producing the brews.  


The management is said to be suspecting that a section of the workforce is behind the complaints to the authorities that had led to frequent raids on the distillery.
