JO not planning to grab power: MR


	

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the joint opposition was not planning a conspiracy to grab power in the country.

"We are only opposed to the privatization and alienation of national resources," he told journalists after visiting Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.

When asked about the removal of a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) provincial councillor from his portfolio, Mr. Rajapaksa said what happens when some members are removed is this his or her colleagues also resign in protest.

He said when agreements are being signed with the United National Party (UNP), other parties raised objections.

“The crux of the problem is not the decrease or increase of the support to any party. The people will show displeasure when other parties join the UNP. These protests against the government increase day by day. This exposes the political instability in the country,” Mr. Rajapaksa said. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
