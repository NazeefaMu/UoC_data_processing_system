Release of Tamil prisoners, in accordance with legal framework - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said that even though he was genuinely interested in releasing all Tamil political prisoners, it had to be done according to legal framework as there were many other factors influencing the issue which needed careful consideration.
The President made this observation when he met the Board of Ministers of the Northern Provincial Council led by Chief Minister C V Vigneswaran, said Provincial Health Minister Dr P Sathyalingam.
Minister Sathyalingam said this was the first time the President had held official talks with the Board of Ministers of the Northern Provincial Council, adding that the main topic of discussion from their angle was the release of the 262 Tamil political prisoners.
The President also told them that the Attorney General's Department would be submitting a report on this matter on November 16 and steps would be taken to release the prisoners after considering the recommendations of the report.
Although the President had agreed to release the prisoners systermatically, 31 of them were released on bail on November 11.
At this meeting, Chief Minister Wigneswaran requested the President to follow a system similar to the common amnesty system given to JVP activists and the release of 12,000 LTTE members after rehabilitation and the release of political prisoners. They also discussed several other proposals regarding services that should be rendered to the Northern Provincial Council.
Following the meeting with the President, Sathyalingam said the four Provincial Ministers visited the Magazine Prison to ascertain the conditions of Tamil political prisoners, but the Chief Minister was unable to join the others due to previous engagements. They said that out of prisoners, four were on a hunger strike for the past four days. They also said that the Chief Jailor and 9 political prisoners were hospitalised following the fast.
