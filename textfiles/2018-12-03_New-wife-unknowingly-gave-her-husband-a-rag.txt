A story that was reported from the Rajarata region can act as a classic example as to why men should ideally buy their own footwear after fitting them on and not leave the task to their wives.

The story is of a young man who holds a prominent position in the tourism industry and was held in high esteem by his employers. He was also newly married. Due to his likeability he was often called upon to represent his company at training sessions held in Colombo.

Since he was due to attend a seminar in Colombo of behalf of his office, the first since he entered into matrimony, he decided to go home and tell his wife the good news. His wife was also proud of her husband and to show her support for his endevours she proceeded to buy him several shirts and trousers along with a pair of shoes.

Having got all his things organised he took off to the venue of the seminar in Colombo. A day before the event he decided inspect his kit for the next day that was carefully selected and packed for him by his wife. The shirt and trouser she had chosen were fine and he then tried on the new pair of shoes she had bought for him and as he walked up and down he felt a difference in the two shoes. He took them off and inspected them and they both appeared to be the same size. He then proceeded to take a measuring tape and measured the two and found to his horror that they were two different sizes. He then called up his wife and went on a tirade about how careless she was and how much trouble she had put him into by her actions.

He was then forced to go to the closest shoe shop and get himself a pair of shoes that fit him so that he could attend the training the following day.(Chapa Madubhashi)
