Seeking political clout through a marriage tie


	

A certain Diyawanna member from the Puttalam district who had made a name for acts of thuggary is said to be walking on air these days.

 


“I can make our Lokka pirouette on my palm,” he would often brag, they say. 


The reason for his unusual buoyancy is that a young girl closely related to him is now the betrothed to an intimate of the Lokka, according to informed ones. 


Incidentally, this politico who had been berating the Lokka in the past is facing several court cases.
