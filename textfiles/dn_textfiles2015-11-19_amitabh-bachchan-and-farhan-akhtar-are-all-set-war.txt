Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar are all set for a war

Two new posters of Amitabh Bachchan - Farhan Akhtar Wazir were finally released after keeping us waiting for a long time! These two new posters give away the lead actors' names and characters. Amitabh plays Pandir Omkarnath Dhar while you will see Farhan as an ATS officer Daanish Ali in this flick.
There are war scenes in the backdrop of the posters and the catch line reads: This New Year, Make Your Best Move. This film sure will be intense and power-packed with stellar performances by Amitabh and Farhan. Amitabh plays a wheel-bound chess-master while Farhan plays an ATS officer. Amitabh is seen sporting long grey tresses while Farhan is looking all serious with a moustache.
Two teasers of Wazir have already been released, one was unveiled last December while the other in June this year. Wazir, which releases on January 8, 2016, has been directed by Bejoy Nambiar . For the first time, Amitabh and Farhan will appear together onscreen. However, Farhan has previously directed Amitabh Bachchan in his 2004 film Lakshya.
