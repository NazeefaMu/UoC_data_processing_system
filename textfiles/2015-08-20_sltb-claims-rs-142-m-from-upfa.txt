The SLTB filed a lawsuit in the Colombo Commercial High Court today against the 2015- presidential election committee members of the UPFA, including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, claiming a sum of Rs. 142 million.
The complainant said the UPFA had hired buses from the SLTB for the January 8th presidential election but had failed to settle the payments after obtaining the services.
The SLTB has named seven UPFA election committee members, including Mr. Rajapaksa, Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Gamini Senarath, as respondents. The case had been filed through Somaratne Associates. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
