Treasurer Scott Morrison has been sworn in as Australia's Prime Minister to replace Malcolm Turnbull after a Liberal Party coup, Sky News reported a short while ago.

Mr Morrison, an ally of deposed leader Mr Turnbull, won a three-way battle for the leadership.

The other two contenders were former home affairs minister Peter Dutton and foreign minister Julie Bishop. Mr Turnbull opted not to contest the vote.

Liberal Party whip Nola Marino announced: "The successful candidate was Scott Morrison. He won this vote 45-40 against Peter Dutton.

"In relation to the deputy's position, this was won in a overwhelming sense, in a majority, an absolute majority, by Josh Frydenberg."

Speaking to the media in Canberra, Mr Turnbull said he will quit politics now his replacement has been chosen.

He said: "I want to thank the Australian people for everything they've done. It has been such a privilege to be the leader of this great nation.

"I love Australia. We have the most successful multi-cultural society in the world and I have always defended that.

"We must never allow the politics of race or division or of setting Australians against each other to become part of our political culture."

It is Australia's sixth change of prime minister in 11 years, prolonging an era of extraordinary political instability.

The leadership battle was sparked on Tuesday by an unsuccessful challenge by Mr Dutton, who narrowly lost a vote against Mr Turnbull.
