UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi today rejected claims made by SLFP Senior Minister John Seneviratne with regard to the refusal to release the Seevali Grounds in Ratnapura for the joint opposition rally on Saturday.

At a media conference, she released a letter received from Municipal Commissioner M.W. Kulathilaka and claimed that she had never lied in the past and had no intention of doing so in the future.

“Former municipal councillor Tyronne Attanayake last month applied for the Seevali Grounds as well as the lorry parking area saying it was required for a sports event to be held on October 7 and 8. On October 3 we sent a letter to the Commissioner requesting for the Seevali Grounds on the basis that we are expecting more people for a propaganda rally to be attended by the supporters of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa for the launching of the new party,” Ms. Wanniarachchi said.

She said the Municipal Commissioner in his response to their letter said the Seevali Grounds could not be used for the putting up of a stage and the putting up of huts.

Ms. Wanniarachchi said the Commissioner had first allowed the use of the Seevali Grounds and lorry park for the sporting event but refused their use no sooner the propaganda campaign was mentioned.

“The Seevali Grounds was used to mark World Environment Day under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. But we have been deprived its use because we are opponents of the Government,” she said and added that it was her father who had taught the basics of politics to Minister Seneviratne.

“Considering the minister’s behavior, I am confident that this is not what my father taught him,” she added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
