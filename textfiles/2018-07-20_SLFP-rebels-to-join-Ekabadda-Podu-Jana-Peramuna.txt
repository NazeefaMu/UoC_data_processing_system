The 16-member SLFP group said today they had decided to join the ‘Ekabadda Podu Jana Peramuna,’ a grand alliance which is to be formed under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

This was revealed by MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena during a media briefing held yesterday at the parliamentary complex.

“The 16-member group is happy about the decision to quit the government because it is all out to sell national assets. We will join the protest and rally that is being organised by the joint opposition on August 17,” he said

On a different note, MP Abeywardena refuted allegations that there were divisions among the 16-member group.

Meanwhile, MP Dilan Perera said the 16-member group would convince the remaining 23 SLFP members, who were holding ministerial portfolios, to leave the government and join the opposition.

MPs Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, W.D.J. Seneviratne, Chandima Weerakkody and Lohan Ratwatte participated in the news briefing. MP Dayasiri Jayasekera was a notable absentee. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
