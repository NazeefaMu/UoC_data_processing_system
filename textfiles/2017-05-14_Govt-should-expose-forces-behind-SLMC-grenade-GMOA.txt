The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today condemned the attack on Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and said the Government should immediately investigate the matter before another insurgency broke out in the country.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, GMOA Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda said the recent attack showed the shameful attempt to silence the SLMC by preventing doing its duty to ensure the quality and the standard of the country’s medical education.

He said the SLMC and its officials were attacked on many occasions however, the lawsuits failed to do justice by arresting responsible individuals.

“This is not the first time the SLMC was attacked. The SLMC office was set fire in 2002 and many SLMC officials and their residencies were attacked on several occasions. The law was not enforced and justice was not served. Therefore the Government should at least find those responsible for the recent attack,” he said.

Meanwhile, Senior DIG Nandana Munasinghe, who is in charge in the investigation said no breakthrough had been made in the investigation.
However, he said the Colombo Crimes Division and the Forensic Units were collecting evidence to find the motive behind the attack and to trace the suspects. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
