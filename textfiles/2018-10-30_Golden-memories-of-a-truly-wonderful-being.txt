Norma De Silva - Birthday remembrance

 

“You can shed tears because she is gone 


Or you can smile because she lived” 


As I once again sit down in a far away land to write a few words in fond remembrance on Aunty Norma’s birthday, thoughts flow fondly of my dear mother-in-law Norma de Silva.   


She was a loving wife to Uncle Joe the wind beneath his wings as he always says and such a great mother to her children and to their spouses.She was a mother who taught her children love and kindness, gave them strength and gave her best to all.   


Aunty Norma was always kind and caring and had time even for a quick chat with the market vendor, the butcher and the green leaves seller who would come to her door.   


She had a strong faith that gave her the strength even in difficult times.   


Family was very important to Aunty Norma and I remember how every Sunday she used to have a sumptuous meal for all. One wonders how she managed to do it all those years with her busy social life. But I know that Aunty Norma and Uncle Joe cherished those family gatherings each week and those memories will remain treasured with all of us.   


Even at her grandchildren’s birthday parties she would be right in the middle of it trying to organize the games.  


Aunty Norma’s influence could be seen in the manner in which her children live their lives. You have shown them that above all riches, family is the most important and I am privileged to be part of this family.   


They say memories are golden well maybe that’s true. So another birthday, another year gone so soon and time goes so fast. Memories of you will always stay treasured. 

 
To wish you a happy birthday and send you all our love.
