Jubilation over seven-day crown!


	

A provincial purohita who was appointed to act for the Chief for mere seven days reportedly celebrated the event with a noisy street parade.




The seven-day chief and his jubilant sidekicks had paraded the streets hooraying and singing to much amusement and derisive humour of the onlookers and had later gone around the estate sector, where some crowds had greeted the politico with a rousing ovation.


This politico had been sworn in as the acting chief for seven days in an unusual situation where two of the four purohitas of this council had gone abroad and he had looked on this acting appointment as a godsend and a cause for a grand celebration, they say.
