The province-wise trade union action launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) continued for the fourth day today in the North Central Province and Eastern Province saying SAITM was putting the patients’ lives at risk.

GMOA Secretary Navin De Zoysa said the protest was conducted from 8.00 am till 12.00 noon. He said emergency treatment was carried out uninterrupted.

The work stoppage was earlier held in the Southern and Uva Provinces.
