AMI: the Montessori revolution in lanka
	

What is a Montessori House of Children It is not a pre-school, because the teacher does not teach children under six, but instead the directress directs the children on how to use the scientifically prepared apparatus. The trained adult and equipment form the environment, prepared to meet the God-given needs of the child, to develop and form a man or woman. The trained adult only helps the child to reach his or her destiny.
Unlike some adults, the children love this environment, where they are free to work. In some other countries, the Montessori Method of Education, which is now available in Sri Lanka only for children between the ages of 2  and 6, is carried right through, to the University. I hope someday, (I am 70 now!!) to learn and implement the Maria Montessori method, for children from 0 to 3 and 6 to 12 as well. Education begins at birth. In fact, what a mother is thinking, speaking and listening to, can affect the baby in the womb. I remember my first baby, moving vigorously in my womb, as I listened to some classical music records. She sings and teachers singing now. 
I strongly believe, that the Montessori Method of Education is the best education, for the human being to be an integrated whole in body, soul and mind. It is futile to impart only knowledge, as we all know of the destruction that knowledgeable people have wrought. Education is not just the imparting of knowledge, to the mind. Montessori Education draws out of the children their inherent powers and helps them make the most of it. It is a help to life. I believe that the children in the villages should also benefit from good Montessori Houses of Children. I am very busy spending my money, time and effort to make that a reality. Why Because I have greatly benefited personally, from the AMI Method of Education and desire to let other less fortunate children benefit from it too. I want to raise up a new generation of leaders, that have a strong will to do right and live right, in a world of crumbling values.A childs will should not be broken, (as some think it should)but be allowed to develop, in order to help him obey his parents. Its the good Montessori Education I had, which helped to develop my will. 
Ive been in the field of Education, most of my life. I was the first lady to lecture in Maths in the Colombo Campus. While I was lecturing there, I did the two-year AMI diploma at St. Bridgets. Being an educationist from school days, (I started giving Maths tuition from the age of 15), I knew that I owed my ability to learn, understand and teach Maths, with little effort on my side, to both my Montessori foundation and my Saviour and Lord. I am not brilliant. Ordinary people like me can succeed, given the same opportunity. It cant be a coincidence that three of us in my Physical Science University batch, were also from the same Montessori class.My AMI Montessori Principal Lena Wickramaratne, went to India and studied directly under Dr. Montessori herself. Miss Joyce Goonesekera also went to India for the same purpose. 

Ordinary people like me can succeed, given the same opportunity. It cant be a coincidence that three of us in my Physical Science University batch, were also from the same Montessori class.

In 1944 when Dr. Montessori together with her Son Mario Montessori visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Colombo Teachers Association conducted the First Montessori Training Course at Good Shepherd Convent, Kotahena, Colombo 13 with more than 350 participants. Ms. Joyce Goonesekera assisted in giving the demonstrations of activities. Before returning to India Dr. Montessori handed over the legacy of Continuing the Montessori Training, to the Provincial Superior of the Good Shepherd Sisters. Joyce Goonesekera lovingly known as Aunty Joyce continued to work with great fidelity and commitment with the Sisters at the Good Shepherd Montessori Training Centre until her demise in November 2003. Since then the Training Centre, now situated at St. Bridgets Convent, Colombo 7 has had the privilege of Celebrating 25 Years, 50 Years, 60 Years, 70 years and now is getting ready to Celebrate 75 Years of Service to parents, little children and to those willing to dedicate their lives in the Service of Children. 
I entered Methodist College, at the age of six, into the right class for my age, the Upper Kindergarten. I already knew my 12 times multiplication tables and could read any book in English or Sinhala. In the first few days itself, much against my mothers wishes, I was given a double promotion to Standard 2. I watched, my classmates standing up and reciting the multiplication tables. I never learned my tables in such a boring way, in the Montessori. My children and I, were able to enjoy our childhood and growing up years in playing, and taking part in extracurricular activities, without spending all our time and money on tuition. 
I later taught at the Sri Jayawardanapura University, (formerly Vidyodaya) for 32 years. In 1973, I taught Maths to the entire Arts faculty of 700 students, in one lecture. It was a formidable task, but I was able to do it, thanks to the Montessori Principles, which I had learned. Actually it was easier to lay down the basics in Maths and then build, with these students who had never done any Maths in school. In later years, I found it more difficult; to undo the wrong ways of learning Maths, without understanding any of the concepts, but by meaningless rules. Thousands of University students have passed through my hands, but have no jobs, as they are unable to learn English. Language should be taught, at the age when the child absorbs all the languages spoken in his environment, which is till the age of six. Hence, it is my desire to bless the villages and the under privileged with English-speaking Montessoris. 
My granddaughter loved it, when I played the zero game with her. Having understood the concept of the zero from it, (though she is supposed to be a slow learner), to my amazement, she correctly answered all the sums on the zero her parents quizzed her. It was her parents answers, which were wrong. My granddaughters of 14 and 10, exclaimed delightedly, when they spied my grading of colours, box 3, and wanted to play with it. I heard the older one say, I hate school. I enjoyed my days in the Montessori. 
Dr. Maria Montessori was the first lady doctor in Italy and in many parts of the world. She was a psychiatrist and hence knew Psychology. So her method of education is based on Psychology. Montessori Psychology is different from general Psychology. Adults tend to draw up a syllabus, and teach it to the child. The child taught Dr. Montessori. Her education was based on observation of the child. It was Dr. Montessoris compassion and desire to meet the needs of the mentally defective children in the Asylum where she was the psychiatrist. She believed that education and not medicine would help these children. This led her to use apparatus made by educationists such as Seguin. When a test was set for both defective and normal children, the defective children only took a longer time to learn and some did even better in the test than normal children. This made her wonder why the normal child did not do better, so when she had the opportunity, she tried this equipment on normal children. She later, modified the equipment for them and developed it, by observing the children. The little child led her to her method. She discovered the child, as her books on Discovery of the Child, and the Secret of Childhood unfolds. 
These early formative years are the most vital years of a human being when the formation of a person takes place. These are the years from 2  to 6, when the right education in the right environment prepared specially for it, is so necessary. We must never undervalue these precious years. The home too must be a prepared environment so that the child from 0 to 2  years, which is the unconsciously absorbent period, should not absorb bad things, but all the good things which are of value. The child at this age is unable to filter out the bad from the good and absorbs unconsciously, everything around him.The environment should provide good, such as the unity of the parents, as disunity brings unresolved trauma and confusion to the little minds. If that has not happened, then the correct Montessori environment from 2  to 6 can help to some extent correct it. One of the earliest Houses of Children was for hungry, orphan children, who were running about, traumatized by the greatest earthquake of that age, in Messina. They were silent, absent minded, and would not eat or drink. In the night people heard them screaming. Within six months people saw the change. They called it the conversion of the orphans of Messina They were healed not only physically but psychologically. Shouldnt this happen in Sri Lanka

When a test was set for both defective and normal children, the defective children only took a longer time to learn and some did even better in the test than normal children
The Freedom of choice to work with any material the child knows to work with, is one of the basic principles of the prepared environment. So each child enjoys working with what he has chosen, which is what he needs to develop, at his own pace. The only punishment needed, is to stop the child from working with the materials. What Dr. Montessori discovered,was that the child learned through the repetition of his chosen activities, and thereby learned to concentrate. Adults often fail to understand the need of the child for this prepared environment and the childs desire to learn and develop according to the Laws of nature. We only shout dont touch , , dont meddle you cant,  dont carry that, you will break it, etc. The little ones must be shown how to, by breaking up the movement into separate steps, so that the child can learn to be independent and able to help himself dress himself, wash hands, wash and polish things, cut up vegetables, etc. All children love to learn these things.Every activity in the prepared environment has a direct aim and also an indirect
aim which is just as important to the child. 
Movement of the hand and limb also increases the intelligence. Babies must be free to crawl, for then that part of the brain is prepared for reading later on. The children in the Montessori constantly uses their hands in coordinated movements, as they work on the materials.
My hope is to make this valuable education available to everyone, especially the underprivileged.
I want to do my part, in making Sri Lanka a far better place foreveryone to live in unity and love.

China accuses US of twisting the truth regarding N. Korea
	

China attacked Donald Trump claiming the US is first in the world when it comes to twisting the truth after the president accused Beijing of failing to rein in North Korea.
Trump doubled down on his suggestion that China was not helping to rein in its Cold War-era ally - a charge he first levelled when he cancelled a trip to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that was due to take place this week.
A lot of people, like me, feel that the US is first in the world when it comes to twisting the truth, and irresponsible and absurd logic, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing.
This logic is not easily understood by all, Hua said.
Trumps refusal to direct criticism at North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and instead blame other parties for a lack of progress comes despite reports the US received a belligerent letter from Pyongyang, which prompted Pompeo to cancel a planned trip to North Korea last weekend.
We hope the US can play a positive and constructive role in settling the issue just like the Chinese. To solve the problem, it should look at itself instead of shifting blame, Hua added.
Part of the North Korea problem is caused by the trade disputes with China, Trump said.
Trump said he was not considering resuming joint military exercises on the Korean Peninsula that Pyongyang considers provocative.

Dont play with fire in Syria: Lavrov
	

Russia, (rt.com), 30 August 2018 -Russias Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the US against using a possible chemical weapons provocation to justify a new strike against Syrian forces. He said Moscow warned the West not to play with fire in Syria. 
Lavrov reiterated the warning that a staged chemical weapons attack in Syrias Idlib province may trigger a US-led attack on the forces loyal to Damascus. 
A new provocation is being prepared by the West to hamper the anti-terrorist operation in Idlib, Lavrov said during a joint media conference with his Syrian counterpart, Walid Muallem. We have facts on the table and have issued a strong warning to our Western partners through our Defense Ministry and our Foreign Ministry not to play with fire. 
Earlier, the Russian military reported that a group of militants in Syria was preparing a provocation, in which chlorine gas would be used to frame the Syrian government forces. The incident would be used by the US and its allies to justify a new attack against the country, similar to what happened in April, according to the claim.

EFL expands global footprint with new office in Malaysia
	
EFL (Expolanka Freight) a global freight-forwarding company headquartered in Sri Lanka is setting up its 18th overseas operations in the regional hub of Malaysia. The company is taking over an existing operation managed by its parent company SG Holdings Global and will officially open for business in Kuala Lampur on 1 September 2018.        
Malaysia is a natural addition to EFLs global portfolio, largely to drive the intra-Asia growth, and to complement our USA expansion. Being a prominent economy in the region, we believe, it will be an important part of EFLs footprint, to cement our place as a sought-after freight forwarder in the South East Asia region, Chief Executive Officer S. Senthilnathan said.
With Asia contributing significantly to the logistics industrys growth, analysts point out that growth in trade and domestic demand will in turn drive the growth of the transportation and logistics industry.
Issuing a statement on the announcement, SG Holdings Global shared its strategy for further expansion. This will be in line with our Groups goal, as we build on EFLs extensive global network and expertise to further expand our reach, it said.

Even more cuts: Busting Locke
	

During these centuries, moreover, the State, which had passed power from the landed aristocracy to the industrialists, sided with the latter
	From liberties to liberty: the world according to Hobbes, Grotius, and Bodin was now secularised, subject to no will higher than that of the sovereign

It is tempting to view the 17th and 18th centuries as eras of progress, reform, and enlightenment. Intellectuals and academics the world over tout this period of history as a sort of apotheosis for Western Europe, in which the West took over from the East in the domain of the material and the philosophical. That this shift coincided with the rise of colonialism and industrialisation is no cause for wonderment, given that such a paradigm transformation in philosophy needed a firm economic base, exploitative and oppressive, but at the same time advertised as liberal and inevitable to the exploited and oppressed. Take any thinker from these centuries and read into what they thought about rights, duties, and obligations. You will come across the same worldview: the world is composed of individuals, but this does not forbid the State from intervening in their (political) rights in the interests of economic freedom. 
The economic, then, determined the general philosophical consensus regarding the individual during this time. This is true of roughly every society and is valid for every historical juncture, be it in the West or the East. From Thomas Hobbes, Hugo Grotius, and Jean Bodin, history gave way to John Locke, who provided the perfect backdrop for the rising nouveau riche in England through a variant of the Social Contract which balanced the subject with the sovereign: He was not an enemy of political authority. During these centuries, moreover, the State, which had passed power from the landed aristocracy to the industrialists, sided definitively with the latter. The bourgeoisie had been the first revolutionary to rebel against the feudal manorial order; once history passed over to the market, he became the reactionary.
Liberty: Last week I pointed out that the word had a connotation different to the one we take for granted today. To sum up, and to add to what I wrote: When the world entered the epoch that paved the way for capitalism (in Fernand Braudels analysis, between the 15th and the 18th centuries), powerful towns gave way to even more powerful nation states. These nation states (precursors to the modern State, with a capital S) bloomed in regions where towns were not powerful: Spain, France, and Britain. The world had known of liberties until then, wielded by powerful groups against the less powerful (although when the economic tide turned, the less powerful, namely the peasantry, got the upper hand). It was a relatively peaceful era, demarcated however by ignorance, fanaticism, complacency, and slowness (between the 9th and the 16th centuries, writes Professor Ha-Joon Chang, income per capita in Western Europe grew at 0.12% per year). The transition from towns to nation states came about through war and its imperious needs, artilleries and armies. By the end of the 17th century, Europe was waging war on itself, usurping the monarch and turning him into a constitutional figurehead. The sovereignty of the State was soon above all laws, all kings, now.
Europe, hitherto regional, and limited to centres of urban power, became Europe: national, territorial. 
From liberties to liberty: the world according to Hobbes, Grotius, and Bodin was now secularised, subject to no will higher than that of the sovereign. The sovereign was, however, subject to Natural and Divine Law. Even that changed: Etiamsi daremus non esse Deum, wrote Grotius, speaking for the new world order: even if God did not exist, the natural law prevailed. Divine law, though not disparaged or relegated or thrown away, was subsumed by the new secularism, and so soon enough, when the constitutional monarchy made it possible for the bourgeoisie to wield their clout in the parliament and outside it, theism (which held that God had the last word on material affairs) gave way to the at times confusing, convoluted deism (which held that God created man, but did not intervene in those material affairs). The man who stood between the secular absolutists of the 17th century and the deist liberals of the 18th century, which saw liberties give way to an amorphous and rather highly contentious-as-to-what-it-really-meant liberty, was Locke. It seems superfluous to devote an entire essay on the man, but it is at the same time essential that we do so. 
Much has been written on Locke. Some contend that he was an apologist for ruthless commercial capitalism. Some point out that his tirades against exploitation were at odds with his ownership of stock in slave trading companies (remember, this was an era when one mans right over a multitude was taken for granted). Some, not a few, contend that by distinguishing between sovereigns and tyrants, he gave the perfect excuse for Western powers, today, to differentiate between pro-Western dictators (who are favoured) and anti-Western democrats(who are deposed). 
Whichever way you look at it, however, you cannot discount his influence on a period of history which defined the length and breadth of modernity. Western Europe owes it to Locke for its conception of liberalism, more specifically classical liberalism (which is what this series is about), and so does the worlds most vibrant democracy (note the asterisks), the United States of America. The truth is that without Locke, and his Two Treatises, there would not have been a Declaration of Independence. 
He had it both ways: the subject could revolt against the sovereign, but the sovereign could be deposed only if he had lost the right to rule: A tyrant has no authority. The bedrock of the State was political authority, and authority flowed from property. 
Unlike Hobbes, civil society for Locke was not preceded by a state of nature nasty, brutish, and short. On the contrary, what had preceded it was an Eden in which liberty flourished. As the population grew, however, so did mans wants, and the Eden which had subsisted until then was threatened by property: there were just too many individuals, and too little land. It was to resolve this issue that he willingly gave up his liberty, and let his Eden fall: in return for his liberty, which was not really taken away from him, only reduced, he would be ensured ownership over his land. The secular absolutists of the preceding century had viewed the sovereign as a totalitarian tamer; Locke viewed him as a firm mediator. In doing so, he sanctified the instrument through which the sovereign became that mediator, private property.

FACETS 2018 :  Promises  to take you to a gem of a world
	
Dating back to over 2000 years ago,Sri Lankas link to gem and jewellery has been an old one. The industry has helped the countrys economy significantly, promoted tourism and secure a place for ourgem-laden island on the world map.

From the arduous stages of gem mining, to cutting, polishing, jewellery manufacturing and finally retail, the process can be intriguing to a layman.
For jewellery enthusiasts, this entire spectrum has a one stop destination which is the E.W Balasuriya store, located at the hill country of Kandy.  The store has a lot to offer gem and jewellery enthusiasts during the Gem and Jewellery Exhibition (FACETS) which will be held at the BMICH from 30 August  2 September. The stalls will be open from10 a.m. to 6 p.m each day. The store maintained by E.W Balasuriya offers visitors an unparalleled experience as it takes them on a journey from mine to market. If queries are posed one would learn everything from mining gems to the process of making the intricate pieces of art, you buy.
The whole process begins at the gem mine. Complete with life-like models and ambient sound effects, the mine will help you understand the effort and extent of labour that is required, in the quest to find the most precious gem stones. Your next stop is at the lapidary where precious gemstones are cut and polished to perfection. The gems are then moved to the laboratory where they are inspected, quality checked and sent to their designers to be transformed into works of art. At the workshop these exquisite gems are set in precious metals by highly skilled craftsmen. Created in-house, with designs inspired by our illustrious history, one will observe that the designs used in them come from around the world. With regard to what they many, no two pieces are alike. The Sri Lankan gem and jewellery industry is one of the most important foreign exchange earners. With the FACETS exhibition, currently on at the BMICH, they wish to reach out to new markets and expand their business in fast developing economies such as China, Russia and Europe.

Fast absorbing Body Yogurts by The Body Shop - 15 seconds to glowing skin
	
Showered Tick. In a rush Double tick. Planning to moisturise No way! Not when youve got jeans to fit into and ten minutes to get out the door!
If this sounds familiar, then you can count yourself among the 35% of women in the UK who dont use a body moisturiser because it takes too long to apply.* Lifes too short for waiting. Which is why the new fast-absorbing Body Yogurts take just 15 seconds to absorb into your skin. Finding time in our busy schedules to take care of our skin is hard, right Well, now just 15 seconds a day is all it takes for a healthy-looking glow.
Next level body moisturising
25 years ago, The Body Shop revolutionised body moisturising from a squirt to a scoop, introducing the first ever Body Butter. And now, here comes another game-changing formula  one you can smooth on - and its set to completely transform the way you moisturize.
Six sensorial scents
What makes Body Yogurts so special The refreshing gel-cream formula sinks into damp skin in seconds, providing 48 hours of lightweight moisture. Which means you can go from shower to jeans (or pyjamas) in 15 seconds. Its perfect for a morning or night routine, and is ideal for balmy tropical weather when you dont want a sticky finish. Added bonus: it gives your skin a healthy looking, year-round glow.
The entire range is 100% vegan and available in Strawberry, Mango, Almond Milk, Coconut, Moringa, British Rose and special edition Banana - you wont be able to resist spooning it on.
When Im in a hurry, I sometimes struggle with thick moisturiser as it can feel wet and uncomfortable on my clothes. My favourite thing about The Body Shop Body Yogurts is how the gel-cream texture instantly absorbs into my skin, giving it a silky ultra sheer veil of hydration without feeling thick and greasy. My recommendation is to use the Body Yogurts on damp skin right after you shower because the hyaluronic acid and glycerin will help attract and seal in moisture to your skin. Body Yogurts deliver moisturisation for 48 hours, but can be used as many times a day as you want, for hydration without a heavy feel. The Body Shop Body Yogurts are ideal for everyone, especially if you are a reluctant moisturiser, explained Dr. Christine Choi Kim, Dermatologist for The Body Shop.
Enriched with community trade organic almond milk from Spain
The Body Yogurts are all made with Community Trade organic almond milk sourced from Man in Alicante, Spain. The Body Shop have worked with Man since 2016. They provide stability for the cooperative of local, small-scale farmers who extract our almond milk, using low-intensity farming methods. They use broken nuts that arent sold for food and turn unwanted almond husks into compost to help minimise waste.
The Moringa, British Rose and Banana Body Yogurts are also enriched with their own Community Trade ingredients  which are exciting new additions to The Body Shops unique Community Trade programme. The Body Shop Community Trade moringa extract comes from Rwanda, Community Trade English rose essence from Herefordshire, and Community Trade organic banana puree is from Ecuador.

Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who kept away from mainstream politics so far, said today that would not remain silent when the country was heading towards disaster and would join Wednesday's Jana Balaya protest organised by the joint opposition (JO).
He said Sri Lanka has never before fallen into the political, social and economic depths such as that seen in recent times and added that the unfolding calamity calls for a meaningful response.
The political environment borders on anarchy with our nation hurtling towards disaster. Professionals and intellectuals can no longer look away. We have heard it said that evil will triumph when the good remain silent. We must no longer remain silent and I urge all professionals and intellectuals to support the patriotic forces who have organised the rally Janabalaya Kolambata on September 5, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said the government was engaged in violating the fundamental democratic rights in ways that threaten the very foundations of a functioning republic.
Even the basic right of expressing a political preference has been flagrantly violated through the arbitrary and illegal postponement of elections, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He saidthat the government has pursuing a policy of ceding control over key economic sectors to foreign interests despite strong opposition from stakeholders, professionals and the people.
It signed agreements in the most unprofessional and unethical manner. Many of these agreements do not include clauses for re-negotiation or annulment. Moreover, these have been drafted and signed without ever being subjected to the review or consideration of Parliament, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said there were dangerous and concerted efforts to compromise peace and reconciliation in the pursuit of personal political interests.
This is evident in the ongoing constitutional reform initiatives as well as the witch-hunts on military personnel who have made untold sacrifices to rid the country of terrorism, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Huawei nova 3 Series leads smartphone colour trend in Sri Lanka with Iris purple
	
Huawei nova 3 series is the newly discovered bright star in the smartphone industry. Having entered the market in early August 2018, the Nova 3 series received record-breaking demand from the Sri Lankan youth due to its revolutionary AI features and trendy design. The product appeals to all youth ranging from the tech community, the fashion circle and also those in show biz.
HUAWEI nova devices have always been gorgeous. Previously, devices in this series earned a warm welcome among the youth with their attractive design. Not willing to be outdone by those that came before it, HUAWEI nova 3 Series comes with a range of trendy hues. The Nova3 is available in Iris Purple, Red & Black while the Nova3i is available in Iris Purple, Pearl White &Black leaving consumers spoilt for choice.
As the first gradient colour offered on HUAWEI nova devices, Iris Purple deserves a proper introduction. Gradient colours are some of the hottest device colour schemes on the market. Huawei has always had great insights into colours and how they affect design. The HUAWEI P20 Pro graced the Sri Lankan market with the breathtaking Twilight colour, bringing the popularity of the gradient colour to new heights. As a device designed for the young, the HUAWEI nova 3 Series sticks closely to the trends, and launched the highly evocative Iris PurpleHuaweis take on the popular violet purple hue.
News of HUAWEI nova 3 carrying the gradient colour actually leaked prior to its official launch, so consumers had expected it to come, but that did little to dampen its impact and influence that it made at its unveiling. Huawei improved upon its 2.5D curve designto create the new and improved 3D curved glass finish, where the gradient colour shines through with fascinating vibrancy. Humans are naturally allured by colours  and with the gradient color, there are just more colours to love.
Looking back at the history of smartphones, manufacturers have always been keen to bolster their product portfolio with differently coloured devices. And that has worked in the favor of consumers, giving them additional choice. The HUAWEI nova 3 Series, a line-up renowned for its design, is at the forefront of this colour trend. The Iris Purple gradient colour available on both the nova 3 and nova 3i evoke feelings of mystery, excitement and adventure. Such a unique experience is only available through the trendy HUAWEI nova 3 series.
Compared to other devices in the same price range, this series has seen a lot more attention to detail in its design and colour, and the same fact drives the Huawei nova 3 series to lead in the colour and design trends. In the present day the mobile device is considered a fashion expression and addressing this demand is a huge challenge among the handset makers. However the Huawei nova 3 series has accepted the challenge and addressed the demand through the vivid, shifting colours of the Iris Purple.
The Huawei nova3 and nova3i comes with a one year warranty and will be available for consumers at all Huawei Experience Centers with Sri Lankas leading Smartphone marketer, Singer Sri Lanka PLC ensuring the availability of the nova3 series devices island wide. Selected Dialog and Mobitel outlets would also market the new devices with the Huawei nova3 priced at 79,900 and Huawei nova3i priced at 49,900.

## Title: Is your thyroid gland playing up
## Section: Medicine

Is your thyroid gland playing up
	

Are you gaining weight and feeling unable to concentrate Then it could be a problem with that little gland in your neck. Located above the Adams apple, the thyroid gland produces thyroid hormone which regulates, among other things, your bodys temperature, metabolism, and heartbeat. The thyroid gland influences almost all of the metabolic processes in your body. Thyroid disorders could range from small, harmless enlarged goiters to life-threatening cancers. The most common thyroid problems involve the abnormal production of thyroid hormones.
Speaking to Health Capsule, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Medicine at the Faculty of Medicine -University of Colombo and Consultant Endocrinologist at the University Medical Unit - National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Dr. Prasad Katulanda explained about hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and other complications related to the thyroid gland.

Types of thyroid imbalance
According to Dr. Katulanda there could be several types of thyroid imbalance.
Hypothyroidism: This stems from a hormone deficiency. The bodys energy production requires certain amounts of thyroid hormones upsetting the bodys chemical balance, thereby lowering the energy levels in the body. Hypothyroidism is common particularly in children where there can be an absence of the gland or it may not be properly developed.
Congenital hypothyroidism: This is a condition where although the gland exist, the mechanism to produce the hormone may be abnormal due to genetic causes. This in turn would lead to mental retardation.
			Symptoms of hypothyroidism
			Sleepiness
				Poor memory
				Feeling cold
				Excessive bleeding during periods
				Constipation
				Hair loss
				Easily feel tired
				Dry, rough pale skin
			Symptoms of hyperthyroidism
			Feeling hot
				Sweating even when around an A/C
				Loss of weight
				Frequent need to pass stool
				Palpitations
				Fatigue
				Puffy face
				Hoarseness
				Muscle weakness
			
		
Hypothyroidism is common in older children and adults, continued Dr. Katulanda. The commonest cause for Hypothyroidism was Iodine deficiency. But now in Sri Lanka and other countries Iodine is added to salt and therefore it is not a common cause anymore. However autoimmune hypothyroidism could occur where the body would produce antibodies which would act against the thyroxin hormone. This is known as thyroiditis and as a result the gland becomes inactive. In this case radioactive iodine needs to be given to patients with hypothyroidism.
Hyperthyroidism: This is caused due to an overproduction of hormones. Speaking further he said that a common cause is Graves Disease. This is also an autoimmune condition where the antibodies in the body would act as another hormone produced by the pituitary gland. This is known as the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Here the antibodies have structural similarities to that of TSH therefore there is an overstimulation of the thyroid gland. One common feature of Graves Disease is bulging eyes also known as exophthalmos.
He further said that small nodules of the thyroid gland could get overactive also known as toxic adenoma of the thyroid gland. This could also lead to hypothyroidism. On the other hand, the toxic multinodular goiter is the most cause of hyperthyroidism after Graves Disease. This is a thyroid gland which has autonomously functioning thyroid nodules where the hormones are stored for a period of time before they are being released, Dr. Katulanda added.
He further said that hyperthyroidism could affect small children and lead to brain deficiency, forgetfulness and difficulty in thinking. It is common in children and females.

Treatments
In the case of under-production of hormones from the gland, thyroxin should be administered daily. According to Dr. Prasad thyroxin should be taken early in the morning, half an hour before the morning tea. Treatments for over-production of hormones depend on the cause. In this case anti-thyroid medication could be given to the patients. In the case of Graves Disease definitive treatment is required because some pe ople will take medicine and then stop after a while. Radioactive Iodine treatment is recommended and it is given as a capsule or liquid which is safe.
But this is harmful if a patient is pregnant. Therefore, if patients are unable to go for radioactive Iodine treatment they can go in for a surgery. If you have an enlarged goiter, a surgery could be performed.

Lowering the risk of thyroid abnormalities
Certain types of thyroid diseases are genetic and are unavoidable. However there are certain things you could do in order to prevent yourself from getting a thyroid condition or lowering the risk. These include :
Ensuring you have healthy iodine levels : Iodine from your diet is the key ingredient of the thyroid hormone your body manufactures. But if you are deficient in iodine, your body is unable to manufacture adequate amounts of thyroid, leading to hypothyroidism.
Stop smoking : Cigarettes contain the chemical thiocyanate which can damage your thyroid gland. Smoking not only increases the risk of a thyroid condition but it also makes it difficult to treat thyroid-related conditions.
Avoiding toxic exposures : A number of chemicals are found to be toxic to your thyroid gland. These are found in food, water and household products such as in anti-bacterial soaps, plastic products, carpets and fabrics and non-stick pans.
Using a thyroid collar duringdental x-rays :
Frequent dental x-rays could expose your thyroid gland to unnecessary levels of radiation which could increase the risk of developing thyroid abnormalities.
Limiting the intake of soy foods: It is found that the overconsumption of soy foods could slow your thyroids production of hormones and impair your bodys ability to metabolise the thyroid hormone.
Avoiding raw goitrogenic vegetables: Eating raw forms of goitrogenic vegetables such as kale, broccoli, spinach and cabbage could slow down your thyroid gland and make you hypothyroid. Therefore make sure you steam or cook them prior to consumption.
Addressing Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of Graves disease and many other health challenges. Therefore Vitamin D therapy can significantly reduce thyroid antibodies and prevent overt hypothyroidism.
Testing for celiac disease: A common trigger for autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Graves disease is celiac disease which is the inability to process the protein gluten found in wheat and other grains. Undiagnosed celiac disease is a known trigger for elevated thyroid antibodies and thyroid disease.
Including Selenium : Research has shown that the mineral Selenium is very important for thyroid function. Therefore supplementing with Selenium can reduce thyroid antibodies. Moderate amounts of Selenium intake is recommended as higher levels could be toxic.

(Kenya, (Daily Mail), 30 August 2018 - The Kenyan president appeared to forget Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsons name during a press conference with Theresa May and refered to him as the bicycle guy.
Uhuru Kenyatta, who came to power in 2013, was seeking to remind dignitaries and assembled media of the former Foreign Secretarys visit to the country.
However he had a spot of bother remembering Mr Johnsons name and ended up calling him the bicycle guy. 
Asked whether UK had been neglecting Kenya, Mr Kenyatta pointed to a visit by Boris Johnson.
Last year, if you recall, the Foreign Secretary then Boris, um, Boris - Boris... Johnson. The bicycle guy.
Mrs May managed to suppress a smile as her Tory rival was slighted during the press conference. 
Best for Britain supporter Layla Moran said: From the Prime Ministers African jaunt we have learned two things - the Maybot is about as catchy as Peter Crouchs robot and one day you are Brexiteer Foreign Secretary and the next you are just the bicycle lad. 
Speculation has been mounting Mr Johnson will launch a bid to oust the PM in the coming months.
His effort could be hampered by a reminder of his difficult time as Foreign Secretary, which was dominated by gaffes.

## Title: Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act Reforms

Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act Reforms
	
Need to be implemented with or without ACJU which does not represent the community

About fifty years ago when I started my journalistic career with the now defunct Sun Newspaper, the then Justice Minister K.W. Devanayagam asked me; why are the Quazi Courts so corrupt Why dont the community reform it to prevent divorces and misery to families 
I didnt know what to say, but passed his concern to Abdur Razak Jamali, Mashood Alim and Noori Hazarath - all prominent members of All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulema - ACJU. 
Fifty years later today; where are we The situation is worse manifold 
Realizing the need to review the Muslim personal law and reform the system of Quazi Courts, former Minister of Justice and Law Reform Milinda Moragoda appointed a committee chaired by Justice Saleem Marsoof in July 2009 to propose amendments to upgrade Quazi Courts. After dilly dallying for nine long years, due to ACJU manipulations as accused by many, Saleem Marsoof committee has submitted its report on July 18, 2018 to the government. 
Now that the report was released isnt it time for all including ACJU - to help implement its recommendations. Some suspect that this long delay on the part of the president and prime minister is due to ACJU opposition as they wrongly believe that the ACJU controls the Muslim vote banks. 
The community has not given any mandate to ACJU which has arrogated itself the power to dictate terms to legal experts and intellectuals on a matter in which it has no monopoly of expertise
According to reports the ACJU has strongly opposed any amendments to the Act stating that it is of divine origin and perfect in the present state. 
Thus created dissent and division within the Committee. Under the circumstance, the community cannot expect ACJU, which has emerged as one man show of its controversial president, to help implement these recommendations. 

The ACJU assuming leadership of the community has failed in its role as it has become subservient to political patronage and the benefits that go with it as opposed to the need to work to the welfare of community interests
However implementing these recommendations is essential in the interest of the community. So far, due to ignorance, the Muslim community has failed to give the rights and privileges given by Islam to women. Time has come for Muslim women too to play their role and make their contributions to families, community and the country, within the framework of Islam. 
As it is now MMDA is not strictly monitored by the State and therefore it is misused/misapplied by ulemas to make girls victims as they are given in marriage easily to fun-seeking foreign      (mostly from the Gulf) men, much older and, in some cases married to many others back in their countries. Educated and enlightened Muslim women are already demanding change and have organized into silent agitation groups. They feel that they too have a right to play a significant role in decision making when it comes to their own life. If Muslim womens views are not respected and required changes to MMDA are not made they (Women) too are likely to show their displeasure at the next polls and, as the trend goes they cannot be dictated even by their husbands about how they will vote. 
ACJU is only an association of those who have gone to Schools of Theology and therefore has no authority to speak for the entire community. It has no power to dictate to the women folk who are being enlightened in the electronic era. The ACJU, formed in the mid 1920s when religious people, though not well known scholars, were respected due to their impeccable honesty, sincerity, integrity and piety.
The situation has changed today with moulvis blending business and religion becoming pawns in the hands of many. On the other hand the ACJU was not given the right to represent the community and the enlightened elements in the community oppose many policies of ACJU. 
The ACJU claims that it is an organization of ulemas- religious scholars. The question is most so called ulemas passed out from out dated madrasas remain unqualified to deal with burning current issues which strikes at the very root of the communitys existence. 
I remember somewhere in 1970s respected Islamic scholar Dr. M. A. M. Shukry spoke about Islams contribution to humanity during an iftar function in Colombo. The then Iraqi Ambassador Thowfeek Abdul Jabbar asked me about Dr. Shukry. When I asked him why, the ambassador said, Dr. Shukry spoke so well on Islam in fine classic Arabic, which he, as an Arab, could not speak. 
Now the question is why such eminent Islamic scholars have no place in the ACJU 
In fact he deserves to be ACJU president. The ACJU today, has become a liability on the community in view of its controversies and lost the confidence of most in the community. 
For example deviating from the goals of founding fathers, ACJU politicized the organization pitting the community against the other communities. 
The controversy over halal certificate business was exploited by anti-Muslim forces to unleash violent campaign pitting Sinhalese against Muslims. ACJU Presidents visit to Geneva to defend the Rajapaksa government on the issue of war crimes against Tamils during the final stage of the war turned the Tamils against the Muslim community. 
In 2013 more than 20 people including ulemas from the ACJU branch in Kinniya sighted the moon and tried to pass the message. However they failed to contact ACJU and forced the community to fast while people in and around Kinniya observed Eid Al Fitr. People in the east were so fed up that they decided to start their own ulema association. Controversial statements such as describing face cover as compulsory in Islam without citing the Quran nor Hadees misled non-Muslims and harmed the community. 
Few years ago on the repeated advise and appeal of ulemas many Muslims invested their hard earned millions in Ceylinco Finance Company which went bankrupt turning investors overnight into penniless. Is this the work of Ulemas 

Is this the work of ACJU The list of wrong doings continue. 
People were sick and tired of controversies. During last Eid al Fitr moon sighting controversy ACJU top official was escorted to his vehicle to prevent attack on him. 
However the environment in the ACJU is such that most ulemas were afraid to speak out as they fear serious repercussions. They have families to support and cant afford to lose their jobs. Their mouths are sealed with incentives and blackmail. 
Thus the need of the hour is to thoroughly reorganize the ACJU to bring in non- controversial ulemas who are respected by the people. 
This is essential because powerful destructive anti Muslims forces such as Israelis, Evangelical Christians and Indias RSS and VHP are here plotting against Muslims. Does the ACJU aware of these threats leave alone taking measures to enlighten the people using at least Jumma sermons and ensure the communitys safety 
Ridiculous state of affairs of the politically bankrupt and sinking Muslim community is such that fourteen civil society organizations led by ACJU met President Maithripala Sirisena four days after violent attacks on Muslims in Digana and Akurana. Instead of showing the communitys anger the delegation thanked president Sirisena for working for communal harmony while Muslims whose houses were burnt to ashes and lost all their belongings due to governments failure to protect them were in tears in Akurana and other places with no cloth to change or no food to eat. 
The ACJU assuming leadership of the community has failed in its role as it has become subservient to political patronage and the benefits that go with it as opposed to the need to work to the welfare of community interests. Often their actions only seem to be degrading rather than focusing on the cohesiveness of Islamic brotherhood. 
Under the circumstance the only inevitable option is for independent religious scholars to come forward and help implement changes recommended in the Saleem Marsoof report.
Reiterating this columnist Ameer Faaiz had this to state in his article in the website ColomboTelegraph that Reforms proposed in the Justice Marsoofs Committees Report are within the limits of Islamic law (Shariah). 
The diabolical actions of the ACJU are further highlighted by the fact that in 1951, its members, as the premier council of theologians, protested against the enactment of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act in the vicinity of the Old Parliament near Galle Face on the basis that they were not consulted despite repeated requests for hearing from the then Minister of Home Affairs. Blissfully forgetting that, now the very same pseudo Mullas or their off springs are crying foul, falsely alleging that it is Shariah and thus cannot be amended.

Lies and abuse from the pulpits
The ACJU has unleashed their stalwarts to abuse and lie from the pulpits of mosques deriding anyone who did not agree with them in the Committee. They do this without explaining the recommendations and their justifications proposed by the Committee itself. Instead, the ACJU is abusing the Friday pulpits to incite people against reforms saying these would be in violation of Shariah law. Many of those who hear them proclaim this, have no way of knowing that they are being lied to. 
The President, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers must step in, act fast and give direction to reform this archaic and discriminatory legislation. Otherwise, they will be knowingly propping up a discriminatory structure that violates the spirit of the constitution and commit collective discrimination against the Muslim women of this country.

Nokunu Team gets ready for the next cleaning phase tomorrow
	

With its successful campaign to transform the city into a greener environment, the Nokunu Team has taken great efforts to spread awareness among the citizens. What began as a door-to-door campaign has materialized into a massive clean-up programme drawing the attention of citizens and corporates alike. This September, the Nokunu Team is ready to cleanthe banks of the Wellawatte Canal upto Thalakotuwa Gardens. 

It has been estimated that Sri Lankans produce 23 million metric tons of solid waste a year or generates about 7100MT of solid waste per day with the Western Province accounting for nearly 60% of waste generation. Each person generates an average of 1-0.4kg of waste per day. According to the Waste Management Authority and the Central Environmental Authority, only half of the waste generated is collected. Other than the irresponsible dumping of garbage, people could always reuse and recycle these products, thereby engaging in waste management techniques. As a citizens engagement movement headed by Sumi Moonesinghe, the Nokunu initiative has been able to mobilise people from all strata of society to engage in active disposal of garbage. 

The world is transforming into a pollution-free place and measures are being taken to reduce the use of plastics and other non-biodegradable materials

According to a team member who joined this cause since its inception, it was a challenge to gather like-minded individuals to work for this cause. The world is transforming into a pollution-free place and measures are being taken to reduce the use of plastics and other non-biodegradable materials. Through this initiative many people living in Colombo were introduced to the concept of waste management.
Waste management is defined as the process of collecting, transporting and disposing of garbage, sewage and other waste products. Waste management is the process of treating solid wastes and offers variety of solutions for recycling items that dont belong to trash. It is about how garbage can be used as a valuable resource. 


Waste management could be classified into eight groups as follows : 
Landfills
Throwing daily waste/garbage in the landfills is the most popularly used method of waste disposal used today. This process of waste disposal focuses attention on burying the waste in the land. Landfills are commonly found in developing countries. 
Incineration/Combustion
Incineration or combustion is a type disposal method in which municipal solid wastes are burned at high temperatures so as as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. The biggest advantage of this type of method is that it can reduce the volume of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume, decreases the space they take up and reduce the stress on landfills. 

Recovery and recycling
Resource recovery is the process of taking useful discarded items for a specific next use. These discarded items are then processed to extract or recover materials and resources or convert them to energy in the form of useable heat, electricity or fuel. 

Plasma gasification
Plasma gasification is another form of waste management. Plasma is a primarily an electrically charged or a highly ionized gas. Lighting is one type of plasma which produces temperatures that exceed 12,600 F .

Composting
Composting is an easy and natural bio-degradation process that takes organic wastes i.e. remains of plants and garden and kitchen waste and turns into nutrient rich food for your plants. Composting, normally used for organic farming, occurs by allowing organic materials to sit in one place for months until microbes decompose it. 

Waste to Energy (Recover Energy)
Waste to Energy(WtE) process involves converting of non-recyclable waste items into useable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes. This type of source of energy is a renewable energy source as non-recyclable waste can be used over and over again to create energy. 

Avoidance/Waste Minimization
The easiest method of waste management is to reduce creation of waste materials thereby reducing the amount of waste going to landfills. Waste reduction can be done through recycling old materials like jar, bags, repairing broken items instead of buying new ones, avoiding use of disposable products like plastic bags, reusing second hand items, and buying items that uses less designing. 

The Bottom Line
There are certain waste types that are considered as hazardous and cannot be disposed off without special handling which will prevent contamination from occurring. Biomedical waste is one example.

Ousted Australian PM Turnbull quits politics
	
Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted last week, has formally tendered his resignation from federal parliament, The Australian reported today.
The countrys 29th prime minister, who served as the Liberal member for the Sydney seat of Wentworth for 14 years, handed in his resignation letter to Speaker of the House Tony Smith this afternoon.
New Premier Scott Morrison said he was disappointed his dear and close friend Mr. Turnbull was leaving public life but he deserved to refresh and reset.
Turnbulls departure comes after he was forced to hold a Liberal partyroom meeting last Friday and a majority of his colleagues voted to spill his leadership position.
Mr Morrison defeated Peter Dutton and Julie Bishop to become Prime Minister.
Speaker Smith will consult with party leaders and the Australian Electoral Commission before deciding on a date for a Wentworth by-election.
In his final letter to his constituents this week, Mr Turnbull said the shocking and shameful events leading to his toppling equated to a pointless week of madness that disgraced parliament and appalled nation.
As you know, I have always said that the best place for former PMs is out of the Parliament, and recent events amply demonstrate why, Mr. Turnbull wrote, in a parting shot at his predecessor Tony Abbott.

Outdated admin system slows down HRCSL performances: Dr.Udagama
	
The prevailing outdated administrative system has slowed down the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lankas (HRCSL) performances and outcome which are expected as an independent commission, HRCSL Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama yesterday said.
She said an Independent Commission should not be considered as yet another state department or a corporation.
The Independent commissions including the HRCSL and the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) were established from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a move which is greatly appreciated. The HRCSL had many a plans ahead of us when it was established three years ago.
However, though we have no political influence, the expected performances were not achieved because of the outdated administrative system. These Commissions should be empowered more, she told an event organised by the OMP to mark the International Day of the Enforced Disappearances.
Dr. Udagama said democracy has not yet been properly established in Sri Lanka, and therefore, institutions find it hard to execute their duties.
Meanwhile, she said Sri Lanka is known as a symbol of human development across the world, and therefore, it was not acceptable for such a country to have a record to grave crimes, including enforced disappearances. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Pope faces mounting pressure to quit
	

(Daily Mail), 30 August 2018 -
The pope is facing mounting pressure to quit as ultra-conservative members of the Catholic Church hierarchy continue to accuse him of covering for a cardinal in a sex abuse scandal.
Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a former Vatican envoy to the US, dropped an 11-page bombshell at the weekend accusing Francis of ignoring abuse allegations against prominent US cardinal Theodore McCarrick.
Pope Francis knew from at least June 23, 2013, that McCarrick was a serial predator, Vigano alleged. He knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end.
The timing of the letters release - right in the middle of Franciss landmark trip to Ireland - immediately raised speculation about a possible plot against the Argentine pontiff.
On Wednesday, US cardinal Raymond Leo Burke - the popes fiercest critic within the Vatican - backed Viganos call for Francis to step down.

President appeals BIMSTEC to take collective steps against drug menace
	
President Maithripala Sirisena called upon the leaders of the states in the Bay of Bengal Region to take collective steps against drug menace narcotics smugglers use ocean routes for drug smuggling.
Addressing the 4th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in Nepal, he drew the attention of the leaders to the drug menace which is a great obstacle for the progress of the world community.
It is the menace of drugs and narcotics, heroin, hashish, marijuana and other drugs that are smuggled into the country mainly by sea. This has largely affected our youth and the school children. Illicit drugs have become the most serious challenge and we require more advanced technology and training for our coast guard to fight drug smuggling at sea, he said.
I urge the BIMSTEC Association, the world community, and all the states to commit themselves to fight illegal drugs trafficking collectively and individually through a robust international programme that is more organized and stronger than now, President Sirisena said.
The President said that some powerful corporate groups sometimes even succeed in toppling governments and the leaders should be vigilant about them.
The BIMSTEC regional bloc is one of the fastest growing regions in the world, said President Sirisena and added that Sri Lanka, as an Island Nation wishes to make maximum use of the ocean with new light on ocean research, tourism, fisheries and marine resources.

Public come  to us with distrust -Mirak Raheem
	
Interview with one of the commissioners of OMP Mirak Raheem who touches on challenges this institute faces and the way forward with regard to serving families whose members have gone missing

The Office on the Missing Persons (OMP) was established by the Government of
Sri Lanka in order to end the suffering of victims and their families. Mirak Raheem, one of the commissioners of OMP, in an interview with theDailymirror said that OMP possesses significant power and that it is open to the advice of others. However, he said that the number one challenge the council faces is the lack of trust people have in this organisation. Raheem also noted that the OMP will be releasing an interim report. Following are excerpts of the interview. 

QThe Office of missing Persons was established five months ago. Since then what is the progress you have made so far and what sort of work have you done 
Yes the commission was set up in February and we have been engaged in a number of areas. On one hand we were working in terms of putting the office into operation. Because at the end of the day this is a permanent office, so we have to set it up in a manner that it will be durable and responsive. We have been careful and cautious not to be ad hoc. We also ensure that we follow the state processes, which at times is lengthy and demands time to obtain approval in terms of securing approvals for staff. 
We are also employed during consultations, particularly with the families of the victims, who have disappeared. We have met with 2147 people, including family members, representatives of civil society and also government actors. What we sought in the process is basically to share the plans of the Office of missing persons and obtain feedback from the representatives and also make our presence felt. With regard to some cases people have no idea of the presence of an Office of Missing Persons. Simultaneously we also try to begin initial inquiries into specific cases. August 30 was the day set aside to commemorate the International Day of Victims of Enforced Disappearances. After that we hope to release an interim report. 

The OMP has a wide mandate and there is no time bar in terms of when the disappearance took place. Its mandate covers a broad sect of context including the war civil and political disturbances which captures insurrections in South in 1971 and late 1980s

Q What are the challenges the Office of Missing persons is faced with and how did you face them
The number one challenge for us has been the lack of trust in us and the suspicion about the Office of Missing Persons. This has been an inherited problem, largely because of the previous experiences of families in dealing with the state. Also very few individuals received answers from the state institutions they dealt with, including the Courts . They see OMP as yet another state institution. In that sense they visit us with years of cynicism and distrust. So that itself is a huge challenge we face. We have recognised and appreciate their experiences. We try to acknowledge that. 
In some cases we have encountered protests where groups of families have voiced their disapproval outside our office. With regard to them what we have stressed is that we are not asking them to stop their protests. What we wish to say is that we are one institution and a key one that is tasked with the responsibility of tracing. Even if they dont want OMP to engage in their individual cases we are open to conversation, open for advice on what we are doing right or wrong and we continue to remain engaged with them. 

This is why during consultations we try to clear our mandate and misperceptions and also deal the complaints we have not taken up immediately. We also understand the need to ensure public transparency
The other issue is that we are starting from scratch. To set up a State institution from scratch is quite challenging. But we are confident that over the next few months we would be able to accelerate in terms of setting up offices outside of Colombo. We do not have the luxury of setting up a fully functional office due to the urgency in which families need answers. We will be rolling out the OMP office while commencing inquiries in specific cases. We also have to learn from the mistakes that we might make. We also try to ensure that we are open to technical advice from both national and international actors. We wish to deal with state and non-state institutions (abroad) which have similar roles to play. 

QYou got some of the families of the victims to attend regional meetings. What sort of meetings were they and what category do they belong to;i.e war victims or any other category Was their participation positive 
The OMP has a wide mandate and there is no time bar in terms of when the disappearance took place. Its mandate covers a broad sect of context including the war civil and political disturbances which captures insurrections in South in 1971 and late 1980s. There is also a category of enforced disappearances, which includes incidents like white van abductions. It doesnt matter if the perpetrator is the state or a non state institute so long as it meets this issue of the context. In some cases people have suggested the kind of cases we should take forward. There was much suspicion and pain expressed at these meetings as people recounted their individual experiences. In some cases complainants focused on just one act of violence and with regard to some others they included multiple acts of violence, such as the abduction and the violations suffered by family members when they attempted to report the disappearance. People also raised questions about how we are going to proceed when other institutions were unable to do so and how we are going to be different from previous efforts by the state

QWhat was the outcome of the regional meetings and what is the impact 
We hope it has increased the awareness of the OMP. Its not just about the fact that people attended the meeting, but also the coverage in the media. Whether you approve OMP or not whether you work with it or not it is there. Secondly we try to make people aware of what we are meant to do and should not to do. For us, even though we may have spent years working on this issue this whole experience is a learning curve; for example the experience of the families of the victims and kinds of expectations they have. Some of the toughest questions were asked not by the media, but by these families.

Since there is a history of harassment, people are still nervous about approaching state institutions. Some people may choose to remain silent during public meetings as they weigh the pros and cons, including the risks of speaking aloud


QAre there instances where people who approached the OMP were threatened during the process of consultations 
From the information we have received so far no one has complained that he or she was intimidated for attending the meetings. We have received complaints that certain families were harassed by protestors hence they found it difficult to enter the consultations. Since there is a history of harassment, people are still nervous about approaching state institutions. Some people may choose to remain silent during public meetings as they weigh the pros and cons, including the risks of speaking aloud. One of the things we try to ensure is building our internal process to ensure that we maintain confidentiality. Families are looking into the future and possible political scenarios hence they are wary of the risks they may personally face. 


QHow transparent is the OMP 
From time to time we will be updating the public about our activities. For example we will be releasing an interim report, to announce the progress we have made and challenges we have faced during the first six months since the establishment of the OMP. We are also required to submit an annual report to Parliament regarding our activities. 
However, we also have to balance considerations relating to privacy, and security of individuals. We, who represent the OMP, Act duty bound to maintain confidentiality of certain types of information; for instance on issues relating to the details of witnesses, status of complaints and investigations. We hope to strike a balance to ensure that we maintain trust, security and confidence of the families and the public. 


QAny specific measures you have taken to maintain transparency
This is why during consultations we try to clear our mandate and misperceptions and also deal the complaints we have not taken up immediately. We also understand the need to ensure public transparency. We are in the process of trying to improve our public interface and responsiveness to families to ensure greater information and intend having our own website. Putting out an interim report is one such effort to ensure greater transparency. 


QDo you think the OMP has sufficient power to carry out the tasks which it is assigned
The Act the OMP is created with significant power; for example the right to carry out searches and demand documents and ensure victim and witness protection. It also provides for significant responsibilities like providing pyscho-social assistance and make recommendations on reparations. Of course we could wish for more but it is a fairly robust mandate. As appointed officers it is our duty to ensure we fully use these powers. 

Secondly we try to make people aware of what we are meant to do and should not to do
	
	We have met with 2147 people, including family members
	
	They see OMP as yet another state institution
	
	We also ensure that we follow the state processes
	
	We try to make people aware of what we are meant to do and should not to do

SL have to accept enforced disappearances: OMP
	
Accepting the fact that enforced disappearances had occurred in the country for at least four decades is the only way Sri Lanka can achieve reconciliation, OMP Chairman Saliya Pieris PC said yesterday.
He expressed this at an event held under the theme No more disappearances to mark the International Day of the Enforced Disappearances at the J. R. Jayawardene Centre in Colombo.
If we speak of the numbers of missing in Sri Lanka, it is one of the highest not only in Asia but also in the world. We have to accept that people had been forcibly disappeared for at least four decades. Accepting this is the only way to achieve reconciliation, Mr. Peiris said.
However, he said there are some elements who are still unwilling to accept that incidents of enforced disappearances had taken place in the country.
For some, still, the perpetrators who are responsible for making people disappeared are heroes and the victims are traitors, he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

SL man arrested over terror offences in Sydney
	
A Sri Lankan man employed by a Sydney university has been charged over a document that police allege contained plans for terrorism attacks, the Guardian reported today.
The 25-year-old was arrested by counter-terrorism officers at the University of NSW in Kensington Thursday afternoon, police said.
It followed a tip-off from a worker at the university, who police said found a notebook that allegedly contained the names of several locations and individuals as potential targets.
They are symbolic locations within Sydney. We have psychologists and investigators looking at that document to try to interpret the intent and capability, but that is in essence the offence that is before the court,acting Detective Superintendent Mick Sheehy said on Friday.
A number of electronic items were also seized during a raid at a unit at Zetland early Friday morning.
The man was charged with collecting or making a document which is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act.
He was refused bail to appear at Waverley local court on Friday.
The charges laid against this person are serious and significant, and should not be underestimated, said Australian Federal police Detective Superintendent Michael McTiernan.
The man, who is in Australia on a student visa that expires in September, has not been charged with being a member of a terrorist group.
He was employed as a contractor at the University of NSW and has allegedly travelled back to Sri Lanka and other areas.
The man was not known to police and does not have any criminal history in Australia, police said.
Authorities have insisted there was no concern for public safety.

Sri Lanka needs to  be alert  big time!
	
Sri Lanka was made a one of the taking points by Indias External Affairs Minister Susma Swaraj at the 3rd edition of the Indian Ocean Conference held in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Sri Lanka is always a hot topic when discussions take place regarding the security aspects in the Indian Ocean. India has its concerns over Chinas influence in Sri Lanka and it wouldnt have come as a surprise when Swaraj met Sri Lankan Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the conference. It is reported that Swaraj had conveyed that India was willing to help Sri Lanka develop its ports and aviation facilities. 
Despite India being the closest neighbour, Sri Lanka has readily accepted Chinas extended hand when offers were made to develop ports in the island nation. What has been of great concern to Indian and Japan is the 99-year lease of the Hambantota Port to China. 
TheDailymirror Columnist Ranga Jayasuriya has summed up all this attention on Sri Lanka beautifully in his piece this week by saying that this islands administrators can take one of two options. Sri Lanka can look at all these probing Asian eyes on her as something annoying or make use of these nations so as to get the best benefits from the situation. 
Sri Lanka seems to have understood very clearly Chinas ways of extending its control over strategic locations on the Indian Ocean. China is ready to throw big money in the guise of a hand that is helping in development and the debt burdened islands administrators see the opportunity as an offer they cant refuse. 
Japan was running out of patience and sent its Defence Minister on a goodwill mission to Sri Lanka very recently. Japans representative was very clear about conveying the message from Tokyo that it didnt wish to see China having a military presence in Hambantota. For the record Sri Lanka has given this assurance to Japan. 
At the conference in Vietnam, Wickremesinghe had affirmed that the security situation in the Indian Ocean should be looked at both a comprehensive and competing environment. He had added that the Indian Ocean region is set to define the destiny of the planet in the 21st Century. Wickremesinghe had pointed out that the world order had become more fragile, polarised and unpredictable. 
This is the very reason why Sri Lanka has to play its cards right in maintaining its position of having three key ports in the Indian Ocean, which is now a Maritime Super Highway. 
China is aggressively playing its role in establishing control over key locations on the Indian Ocean through its One belt one road strategy. India and Japan have already offered alternatives to what China is offering to those who are part of maritime traffic. 
China has its own tussles with other Asian nations regarding the South China sea. Wresting control over key points in the Indian Ocean will help China immensely in stamping its authority in the South China Sea. This is why Sri Lanka needs to be careful in its dealings with China where the Indian Ocean is concerned. 
As ties between Sri Lanka and China grow, Colombo entered into an agreement with Japan-when the latters defence minister made a visit here- to boost defense cooperation in the maritime sphere.
Maintaining ties with Japan and China has never been so tricky for Sri Lanka. 
Given the highly sensitive situation in the Indian Ocean, it is important to assess the words of Swaraj at the conference in Vietnam. She had said that nurturing a climate of peace and stability in this region (Indian Ocean) is New Delhis foreign policy and added that India would continue to work on arranging projects to improve maritime logistics in Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and Sri Lanka. 
Now, little Sri Lanka needs to be alert big time!

Suu Kyi should have resigned over Myanmar crackdown: Rights Chief
	

BANGKOK AFP Aug30, 2018 - Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi should have resigned as Myanmars de facto leader over last years brutal army campaign against the Rohingya, the outgoing UN human rights chief has told the BBC. 
A military crackdown in response to attacks by Rohingya militants drove around 700,000 of the Muslim minority from Rakhine state into Bangladesh, where they have given accounts of widespread rape, murder and arson targeting their villages. 
Suu Kyi, once lionised as a defender of human rights, has been pilloried outside her country for failing to speak up for the Rohingya or condemn the actions of Myanmars army. 
Instead, as streams of desperate Rohingya fled, Suu Kyi suggested an iceberg of misinformation had obscured the real picture of what had taken place inside Rakhine and backed the army campaign as a justified response to terrorist acts. 
She (Suu Kyi) was in a position to do something, UN rights chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein said in the interview with the British broadcaster.

Taking a close look at a  painful lump on your kids breast
	
As parents your most valuable asset would be your children and there is no doubt about the fact that you wont be reluctant to go out of the way at times to ensure the topmost happiness for them. Seeing your child sick would be one of the most devastating moments in your life and satisfactory health care facilities with expert medical advice would be highly comforting and reassuring at such times.
In this weeks Health Capsule we are going to discuss one of the commonest complaints, pediatricians come across when mingling with girls around the pubertal age; painful one-sided breast lump. To know more about the medical aspect of this condition we spoke with Dr. H.T Wickramasinghe, a consultant pediatrician.
Your daughter, in her pre-pubertal age, complaining of a pain in the breast and you, feeling a lump around the particular area, can be extremely terrifying as breast cancers always tend to pop up as newspaper headlines says Dr. Wickramasinghe. As parents it is reasonable for you all to panic during situations like that, but the proper medical attention and care will guide you to the safest treatment options, which can either be conservative, medical or surgical
Not something to panic about
According to Dr. Wickramasinghe, puberty is defined as a period of transition from childhood to adulthood which involves physiologic, somatic and constitutional changes associated with further development of the internal and external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics. Breast development is the initial stage of this step-wise evolvement and breast buds, from which breasts are developed to mature glands, during its transition, might present as small, firm, mass under the areolar (the dark area of the breast) especially in one breast initially.Often felt as a strange sensation or pain on one breast at a time, breast buds are not something to get alarmed about and dont suggest any hormonal imbalances or cancers.

However, once family members come across this kind of a presentation they frequently try to feel it to see the progression or changes associated and this constant manipulation may result in soreness, giving rise to unwanted complications like infections and inflammation he further mentioned.

Is there a need to undergo any medical tests or biopsies
Well, this actually depends on how your child presents and the stage of puberty she is experiencing. After listening to the history and carrying out a thorough physical examination, we can decide what this painful lump really is and whether it needs further evaluation.
There are situations which might need fine needle aspiration biopsy etc. to come to a definitive diagnosis, but as I mentioned earlier, in a majority of girls around the age of 8-10 years- it is a mere breast bud which grows up during the normal breast development process of a girl.Adding to this, there was a condition known as Filariasis, which we used to see decades back which presented with a similar picture, but it is extremely rare now Dr. Wickramasinghe explained.

Are there any other conditions which can mimic a breast bud but could be potentially dangerous
Yes of course. There can be several other conditions which may present with a similar clinical picture, but almost all of them will come up after a girl reaches her puberty-meaning post pubertal, which should definitely be addressed by a qualified health care professional.
Breast cyst Cysts are small pockets comprising body tissue filled with air or fluid which can develop within the breast, often as a result of the blockage of glands.
Breast cysts are usually found in middle aged women, but may see in adolescent girls, who have attained puberty. The cysts can have an abrupt onset and can swell and be painful just before menstruation.
This is a situation which needs medical attention and if a cyst filled with pus is diagnosed, it can be treated with aspiration.
Fibroadenomas- These are benign lumps on the breast which can occur at all ages, but commonly seen in women between 16 and 24. The lump will be solid, smooth, firm and rubbery on touching and may grow up to various sizes.
It is better to visit a doctor if you find this kind of a lump on your childs breast and it would be diagnosed through mammogram, ultrasound or fine-needle aspiration.
Breast abscess- Breast abscesses usually occurs in lactating mothers, but can occur in preadolescent girls too. It will be red and painful to touch. These abscesses usually develop as a result of an infection due to Staphylococcus aureus and the treatment will be needle aspiration and antibiotics
Benign fibrocystic changes
Over half of all women will experience fibrocystic changes in their breasts over their lifetime.
These lumps can result in pain and discomfort and medical advice is indicated if the mass doesnt seem to disappear over a period of time.
In addition to all these conditions, a cancerous growth in breasts during childhood can be seen rarely and at times as a secondary deposits from a distant organ such as bone and therefore as health care professionals we always advice parents to bring their child to the hospital if the slightest changes are noted. This is to ensure that we can examine the child and decide whether she needs further evaluation or if its just a normal change occurring with the growth.
According to Dr. Wickramasinghe, if your child presents with any of the following signs in addition to the breast lump, she should get medical advice from a healthcare professional in order to see if any additional interventions are required.

The lump isnt situated directly under the nipple.
	The lump has a diameter more than 1.5 inches (4 cm).
	The lump doesnt go away after 2 years.
	The lump occurs when the girl is over 15 years, especially couple of years after reaching the puberty
	The lump is attached to the chest wall, feels hard or is unmovable.
	Dimpled, ulcerated or discolored skin lying over the lump.
	Blood, milk or other discharge leaking from the nipples.
	If associated with other symptoms such as fever, night sweats or weight loss

Take home message:
The human body is something really amazing. Most changes it under goes over the course of life time have still not been explained-as they are highly individualised and differ from person to person. So even if we generalize certain facts with data obtained by research studies, they may not be applicable to all the individuals-which is why we say, even though the medical information we share can apply to the majority-your child can be special or exceptional.

Tamil leaders bogged down in new controversy:                                             Developmen
	

NPC had been over-politicized
	
	Wigneswaran requested 16 Parliamentarians of the TNA not to participate in the Task Force
	
	Argues that political solution to the ethnic problem more important than the economic development 
	
	As a result of both parties to the talks attempting to hoodwink each other, the Thimpu talks collapsed.

With only a month remaining for the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) to end its term, the long-drawn tussle between Chief Minister of the Province, C.V.Wigneswaran and the leadership of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has found a new bone of contention, the Presidential Task Force for the Development of Northern and Eastern Provinces, to fight over.
Bringing back a long forgotten theoretical argument, the Chief Minister had requested the 16 Parliamentarians of the TNA not to participate in the second meeting of the Task Force scheduled to be held on August 27, contending that it would help Government to undermine the Tamil peoples demand for a political solution to the ethnic problem.
In a letter addressed to TNA leader R. Sampanthan on August 22, Wigneswaran had argued that the political solution to the ethnic problem was more important than the economic development in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces.

Prabhakaran responded in his letter dated December 22 that the economic issues created by the war and faced by the people must be addressed before going into political matters.
He had suggested the TNA leader to convey this point to President Maithripala Sirisena by the absence of the TNA MPs in the meeting.
However, the Parliamentary group of the TNA that met on August 23 rejected Chief Minister Wigneswarans suggestion and decided to participate at the meeting.
The MPs, who supported the decision, are of the opinion that there is progress in the process to find a political solution to the ethnic problem and the Task Force was a good forum to air the grievances of the Tamil people.
They had also contended that it was only by attending the meeting that the TNA would be able to bring to the notice of the Task Force some of the burning issues such as the invasion of northern land by the security forces.
Wigneswarans line of thinking seems to be that he is no longer a member of the TNA, despite him still being the Chief Minister nominated by the party at the 2013 Provincial Council Election.
He openly criticizes the TNA and its leadership while receiving a reciprocal response from the party as well. Going by the public utterances by some of the senior TNA leaders, he would not be included in the partys candidates list for the next Northern Provincial Council election.

TNA is of the opinion that there is progress in the process to find a political solution to the ethnic problem and the Task Force was a good forum to air the grievances of the Tamil people.
And rumours have it that he was preparing to contest under a new coalition, sometimes under the Tamil National Council (TNC) which he formed three years ago and in which he is one of the co-Presidents.
It is against this backdrop that the new controversy over the Presidential Task Force is making headlines in Tamil newspapers.
The notion that the political issues must take precedence over economic issues seems to have been the policy the Chief Minister has been following during his tenure.
The Sunday Times carried a story on its July 29 issue which said that the NPC had passed a record 415 resolutions during its tenure and they are related mostly issues that do not come within the purview of the council.
In fact, we have heard about the NPC adopting resolutions requesting the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to conduct an international investigation on war crimes allegedly committed during the war and to declare that genocide against Tamils had taken place in Sri Lanka.
In a recent interview with the Daily Mirror the Governor of the Northern Province Reginald Cooray had said how the NPC had been over-politicized in a manner that it is more interested in political issues rather than the problems of the people, who are struggling to come out from destructions caused to their families and society as a whole, by the war.
However, the position taken by Wigneswaran is not something new, rather it had been the stance taken by many Tamil leaders including those of the LTTE and the TNA itself, in the past.
Apart from the Tamil leaders some of the Leftist leaders including those of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in far back as the 1960s and 1970s had contended that economic measures taken by the bourgeois Governments would not solve the problems of the people but hamper their struggle for Socialism.
Hence, the extreme extension of this contention resulted in some Leftists arguing that people must be affected by the activities of the Government so that they would be attracted towards Socialism.
Wigneswaran seems to have borrowed this old theory.
Yet, most of those who argued that the political issues must take precedence, including the LTTE and the TNA had changed their mind later.
During the first negotiation between a Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil groups that was held in Bhutanese capital Thimpu in July and August 1985, the position taken by all stakeholders had been that ethnic problem should be addressed politically and forthwith. Interim measures were not even considered.
It was during these talks that the famous Thimpu principles were presented by the Tamil leaders.
However, as a result of both parties to the talks attempting to hoodwink each other, the talks collapsed.
Four years later, when the LTTE came forward for talks with the Government of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, the organization had changed.
They wanted the day-to-day problems of the people in the North and the East to be solved first, despite President Premadasa attempted to address the political issues through an All Party Conference, in which Yogaratnam Yogi and a few others attended as the LTTE representatives.
Yet, after several rounds of talks at the highest level, the LTTE seized on the arrest of a Muslim tailor, who worked for them and started what is then called Eelam War II, in June 1990.
The LTTE had not changed this stance during the talks with the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government either. In a letter sent to the organisations leader Velupillai Prabhakaran on December 20, 1994, the then Deputy Defence Minister Anurudda Ratwatte had suggested to take up political issues at the next round of talks and Prabhakaran responded in his letter dated December 22 that the economic issues created by the war and faced by the people must be addressed before going into political matters.
Again this had been the position taken by the LTTE during the talks with the Ranil Wickremesinghe government as well, in 2002 and 2003. Their main demand at the negotiating table was to form an interim administration for the North and the East, which in a proposal they submitted later had been named Interim Self-Governing Authority (ISGA).
A joint subcommittee named Sub-Committee On Immediate Humanitarian And Rehabilitation Needs In The North And East (SIHRN), comprising of representatives of both the Government and the LTTE was formed, while a separate fund called North East Rehabilitation Fund (NERF) was to be formed with the supervision of the World Bank.
Two international conferences were convened in Washington and Tokyo in order to support the Sri Lankan peace process and the international community pledged to assist Sri Lanka with a massive amount of $ 4.5 billion, at the Tokyo Conference.
Despite this history vindicating the TNA stance in the present controversy, some six years ago, during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, the party was following a different line.
During the 14th convention of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) held in Batticaloa in May 2012,
TNA leader Sampanthan said It is true that a duty lies with us all to rescue ourselves, our community and our people from this agony, to uplift them to an acceptable standard of living. But, my dear friends, we must not, for this reason, fall into the trap of the so-called development being brought about by the Sri Lankan Government. It is a devious trap to undermine the very existence of the Tamil people as a community. It is a death trap.
The Tamil leaders have been demanding a political solution for decades and it is not clear how many more decades they would have to wait for a solution that would satisfy them.
Does Wigneswaran want the northern people to live without land, water, roads, irrigation facilities and housing until then

## Title: The cellulitis conundrum

The cellulitis conundrum
	

The proper and timely treatment of a patient possesses potentially lifesaving benefits. In tandem, with the advancements in science & technology pertaining to the field of medicine, wondrous miracles have been performed during the past few decades. However the number of individuals receiving treatment due to Cellulitis continues to rise. This health condition is one of the most common causes for admission to the surgical wards in the government setup. In this weeks edition of Health Capsule we are joined by Dr. Thushan Gooneratne, Senior Registrar in Vascular Surgery, who is currently on a vascular surgery fellowship in Leeds, UK to shed some light on the subject. Following are excerpts of an interview done with Dr. Gooneratne.
QWhat isCellulitis
The condition called Cellulitis occurs when there is an infection on the skin and the layer of fat and tissues just below the skin surface. It can happen in almost any part of the body, but its more common in the legs.
QWhat causesCellulitis
Cellulitis is mainly caused by bacteria. Two types of bacteria called staphylococcus and streptococcus are commonly implicated. We all have bacteria, including these ones, living harmlessly on our skin. But our skin acts as a protective outer layer to prevent them from causing harm. However, if there is any damage to our skin, then these bacteria can creep in and cause infection. I.e. cellulitis.
QHow do you recogniseCellulitis
Commonly when there is cellulitis, the affected area becomes red, swollen and very painful. You will notice that the affected skin is tight, smooth and shiny. It feels very warm compared to the rest of the body. It may initially be a small area, but will quickly enlarge in size within a few days.
If the bacteria enter the bloodstream, then you may also develop fever and chills. You may lose your appetite, feel nauseous and generally unwell.

QWho are most susceptibleto it
Cellulitis can affect anyone. In a normal healthy person, even if the infection gets in through the skin, the immune system is usually capable of destroying the bacteria before they spread the infection. Therefore cellulitis is not commonly seen in healthy adults and children. However certain conditions make some people more susceptible to developing cellulitis.
The elderly patients whose immune system is suppressed (i.e. on steroids, on chemotherapy, have immune deficiency medical conditions), patients who have skin conditions that cause cracks in the skin (eczema, cracked heal pads), patients who have poorly controlled diabetes and patients with chronic leg swelling have a higher chance of developing cellulitis.
In fact, cellulitis may be the first presentation of a previously undiagnosed diabetic. So if you were otherwise healthy, it is important that you subject yourself to a fasting blood sugar test. Toe nail infections, fungal infections in toe web spaces, missed heal prick infections are commonly found causes of infection in such people.

QWhat is the treatmentfor Cellulitis
The mainstay treatment for cellulitis is antibiotics. This can be oral (if mild infection) or intravenous injections (if severe infection). Overall you will probably require 7-10 days of antibiotics.
You can help speed up the healing process by resting the affected part and elevating it above the heart level. Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. Dont attempt to rub various oils/creams/lotions and wrap bandages on the affected area. This can make things worse and result in permanent damage to the skin or cause ulceration.
Once the acute symptoms are controlled, it is important that the foci of infection as well as general predisposing conditions are properly treated to prevent cellulitis from recurring. Your doctor will perform the necessary investigations to find out such conditions.

QHow would youprevent it
It is important that people exposed to the risk of cellulitis avoid skin damage. You should always try to wear protective clothing, shoes, gloves etc. whenever possible.
Patients with chronic limb swelling (due to varicose veins or lymphedema) should wear compression stockings. Sometimes if patients develop recurrent cellulitis despite all the prevention methods they are prescribed long-term antibiotics. It is important that people who are diabetic keep their blood sugar levels under control and have proper foot care. Dont try to cut you own toe nails. Dry skin should be moisturised. Make sure that your shoes are not too tight and appropriate shoes are worn. Check your feet daily and immediately report any minor injury.
QWhen should I be worriedWhat if things worsen
It is important that you seek urgent medical attention, and not try to indulge in self-medication. There are many causes that mimic cellulitis. Your doctor will be able to differentiate them.
Any cellulitis that involves the face and especially areas around the eye can result in brain infection called meningitis if not properly treated. Similarly if cellulitis involves genitalia, recent surgical sites or overlies a joint then you must seek immediate medical attention.
If symptoms havent responded after 48-72 hours of antibiotics; or the skin colour changes from red to purple/brown or black colour, or if you notice blistering / numbness in the affected area, you should seek urgent medical attention. This could mean that the infection is spreading into deeper tissues, or resulting in a collection of pus and will require urgent surgery. A dangerous condition called necrotizing fasciitis can develop when cellulitis progresses and is potentially fatal if surgery is delayed.

The Yellowing that is a red light
	
                  Neonatal Jaundice                   

If you have ever visited a newborn baby unit, you would have seen some babies kept under special devices emitting a blue light. You may have heard that this is a form of treatment for a condition called neonatal jaundice. Not only does neonatal jaundice rank high among the complications occurring in newborn babies, it has the potential to cause significant adverse effects later in life. At times, it also acts as an early warning sign of more severe underlying pathologies. The health capsule decided to consult Dr. Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician, Apeksha Hospital Maharagama, to obtain more information regarding this condition.

About Neonatal Jaundice
A person is said to have jaundice when he or she has yellowish discoloration of the skin and in the white part of the eye, due to the accumulation of a substance called indirect bilirubin in the blood. Indirect bilirubin is produced as a result of a breakdown of blood cells in our body, and cannot be excreted directly. These particles are then transported into the liver and converted to another form of bilirubin, which can be excreted through urine and feces.
Neonatal jaundice is when the baby is having jaundice within the first month of its life. Functions of the liver are not fully developed in newborn babies, so they do not have the same capacity to turn insoluble indirect bilirubin into the more excretable form, so even a relatively small amount of bilirubin can get accumulated in their blood, causing neonatal jaundice. This process, which is called physiological jaundice, can occur even in normal, otherwise healthy babies, explains Dr. Perera. This is due to the relatively short lifespan of red blood cells of a neonate, causing them to breakdown earlier, resulting in accumulation in bilirubin, he explained
But, jaundice can be a presenting feature of a more sinister underlying cause as well. Infections, congenital metabolic conditions and a group of conditions called haemolytic disease of the newborn can also present as jaundice, as a result of increased blood cell breakdown caused by these conditions.
So how do we differentiate physiological jaundice from its more sinister counterpart, which is called pathological jaundice Physiological jaundice usually appears around second or third day after birth, with blood bilirubin levels going up until around 5th day of birth and going down usually by 10th day following birth. Therefore, jaundice that appears during the first 24 hours after birth, as well as after 14 days of birth is considered more dangerous, according to the doctor. But this does not mean that all newborns having jaundice between 2nd day and 14th day are having physiological jaundice.

In cases of persisting jaundice after two weeks, thyroid assessment should be done and thyroid hormone supplementation should be started immediately if needed

Pathological Jaundice
Pathological jaundice that appear very early in life can be caused by infections at birth, as well as a condition called haemolytic disease of newborn, which occurs due to incompatibility of the blood between mother and the fetus. In this condition, antibodies produced in the blood of the mother is passed into the blood of the baby, attacking the cells in the blood. This condition is especially seen in Rh negative mothers, who are having Rh positive babies. This can also be seen at times in mothers with the blood group O and babies having blood group A or B. Poor feeding due to various causes like poor feeding technique, difficulty in breastfeeding in prematurely born babies is also a cause of neonatal jaundice.
If jaundice persists after 2 weeks of birth, it can be due to an underlying condition like congenital hypothyroidism, conditions like congenital biliary atresia, choledochal cysts, or underlying infections, which needs early recognition and intervention.

Complication of Neonatal Jaundice
Why are we so concerned about jaundice in newborns, we asked the doctor. This is because of the long-term effects that the baby can have later in life due to accumulation of bilirubin in blood, he explains. In adult brain, there is an obstacle called the Blood Brain Barrier covering the blood vessels supplying the brain which filters blood of unwanted material before delivering it to the brain. Like many organs in a newborns body, the blood brain barrier is not fully developed at birth. Therefore bilirubin, when it passes a certain level in blood, goes directly into the brain and gets collected in the brain tissues, giving rise to a condition called kernicterus.
Kernicterus can give rise to many complications related to brain development like cerebral palsy and learning disabilities in children. Therefore timely management of both physiological and pathological jaundice is of utmost importance. In addition, as explained earlier, underlying causes in case of pathological jaundice need to be identified and treated immediately.

Treatment for neonatal jaundice
Neonatal jaundice can be successfully treated with no lasting consequences if identified early and managed, emphasises Dr. Perera. The need for treatment is decided after checking the babys blood levels of bilirubin. In cases of very high levels of bilirubin, a procedure called exchange transfusion is performed. There, the blood which contains toxic amounts of bilirubin is replaced with normal blood.
In newborn babies with moderate levels of jaundice, phototherapy is the recommended treatment method. Phototherapy is a treatment where the bilirubin in blood is broken down into soluble particles by a special light and excreted through babys urine. Keeping as much area of the babys skin exposed to the light, (except for the eyes which should be kept covered) is important in receiving the maximum benefit of treatment. Duration of the phototherapy needed will be decided by the level of bilirubin in blood.
In addition, causes for jaundice should be identified to find out if its correctable. Breastfeeding technique should be assessed and corrected, and appropriate antibiotics should be given in case of an infection.
Neonatal hypothyroidism is an important correctable cause of neonatal jaundice. In cases of persisting jaundice after two weeks, thyroid assessment should be done and thyroid hormone supplementation should be started immediately if needed. Thyroid deficiency at birth, if untreated, can cause many adverse consequences like growth retardation and learning disabilities in children. Babies with conditions like congenital biliary atresia and choledochal cyst should be referred to a paediatric surgeon because they are likely to have to undergo surgery.

Message to the parents of newborns

Neonatal jaundice is a common condition occurring in newborn babies. Even though it can have adverse effects if untreated, timely identification and treatment will result in complete cure for the baby. Therefore knowing about the condition and the modes of treatment is important in parents of newborn babies. Also, seeking medical advice in case of suspicion of yellowish discoloration of the skin of your newborn, especially after 2 weeks following birth, will help in preventing complications, ensuring the health of your baby.
If you have ever visited a newborn baby unit, you would have seen some babies kept under special devices emitting a blue light. You may have heard that this is a form of treatment for a condition called neonatal jaundice. Not only does neonatal jaundice rank high among the complications occurring in newborn babies, it has the potential to cause significant adverse effects later in life.

They dont want even dogs sniffing around!
	

A section of white collar ones working at a strategic point monitoring imports and exports have put down their foot against a proposed move to set sniffer dogs to detect narcotics being smuggled into the country concealed in cargo shipments.

These white-collar ones apparently working on a common agenda, which appears to form part and parcel of a sleaze network, look on the workplace as their exclusive territory and would not tolerate collaborative assistance even from another State Agency, they say.
These worthies had raised a howl of protest when a high political authority recently proposed that the trained sniffer dogs be deployed at strategic points at the Colombo Port to frustrate attempts to smuggle in dope to the country.
Some of these white-collar ones have reportedly made it a practice to collect santhosham from importers for releasing cargo shipments and they do not tolerate the presence of outsiders in their territory even in an official capacity, they say.

Turning the predecessors failings to good account!
	

This head of a mini-council in a historic township is reportedly spending most of his time raking up the mistakes of his predecessor neglecting the pressing problems of the ratepayers, they say.

He is also said to be planning to transfer out the council employees believed to have been loyal to his predecessor, who is an active Pohottuwa member.
The main purpose of this worthys persistent efforts to uncover acts of commission and omission of his predecessor is to win brownie points from his party leader, they say.

Whither tertiary education Policies, regulations and practices
	

Tertiary Education is Post-Secondary School Education, which is different from Post- Secondary Education as it is after successful completion of secondary education, i.e. after GCE A-levels or equivalent qualifications.
Of course, Tertiary Education covers a wide area including University education and Degree awarding institutes as provided by the Universities Act and respective Acts of other Universities outside the Universities Grants Commission (UGC), Off shore Universities granting degrees, Higher Diplomas by overseas universities through private training institutes by the authority vested on them by the respective Senates and Governing Councils or equivalent bodies, Professional Courses of the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA), Higher Education Institutes of the Ministry of Higher Education, Colleges of Education of the Ministry of Education, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutes under the Ministry of Skills development and Vocational Training and others as displayed in the chart. 
The main purpose of this article is to indicate primarily the Tertiary and Vocational Education and Training institutes registered with the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), and the courses of study of such institutes which are accredited by the TVEC.
In order to legalize and enforce the above, the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act No. 20 of 1990 (as amended) has prescribed among its general objects the maintenance of academic and training standards in institutes, agencies and all other establishments providing tertiary education and vocational education. 
The current accredited courses of study and the registered institutes are illustrated in the TVET Guide 2018, on a provincial basis, in the website: info@tvec.gov.lk. For the convenience of all stakeholders, such as student trainees, parents, principals and teachers of schools, employers, those specially from the industry, this information would be available to offer their services to interact with the institutes. Most of the courses are based on the National Vocational Qualification framework (NVQ 1-7) where levels 1-4 are at certificate level, 5 & 6 are at diploma level and level 7 being a degree. At present there are 615 registered institutes (405 public & private 210) and 3715 accredited courses of study(2847 NVQ & 868 Non NVQ) conducted at the University of Vocational Technology (UNIVOTEC) in Ratmalana. technology graduates who have pursued the programmes of study as per the conditions laid down by the Sydney Accord and the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL) would be eligible initially for Affiliate Status of the IESL. 
Hope this would indicate the vast provision of tertiary and vocational education opportunities in the country. While there may be shortcomings, delays and improvements necessary, it could be assured that all these are being looked into by the authorities. If there are suggestions for improvement, constructive comments are most welcome to the email address: chairman@tvec.gov.lk
It is hoped that the above would generally present the policies on Tertiary Education, regulations which govern the establishment and continuation of tertiary and vocational education institutes as described in the TVE Act and the practices of providing tertiary and vocational education courses of study island wide.
