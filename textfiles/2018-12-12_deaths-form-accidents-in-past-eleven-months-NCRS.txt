A total of 2,590 people were killed in 2,481 road accidents during the past eleven months, the National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) said.

NCRS Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said accidents involving motorbikes and the number of pedestrian deaths had increased drastically with 1,011 people getting killed in accidents involving motorbikes while 792 pedestrians were also killed.

“The increase of such accidents can be attributed to incorrect overtaking, high-speed driving and riding, failure to follow road signs and not adhering to road rules as a whole,” Dr. Kodagoda said.

According to the report, an average of eight persons are killed while nearly 20 become permanently disabled every day as a result of road accidents. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
