Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa said today that the Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya must have been influenced to postpone the local government election.

Mr.  Rajapaksa said the Elections Commission Chairman had no legal obstruction to hold the election and requested him to hold the lection without being recorded in history as the person who did not hold an election for one and half years.  

“The President had issued a gazette notification regarding the local government election. No one can go beyond it,” he said.

Mr.  Rajapaksa said the referendum during J.R. Jayawardene’s tenure was the most corrupt election ever but postponing the election was even more corrupt.

“Elections cannot be postponed as ministers want. It is an administrative matter. There is no provision in the law to take away the right of vote. The elections commission will have to take the responsibility for that,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
