An unseen hand in awarding of the contract


	



 

The awarding of the contract for building houses for the war-displaced in the North to an Indian company for an amount  described as ‘unreasonably high’ has come under fire from many quarters.

 


  The purohita in charge of the subject has got into an untenable position with even the TNA ruling the roost in the North taking up cudgels against him over the affair. 


Although the purohita in charge is facing the music, the person who is really behind bringing the foreign construction firm into the scene here is said to be a much more powerful political authority, they say. 


The powerful political authority himself is a big name in the business world.  However, government had to appoint a committee to look into this deal when it came under fire from one quarter after the other.
