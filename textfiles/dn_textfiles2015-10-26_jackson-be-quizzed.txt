Jackson to be quizzed

Popular artiste Jackson Anthony is likely to be summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) to obtain a statement regarding excessive finances incurred on the opening dance acts performed at the Hambantota harbour opening, sources said. Anthony was the creative director for the ceremony held in 2010. Rs. 15 million was spent for the dance acts alone, which was performed by members of the Channa-Upuli Dance Academy managed by dancers Channa Wijewardena and Upuli Panibharatha.
The duo in a statement to PRECIFAC last week stated that only Rs. 6.8 million was paid to them.
Meanwhile, Jackson Anthony yesterday said on being contacted and asked by the Daily News about his involvement in the harbour’s water filling ceremony on August 15, 2010, “ I was the Creative Director of that ceremony. As the creative director of the event I gave the concept to Channa Wijewardena.” Asked if he had been called to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, Anthony said,” “I saw that some social network websites had reported that I have been summoned by the Commission.”
“I have not received anything to this effect though. I do not know anything about this,” he said. Asked if he was aware that artistes Channa Wijewardena and Upuli Panibharatha had given statements regarding payments they have received for their performances at the Habanthota Harbour ceremony, Anthony said, “Yes, Channa told me so.”
Commenting on the situation Channa Wijewardena told the Daily News, at the request of the Ports Authority, their Arts Foundation agreed to stage multiple dance events at the Hmbnathota harbour water filling ceremony. “It was Jackson that gave the concept to us ,” he said. “We were asked to present a group of 1,000 dancers for the show. I told them that the costs would be exorbitant with so many artistes. Then they asked me to come up with 500 artistes, I further reduced the number down to 200.”
“We did not accept any cash. The payments were made through banking. I have submitted every slip and file to the Presidential Commission,” he said.
“I want the authorities to go ahead and investigate every one of my bank accounts,” he said. “ This is really saddening, I am an artiste who has brought international recognition to Sri Lanka, not just once, but, seven or more occasions.
I have earned many international accolades and awards for Sri Lanka, competing with 99 countries,”said Wijewardena. “And they are asking me if I had had taken an amount that I was not even aware of for a show that I gave with all my heart in terms of its artistic value,” he pointed out.
“Should anyone wonder as to for what we charged the sum of Rs 6,888,125, it is for payments for 200 dancers who performed at the ceremony, together with 200 costumes that were made, stage equipment, the two month training that was given to them, the services of professional make-up artistes and hair dressers, sounds that were purchased, food and lodgings given to artistes and other miscellaneous expenses,” he said.
“Moreover,” he said, “ as a matter of policy, we do not charge any money for costs involving creating costumes and graphics when a show is a state event. We did not charge for any of these events as well.”
