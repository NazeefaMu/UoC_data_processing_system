Speaking at an event in Kegalle, Minister of Power and Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya the laws would ensure the CEB discharged its duties responsibly.

The minister claimed that despite the Public Utilities Commission being formed 7 years ago, no laws and regulations were introduced for anything related to power and energy.

The ministry is to enforce laws which will hold the CEB responsible to the general public.
