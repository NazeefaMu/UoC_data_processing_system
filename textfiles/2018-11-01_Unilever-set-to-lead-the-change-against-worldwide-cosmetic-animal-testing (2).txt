As one of the biggest companies in the cosmetics industry with brands under their belt such as Dove, Fair and Lovely and Vaseline, Unilever has recently announced its support for a global ban on the cosmetic testing on animals.  It’s estimated a worldwide ban could save around 115 million animals from a painful death every year.  Unilever is in the unique position that they now have the chance to influence other companies by sharing with them their 30 years of research on the technology and methods for non-animal approaches for product safety testing.  Their goal is to end cosmetic animal testing within the next five years, which means a lot of happy bunnies!
