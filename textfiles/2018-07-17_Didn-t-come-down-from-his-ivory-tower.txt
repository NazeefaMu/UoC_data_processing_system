Didn’t come down from his ivory tower!


	



 

A group of local politicos in a certain part of the backwoods were highly elated on hearing that a very high political authority was due to attend a religious ceremony at the village temple for they were keen on apprising him of the pressing needs of the area for early necessary action. The high political authority did arrive for the religious ceremony held with much fanfare, but the group of politicos waiting to meet him were not allowed to go near him by the security men who rudely brushed them off.

 


Highly dejected, the local politicos left the venue in a huff vowing to teach them all a lesson at the coming polls, they say.
