Foreigner heaps praise on Corporal for exemplary act

Corporal Sunil Karunatilake with Dr. Gerhard Niemand of South Africa
Corporal Sunil Karunatilake of 13 Corps of Engineer Service (CES) of the Sri Lanka Army received overwhelming praise from a South African foreigner after the former returned the foreigner's wallet, left behind on the road close to the Galle Face roundabout a few days ago.
The wallet belonging to Dr. Gerhard Niemand of South Africa who was on tour in Sri Lanka during the final week of September, contained traveller's cheques, credit cards, driving licence, several keys and Sri Lankan currency to the value of Rs 22,240. It was recovered by Corporal Sunil Karunatilake who was returning to the Army Headquarters after attending to some work at the Commander's official residence.
The soldier informed about the recovery of the wallet to his Commanding Officer at his duty point soon after his return to the Army Headquarters who in turn got in touch with the foreigner through details found in the wallet. The following day, the soldier together with an officer met the foreigner staying at a hotel in Colombo who praised the soldier for his exemplary act.
The foreigner after taking photos of the Army Corporal handed over a letter of commendation to him.
