A strong earthquake has struck near Norcia in central Italy, following last week's damaging tremors, experts report.

The quakes come nearly two months after a major earthquake killed almost 300 people and destroyed several towns.

Sunday's quake measured magnitude 6.6, the largest so far, and was at a depth of only 1.5km (0.9 miles).

There were no immediate reports of casualties but many buildings are reported to be destroyed.

The US Geological Survey said the epicentre of the quake was 68km south-east of the regional centre of Perugia and close to the small town of Norcia.
