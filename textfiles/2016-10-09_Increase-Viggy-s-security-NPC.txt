Chairman of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC), C.V.K. Shivagnanam has requested the security provided to Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran be increased citing threats to his life.

Mr. Shivagnanam had made the request in writing to the IGP. The decision, he said was based on a statement made by the Chief Minister to the effect that racist groups based in the South were hatching plans to harm his life and blame previous LTTE cadres for the act.

Meanwhile, NPC member M. K. Shivajilingam said the Chief Minister had received more threats from southern racist groups after the ‘Eluga Tamil’ demonstration.

At present, Chief Minister Vigneswaran has been provided with security similar to other Provincial Chief Ministers. (Romesh Madushanka)
