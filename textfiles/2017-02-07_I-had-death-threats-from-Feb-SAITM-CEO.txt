SAITM's Chief Executive Officer Dr. Sameera Senaratne whose car came under gunfire on Monday night said today he had received death threats on three consecutive days and that he had complained to the IGP, DIG and the Mulleriyawa Police about these threats.

He told a news conference that he received several anonymous phone calls on February 1, 2 and 3 asking him to resign from SAITM and that he had lodged the complaint on the third when he received a letter with death threats.
Dr. Senaratne said the shooting incident occurred when the investigation into the complaint was in progress.

He said the Police and the CID had launched investigation into the shooting incident soon after he complained to the Police over the phone.

Dr. Senaratne said police had provided him with personal security after the shooting.

When asked whether it was a drama enacted to win sympathy, he said no one would empathize with SAITM at this juncture and that he was only an officer and his removal would not affect its operations.

“Even if I am killed SAITM will continue with another official appointed to my post,” Dr. Senaratne said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
