With Love, love love...

Someone once said that if a modern version of Sri Lankan cinema’s legendary romantic hero, Vijaya Kumaratunga, could be rejuvenated in modern times Hemal Sachindra Ranasinghe would fit the bill! Armed with charismatic looks, the passion to dedicate his life to the reel and inborn talents to excel in the field, it is no wonder that he is also dubbed as the actor who is likely to turn a new page in local cinema history.
His debut movie, ‘Super Six’ was one of the highest budget films in Sri Lanka. It also made it to theaters in India. His second movie, ‘Pravegaya’ gave him an opportunity to carve a niche for himself. His third cinematic venture, ‘Aadaraneeya Kathawak’ (A Melody of Love) is a musical.
Hemal has also made a name for himself as a top model and had walked the ramp at many national and international level fashion shows. He won the Male Model of the World 2009 title at the Best Male and Female Model of the World competition held in Spain. He also represented Sri Lanka at the Mr World 2010 pageant held in Korea. Hemal is also versed in martial arts and dancing.
Q: If you could be someone else for a day, who would you like to be? Why?
A: One day is not a long span for me to do much with my new avatar! I think I would like to be myself to dedicate one more day towards doing something good on behalf of the society.
Q: Have you ever been compared to other well known people?
A: Yes. People tend to compare well known personalities with me. There are too many names to mention.
Q: Which historic character would you like to give life to?
A: King Ravana. I actually got the opportunity to play his role in a movie but unfortunately that project got held up. If I was given a choice I would choose to play him because he played a significant role in our history. We first got to know about our county’s existence through his tale. Though he is known as the demon king, I believe that he too is a hero belonging to the bygone era. I first heard the tale in my childhood and I never tire of hearing it.
Q: Action hero or romantic heartthrob? Why?
A: I like to be known as a versatile actor some day. So both please...
Q: What is your most treasured possession?
A: (pauses for a while) I had a ‘possession’ which I treasured some years ago. But I lost it. I do not like to think about it today.
Q: What is the best acting advice you have gotten?
A: “Take a deep breath! Then proceed”. Mahendra Perera gave me that advice. He is one of the veterans whom I respect most in the industry.
Q: Who would be your Bollywood leading ladies if you were asked to act in a romantic drama, action thriller and comedy?
A: (Laughs) Gosh, I need time to think that over... ok, for the romance I would choose Shruti Haasan. I would pick Deepika Padukone for the action thriller and Priyanka Chopra for the comedy.
Q: Do you have any nicknames?
A: My close friends call me Sachi or Sachee.
Q: What is your favourite food?
A: Anything my mother cooks. I love home cooked meals.
Q: Are you an animal lover?
A: Yes. Though I cannot keep pets in my residence in Colombo we have two rottweilers at home in Matale. They are Jade and Cheo.
Q: Who are you closest to in life?
A: My mother.
Q: What are the qualities that you are looking for in your future partner?
A: Love, love, love.
