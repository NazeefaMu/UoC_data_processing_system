The cabinet subcommittee appointed to advise the FCID will be disbanded as it has not met for a year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.

"I have never got involved in the investigations, and the cabinet subcommittee which advises the FCID has not met for a year to decide on the investigations," said Mr Wickremesinghe, in response to opposition MPs who wanted to know who actually advised the FCID, as there was provision for a cabinet subcommittee headed by the Prime Minister to advise them on investigations.

Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella said that the subcommittee should be abolished if was inactive.

"Then we will disband it," said the Prime Minister. (Yohan Perera)
