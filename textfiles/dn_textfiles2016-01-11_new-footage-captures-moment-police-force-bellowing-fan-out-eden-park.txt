New footage captures the moment police force bellowing fan out of Eden Park

Seven people were removed from Eden Park during yesterday's T20 against Sri Lanka over "alcohol management and misconduct issues", Eden Park Trust CEO Guy Ngata has confirmed.
The stadium spokesman was responding to a public backlash over the eviction of Sri Lankan fans during the game.
Mr Ngata said the removal of fans from the game was for "reasons of safety".
"Eden Park's priority is to ensure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the game," Mr Ngata said in a statement.

"Eden Park reserves the right to ask patrons to leave if they are consuming alcohol not purchased at the ground or are intoxicated."
Their response came as new footage surfaced on Facebook of the moment a Sri Lankan cricket fan was forced out of Eden Park.
Security at the T20 has come under fire from cricket fans appalled by what's being described as "heavy-handed" security.
The new footage shows one fan bellowing as two police officers carry him out of the stadium.
The man yells "my knee, my knee", either in pain or protesting over the way the officers were handling him.
Members of the crowd can be heard jeering at the police officers.
Following the incident, Eden Park's Facebook page was bombed with several comments about the conduct of security guards.
James Creighton said, "too bad the Sri Lankans can't see it, because you kicked all of them out".
Imker Swanepoel commented on a post saying, "gotta say Eden Park, you really know how to make your customers hate you. Well done".
Sri Lankan fans were ejected early in the first innings, allegedly for smuggling in alcohol and instruments.
But fans say they were unfairly targeted for using drums at the stadium.

"It was just joyful fun-making, what makes a day like the T20 great. The security came it and it kept escalating things," spectator John Holley told ONE News.
"It ends up making the thing a very - dare I say it - beige event."
