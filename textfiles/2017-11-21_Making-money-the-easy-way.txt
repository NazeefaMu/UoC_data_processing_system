Making money the easy way


	



 

This character, a sidekick of a soldier-turned politico, now a purohita, is reportedly diddling money from unsuspecting people by promising them job opportunities in a State sector statutory body. 

 


The guy going about in a vehicle belonging to the statutory body is charging a minimum of Rs.75,000 from each job seeker, they say.


He had once unsuccessfully contested a provincial council election.


Some of the job seekers who had realized that they had been duped have made complaints to the Police. But no action has been taken against the trickster so far, they say.
