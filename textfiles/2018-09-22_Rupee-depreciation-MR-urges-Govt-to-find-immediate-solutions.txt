Rupee depreciation: MR urges Govt. to find immediate solutions


	

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa urged the Government to come up with an immediate solution to address the issue of depreciation of rupee against US Dollar, saying it was the people who are being affected.

Speaking at a special news briefing held at his residence in Colombo, Mr Rajapaksa said the Government should admit its incapability .

“This is a serious issue, which needs serious attention. Even during the wartime and world economic crisis, we managed to keep our economy above the water. In fact, Sri Lanka was one of the few Asian countries, which remained unaffected by the economic crisis. We invite the Government to come to terms with its incapability and find solutions to the depreciation of rupee without pointing fingers at us,” he said.

Meanwhile, MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Government should immediately resign and handover the country to the Joint Opposition led by former president Rajapaksa.

“We are ready to rule the country. We have already shown how to manage the economy. Its unfortunate that neither the President nor the Prime Minister can contain the fiscal mismanagement,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
