Initially, the PNB recovered 249 grammes of heroin that had been in the possession of the suspects while another 2.3 kgs of heroin was found in a house located at Korathota in Kaduwela that had been hidden by the suspects.

The suspects, residents of Dematagoda and Kaduwela, were detained for seven days after being produced before the Kaduwela Magistrate. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
