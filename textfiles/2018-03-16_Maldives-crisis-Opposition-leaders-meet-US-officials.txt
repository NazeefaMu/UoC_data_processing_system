HINDUSTAN TIMES, 16th MARCH, 2018-Opposition leaders from Maldives met US government officials in Washington on Thursday and urged them to act “urgently” to prevent the crisis in the island-nation from turning it into a threat to security in the Indian Ocean and from “reversing” the geopolitical reality in the region. They also discussed the growing influence of the Islamic State in the country — and the fear of it becoming a “breeding ground” for recruits — to seek immediate action. The state department confirmed its officials met former Maldivian foreign minister Ahmed Naseem, who is leading the delegation, on Thursday. “They exchanged perspectives on the current situation in Maldives,” a state department spokesperson said, refusing to comment on the specifics of the discussions and calls from the delegation. “The United States continues to call on President Yameen to end the state of emergency, uphold the rule of law, permit the full and proper functioning of the Parliament, and restore the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the people of Maldives,” the spokesperson said in a statement to Hindustan Times.
