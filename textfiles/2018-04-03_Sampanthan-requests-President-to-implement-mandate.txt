Ahead of the no confidence motion, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R. Sampanthan called on President Maithripala Sirisena today and stressed that the government should implement the mandate given at the Presidential Election on January 8, 2015.

Mr. Sampanthan told Daily Mirror that the TNA could not take a final decision on the no-confidence motion, and it would be done tomorrow.

“I informed the President about it,” he said.

Asked whether it means the present set-up of the government should continue, he said it was not for him to decide it.

However, he said the TNA wanted stability in the country to resolve issues such as economic and democratic matters and the ‘national question’. (Kelum Bandara)
