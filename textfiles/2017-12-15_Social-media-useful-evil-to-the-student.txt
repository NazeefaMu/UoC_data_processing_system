But the social media like over other thing has benefits and down side social media addiction. Addiction is very harmful to students. Students prefer to chat with friends for hours, and this leads to a waste of time which could have used for studying, playing or learning new skills. Many people specially the students feel lonely as a result of social media. They are unable to depend on their original thoughts thinking that the views of others have more value than theirs. Youths are very daring and will try to imitate everything they see on these social networks. The result is dangerous and might bring out unacceptable habits and practices to use drugs.
