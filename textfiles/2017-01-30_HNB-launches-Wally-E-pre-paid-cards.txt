Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB), Sri Lanka’s most innovative bank, announced the launch of Wally-E, the country’s very first pre-paid Visa card, designed specifically for teenagers. 
Built with the goal of providing an unparalleled level of convenience and peace-of-mind to parents while at the same time teaching children the value of saving and financial responsibility, Wally-E is packed with features and functionality that enable simple tracking and regulating of expenses.
Ideal for children between the ages of 13 and 18 years, Wally-E gives parents the convenience of managing their children’s finances from anywhere and at any time. The system generates automatic SMS notifications every time a purchase is made using a Wally-E card, including details as to how much was spent, where it was spent and what types of purchases were made.
Wally-E cards are issued with identification photos of the user in order to provide an additional layer of security. While the card itself can be used with any point-of-sales (POS) terminal, purchases can only be from a comprehensive selection of pre-approved merchants. Additionally, the Wally-E card also allows parents to make simple and safe payments of school fees and other similar payments.
Reloading Wally-E cards has also been designed to be as straightforward as possible. With a minimum payment of just Rs.500 and up to a maximum of Rs.100,000, parents can reload their children’s accounts from any ATM cash deposit machine or through any ATM via debit card in addition to any HNB customer centre or through HNB’s pioneering Home Counter Services. Similarly, registration for a Wally-E account can be carried out at any HNB customer centre or at any of HNB’s dedicated school banking units upon submission of a duly completed application for together with a single passport-sized colour photograph.   
Notably, the launch of Wally-E pre-paid cards also makes HNB most rounded private commercial bank in Sri Lanka with respect to its segment of products catering to minors under the umbrella of HNB Singithi, which also maintains accounts catering to minors within the age groups of new born to five and new born to -12 under HNB Kirikati and HNB Lama, respectively.
