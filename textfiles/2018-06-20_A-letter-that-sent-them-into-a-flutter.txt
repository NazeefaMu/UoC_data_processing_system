A letter that sent them into a flutter


	



 

A document that passed from hand to hand among the Green backbenchers last week left most of them shocked and baffled, they say.

 


The document was a copy of a letter of warning issued to the rebel female Diyawanna member for berating the party leader.


After reading the warning letter, most members had shared the view that there was no sense in being expelled from the party by antagonizing the party leader and some of them had made it a point to lose no time in collecting their ‘monitoring’ appointments from the Ministries concerned. 


However, the rebel duo from Badulla and Ratnapura continue to remain defiant and is determined to carry on their struggle for the democratization of the party come hell or high water, they say.
