Colombo High Court today served Indictments to NFF leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa over the case filed by Bribery Commission for allegedly earning around Rs 75 million by unknown means other than his lawful earnings.

He was granted two sureties of Rs. 500,000 and the case was fixed for January 19.

The Bribery Commission filed indictments in the Colombo High Court against Weerawansa in November last year.

The Commission had indicted Weerawansa on 26 charges for earning Rs 75 million from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014 by unlawful and illegal means. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
