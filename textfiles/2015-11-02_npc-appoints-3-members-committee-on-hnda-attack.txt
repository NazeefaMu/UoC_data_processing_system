	A three-member committee comprising senior administrative service officers has been appointed by the National Police Commission to investigate the attack on the students of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) in Colombo last Thursday.
	NPC Secretary N. Ariyadasa said today the committee would inquire whether a violation of police discipline had taken place during their attack on the students.
	“Based on the initial investigative report, disciplinary action will be taken if the police officers have violated any laws. The commission will make recommendations to the police when facing these kinds of incidents in future,” he said adding that the three-member committee was appointed on the recommendations of the NPC Chairman and that it would act independently.
	Mr. Ariyadasa said a broader inquiry would be launched by the committee to find out the cause for the incident.
	The committee members were scheduled to meet yesterday. “We hope the committee would submit their report within two weeks,” he said.
	The NPC summoned acting IGP Pujith Jayasundara, DIG Gamini Mathurata and SSP Champika Siriwardana this morning to discuss what happened.
	When asked whether the DIGs would be summoned again by the commission, the secretary said, “Based on the committee's final report to the NPC, if necessary, IGP N.K. Illangakoon will also be summoned by the NPC when he returns to the country”, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
