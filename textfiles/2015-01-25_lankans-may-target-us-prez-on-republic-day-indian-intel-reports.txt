Indian intelligence agencies have issued alerts to Delhi police and other security agencies saying US President Barack Obama might be targeted by anti-national elements belonging to Sri Lanka or Maldives during his Delhi visit as the chief guest for the Republic Day parade, Hindustan Times reported.
A close watch is being kept on Sri Lankan and Maldivian nationals staying in India, particularly those with longer visa validity or whose visas have expired.
In their alert issued on January 15, intelligence agencies highlighted the possibility that Obama will be shown black flags by some Aam Aadmi Party sympathizers and Hindu Sena members to protest the US President’s visit. Hindu Sena opposed US granting $532 million to Pakistan for checking terrorism and accused US of adopting double standard. Alerts suggest that an AAP’s political advisor from Gujarat has been mobilising people to show black flags to the US President.
Besides Delhi, Obama might face a similar attack or protests during his trip to Uttar Pradesh’s Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Obama’s scheduled trip to Agra, however, was cancelled on Saturday as he will cut short his India visit to travel to Riyadh to condole the death of Saudi Arabia’s king Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.
These inputs were shared in a letter sent to Delhi police, UP Police and CISF and they were directed to stay vigilant and keep a close watch on unidentified Sri Lankan and Maldivian nationals.
“Being a high valued target, a high degree of threat is perceived to Obama from radical Islamist outfits like Al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed,” a senior Delhi police officer said. (The Nation Pakistan)
