Have you ever thought about how much your family will really need, should the unforeseen ever happen to you?  Have you made sure their future would be financially secure?  Can you confidently say so?  Not everyone knows how to be smart with their hard-earned money.  
More importantly very few realize the gap between the protection they have and what they ultimately will need or how much this impacts them and their family’s lifestyle if the right protection level is not maintained.  Many, often end up wasting their savings via unwise decisions or just not getting the best out of it. 
Now AIA Insurance has designed a value-packed insurance solution that meets your savings goal while providing you protection in today’s fast-paced environment. AIA SmartBuilder is the smart new insurance option that requires you to pay premiums for only 4 or 6 years to build a fund while providing long-term protection between 10 to 20 years. 
It is an ideal savings plan to build a fund for a special need whatever the life stage you are in right now.  Everyone has aspirations they dream of achieving. This could vary from building a luxurious house or buying a more stylish car to visiting exciting holiday destinations overseas with the family. To fulfill your ambitions in life, you need AIA SmartBuilder.       
AIA SmartBuilder fund will grow on a compounding basis at a yearly guaranteed annual dividend rate during the policy term. What also makes this a really smart option is the fact that you can choose between a sizable regular monthly income and an attractive nest egg, once the fund matures, giving you greater confidence, financial security to face your future. 
In case the unthinkable does happen, it will offer financial security to the policyholder’s near and dear. AIA SmartBuilder pays the life cover immediately to the beneficiary and subsequently, the fund value at maturity.  Customers may also opt for an Accident Benefit Cover for a nominal fee, in which case the life cover is doubled in the event of death due to an accident.
AIA SmartBuilder comes with many other smart benefits.  One is the ability to withdraw up to 15 percent of your fund in case of an emergency.  Another is the ability to top up whenever you get excess funds such as a bonus, fixed deposit earnings or a windfall that you would like to invest wisely. Most importantly, your life cover can be customized and you can opt to get between 4 to 30 times your annual basic premium.   
This is a really smart way to invest excess cash for Sri Lankans living abroad, or even for celebrities and stars who are earning significant amounts now and should wisely invest their earnings, saving for a rainy day. 
Suren Perera, Head of Marketing at AIA Sri Lanka commented “Our extensive and regular research into lifestyles has revealed that nowadays, some people are reluctant to get into long term commitments.  However, they appreciate the need to secure their future and safeguard their dependants. It is for them that we have developed AIA SmartBuilder. It is the ideal way to maintain the right level of financial protection for your family.”
