Several purohitas of the yahapalanaya attended the Blue party’s annual year-end Pirith Pinkama at Kataragama held on December 31 night.
They all looked forward to the attendance of the former Madam at the Pinkama, but she failed to turn up for the religious event. But to their surprise and discomfiture someone they least expected made his appearance at the Pinkama. He was none other than the former strongman. His arrival with a large following sent ripples of hush-hush among his erstwhile loyalists. Meanwhile, a certain purohita from the South warned his colleagues that it was possible that their former boss would put up a show that could go against their present interests. The others took the cue and they all soon faded except one purohita – the one of ‘Appochchi Mala’ fame.
