Demonstrating its excellence at the regional as well as the national level, Asian Alliance Insurance has clinched 10 coveted awards within less than a year in various spheres – including innovation, corporate sustainability, business and brand excellence and human resource management.


The company’s impressive awards tally since November 2015 consists of two regional awards and eight national awards. Of the total 10 awards, six were received in 2016.
Last year, Asian Alliance Insurance clinched the highly prestigious Asia Insurance Award for ‘Innovation of the year’ for its ‘Click2Claim’ innovation. Asia Insurance Award is the region’s only awards ceremony of its kind and its 2015 edition attracted over 400 entries in total. The company was also honoured at the national level with a Gold in the Insurance category and a Silver in the Overall Large Companies category at the 2015 National Business Excellence Awards, which rewarded excellence in business and contribution to the economic progress of the country. A Bronze award was also won by the company in the Service category at Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) Brand Excellence Awards 2015. 


Continuing this winning streak, in 2016, Asian Alliance clinched four awards at Insurance Industry Awards of Sri Lanka 2016, emerging as the highest awards winner at the ceremony. These awards were for ‘Excellence in Agency Distribution’ and ‘Excellence in Growth’ in Life Insurance, ‘Technology Innovation’ in General Insurance and ‘Excellence in Growth’ in Motor Insurance. For its contribution towards empowering underprivileged youth, Asian Alliance Insurance was recognized as a winner in the ‘Social Empowerment’ category at the prestigious Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship Awards (AREA) 2016. It was also honoured among the country’s top 25 workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute. 


“These coveted awards, which recognize Asian Alliance Insurance’s diverse strengths, also serve as strong and independent endorsements of our business strategy,” Asian Alliance Insurance PLC Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said. “Asian Alliance will continue to strive for excellence in all spheres of business performance – especially via technological innovation and human 
resource development.”  


Besides these accolades, Asian Alliance Insurance Head of Marketing Nuwan Widyapathige was recently honoured as one of the Top 50 Marketers in Asia by Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Asia at its seventh edition held in Singapore, thereby becoming one of the only two Sri Lankans to be honoured at the awards in 2016. In addition, Asian Alliance was also recently recognized by the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) Agents’ Association of Sri Lanka (AASL) for contribution to its members.
