Sri Lanka’s only natural flip-flop brand, Waves, opened its very first concept store at Colombo’s latest premium shopping destination, Marino Mall – Colombo 3. 

The brand which brought flip-flops back to fashion, has carved a name for its trendy and colorful footwear. Not limiting to it, Waves has now added fashionable beachwear and unique beach accessories to their range of categories. Beach dates become much better with the new products which include Swim shorts and skinnies for ladies and men, jewelry, shawls, sunglasses, beach bags, beach spikers and inflatable floating holders. Styling up one’s beach attire from tip to toe could not get more exciting and creative with the numerous patterns, colours and accessories available at Waves. 

The Make your Waves corner allows customers to create their own flip-flops, to highlight their unique personality. A variety of soles and straps are available to choose from, which one can mix and match to suit one’s taste.

The Waves concept store is open from 10 am to 8 pm at the Marino Mall – 590 Galle Road, Colombo 3.
