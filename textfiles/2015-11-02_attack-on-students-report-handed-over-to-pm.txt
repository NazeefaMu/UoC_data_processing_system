The government is to decide on its future course of action in respect of the incident after studying the two reports, sources said.
The prime minister had told the government MPs that firm action would be taken against those responsible for the attack, irrespective of their rank, if they were found to have used excessive force against the demonstrating students.
The MPs had requested the premier to investigate whether an attempt had been made to discredit the government by attacking the students.
