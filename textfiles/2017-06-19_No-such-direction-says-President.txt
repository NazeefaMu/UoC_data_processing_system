No such direction, says President


	

With reference to today's Daily Mirror page one story titled ‘President gives WP CM 3 days to clean up City’, President Maithripala Sirisena said he had not made such a direction.

The President had also told our sister paper Lankadeepa yesterday that he never mentioned anything related to the removal of the Chief Minister from the post.
