Reinforcing its commitment to environmental sustainability and technological innovation, Hatton National Bank (HNB) has concluded a highly successful awareness campaign which encouraged its customers to switch from paper statement accounts to e-statement accounts.
Titled ‘Change Your Address and Win’, this campaign was a milestone in HNB’s long running environmental sustainability drive and its positioning as the ‘Bank of the Future’. 
As paper product manufacturing contributes significantly to deforestation and produces greenhouse gases, there are numerous benefits to the environment from the use of e-statements.
From a customer point of view, this campaign was an example of HNB’s endeavour to boost the adoption of the latest technology among its customers in order to offer them superior service standards.
The three-month long campaign culminated in a draw which rewarded customers who had supported this initiative by opting for e-statements. 
The first prize, a Curved LED TV, went to Shakira Mubeena Begum Mohamed of HNB Emirates Customer Centre and the second prize of a family tour to Singapore was won by Mohomed Lafeer Fathima Sasmiya of HNB Islamic Banking Unit. 
The third prize of 3 Apple iPhone 6 phones were given to Anandarajah Ravindrarajah of HNB Trincomalee, Dandaniyage Dhammika of HNB Ginigathhena and R A Manjula Lakmini Perera of HNB Mount Lavinia. 
Commenting on this, Janaka Epasinghe, Head of Process Improvement and Change Management of HNB stated: “As Sri Lanka makes rapid strides in the digital space, we at HNB are committed to being a key participant on this journey. Conversion of paper statements to e statements is an initiative which is merely one step in the right direction which will result in speedier and more convenient access to information for customers and would have a positive impact on the country’s eco system.”
HNB e-statements are now available for both individual and corporate accounts, including savings accounts, credit cards, current accounts and NRFC and RFC accounts. 
Once an account has been converted, the customer will receive the month’s e-statement on the first day of the following month via email, instead of the traditional mail-based paper statement. 
Furthermore, customers benefit from a lack of postal delay, ease of use, the added security offered by an email or computer password and the elimination of the need to regularly update a savings account passbook. 
They also have the freedom to choose which of their accounts to convert to e-statements, with the option of reverting to paper statements at any tme.
