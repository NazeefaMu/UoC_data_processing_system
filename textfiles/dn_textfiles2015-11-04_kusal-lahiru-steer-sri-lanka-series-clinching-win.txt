Kusal, Lahiru steer Sri Lanka to series-clinching win

Flamboyant opener Kusal Perera missed out on a well-deserved century by one run but coupled with a cultured unbeaten half-century from vice-captain Lahiru Thirimanne it was enough to propel Sri Lanka to a series clinching eight-wicket win over West Indies in the second one-day international played under lights at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka chasing a revised target of 225 under the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule completed the win with nine balls to spare to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
If Sunday's run chase proved to be nerve-wracking - Sri Lanka winning by one wicket, yesterday's victory was convincing with the top order ensuring they finished the match off without allowing it to drag on.
Thirimanne who made the winning hit - a push to mid-on for a single was unbeaten on 81 scored off 95 balls with five fours and a six and Dinesh Chandimal was on 16 not out.
Man of the Match Perera dominated a 156-run stand with Thirimanne that really took the wind out of the West Indies sails, Despite Perera's dismissal for 99 scored off 92 balls (4 sixes, 6 fours) the final result was a foregone conclusion.
West Indies who chose to bat first after winning the toss apparently overlooked the dew factor for they were greatly handicapped by a wet ball due to the dew on the field making it slippery in the bowlers' hands. It was also not easy on the fielders to field the ball cleanly.
Sunil Narine who caused havoc in the first ODI with three wickets in one over struck immediately as he was brought on in the fifth over surprisingly Dilshan (17) with his first delivery that swung more than spun to take his off bail. Dilshan together with Perera had set the tone for the innings posting 40 off 25 balls for the first wicket.
The usually flashy Perera played a refined knock but it didn't stop him from reaching his half-century with a six over midwicket off Brathwaite and following it up with another six off a free-hit courtesy of the bowler sending down a high full toss.
Lasith Malinga gave Sri Lanka the early breakthrough with the wicket of Andre Fletcher for a duck and when Sachitra Senanayake picked up a wicket with his first ball getting rid of Jermaine Blackwood who tried to take him on but only succeeded in holing out to Siriwardana at long-on, West Indies had lost two wickets for 29 in the fifth over.
The innings was revived by Johnson Charles and Darren Bravo who associated themselves in a partnership that produced 70 runs in as many balls.
Siriwardana who has the knack of breaking partnerships did just that when everything was going well for West Indies. He had Bravo caught on the pull shot by Dilshan at midwicket for 21 and then removed the ominous looking Charles for 83 trapping him lbw.
During his 70-ball stay at the wicket Charles slammed four sixes and seven fours and his presence in the middle saw the West Indies maintain a healthy run rate of six an over.
With the match being played on the same strip as the first ODI on Sunday, spinners came into play in a big way. Before rain caused an interruption to the West Indies at 149-4 in the 27th over, Sri Lanka already had five spinners in action bowling a total of 19 overs.
The game when it resumed after a three and a quarter hour break for rain took a bizarre turn with West Indies perched nicely at 211-6 losing their last four wickets for three runs - all to run outs.
The dismissal of acting skipper Marlon Samuels for a well struck 63 off 61 balls (2 sixes, 4 fours) - his best innings on the tour sparked off the run out mania from which the West Indies failed to extract themselves out of and eventually fell short of utilizing their full quota of overs. Taylor, Brathwaite and Narine all followed the same pattern as their captain needlessly throwing away their wickets to poor judgements.
The third match of the series which is now a dead rubber will take place at Pallekele on November 7.
