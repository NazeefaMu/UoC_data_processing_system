He had the guts to say, ‘no’, but now he has to go!


	



 

There is a card that every citizen above the age of 18 in the country should possess. Plans are afoot now to issue an electronic card in place of the card now in use. 

 


Tenders were called and the head of the department responsible for carrying out this task awarded the contract to produce some 15 million e-cards to the lowest bidder, a reliable one to boot.


Meanwhile, an elderly gent who introduced himself as the advisor to a prominent purohita – not the purohita in charge of the subject – told the departmental head to follow the instructions of his purohita in regard to the production of e-cards. 


The departmental head had put his foot down and told the elderly advisor that he was not prepared to take instructions from his purohita and he would strictly adhere to the correct procedure in carrying out his responsibility.


The interfering purohita had turned livid with anger when he heard the curt reply given by the departmental head. And he had taken immediate action to transfer the ‘disobedient’ departmental head to the ‘pool’ as punishment, they say.
