UPFA MP and former Deputy Minister Sudarshini Fernandopulle is to be nominated to the Deputy Speaker’s post, sources close to the MP said today.

Informed sources said many in the UPFA had welcomed this move.

Former Deputy Speaker Tilanga Sumathiapla earlier claimed that President Maithripala Sirisena had wanted him to take over the post once again while there was also a report which said UPFA MP Angajan Ramanathan will be nominated to the post.

Ms. Fernandopulle would be the first women Deputy Speaker in the Parliamentary history of Sri Lanka in the event she is appointed to the post. (Yohan Perera)
