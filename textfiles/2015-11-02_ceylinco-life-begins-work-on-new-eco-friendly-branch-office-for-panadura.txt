Ceylinco Life has commenced construction of another key branch building to a new eco-friendly model adopted by the life insurance leader as part of its commitment to Green its operations.
The new branch in Panadura is to be a custom-designed edifice of three floors, providing 7,000 square feet of space for the use of staff from the existing branch, the company said.
As is the case with all-new branch buildings being constructed on company-owned land, the new Ceylinco Life Panadura branch at No: 400, Galle Road, Panadura, will run on solar power and have energy-efficient air conditioning, lighting systems and an elevator, and a rainwater harvesting facility.
The building will have ample parking for customers and a conference hall for meetings and training sessions.  
The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the company’s Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan. 
Similar branch buildings designed to use renewable energy and water are nearing completion in Wennappuwa and Trincomalee, while construction of another branch in Horana will begin in late November, the company said.
In August this year, Ceylinco Life opened an eco-friendly, four-storey branch office on company owned land in Bandarawela. The company already owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia.
Ceylinco Life operates the largest network of 250 branches in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every one of the island’s 25 districts.
The market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has more than a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
