The Inter-University Students Federation and University Students' Union of Jayewardenepura University launched a massive protest today over an incident that had taken place on Saturday night where a thief had allegedly entered a girls’ hostel.

Sources said this most unpleasant incident took place at a girls’ hostel of the Jayewardenepura University Arts Faculty, which was occupied by sophomores.

Meanwhile, University Students’ Union President Prabath Chaturanga said a thief had entered the girls’ hostel, a four storey building occupied by more than 300 students, on Saturday and stolen eight mobile phones.

“The thief had entered the hostel which is located outside the University premises through the broken doors and windows that did not have latches. However, when a girl who was disturbed by her sleep suddenly woke up in the middle of the night and noticed him, he had immediately resorted to escape,” he said adding that the only female security officer who was on duty that day failed to catch him because she had been in deep sleep.

He claimed that they were protesting in order to urge the relevant authorities to ensure the security of the female students by taking necessary actions. Sources said the students of the university lodged a complaint with the police regarding this issue.

However, it is reported that no girl was harassed or injured by the thief. (Piyumi Fonseka)
