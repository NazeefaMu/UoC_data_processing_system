Former President Mahinda Rajapksa’s son Yoshitha arrived at the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) a short while ago to give a statement in connection with an ongoing investigation.

He had been summoned before the FCID on September 12 but his lawyers had informed it that Yoshitha was unable to turn up on that day due to a personal reason and sought another date.

He was asked to appear before the FCID in connection with the purchase of a land and house located in Mihindu Mawatha in Mount Lavinia and another land in Ratmalana.
