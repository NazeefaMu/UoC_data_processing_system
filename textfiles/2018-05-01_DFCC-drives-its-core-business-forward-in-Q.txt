The Bank recorded a growth of 17% in total operating income amounting to LKR 4,093 million for the quarter ended 31 March 2018 compared to LKR 3,503 in the comparative period in 2017.

The Bank’s NPL ratio increased to 3.12% as at March 2018 from 2.77% recorded in December 2017 as a result of adverse environmental conditions in the operating environment. The industry NPL ratio also recorded an upward trend. 

The Bank has strengthened processes whereby close follow up measures are taken to arrest defaults at an early stage and all efforts are made to swiftly recover loans in default.  

The Bank achieved a notable growth in its core business operations during the quarter under review. During the current period, net interest income grew by 29% to LKR 3,342 million from LKR 2,581 million in the 1st quarter of 2017 while net fee and commission income grew by 27% to LKR 434 million from LKR 343 million in the comparable period. Interest margin improved to 4.0% during the quarter under review from 3.6% in the comparable period. 

Operating expenses increased from LKR 1,343 million to LKR 1,579 million (18%) in the comparable period due to branch expansion and business promotions that were carried out during the first quarter 2018. Bank added 10 fully fledged branches during the period April 2017 to March 2018 and continued its drive to expand its franchise through business promotions, which helped to increase income streams.  

Other comprehensive income before tax improved by LKR 1,475 million (86%) over the previous period. Mark to market impact on investment in equity securities under available for sales investment has improved by LKR 1,771 Million year on year while mark to market impact on fixed income securities declined by LKR 296 million. 

Financial Position

Total assets of the Bank grew by LKR 67,236 million year on year which reflects a 24% growth compared to March 2017. The growth in total assets from December 2017 was LKR 18,393 Million (6%).

Continuing the growth strategy, Bank’s Loans to and receivables from other customers (Loans and advances) grew by LKR 35,475 million to LKR 222,588 million compared to LKR 187,113 million as at 31 March 2017 reflecting a growth of 19%.

The Bank’s low cost deposits (CASA) ratio was 19.6% compared to 21.3% as at 31 December 2017. 

This is a result of an increased growth in time deposits versus savings which is reflected in the first quarter. With the impending promotional campaigns planned to mobilise low cost deposits this position will be corrected in the coming months.

The Bank continues to enjoy long term concessionary credit lines which improves the ratio to 28.4% as at 31 March 2018.

The Bank has successfully issued BASEL III compliant Tier II listed rated unsecured subordinated redeemable debenture of LKR 7 billion (oversubscribed on opening day) in order to sustain the planned lending growth and to maintain stable Basel III compliant ratio.
