Vista Rooms, an online accommodation aggregator with an aim to provide comfortable, standardized stays, has partnered with Mastercard to offer its guests a 20 percent discount. 


Mastercard cardholders will enjoy this discount on any stay at a Vista Rooms partner property from August 1 to November 30 on bookings made by October 31. 


“We are always looking for new synergies and partnerships that can add value to our guests. And this latest partnership with Mastercard does just that. We are excited about this promotion and fully expect our guests to take advantage of it,” said Vista Rooms Co-Founder Amit Damani.
Primarily targeting the affordable accommodation segment Vista Rooms has built an impressive network of over 200 properties across 25 cities in Sri Lanka. These properties include boutique hotels, guesthouses, service apartments, villas and homestays.


Identifying the need to renew trust in the segment Vista Rooms works closely with its partners to provide guests with a consistent experience. Properties are also periodically audited to ensure that standards are maintained.


“At Mastercard we have worked with strategic partners to promote Sri Lanka as a preferred destination across multiple markets. This latest promotion with Vista Rooms is in line with this goal and also allows our cardholders to explore the hidden secrets of this beautiful island nation and form lasting memories while saving on the experience,” said Mastercard Country Manager Sri Lanka and the Maldives R.B. Santosh Kumar.


Vista Rooms follows an asset and people-light model and looks to venture into five countries by the end of 2016. The rapid growth in Sri Lanka is an apt testimonial to Vista Rooms’ aggressive growth plans. Catering to a large, untapped demand segment the online start-up believes that the application of modern technology, standardized experiences and stellar customer service will uplift the segment and create greater demand.
