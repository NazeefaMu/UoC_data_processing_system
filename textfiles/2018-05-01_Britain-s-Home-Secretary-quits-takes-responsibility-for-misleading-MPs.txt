Britain’s Home Secretary quits takes responsibility for misleading MPs


	



 

British Home Secretary Amber Rudd, finally bowed to massive pressure last night and quit saying she had to ‘take responsibility’ for misleading parliament over deportation targets for illegal migrants.   
With no sign of the scandal blowing over, the Home Secretary decided to fall on her sword rather than facing more humiliation.   


‘I feel it is necessary to do so because I inadvertently misled the Home Affairs Select Committee,’ she said - admitting she ‘should have been aware’ the targets existed.   


The dramatic departure will be a huge blow for Theresa May - and potentially leaves her personally vulnerable. Ms Rudd has acted as an lightning rod for her predecessor in the Home Office amid the outcry over the Windrush immigration debacle.   


It appears that Ms Rudd took the decision to quit herself, despite Downing Street previously trying to prop her up. She telephoned the PM to inform her of the move late on Sunday.  In her response to Ms Rudd, Mrs May said she was ‘very sorry’ to receive the resignation. The premier said she still believed Ms Rudd had answered questions from MPs in ‘good faith’.   


Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said: ‘I see Amber Rudd is carrying the can for the person originally responsible for this scandal - Theresa May.’  The timing of the resignation took Westminster by surprise. There was intense speculation that Ms Rudd might go on Friday night after the emergence of a leaked Home Office memo that had been copied to the minister.
