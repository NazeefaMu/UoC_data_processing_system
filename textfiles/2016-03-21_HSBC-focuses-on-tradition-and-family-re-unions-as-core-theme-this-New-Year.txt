As the Sinhala and Tamil New Year approaches, HSBC prepares to celebrate this auspicious season with customers, by offering a plethora of savings across many categories and facilitating family re-unions through its #Star tsToday campaign.

Throughout the season, HSBC customers will be able to enjoy holiday savings with up to 50 percent discounts on local and overseas holidays, dining, shopping, household electronics, supermarket, jewellery and accessories with extended offers on smartphones and telco appliances, salons and spas, gyms, health and vehicle insurance.

Avurudu ushers in festivities that last for weeks and hosting family and friends at home is a necessity. Stocking up on daily essentials and grocery items has been made convenient and affordable with weekly deals on a range of products at Keells Supermarkets, offering shoppers special discounts on their purchases and making Keells Supermarkets a one stop shop for the Avurudu season. Shopping for new clothes to celebrate the New Year is habitual, while gift giving is a customary element that can become tedious. HSBC cardholders get to bag in big discounts with upto 30% savings on clothing at a range of retail stores around the country. Ushering in the New Year is an exciting time as household preparations get underway in advance to mark a new beginning with the purchase of new items.

This has been made easy and affordable with special discounts and 20 months 0% installment plans on electronics and electrical appliances through HSBC’s exclusive tie-up with Abans, until 30 April. Adding to the benefits already offered, HSBC Visa Signature, Visa Advance, Visa Platinum and Visa Gold credit cardholders will also be able to qualify for a seasonal wipe a-thon with a minimum spend of rupees 50,000.

The seasonal wipe a-thon will surprise 100 lucky customers, who will each get 50 percent wiped out of their shopping bill during the promotion period from 14-31 March 2016. Beginning April HSBC customers and their family will be in for an unforgettable experience, where tradition will meet modernism through the introduction of the very first digital Avurudu zone at the Majestic City in Colombo.

Customers will be able to engage in playing traditional Avurudu games and competitions which are equally unique in nature, with the use of virtual reality. The New Year is the season to spend some quality time with your family.

Hence, HSBC customers can take advantage of the holiday season and decide on where they would like to spend their next holiday with family by choosing from across 40 local holiday destinations that cover every sphere of the country. Nilantha Bastian, Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, stated, “The Sinhala and Tamil New Year is rich in culture and tradition and it has always been celebrated with family and friends.

It’s a time of coming together and strengthening family ties. We wanted to build on this tradition and infuse a bit of modernism through the introduction of the first Tech - Avurudu Zone, at Majestic City, where customers could participate in an exciting array of games and activities which are unique to Avurudu. Our hope is to make this a memorable and enjoyable season for all our cardholders and hope they will truly benefit from the wide range of savings as they endeavor to make family
