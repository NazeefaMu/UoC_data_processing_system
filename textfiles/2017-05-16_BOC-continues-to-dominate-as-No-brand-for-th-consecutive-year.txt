Sri Lanka’s No.1 bank yet again reinstates itself as the No.1 brand in Sri Lanka for the 9th consecutive year according to the latest Brand Finance Sri Lanka’s records published on ‘Brands Annual’ by Media Services. 
The Sri Lankan partner of Brand Finance UK which is a leading body which has a global network in 17 countries, Brand Finance Lanka revealed BOC brand as the No.1 brand with the value standing at Rs.40. billion. 
Empowering Sri Lankans to realize their life goals through affordable yet best-in-class banking solutions, in its steadfast journey of over 77 years, the Bank of Ceylon has always gone that extra mile to add value to Sri Lankan banking industry. 
With the pledge to commit as ‘Banker’s to the Nation’ since its inception the bank has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide the financial assistance they require. 
The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn PBT of Rs.25.3 billion for 2015 and PBT Rs.31.2 billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking. 
Two very significant achievements of BOC in recent history were the surpassing Rs. 1 trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. 1 trillion advances in 2016. The bank’s asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country.
“Maintaining our position as the No.1 brand in the country is an achievement like no other. Anyone would agree with me that being the No.1 brand in the country for the 9th consecutive year is an unmatchable achievement. We have done exceptionally well during past years and now we are the only bank that has three trillion in the balance sheet. Our next goal is to enhance the bank’s asset base up to Rs. 2 trillion by 2019-this will surely be another milestone in the Sri Lankan banking industry.”  The Bank’s Chairman, President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera stated. 
“The bank’s approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind BOC brand’s 77 year long success. Since its inception in 1939, Bank of Ceylon’s motive was the same as promoting social and economic development of the country and its people. As such the bank has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with the understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services. A very recent example was the BOC’s digital transformation that completely changed the bank’s internal processes along with its customer interface and infused synergy to the whole Sri Lankan banking system. Along with the benefits of digital transformation BOC was able to embark on Green Banking comprehensively for a sustainable growth together with the community,” stated D.M. Gunasekera, General Manager Bank of Ceylon.
