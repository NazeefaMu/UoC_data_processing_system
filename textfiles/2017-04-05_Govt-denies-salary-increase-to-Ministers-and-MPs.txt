Govt. denies salary increase to Ministers and MPs


	

The government today denied any move to increase the salaries of ministers and MPs in the guise of increasing salaries of Supreme Court and Appeal Court judges.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and State Minister of Highways Dilan Perera informed the House last evening.

Mr. Rajapaka said the salaries of judges are increased under Section 108(1) of the Constitution whereas salaries of MPs have to be increased under Section 68(1) of the Constitution.

However, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said it is natural for anyone to suspect that salaries of MPs would be increased when salaries of judges are increased as both are considered equal when it comes to remuneration. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
