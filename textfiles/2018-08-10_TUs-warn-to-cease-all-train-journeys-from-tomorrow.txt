All train journeys, which commenced today during the ongoing strike, would also be ceased from tomorrow, the Locomotive Engine Operators’ Union (LEOU) today said.

LEOU Secretary Indika Dodangoda told the Daily Mirror that the work stoppage launched by the railway trade unions would be continued further in the absence of a reasonable solution from the authorities concerned.

“We have not been offered with a discussion yet. The sudden strike which was launched on Wednesday will be continued until our salary anomalies and other issues are resolved,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
