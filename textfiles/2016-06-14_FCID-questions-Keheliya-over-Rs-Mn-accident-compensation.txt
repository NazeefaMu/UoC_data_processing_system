FCID questions Keheliya over Rs.20Mn accident compensation


	

Former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella arrived at the FCID this morning after he was summoned in connection with a probe of claiming Rs.20 million from the President’s Fund as compensation for his accident in Australia.

The FCID commenced a probe recently following a statement made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake in Parliament regarding certain allegations involving MP Rambukwella obtaining Rs. 20 million from the President’s Fund following an accident he met with in Australia.

The FCID detectives said they have learnt through the statement recorded from Deputy Minister Ramanayake that the former Minister had claimed and received the compensation from the President’s Fund in 2013 in addition to receiving accident compensation from both the hotel in Melbourne as well as from his personal insurance in Sri Lanka.

Rambukwella met with the accident in early February, 2012 during a private visit to Australia to receive treatment to his son, and sustained injuries to his legs after falling off the third storey balcony of his Melbourne hotel.

The FCID recorded a four hour statement from Deputy Minister Ramanayake on May 31, regarding his statement on MP Rambukwella. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
