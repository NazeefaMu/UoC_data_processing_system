Kim Jong Un arrives in Singapore for historic summit with Trump


	



 

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un landed in Singapore on Sunday ahead of his historic summit with US President Donald Trump, local media reported.   


Kim landed at Singapore Changi Airport at 2.38 pm (0638 GMT) on an Air China flight and was to be taken to the St Regis hotel, where his delegation is expected to stay, Channel NewsAsia reported.   
There was no footage of the leader’s arrival.   


Trump was due to arrive several hours later from Quebec, where he attended the G7 summit with other world leaders.   


The Trump-Kim summit, which will be held at the Capella Hotel on Tuesday morning, will mark the first time a North Korean leader has met with a sitting US president.   


The talks will focus on reaching an agreement on the denuclearisation of North Korea in exchange for the easing of economic and diplomatic sanctions.   


As he departed on Saturday, Trump said he was on a “mission of peace” but also warned that the face-to-face talks were a “one-time shot.”   “I feel confident Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people,” Trump said, adding that “he won’t have this opportunity again.”   


He also insisted he would know within the “first minute” whether North Korea was serious about peace, using “my touch, my feel” to figure out the situation.   


There had been weeks of speculation about whether the meeting between the two leaders would actually happen, after Trump pulled out of the scheduled talks on May 24, citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility” and “tremendous anger”.
