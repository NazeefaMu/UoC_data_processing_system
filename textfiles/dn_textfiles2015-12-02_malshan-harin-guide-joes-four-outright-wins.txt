Malshan, Harin guide Joes to four outright wins

Left-arm leg-spinners Malshan Rodrigo and Harin Cooray have propelled St Joseph's to four outright victories giving them a flying start in the current inter-school cricket season.
The Josephians led by Sandaruwan Rodrigo recorded outright victories over Mahanama, Maris Stella, De Mazenod and Mahinda College, Galle. Their encounter with Royal Panadura was washed off on the second day while the game against D S Senanayake (first innings win) and Thurstan (first innings loss) ended in no-decisions.
St Joseph's are currently heading their respective group in the Singer All-Island Under 19 tournament (Played 5, Won outright 3, Won first innings 1, No decision 1). Royal, Prince of Wales and Zahira are the three remaining tournament games for the Josephians.
All-rounder Malshan Rodrigo has been their star performer to-date claiming 41 wickets in the seven games inclusive of a match bag of 11 for 87 against De Mazenod. Harin Cooray is not far behind claiming 24 wickets in five games inclusive of a match bag of 9/43 against D S Senanayake.
The successful performance of the Josephians this season has been noteworthy since they have been minus some of their key senior players for most of the games.
All-rounder Jehan Daniel who has been part of the Sri Lanka Under 19 team missed out five games while vice-captain Kevin Cortling fractured his right wrist and missed four games. Their second highest wicket taker Harin Cooray was also sidelined for two games. This year the Darley Road school is coached by Asela Pathirana.
