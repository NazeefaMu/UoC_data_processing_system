JO objects to alienation of business institutions


	

The Joint Opposition (JO), yesterday, accused the government of endorsing the alienation of 18 state business institutions to obtain US$ 5.8 billion.

It said Waters Edge, the Grand Oriental Hotel, Litro Gas, Lanka Hospitals, the Hyatt Regency Complex, Hilton Hotel, Hambantota Airport and the Port were among the 18 institutions identified by the Pathfinder Foundation as potential candidates to lure Foreign Direct Investments.

“Alienation is not a practice of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or the United National People’s Alliance (UPFA). We cannot countenance the sale of state entities that would place the fate of future generation at risk,” MP Bandula Gunawardena said at a media briefing.

He said there were some SLFP ministers in the government who were against the alienation of state institutions.

“Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said recently that he was against the Hambantota Port deal on account of some unacceptable conditions. We commend Minister Ranatunga for not giving into peer pressure,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
