If Constitution process stalled, Sampanthan’s Opp. leadership meaningless: Mano


	

If new Constitution process was stalled permanently, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP R. Sampanthan’s holding of Opposition leader’s post would be meaningless, Minister Mano Ganesan said today.

He said in a tweet that the issue between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had put the Constitutional process to back seat.

“Not the issue of the UNP and the SLFP but the new constitution as solution to national issue topped Sampanthan’s priority list. If new Constitution process is stalled permanently, Sampanthan’s holding of Leader of Opposition would be meaningless,” he tweeted.

He said it was sad to notice that the Sinhala nation had failed to understand and respect Sampanthan’s message of ‘dropping Eelam State and coming into Sri Lankan State radius’ by taking up the Leader of Opposition job in the Sri Lankan Parliament.
