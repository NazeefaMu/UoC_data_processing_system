Avoid siding with big powers: China tells small, medium size nations
	
In a white paper which its stance on AsiaPacific Security, China has stressed the need for small and medium-size countries in the region to refrain from siding with big powers.
Outlining China's concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, the white paper explained the Chinese approach to achieving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
The policy package includes the promotion of common development; the building of partnerships; improvement of existing multilateral frameworks; rule-setting; military exchanges; and proper settlement of differences.
Noting the role that major countries in the region play in maintaining peace and development, the white paper urged them to reject the Cold War mentality, respect others' legitimate interests and concerns and to pursue positive interactions.
"Small- and medium-sized countries need not and should not take sides among big countries," the white paper said.
All countries should work toward a new dialogue system instead of confrontation, and pursue partnerships rather than alliances, according to the white paper.
China said it supported the creation of international and regional rules set through discussion with all countries concerned rather than being dictated by any particular country.
Rules of individual countries should not automatically become "international rules," and countries should not be allowed to violate the lawful rights and interests of others under the pretext of rule of law, according to the white paper.
China is prepared to take on greater responsibilities for regional and global security, and provide more public security services to the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, it said.
The white paper said China will increase military exchanges and cooperation, which would support peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. China will build a strong national defense force that is commensurate with China's international standing.
"Its security and development interests is a strategic task in China's modernization drive, and provides a strong guarantee for its peaceful development. China's armed forces support the country's development and contribute to the maintenance of world peace and regional stability," the white paper said.
China remains committed to resolving disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation and upholding peace and stability as well as freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, the white paper said. (KB)

Be prepared; difficult times ahead
	
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa today warned of an imminent food shortage, power and energy crisis and a scarcity of water for agriculture by March this year because Sri Lanka will not have any significant rain until mid March.
However, he told reporters that the government would take all possible measures to mitigate the effects of bad weather and appealed to the people to use water and power sparingly.
The government has decided to import 250,000 metric tons of rice to offset any possible food shortage. We will do our best to soften the impact of the prolonged drought. The Irrigation Department has already curtailed the supply of water for agricultural purposes in certain areas so as to provide drinking water. Our main concern is the welfare of the people, the minister told a news conference held at the Information Department.
When asked by a journalist, he said deforestation could not be named as the direct cause for the dry spell and added Sri Lankas forest cover still remains at around 23%.
With regard to the payment of compensation to those affected by the Salawa explosion, the floods in Kegalle and the landslide, the minister said a plantation company had agreed to release 350 acres of land to build houses for those displaced by floods and landslides in Aranayaka.
He said the government would pay Rs.400,000 on a staggered basis for 20 perches of land to those who have found a safe location to build their homes. (SAJ)

## Title: Benefits of Coconut water- The natural Jeewani

Benefits of Coconut water- The natural Jeewani
	

In a rapidly modernizing world where processed food and fizzy drinks have been conveniently given priority, it is essential to reflect on ones state of health. Sri Lanka being a tropical island has much to offer where natural products are concerned. Amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life, we need to look into natures healing products. Thambili (king coconut) is a travellers energy booster and thirst quencher. It is said that tender coconut water is more refreshing and tastier than mature coconut water. Coconut milk, which is an integral part of Sri Lankan cuisine, is obtained from the mature coconut pulp. However, the coconut water found hidden inside the shell is often discarded, though it offers a wide range of health benefits. Mirror Medicine spoke to Dr. Damayanthi Perera (Ph D- Human Nutrition, Uni. London), a Nutrition, Dietetics and Lifestyle Specialist on the benefits of drinking coconut water. 

QWhat are the constituents of coconut water
When you say coconut water, I assume you are referring to tender, green coconut water (TGCW) that comes from immature green coconuts. Firstly, I wish to explain that there are different types of coconut water. Differences can arise due to a number of factors, including the variety of the coconut plant and the maturity of the nut. The main constituents of tender coconut water (TCW), whether it comes from the green-skinned or the orange-skinned coconuts (king coconut) are water, easily digestible carbohydrates in the form of sugars and electrolytes. Sugar content varies according to the maturity of the nut. Tender coconut water has more sugar than what is found in mature nuts (i.e. water that comes from the coconuts used for cooking) but it is far less than what is found in aerated water and processed fruit juices. 
Potassium and sodium are two important electrolytes present in human serum (serum is a fraction of the blood). In general these minerals are called serum electrolytes. In the human body, these electrolytes have specific functions and are maintained within certain limits. In coconut water, potassium is found in a much higher concentration than sodium or in other words, these two electrolytes (coconut electrolytes) have a healthy balance. 
Coconut water also provides other key minerals such as calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium and phosphorous. Coconut water also contains vitamin C and some vitamins of the B-complex such as thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate and vitamin B-6. 
QWhat are the benefits of drinking coconut water
Firstly, coconut water is a healthy, refreshing beverage that can be used in place of unhealthy, high sugar and chemically based, aerated soft drinks such as Cola and other beverages. It is also far better than highly processed fruit juices. In hot and humid climates it is common to lose body water and electrolytes through perspiration. Therefore, tender coconut water is an ideal beverage in a country like Sri Lanka.

Sportsmen/women lose more water and electrolytes than sedentary people. Tender coconut water has much less sugar than most sports drinks and also less sugar than fruit juices. Tender coconut water is an ideal hydrating beverage. As a result, it has become a favourite sports drink in Western countries and dubbed Mother Natures Sports Drink.
Coconut water is also very beneficial to those suffering from diarrhoea or vomiting. Both these conditions lead to the loss of body water and electrolytes. Tender coconut water is Natural Jeewanee that provides natural hydration (Jeewanee is the commercially manufactured oral rehydrating fluid used in Sri Lanka). TCW also helps to rehydrate after a hangover and claimed to be beneficial for a host of ailments including cancer and kidney stones. 
It is now known that potassium-rich foods help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Banana is a fruit rich in potassium. However, coconut water has a much higher content of potassium compared to bananas which have a lower content of sugars (carbohydrates). 

QWhat is better- king coconut water or green coconut water
There is a traditional belief that tender king coconut water is better than green coconut water. In Sri Lanka we have a long way to go in relation to food, nutrition and health research. I say so because though many talk about Food and Nutrition and we have a Ministry of Health and Nutrition, we do not even have a National Food Composition Table! Without having local analytical data, it is not possible to give an exact answer to this question. 
There is growing international demand for coconut water, virgin coconut oil and other coconut products but there is little or no research into these products. Relevant authorities should conduct research into these products. Prior to that, it is important to collect and collate the available local and global data. 
QAre there any negative effects of drinking coconut water
There is no cholesterol in coconut water or any food or oil of plant origin. Drinking 1-2 glasses of coconut water per day with a healthy diet will not lead to any negative health effects. However for those with kidney failure, coconut water or any food containing high potassium is not recommended.

Draft proposals in 2000: No clause for two-year extension of tenure: CBK
	
Former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaranatunga responded to Cabinet spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne saying she made no attempt to extend her term of office by two more years through the constitutional proposals presented to Parliament in 2000.
The following is her statement issued to Daily Mirror: "I am surprised to see a statement made by Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne about the 2000 draft Constitution formulated by my Government, where he states the UNP opposed it and did not give the seven votes required for a 2/3rd majority in Parliament, because G.L. Peiris sneaked in a clause to extend my term by two years.
"This is completely false. The Draft Constitution said no such thing. However, it contained a specific clause to abolish the Executive Presidency entirely. Our draft constitution stated that the Executive Presidency would come to an end at the end of my second term which is 2005.
"However, because the UNP was not very keen on that I suggested that the Executive Presidency would end one year after the constitution is adopted. This would have meant that I would have ended my second term by August 2001, instead of December 2005.
"Regrettably the UNP was not willing to discuss my proposal about the abolition of the Executive Presidency. Hon. Karu Jayasuriya confirmed these facts and Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne who was the secretary to the constitution-drafting committee mentions all this in his book relevant to the constitution.
I regret that the Cabinet Spokesman who is a senior politician has not studied the clause on the abolition of the Executive Presidency contained in my Draft Constitution of 2000.

## Title: How dangerous is  Microcephaly

How dangerous is  Microcephaly
	
By Vinuri Weerawardena
The 2016 outbreak of the Zika virus brought the neurological condition Microcephaly to global attention as a significant number of infants whose mothers had contracted the Zika virus were diagnosed with the condition. However, Microcephaly is a condition on its own, even though it has been mainly associated with the Zika virus in the recent past. Microcephaly still remains a major concern worldwide and spreading awareness on its causes, symptoms, prevention and supportive care is of utmost importance. 
Microcephaly (my-kroh-SEF-uh-lee) is considered a rare neurological condition in which an infants head is significantly smaller than the heads of other children of the same age and sex, based on standardized charts. This is usually due to the brain developing abnormally in the womb or not growing as it is supposed to. Microcephaly is often associated with below average mental and cognitive development. This could be congenital or acquired. Many countries including Sri Lanka have no valid data on microcephaly and its causality. Even estimated incidence of microcephaly have wide variation due to the differences in the definition and subjects under study. 
The Daily Mirror approached Dr. Kapila Jayarathne, Consultant Community Physician and National Programme Manager- Maternal & Child Morbidity and Mortality Surveillance (Family Health Bureau- MOH) to determine the details of the disease and its presence in the country. He acknowledged the lack of reliable information regarding the incidence of Microcephaly in Sri Lanka. He went onto say that this neurodevelopmental defect came into light in Sri Lanka with the incidence of the Zika virus and public awareness of its effects during this period. As of now, the Family Health Bureau has established a surveillance system to monitor the incidence of Microcephaly cases. Dr. Jayarathne is pleased to report that there are many prospective studies and collaborations awaiting in the year 2017 that will venture into the study of Microcephaly. One such prospective study will be a series of Microcephaly case studies that will inspect every aspect of the defect, its causes and any unique attributes for Sri Lankans. 
Meanwhile, it is always safe to be equipped with the necessary knowledge and facts about Microcephaly in order to help family, friends and yourself. 
Causes
There are several potential causes of Microcephaly, however as in most neurological conditions, the specific cause varies from individual to individual but often the cause remains unknown. 
The common causes of Microcephaly as identified by Neurologists are; Infections during pregnancy: toxoplasmosis (caused by a parasite found in undercooked meat), rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, HIV and Zika viruses. Exposure to toxic chemicals: Maternal exposure to heavy metals like arsenic and mercury, alcohol, radiation, and smoking. Pre- and perinatal injuries to the developing brain: Hypoxia-ischemia, trauma); Genetic chromosomal abnormalities: Down syndrome, Seckel Syndrome. Malnutrition: Severe malnutrition during fetal life. Craniosynostosis: The premature fusing of the joints (sutures) between the bony plates that form an infants skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis) usually means the infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. If there are no underlying problems in the brain, this surgery allows the brain adequate space to grow and develop. Chromosomal abnormalities: Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly. Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain (cerebral anoxia): Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to the fetal brain.

The common causes of Microcephaly are; Infections during pregnancy: toxoplasmosis (caused by a parasite found in undercooked meat), rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, HIV andZika viruses

Long-term Effects

Life expectancy is usually reduced along with poor brain function in children and adults. However this outcome varies based on the presence of associated conditions. Typically life expectancy is low, limited to about 20 years of age, although this depends on the incidence of the aforementioned related abnormalities. 
How well a child copes depends on what caused the brain to stop growing, causing the condition. Children with a mild form of this disorder may not have any significant problems. They will grow normally during childhood and adolescence and meet age-appropriate growth milestones as they get older. 
Others with more severe Microcephaly will have problems learning and moving. They are more likely to have other medical problems, such as cerebral palsy and epilepsy. 

Methods of Prevention
Pre-natal health is of utmost importance when it comes to tackling the prevention of Microcephaly caused by non-genetic factors, i.e. Acquired Microcephaly. 
Following are a few general guidelines covering basic maternity health concerns. Following the guidelines could reduce the probability of your child being born with acquired microcephaly. Make a healthy diet part of your lifestyle and take prenatal vitamins. Refrain from the consumption of alcohol and the use of drugs. Stay away from chemicals. Maintain cleanliness, wash hands often and get treatment for any illness as soon as you feel sick. If you have pets, make sure to have someone else change the litter box. Animal feces can spread the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. Use mosquito repellent when in wooded areas or countries known for mosquitoes. The CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention- USA) says insect repellent is safe to use while pregnant. 
Make a healthy diet part of your lifestyle.Refrain from the consumption of alcohol and the use of drugs. Stay away from chemicals. Maintain cleanliness and get treatment for any illness as soon as you feel sick



Diagnosis
Microcephaly can be diagnosed during pregnancy or after the baby is born. 
During the pregnancy, diagnosis may be done via means of an ultrasound (which creates pictures of the body). For clear detection during pregnancy, it is advisable to do so through an ultrasound test done in the late 2nd Trimester or early 3rd Trimester. 
After the birth of the child, diagnosis would be done by a medical practitioner. A head CT scan or an MRI along with blood tests will help determine whether or not Microcephaly has been detected in the child.

Is There A Cure
Microcephaly is a life-long condition and may also be life-threatening in some cases. As reiterated throughout the article, it again depends on the severity of this neurodevelopmental condition.
Unfortunately at present, there is no known treatment to ensure that the growth of the head is set on track. However, medical professionals may treat associated conditions and complications arising from microcephaly. 
This kind of treatment will focus on managing the childs condition. Early childhood developmental intervention programmes that include speech, physical and occupational (for development of motor skills) therapies are advised in order ensure the child abilities are strengthened in order to maximize their developmental and intellectual capabilities. Medical practitioners may also recommend medication to control certain complications of Microcephaly such as seizures and hyperactivity.
Early childhood developmental intervention programmes that include speech, physical and occupational therapies are advised


Symptoms

Early detection is always important when it comes to neurodevelopmental conditions, as such detection will enable parents addressing the condition earlier to provide supportive care in order to ensure a comfortable lifestyle for the child. 
The primary sign of Microcephaly is the childs head circumference being significantly smaller than that of other children of the same sex and age. This comparison can be made with the use of standardized growth charts using standardized growth charts. This measurement is compared with other childrens measurements in percentiles. The Sri Lankan growth standards to be used can be found at the WHO site https://www.unicef.org/srilanka/ECDS_report_new%283%29.pdf 
Other basic symptoms that can be observed and identified include: 
Poor appetite/feeding 
Unusually high-pitched crying 
Spasticity (involuntary muscle contractions) 
If the brain stem of the child has been affected, the condition could be more serious because it is the brain that controls vital survival functions such as respiration. 
Therefore, depending on the severity and/or complications of Microcephaly, other symptoms include: Impaired cognitive development, delayed motor functions and speech, facial distortions, dwarfism or short stature, hyperactivity, seizures, difficulties with coordination and balance and other brain or neurological abnormalities.

He said President Maitripala Sirisena's mandate was to carry out changes which did not need a referendum because holding a referendum could be risky given the trend in some other countries where governments had been defeated.
See what happened in Italy, Colombia and Britain where the people did not vote on the question asked but used it as an opportunity to protest against those governments, the state minister said and added that it would be best to avoid a referendum.

'Sun Sea' voyage was a humanitarian service to Tamil migrants
	
Defence lawyers made their final pitch to the jury at a human-smuggling trial yesterday, arguing their clients provided humanitarian assistance to Sri Lankan Tamils fleeing persecution in a country ravaged by civil war, challenging the Crowns view that the accused illegally organized the MV Sun Seas arrival in Canada, the Globe and Mail reported today.
Kunarobinson Christhurajah, Lesly Emmanuel, Nadarajah Mahendran and Thampeernayagam Rajaratnam have each been charged under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act with organizing the cargo ships voyage across the Pacific. The MV Sun Sea docked in B.C. in August, 2010, carrying 492 people  380 men, 63 women and 49 children. The ship was the second Tamil migrant vessel to arrive in the province in less than a year and drew considerable attention.
The trial for the four men began in B.C. Supreme Court in October and closing arguments started Thursday.
Casey Leggett, the lawyer representing Mr. Christhurajah, reminded the jury it heard from 10 Crown witnesses who were aboard the ship. Mr. Leggett said those witnesses described the horrific violence they had endured in Sri Lanka  one man testified his younger sister was killed when their house was hit by a bomb, another said he was tortured by police and others described fleeing to refugee camps or young men being taken away in white vans and never heard from again.
Mr. Leggett said there is no evidence his client profited financially from the voyage. He said Mr. Christhurajah has been accused of helping passengers find accommodation before the trip and handing out food, among other things. However, Mr. Leggett said dozens of people volunteered and did whatever they could to ensure the MV Sun Sea and its passengers safely made it to Canada.
My submission is that there is no evidence from which you could draw the conclusion that my client, Mr. Christhurajah, was not acting for a humanitarian purpose, he said.

UNP tactfully delaying LG polls: CaFFE
	
Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said today the United National Party (UNP) was purposely delaying the Local Government elections by its representative not signing the delimitation committee report.
He said the UNP was adopting this strategy either because it was scared of facing the elections or was not confident enough to do so.
Mr. Tennakoon said the LG elections had been delayed by more than one and half years for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Elections have been held even during the armed conflict and other disturbances. But this time the elections are being delayed in a tactful manner, he told a news conference and added that by delaying the elections the government was blatantly violating good governance principles and the people's mandate.
Referring to the governments plan to lease lands in Hambantota to a Chinese Company, Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed he would inform the people about the agreement and highlighted the fact that the people had a right to know it before it was finalised.
He said one of the main criticisms against the previous government was its lack of transparency and its as the Hambantota Port, the Mattala Airport and Sooriya Wewa stadium were not economically viable. (Ajith Siriwardana)
