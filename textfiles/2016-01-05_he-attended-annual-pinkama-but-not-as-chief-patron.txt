The former strongman had been conducting a year-end Pirith Pinkama in Kataragama for years in a row. However, when he recently contacted the relevant authorities in Kataragama in this regard, they had informed him that there was no possibility for him to conduct this event on December 31 night as usual. 
When he received this unexpected message from the Kataragama authorities, the former boss had asked the messenger: “Have they imposed a ban on my Pinkamas as well…?  Or has the order come from some commission?”
The former boss later received the answer to his question from the official in charge of the responsibility of making arrangements for Pinkamas in Kataragama. “I have got instructions to allow the former madam to conduct the Pirith Pinkama this time round,” was his answer. 
Nevertheless, the former strongman had attended the December 31 Pirith Pinkama in Kataragama saying that after all it was a Pinkama no matter under whose patronage it was to be conducted. 
However, the former madam who was the chief patron of the event had not turned up for the event. The only VIPs present were three yahapalanaya purohitas, they say.
