There was no extra security at Parliamentary premises on Nov. 03 - Speaker

Speaker Karu Jaysuriya yesterday, announced that no extra security was deployed within the Parliamentary premises on Tuesday November 03,
He stated that neither a member nor the public who came to meet the members were subjected to any extra check-ups other than going through the normal procedures.
The Speaker made this announcement in relation to a question raised by opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena on November 03 in Parliament on the extra security deployed.
"I inquired from the acting Inspector General of Police and other relevant authorities on this matter," the Speaker said. "I was told that as they had information that a large section of the university students were preparing to stage protests in Colombo and near the Parliament, extra security was deployed outside the Parliament premises."
The Speaker further stated that he came to know that it was not compulsory to obtain the Speaker's permission to deploy security personnel outside Parliamentary premises. He added that there had been similar situations earlier too. At this stage, the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella stated that the country had a new political culture unlike during the Rajapaksa regime.
"The Police is independent now.
There is an Independent Police Commission now," Minister Kiriella said. "Nobody can order the Police. If that is so, it constitutes an offence."
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that the Police Commission is responsible for the recruitment, promotions and disciplinary actions, etc of the Police. "It does not control Police action, Dissnayake said. "The government is responsible for them."
At this stage, the Speaker stated that he had already made an announcement and should resume the business of the day. Opposition Member Dullas Alahapperuma requested the Speaker to inform the
authorities to make the Speaker aware if extra security is deployed. The Prime Minister stated that he would not speak about the powers of the Police or the Security forces. "But one should consider that two of our parliamentarians had been brutally killed during the last parliament," Premier said. "Our leaders too have been killed by the LTTE."
He also said those assassinations should be considered when statements are made when security is deployed around Parliament.
Chief Opp. Whip demands Black Book be tabled
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, demanded Minister Mangala Samaraweera to table the 'Black Book' prepared before the Presidential Poll in January, enlisting corrupt government officials.
The MP was presenting an adjournment motion on the controversies surrounding the Avant Garde investigations. He observed the 'black book' would expose the names of corrupt government officials on whom there are allegations of misusing colossal amounts of public money.
He charged that some of these officials are still bearing office in high positions under the present Government. Elucidating on a series of large scale corruption charges against the previous Government, Dissanayake accused the present Government of covering up those who were involved in those acts of corruption, fraud and other wrong doings.
"Many of the officials who were involved in corruption and fraud in the past years are holding ministerial and deputy ministerial posts.
Those who are accused of ethanol and drug business are also among them. With them in the government, how could we hope that thieves would be brought to book? This Government continues with the deals of the previous regime.
This is against the people's wish. The people gave a mandate to bring these culprits to book and take over their illegally gotten wealth," he accused.
He went on to state that several ministers intervened to shield the retired Major Nissanka Senathipathi of the Avant Garde Company and that he met the President soon after the January elections. Referring to the Prime Minister's statement on Avant Garde, Dissanayake observed it had contradictory facts and charged that it was false.
Dissanayake said that Minister Vajira Abeywardena facilitated a meeting between Nissanka Senadhipathi and President Maithripala Sirisena on January 10, following the election results.
He further charged that the Prime Minister accompanied a businessman named "Thirukumar Nadeshan" when he went to Temple Trees to meet defeated President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the wee hours of January 9.
He also demanded to know to which court case ex-MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena had agreed to appear as a state witness and in which Magistrate's court he had made that statement.
"The public have a right to know the deal the Government has with the ex-MP. Why is he given MSD security?" he asked.
Following the speech of Dissanayake, Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera, proposed to summon the IGP and Attorney General to Parliament to query on the matters raised.
Don't deport Kumar Gunaratnam - Dinesh
UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, asked the government not to deport Frontline Party Leader Kumar Gunaratnam from Sri Lanka.
Rising to a point of order, MP Gunawardena said that Gunaratnam had been arrested by the Kegalle Police and detained at the Kegalle Police station without an arrest warrant. "I direct the attention of the House to this urgent matter as relevant ministers are also present here.
We got to know that there are attempts to deport him.
He was born in Sri Lanka and is a Sri Lankan citizen.
He has abandoned his Australian citizenship for this purpose.
If he has done anything wrong, he can be dealt with under the laws of our county," he said.
Motion on Avant Garde investigations:
Speaker gives Chief Opp. Whip the nod
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, allowed Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake to move the adjournment motion on the Avant Garde investigations, observing that it did not obstruct the judicial process.
The Speaker made this observation following a point of order raised by the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, that matters raised in the motion could be under subjudice, stating that the Avant Garde matter is presently before the Galle Magistrate's Court.
"The next date of the hearing of this case has been fixed for February 25. Therefore this motion could affect the judicial process," he said. However, MPs Dissanayake and M A Sumanthiran observed that only a 'B' report had been sent to the Magistrate's court, adding that the motion is not a matter of subjudice. They requested the move to allow the motion be granted, it was of great public importance. The Speaker allowed the MP to move the motion, while asking him to be cautious to avoid things that could affect the judicial process.
CC decides implementation of Independent Councils soon
The Constitutional Council which met in Parliament yesterday, had decided to establish the other independent commissions proposed under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution without further delay.
The Council discussed the nominations of members for the independent commissions for which members have not yet been appointed. The council is to finalize them on its next meeting on November 6.
The members for the national police commission, human rights commission, public service commission and commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption, were appointed recently. The members are yet to be appointed to the elections commission, audit commission, finance commission, delimitation commission and the national procurement commission, etc. The council meeting was chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
 
Avant Garde Armoury case:
I stopped former Defence Secy. from being arrested
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stated that he stopped former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa from being arrested in connection with the Avant Garde floating armoury case.
He said in Parliament yesterday that he was in the position that Gotabhaya Rjapaksa should not be arrested in this connection. He added that he brought this matter to the notice of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He also added that they instructed him to act according to the law. He made these observations joining the adjournment debate on the Avant Garde floating armoury moved by Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
"Although some groups and the media had mistakenly published that the Attorney General said there was no evidence to prosecute anyone connected to Avant Garde for committing a crime, it is incorrect." Wijeyadasa Rajapaksh said.
"He said that there was no evidence to file cases under the Firearms Ordinance, the Prevention of Terrorism Act or the Explosives Act."
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the AG has said that there should be more investigations to ascertain whether money laundering charges could be brought against the Company. Hence, that matter had been referred to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The Minister further stated that the members who state that they have no faith in the Attorney General's Department and the Judiciary system again protests against foreign judges who come to inquire into allegations in Sri Lanka.
"It seems that those who speak against the judiciary and the Attorney General's Department, are involving themselves in an attempt to make a situation of anarchy in the country.
