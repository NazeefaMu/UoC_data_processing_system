Kelani river water sent for further lab tests

The water samples obtained after the incident of the Kelani river pollution on August 17, have been sent to the Government Analyst's Department, for further laboratory tests, Urban Development and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
The minister was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2).
The minister noted the National Water Supply and Drainage Board had made a complaint to the Biyagama police station soon after the incident and Biyagama police has filed a case against the Coca Cola Company at the Mahara Magistrate's Court.
The minister further stated that the chemical substance leaked to the Kelani river had been identified as furnace oil as per the reports of laboratory tests conducted by 'Bureau Veritas'.
He added the reports of the tests conducted by SGS company in India had not found '4 - Methylimidazol' chemical in the water samples.
The minister pointed out the Coca Cola Company had paid Rs 131 million to the NWS&DB, Rs 2 million to the Marine Environment Protection Authority and Rs 1.5 million to the Central Environmental Authority as compensation for damages and to recover the expenses incurred by those institutions following the incident.
The minister further observed that the CEA had informed that the Environmental Protection license (EPL) was temporarily restored as the company had satisfied conditions laid down by the CEA, adding that the CEA continues post monitoring on the bottling plant at Biyagama.
He noted the CEA has initiated a programme to monitor the activities of factories situated close to the river. The minister further observed the newspapers blew the issue out of proportion creating unnecessary fear among the public.
He guaranteed the quality of water supplied by the NWS&DB, adding that the water treatment plants at Ambathale and Biyagama as well as the accredited lab, where the water samples collected at 12 sample points of the river are being checked, have got ISO certification.
Following the response of the minister MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake further queried what compensation would be paid to the consumers who had to consume polluted water for days.
He also asked how could the people have faith on the quality of water distributed by the NWS&DB.
"Despite having all those ISO certifications, the water supply was suspended only after the public complaints," he observed.
