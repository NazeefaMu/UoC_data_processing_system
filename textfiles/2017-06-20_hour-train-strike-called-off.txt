The 24-hour strike scheduled to be launched by the Locomotive Engineering Operators from midnight has been called off, Locomotive Engineering Operators’ Union (LEOU) said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror LEOU Secretary Indika Dodangoda said the decision was taken following a request made by Prime Minister's Secretary Saman Ekanayake.

He said Mr. Ekanayake requested the union to postpone the strike for 48 hours to call a meeting today to discuss the issues with the participation of related authorities at the Prime Minister Secretariat.

The token strike was organised seeking several demands including salary anomalies
“If the demands were not met at the end of the meeting we will launch the strike,” Railway Employees' Trade Union Federation Convener Janaka Fernando said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
