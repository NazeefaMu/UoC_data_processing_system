DPA, 24th APRIL, 2018- The man suspected of deliberately driving a van into pedestrians along a busy street in Toronto is set to appear in court later on Tuesday.


Alek Minassian, who was arrested on Monday, is due to appear before a Toronto court at 10 am (1400 GMT), Toronto police said on Twitter, adding that information on charges will be released at that time.


The 25-year-old was arrested after the van he was driving jumped the kerb and mowed down pedestrians in the busy suburb of North York, killing at least 10 and injuring 15 others.


Similar acts in other cities in recent years have been carried out by terrorists, but Ralph Goodale, Canada’s minister of public safety, said following the attack that it was too early to say whether the Toronto incident was terrorism. Goodale also said it was unknown whether the incident was connected to a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers currently taking place in Toronto, Canada’s biggest city.
