Ishani breaks another national swimming record

 
Sri Lanka's top swimmer Ishani Senanayake of Sri Lanka Army and Killer Whale Aquatic Club added another feather to her swimming cap when she broke the national free style record for 800 metres at SAF Games Swimming Trials worked off by the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU) at the Sugathadasa Stadium Swimming Complex.
Ishani Senanayake timed 9.55.46 minutes to eclipse the record of 9.56.10 minutes held by National swimmer Machiko Rahim since November 2012. She set up this record at the National Swimming Championship.
Twenty year old Ishani Senanayake is the fastest woman in the waters in the 800 metres free style event and is the proud owner of both the long course and short course national records. She achieved both these during a short period of time which is a true reflection of her improvement of both speed and skills in this water sport.
By merit alone she has been selected for the SAF Games swimming squad for the SAF Games to be held in New Delhi. She will be competing in three events and is presently under the watchful eyes of Manoj Abeysinghe.
The SAF swimming contingent underwent training at the Peradeniya University swimming pool this week to get themselves familiar with various conditions.
The conditions at New Delhi is expected to be colder than Colombo hence this acclimatisation at Peradeniya.
This is a good move by the swimming authorities as acclimatisation plays an important role.
Ishani Senanayake has many swimming records to her credit at various meets and was adjudged the champion swimmer at the recently concluded National Sports Festival where she established two meet records.
