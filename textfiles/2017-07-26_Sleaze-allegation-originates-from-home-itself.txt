A complaint against a very senior purohita in yahapalanaya had been made to sleaze investigating authorities recently, they say.

 


What is special about this complaint is that it had been made by a very intimate family member of the purohita.


The complainant has furnished a list of property owned by the purohita which includes several mansions and BMW vehicles. 


The family member had made the complaint to the authorities on hearing that this purohita representing a distant district was planning to transfer some of his property to his ladylove.


The purohita had already transferred the ownership of several houses to this lucky lady linked to the medical profession and the intimate family member had decided that enough was enough when the purohita had given as a present a limousine to the lady which she herself had wanted. By the way, this lady being showered with presents by the purohita is said to be a close relative of the former strongman.


Those in the know of this complaint are said to be on the watch-out for the response to the complaint by the investigating authorities, they say.
