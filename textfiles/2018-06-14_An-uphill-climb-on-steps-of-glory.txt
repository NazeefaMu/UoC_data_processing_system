An uphill climb on steps of glory


	



Twenty five years of success. The beginning of it all was the dream of a single individual, Mohan Lal Grero. His dream of a Sri Lankan student population proficient in the English Language became a reality with the establishment of the Lyceum International School on June 14, 1993. The dream developed into his Vision and then into his Mission, and the Mission of the school is “To enhance the potential of every young soul that passes through our halls, empowering them to be the best they can do”.

It seemed then ‘a mission impossible’. In reality, however, in proved to be quite possible. As a teacher, who joined the school on September 6, 1993 with the opening of the Primary School and yet works as an AL teacher for the Upper School of Lyceum, I have observed the transition over the years and can now very sincerely state that this mission has been, in every sense of the word, fulfilled.   

Today we boast of 8 branch schools established in diverse parts of the country, namely Kandana, Panadura, Wattala, Ratnapura, Gampaha, Nuwara-Eliya, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala. The significant fact about it all is that equal attention and supervision is maintained with respect to all these branch schools to keep up the standards of every one of them.   

The methodical nature and the meticulous attention given to detail, by the Founder of our school Mr. Mohan Lal Grero and his wife the Principal of the school Mrs. Kumari Grero (a very diplomatic lady indeed), I am by no means surprised.

Lyceum International School which began with the Nursery and Pre-Grade on June 14, 1993 rose up to the AL Commerce and Science streams in its very first two years. Students of all religions were given time for study and prayer. Discipline was maintained to the maximum. And the little-known Lyceum gradually grew into a much sought-after International School. Currently, Lyceum has both National and Cambridge AL and OL streams. Extra-curricular activities were added on. Sports such as Cricket, Basketball, Netball, Soccer, Swimming, Badminton etc.  received a very special place. Public Speaking was given a very special place and made part of the school curriculum from Grade 1 itself.

We now have our own Broadcasting and Media Clubs as well and our very special Channel 100.8. Lyceum FM was launched to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Lyceum Nugegoda.   

Academic excellence naturally comes first. Our father figure Aristotle has given us our school motto: “Know Thyself”. Our students have amply shown that they certainly have come to know themselves.   

The past 25 years have produced an impressive number of nearly 200 Edexcel and Cambridge Award Winners. Almost 150 out of them have been Top in Sri Lanka Awards and 19 Top in the World Awards.   

The A/L Top in the World Awards have been in the subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Accounting, Computing and Business Studies at both Edexcel and Cambridge International Examinations. Top in the World Awards at O/L Edexcel and Cambridge Exams have been in French, English Literature, Biology, Computing, Human Biology and Maths. The highlight of our Awards came in the year 2006 when three Cambridge O/L students from the same batch won Top in the World Awards in the subject of English Literature --- a record yet unbroken in Sri Lanka.   

Lyceum International School provides ample opportunities for the development of the natural talents of all children. Every kind of sport is available in the school and our students have excelled in all of them. Also, the large number of clubs and societies in existence in the school allows the child to choose which field it is that most interests him.   

A team from Lyceum organised and trained by the English Literary Association (ELA) won the All Island Shakespeare Challenge Trophy in the year 2009. The ELA also held two unequalled variety shows ‘Sub Zero’ and ‘Ecstatic’ in 2012 and 2014 spotlighting solely Lyceum student talent. The Lyceum Model United Nations, besides winning many awards, represented Sri Lanka at the World Young Leaders’ Summit in Washington D.C. The dream has indeed become a beautiful reality. The next question is quite natural. ‘What of the future?’ Yet again, is that a question? The Founder’s son Nikitha Grero and daughter Nardhya Grero are already engaged in the issues of the school. Nikitha, in addition, is a   Director and Deputy Coordinating Principal of Lyceum as well as the Principal of the Kurunegala Branch. They would undoubtedly carry on the wonderful work of their parents and keep the flag of Lyceum soaring upwards. 

 

Our prayers are with Lyceum.
