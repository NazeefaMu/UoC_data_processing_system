	The Health Ministry requested the Police Department launch an investigation into the alleged kidney racket.
	In a letter to Police Chief N. K Illangakoon, Health Service Director General Dr. Palitha Maheepala requested private hospitals that conducted the alleged kidney transplants be investigated.
	Dr. Maheepala said the procedures had turned into a large scale kidney racket.
	Last week, the Indian Police filed legal action against six Sri Lankan doctors, working in four different hospitals in Colombo, on charge of performing the procedure illegally.
	The Health Ministry has also appointed a committee to investigate the kidney racket.
