Kaduwela mayor G.H. Buddhadasa said that the law should be applied equally to all, including the wife of MP Wimal Weerawansa.
“The law should be applied equally to all without discrimination. The Police arrested MP Tissa Attanayake over an alleged forged document. Why are the Police not arresting Mr. Weerawansa’s wife, who was accused for forgery and the possession of forged documents? The law should be applied to Mr. Weerawanasa’s wife as well,” the mayor said at a media conference.
He said Weerawansa’s wife had presented forged documents to the Immigration Department with a false name and a false date of birth when applying for a passport.
People elected President Maithripala Sirisena to ensure good governance. Therefore the police should be independent and implement the law fairly, he said; adding that Weerawansa should also be arrested for abetting his wife.
 He alleged that the couple had also committed fraud in the construction of a hotel in the area. He said that he would continue to press the police until they were dealt with. (Irangani Edirisinghe)
