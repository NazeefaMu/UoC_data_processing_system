The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today threatened to go on a trade union action once the students who are said to have passed the MBBS degree from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) are granted provisional registration.

The decision to take trade union action was approved at the annual general meeting where Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya was re-appointed as the President of the GMOA for the sixth time.

The GMOA said since the SAITM’s medical degree did not meet the prescribed standards as said by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), students who pass out from the SAITM could not practice as doctors in Sri Lanka.
