President can remove PM if required: GL


	

President Maithripala Sirisena has the sole power to remove Prime Minister as the Constitution outlined the provision as to how a President could remove a Prime Minister, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said today.

Addressing a news conference he said the constitution envisaged that the Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function, and added as there seemed to be neither a government nor a cabinet right now, the President could remove the Prime Minister if required.

“President Sirisena does not want to remove the premier although it is requisite to appoint a new Prime Minister. The President would delay it until the tenure of the incumbent Prime Minister expires. At the same time, the President is trying to delay appointing a new Prime Minister claiming that there are barriers that have been stipulated in the Constitution. By delaying it, the political necessity is neglected” Prof. G.L said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
