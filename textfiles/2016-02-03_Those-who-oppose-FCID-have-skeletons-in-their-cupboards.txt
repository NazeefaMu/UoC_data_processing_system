Those who call for the abolition of the Financial Crimes Division (FCID) and most of those who have visited former President’s son Yoshitha in prison are ones who should be behind bars, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.


JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the deputy ministers who claimed that the FCID was illegal and should be abolished are ones who have been involved in various corrupt deals.


 "These people have got scared after Yoshitha’s arrest because they have skeletons in their cupboards," he said.


Mr. Dissanayake said Yoshitha was arrested on money laundering charges and most of those who oppose his arrest were ones who raised their hands to approve the legislation banning money laundering.


“Those who visited Yoshitha should be in prison with him.The FCID is currently under the IGP and he had informed that no one can be arrested without the approval of the Attorney General,” he said.


Mr. Dissanayake said Yoshitha’s arrest wasin no way an act of political victimization because there are serious charges against him of abusing state property.

He said the Rs.120 million which the CSN officials were unable to account for was really public funds.


Mr. Dissanayake said these properties should be confiscated.
