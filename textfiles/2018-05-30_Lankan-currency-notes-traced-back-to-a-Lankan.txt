The recent news story that a huge amount of money in our country’s currency was among the valuables found in the treasure trove unearthed from a private residence of the ousted Malay high political authority raised many eyebrows in our country.

 


The authorities in that country and those in ours who made investigations as to how the ousted high political authority had come to have a large bundle of our country’s currency notes in his possession, have traced the origin of the money to a Lankan worthy operating a mobile phone company in the West. 


It has come to light that this Lankan worthy has made several investments in that country and he is believed to have offered ‘santhosham’ to several local authorities there to cut corners and the former Malay political bigwig had been among the recipients of such a santhosham.
