Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today warned that the local industrial sector would be adversely affected by granting more access to Indians via the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Hearth said they had information that the CEPA would be a main focus during talks between Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Indian counterpart.
Mr. Herath said if the CEPA which was first mooted some 15 years ago was signed it would mean a severe blow to our local producers and market stakeholders because the CEPA opens the doors for Indian traders to ply their trade without any let or hindrance in Sri Lanka.
“The CEPA is extremely favourable to Indians and impact negatively on the local business sector. Sri Lanka's exports to India have been estimated at US$580 million while Indian imports to Sri Lanka had increased from US$600 million to US$3,730 million and such a situation is not good for our economy,” he said.
Mr. Herath claimed that if the CEPA was implemented, an increasing number of Indian professionals such as doctors, engineers and labourers would come over to Sri Lanka thus dealing a severe blow to our professionals.
He said the CEPA should not be signed without a thorough and realistic reassessment of the agreement and that above all the economic and other burning problems of our people should be resolved on a priority basis before taking it upon itself any other issues based on regional of political considerations.
