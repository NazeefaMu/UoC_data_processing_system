The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today said there was an attempt to arrest MP Ravi Karunanayake prior to the parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission report and then release him after the Local Government (LG) elections were over.

Former provincial councillor Ajith Prasanna claimed at a news conference that the MP’s consent had been obtained to arrest him.

“Both the President and the Prime Minister are playing to the gallery by calling for a debate on the Bond report prior to the elections. We have received information that Mr. Karunanayake has been persuaded to be arrested to save the party and the unity government. During the debate, the government leaders will score points by saying that this is ‘good governance’ and that they have even arrested a former minister. However, once the election is over, he will be released,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
