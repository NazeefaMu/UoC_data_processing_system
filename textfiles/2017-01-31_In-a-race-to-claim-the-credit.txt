In a race to claim the credit


	



 

The train service between Colombo and Matale that remained out of operation for the past 20 years has now been re-launched. 

 


Special trains are now being run back and forth between Colombo and Matale during the weekends while a train from Matale to Colombo is operated every Monday morning.


People in Matale are full of praise for the railway department and the government for relaunching the long neglected train service.  Meanwhile, two politicians in a bid to hog the credit for the resumed train service have put up banners and posters all over the district, each thanking the government ‘for complying with his request’.
