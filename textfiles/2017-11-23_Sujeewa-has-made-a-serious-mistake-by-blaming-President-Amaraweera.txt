Sujeewa has made a serious mistake by blaming President: Amaraweera


	

UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera today said State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe has made a serious mistake by blaming the President for appointing the Presidential Commission to probe the Bond issue.

Minister Senasinghe recently said that he was badly disappointed about the President and called on the President to appoint Commissions to inquire into ship deals, MiG deals, spectrum deals and advertising firms.

Addressing the weekly Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) media briefing, Minister Amaraweera said State Minister Senasinghe was not a Cabinet minister and therefore he cannot know what was happening in Cabinet meetings.

“People know that there is no fault at President Sirisena appointing a Commission. If someone is against the Presidential Commissions, that means he is ignoring investigations against frauds. If they are saying that the President was elected on January 8 to continue their frauds, that would never become true. As UPFA we approve the decisions taken by the President,” Minister Amaraweera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
