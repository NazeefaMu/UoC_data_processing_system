Govt. must take a cue from PM Mahathir: Duminda


	

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Minister, Duminda Dissanayake said today that by now legal action should have been taken against those of the previous government alleged to have committed acts of fraud and corruption had the government acted in a manner similar to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

“The Malaysian people requested newly-elected Premier Mohamad to punish corrupt politicians of the previous regime. After assuming office, he took immediate action as demanded by the people to arrest all those, including politicians, Government Officials and Police Officers known to have committed fraud and corruption,” he told journalists in Anuradhapura.

The minister said however investigators in Sri Lanka are reluctant to investigate the charges levelled against politicians and multi-millionaires.

“They are very prompt in implementing the law when it comes to ordinary citizens who are alleged to have committed minor offences. Some influential individuals even seek court orders to evade arrest when cases are to be filed against them. The law must be applied equally to all citizens,” he said. (Athula Bandara)
