Over 65,000 applications to get 30 pc from EPF

The Labour Department has received over 65,000 applications from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) members to obtain 30 percent from their EPF accounts. The Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry allows members to withdraw 30 percent from their accounts from May, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
"I have instructed my staff to take steps to implement this at provincial level efficiently and effectively. A large number of people are coming to the Labour Department at Narahenpita daily to check the balance in their accounts. It is an inconvenience for both them and the department," he said.
"Although we have received over 65,000 applications we can grant funds for only 3,700 due to the lack of department staff. As a result, we will implement this at provincial level through the Deputy Labour Commissioner General Offices," he added.
The Labour Department has found solutions for the shortage of staff. However, it is more convenient to implement this at provincial level as members do not need to come to Narahenpita from far off areas.
Implementing this programme at provincial level will make this three times more efficient, the minister said.
