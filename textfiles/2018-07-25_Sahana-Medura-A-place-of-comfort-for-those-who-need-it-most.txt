Sahana Medura : A place of comfort for those who need it most


	



 

25 years ago, the state of the country and the war it was involved in, meant that many people were left vulnerable, having lost loved ones, their belongings and their jobs. Many of these people were also mentally affected by the ongoing trouble in the country and found it difficult to continue living a normal life. Aiming to help those who were psychologically affected, the late Rev. Fr. Fraccid Anthony OMI, started a foundation called ‘Sahana Medura’ in a beautiful environment at Kanuwana in Ja Ela. This  institute celebrates 25 years of valuable service this year.   

 

 

Purpose

With the aim of giving comfort to those who needed it the most, Sahana Medura opened the doors to those who had lost parents or children and were wandering the streets, irrespective of creed, caste and religion. They were taken in by Fr. Anthony and his team and were given counselling and psychotherapy to help them deal with their situation and to enable them to return to their normal lives. Along with those who suffered from the psychological effects of the war, there were many other individuals with various other conditions such as autism and Down’s syndrome for which they required long term treatment. This led to the construction of housing facilities which enabled the members to stay at Sahana Medura and take time to recover and return to society. Many inmates have fully recovered and have been able to return to their normal life and are doing well in society today.   

Although most of the inmates have psychological problems caused by war and various illnesses, some inmates are also affected psychologically by social problems such as bullying, financial issues, negligence from family, problems at their workplaces, and the lack of acceptance in society. They keep all these troubles bottled up in their mind and it becomes too much for them to bear.

This has led to them being psychologically affected. Some inmates were also found to be extremely violent upon their arrival at Sahana Medura. The set programme, counselling and the therapy which the inmates are given help them to deal with and come to terms with their past. It also allows them to release themselves both physically and mentally from the difficulties they face. In addition, the calm environment by which they are surrounded, the love and the affection they are shown have also greatly helped the inmates.   

After the sad demise of Fr. Anthony early this year, the Rev. Fr. Prasanna Rodrigo OMI stepped in as Director and passionately continues the work for which Sahana Medura was originally created. With a total of 40 inmates, the staff at Sahana Medura continue to provide them with the help they need to return to their normal lives and fit back into society with ease.   

 

 

A day in ‘Sahana Medura’

Everyday these wonderful, innocent yet deprived individuals engage in a set programme which starts at 5.30 am. Their day starts with a spiritual session and leads on to many other activities such as music, water, physical and occupational therapy. Throughout various times during this set programme, the inmates are assigned work such as sweeping the rooms, cleaning and looking after the garden and chopping firewood. This enables them to work individually and reflect on their situation and also helps to make their transition back into society easy and comfortable.   

 

 

Health and Well-being 

Fr. Rodrigo makes sure that these inmates are looked after well and has a healthy life and has acquired the services of a qualified psychologist and a therapist to look after and treat these individuals and help them to recover. Further they undergo monthly medical check-ups at the Ja-ela hospital where Fr. Rodrigo accompany them personally.   

To ensure their safety, no one is allowed to go out of Sahana Medura alone but the inmates have been given the opportunity to enjoy themselves through activities such as participating in the church feast, enjoying trips and picnics, and also going on pilgrimages. Many volunteers have also visited the inmates of the foundation and have spent time with them, sung songs with them and have taken time to make them feel accepted and loved.   

 

 

Support

Along with Fr. Rodrigo and his staff, the foundation is also being looked after and supported by the religious congregation named Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) which covers most of the expenses of Sahana Medura and enable the inmates to live as comfortably as possible. Countless contributions have been made towards the running of the foundation by kind acts such as alms-giving, financial aid and also by providing them with other materials which they require. Volunteers have also chipped in and helped the inmates and the staff by washing their clothes and helping to clean the place.   

 

Their Future

In the future, as a congregation, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate plan to gradually change the place into a mental hospital where the inmates can be treated and released back into society instead of having to spend their whole lives at Sahana Medura. 

Sahana Medura humbly request from you, the public who has a passion to make a lonely heart happy that you visit the inmates of Sahana Medura, 6/7, St. Anthony’s Mawatha, Kanuwana,Ja Ela and help put a smile on their faces and show them that they are loved by others and embrace them as brothers and sisters. They also would welcome financial support and any other donations which will be used for the benefit of the innocent inmates.
