The guest, after all, didn’t turn up


	



 

The Group of 16 had recently organized a special meeting with a special guest at the residence of a Group-member in Punchi-Borella. 

 


A prominent public figure from a leading political family whose name is often being mentioned these days as a possible candidate at the upcoming big poll was to be their guest. 


It was expected to be a politically significant big event. But alas! It had to be called off at the eleventh hour, they say. 


It had transpired later that a family member matured in political savvy had advised the guest not to attend the proposed meeting.


Meanwhile, some reports say that some Pohottuwa stalwarts were responsible for causing this great disappointment to the Group of 16.
