Kosgama residents protest against Govt. apathy


	

People in Salawa, Kosgama staged a protest today obstructing the Colombo-Kosgama Road complaining that government officials did not care about the plight they were in.


“Ministers did not even get down from their vehicles to talk to us,” the protestors shouted.


The road was blocked shortly after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the convoy of ministers accompanying him left the area. They did however disembark from their vehicles when they reached the Kosgama Town and inspected the shops and other establishments that had been damaged as a result of the fire.  The Prime Minister was seen in conversation with the owner of an establishment supplying sound systems who explained that the building where his business was located was destroyed during the fire at the Salawa Army Camp. He said he lost some of the equipment he had been storing for hire and that his business was badly hit as a result. Mr. Wickremesinghe also accepted a written document from one person on the destruction caused by the ammo fire at the Salawa Army Camp. (Yohan Perera)
