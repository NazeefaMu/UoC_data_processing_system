There is a business tycoon, a buddy of a leading politico, much in the news these days for being a key accused in a staggering scam that has rocked the country. 

 


His close associates and lackeys led by high-ups of a brewery now under temporary closure are reportedly conducting a series of Bodhi Poojas and other religious observances at a popular place of worship hallowed by the visit of the Buddha to invoke blessings for his protection from the wheels of justice.


Meanwhile, the employees of the sealed brewery too are participating in religious ceremonies to pray for the safety of their jobs, they say.
