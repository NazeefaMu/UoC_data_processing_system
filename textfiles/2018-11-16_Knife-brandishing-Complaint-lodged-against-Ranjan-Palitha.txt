The government yesterday said it had lodged a complaint with the police over UNP MPs Ranjan Ramanayake and Palitha Thewarapperuma who had allegedly threatened government MPs in Parliament with a knife.

Govt. MP Indika Anuruddha said a complaint has been lodged with the police post at the Parliamentary complex.

“Both Ranjan Ramanayake and Palitha Thewarapperuma threatened me with a knife inside the chamber. When I brought Speaker’s attention to this, he said not knives but swords should be brought in because of the current state of affairs.

"This is unacceptable. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s seat was a few rows away from these unruly MPs. This was a threat to all MPs. Therefore, we lodged the complaint with the police,” he told a news briefing held at the Prime Minister’s Office.

MP Johnston Fernando said the MPs who allegedly threatened others with a knife should be arrested. “We have to find out how a knife was brought into parliament. We will bring this issue to the attention of both the President and IGP as well,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
