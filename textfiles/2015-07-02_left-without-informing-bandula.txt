Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran left the island even without passing over his liabilities to another official or informing relevant authorities, Bandula Gunawardena charged today.
“Reliable sources at financial institutions informed me on the sudden flight of the Central Bank governor on Saturday (27), the very next day of dissolving Parliament. Sources told me that Mr. Mahendran had not informed about his tour abroad to the Monetary Board untill Tuesday (30),” the former MP said.    
He said it was not the standard procedure for a governor to leave the country without informing authorities including the Monetary Board and naming an official to make decisions on his behalf. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
