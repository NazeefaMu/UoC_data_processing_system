The Avurudu season is a time for families to come together and celebrate the New Year while sharing gifts and unforgettable moments and DFCC Bank is pleased to announce exciting benefits for DFCC’s Vardhana Virtual Wallet (VVW) users during the upcoming Avurudu season. 
DFCC’s VVW offers limitless benefits and DFCC Bank is proud to spearhead this unique digital innovation in the banking industry. The VVW has now been extended to non-DFCC Bank customers as well, which means that more Sri Lankans can enjoy this cashless convenience. This app is the first of its kind in the country’s banking industry and encourages individual users and merchants to move away from the traditional use of physical cash. 
VVW users can receive money from overseas through DFCC’s Lanka Money Transfer service directly to the VVW from countries such as the UAE, Qatar and South Korea in a hassle-free manner. These transfers take no more than 10 minutes to reach the VVW, making the process almost real-time.
Whether it is splitting a dinner bill between friends, contributing to shared household costs or simply sending a gift this Avurudu season to loved ones, the VVW provides the convenience to send and receive money. The money gets transferred instantly between VVWs without any fees being deducted. 
Furthermore, special discounts for VVW users are available this Avurudu season. From purchasing electronics online, to dressing up smartly and enjoying Avurudu sweet meats, drinks and cakes, the VVW Avurudu promotion covers all aspects for a memorable New Year. The promotion extends beyond the New Year offering 20 percent off at takas.lk and at selected times periods for 20 percent off at Divine, 15 percent off at Panaash and 10 percent off at Navavi Tailors.
