Epic Lanka has joined hands with the Association of Professional Bankers (APB) as platinum sponsor for its 28th anniversary convention.
The annual convention of the Association of Professional Bankers (APB) is the country’s premier forum that brings together leading banking professionals, industry experts and academics to share domain knowledge, discuss issues and generate new ideas for the development of the industry. It also facilitates networking among the stakeholders of the financial services industry. 
The convention is the key learning and development activity organized by the APB and it is aimed at realizing APB’s primary objectives of undertaking, promoting and facilitating studies in the field of banking, while promoting fellowship and dialogue among members, thus playing a vital role in equipping the bankers with the requisite knowledge and skills for the improvement of the banking system in 
the country.
Shashi Kandambi Jassim, President of the APB commenting on this year’s theme of the convention- Thriving in a Digital World said, “Digitalization today has become so inherent in the way we do business. If we do not embrace this change and adapt ourselves expeditiously, we are bound to be left behind. Take the Banking fraternity as an example where digitalization is fast changing our payment ecosystem. Retail payments around the world are shifting on to digital platforms for easier and more flexible payment options using digital devices. Even the internal banking service processes have to be digitalized in order to cater to the customers who demand services through digital media. This proves that the theme we have chosen is timely and relevant to all of us in the financial services industry. I am particularly happy that an illustrious line-up of eminent speakers and panelists who are ready to share their knowledge and experiences at our convention,” added Jassim.
Dr. Nayana Dehigama the Executive Chairman and Managing Director of Epic Lanka said, “We are delighted to partner APB as its platinum sponsor for the third time. 
The theme of the convention ‘Thriving in a Digital World’ is highly relevant, timely and appropriate for every player in the Financial Services Industry. Digitalization is no more a feature to win competitive edge. It is fast becoming a requisite for survival. Thus, having a dialogue on digitalization to share knowledge on why banks should embrace digitalization as a modern business strategy and how to overcome challenges in digitalization is very vital for the banking industry.”
