An infant girl, aged about 18 days has been found abandoned by a road near the Dangolla Junction in Peradeniya.
The infant had been found last evening and officials of the Women and Children’s Bureau of the Peradeniya police had rushed to the scene and admitted the child to the Peradeniya hospital, immediately.
During the investigation a note had been found left at the scene, written allegedly by the child’s mother, explaining her inability to bring up the abandoned infant due to economic constraints as she has four other children. She had requested the infant be adopted by a childless family. (Nadeeka Bandara)
