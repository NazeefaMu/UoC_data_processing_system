Changing base for the coming race!


	



 

A front-line Green party leader currently active in the deep South has planned to shift his political base to the city, a sizable part of which has been a family domain for several decades.  

 


This young politico known to be a leading aspirant to both party leadership and the country’s Number One position has reportedly decided that it would be more convenient for him to make subtle political moves and sharp maneuverings in the pursuit of his goal from the city base rather than from the distant South, they say. 


Some people say that this party heavyweight had been marking time instead of actively pursuing his goal due to the advice of astrologers that he bides his time until the arising of the most powerful Rajayoga. 


Diplomats of certain powerful countries based in the city too have reportedly assured him of their support for his pursuit for the twin goals, they say.
