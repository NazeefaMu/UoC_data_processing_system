Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said that police would report to the Mullaitivu Magistrate the remembrance function held in Wellamulliwaikal with the participation of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran.
A commemoration event to honour the fallen kith and kin was held on the beach in Wellamulliwaikal where the last phase of the civil war took place. 
The Mullaitivu Magistrate had on Saturday issued an order banning the holding of any pro-LTTE remembrance events in the Mullaitivu police division for 14 days starting May 18.
“We are still uncertain about the nature of the event and the motive with which it was held. The organisers said that it was held to remember their kith and kin who had fallen during the armed conflict. However, since there was a court order, we will report to Court so that it could take a final decision on the matter,” he said. 
He said the court order had also banned the holding of any pro-LTTE protest or procession but that no protest or procession had been held by the organisers today.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
