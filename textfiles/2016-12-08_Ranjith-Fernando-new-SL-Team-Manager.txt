Sri Lanka Cricket has appointed Ranjith Fernando as the Team Manager for this month’s tour of South Africa, SLC confirmed today.

Fernando will replace Charith Senanayake, who was appointed for a second stint in 2015. Senanayake’s contract is due to expire in September.

Senanayake confirmed that he had been replaced – on a rotation basis – and that he was informed of the decision only yesterday, two days before the team’s departure to South Africa.

“I was not told until last evening. I was in office doing all the preliminary work to go on this tour and a journalist called and asked me for a clarification. I said I had no clue. I was only told yesterday officially that I am not going on the tour as manager,” Senanayake said, speaking to the media today.

Sri Lanka Cricket also named the Test squad for the tour of South Africa, subject to the approval of the Sports Minister.
