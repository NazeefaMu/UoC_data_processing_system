HSBC Sri Lanka has once again been recognised for its digital capabilities by winning the Best Consumer Digital Bank Award in Global Finance’s World’s Best Digital Bank Awards for 2015 (formerly known as the Best Internet Bank Awards). 
The Best Internet Bank Award was won by HSBC from 2006- 2013, making this year the ninth year that HSBC has won the prestigious award. 
HSBC’s Internet banking platform is built on world-class technology with high security and equipped to perform a number of banking services such as real-time statement viewing, transferring funds between own or third party accounts, bill payments, credit card tracking and management of your own accounts (i.e. cancelling any direct debits, amending standing orders and others). It allows the customer the convenience of banking from anywhere at any time. 
HSBC’s Internet banking allows customers to view their credit card statements and keep track of their spending, day or night, whether they are at home or overseas. Furthermore, with state-of-the-art security features and fraud prevention systems, you can be rest assured that your money is secure and safe.
Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management Nilantha Bastian said, “We are humbled to have won this award for the ninth year that further demonstrates our leadership position in digital banking solutions that offer convenience to customers. Banking is made ever more convenient through HSBC’s Internet banking platform that is secure and can be accessed from anywhere in the world and we are committed to continuing to build and strengthen our online banking platform for the benefit of our customers.” 
The award won is due to HSBC’s commitment to developing world-class solutions through the bank’s personal Internet banking service. 
In Global Finance’s awards programme, winning banks were selected based on the strength of strategy for attracting and servicing digital customers, success in getting clients to use digital offerings, growth of digital customers, breadth of product offerings, evidence of tangible benefits gained from digital initiatives and web/mobile site design and functionality. 
Winners were chosen among entries evaluated by a world-class judging panel. Regional and Global winners will be announced at an awards ceremony in London in October this year. 
This is the 16th year Global Finance has named the World’s Best Digital Banks and details on all First Round winners will be published in the September issue of Global Finance.
