A university don who stormed a GCE (AL) paper marking centre in a main city in the South, had abused the teachers on duty in utter filth, they say.

 


Teachers selected for this exercise are required to mark answer scripts according to an evaluation methodology worked out by the Department of Examinations.  The Professor who objected to the methodology being observed had hurled obscenities at the teachers.
