While denying the Government Medical Officers’ Association’s (GMOA) allegations over shortage of medicine prescribed to Dengue patients, the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry yesterday said that,  so far there is no threat of Dengue epidemic level in flood hit areas in the country.

Issuing a statement, Ministry Acting Health Services Director General Dr. Sarath Amunugama said the GMOA’s allegation on the drug shortage was a false alarm. However, ample stocks of the said drugs have been issued to the hospitals across the country.

The GMOA on last Friday, revealed of a shortage in ‘Dextran’ a medicine administered to Dengue patients said the ministry has imported an inferior quality drug from India which the doctors are refusing to give to their patients. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
