March demanding death sentence activation

A group of SLTB union leaders began a march from Jaffna to Colombo on Monday under a campaign to demand the government to implement the death sentence against the criminals involved in the killing of Seya Sadewmi of Kotadeniyawa and Sivaloganethan Vidya of Punkudutivu.
They reached Anuradhapura on Wednesday passing Killinochchi and Vavuniya. The organisers said they will conclude the march in Colombo by passing through Mahawa and Polgahawela. They will submit a memorandum to the President. A large number of SLTB employees joined the march in Anuradhapura. Union representative Upali Kiriwattuduwa said bringing laws to implement the death sentence would be a timely measure to arrest the crime rate.
