The Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) today questioned former Petroleum Industries Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa in connection with Rs.35 million loss incurred by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation during his term of office.
Mr. Yapa who arrived at the SIU office at the Police Headquarters was questioned for about two hours and a statement recorded.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said a complaint had been lodged with the SIU against a massive loss incurred by the CPC during the past regime.
The CPC had to hire a special vessel from a private shipping company to collect and clean up the large oil spill that had spread across a wide area of the sea off the Colombo Port.
One of the tankers that supply oil to the CPC had damaged a buoy in the Colombo Port resulting in the massive oil spill.
Police said the hiring charges paid to the special vessel for clean-up operations had cost the CPC Rs.35 million.
