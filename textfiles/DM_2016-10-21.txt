Bond Scam: VAC to file law suit against CB Governor
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) affiliated Voice Against Corruption (VAC) said it would take legal action against Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, former Governor Arjun Mahendran, directors of Perpetual Treasuries and some other Central Bank officials next week.
VAC Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe told a media briefing today that the VAC had decided to file legal action because the Governor had failed to take action against the Central Bank officials alleged to have been engaged in the bond scam.
We requested Dr. Coomaraswamy to take action against those officers who are involved in the bond scam but he had failed to do so yet. These officials have been allowed to remain in the Central Bank and bonds are still being issued at an off-market rate, which is a punishable offence," he said
Mr. Samarasinghe said this was the state of affairs during the former governor's tenure as well. "Therefore we will file action against him as well, and the directors of Perpetual Treasuries on the basis that it had caused a huge financial loss to the," he said. We requested the CB Governor to take action to stop these scams taking placed with regard to bonds and have given him suffecient time to do so. However, we will take legal action against all those responsible because nothing is being done to penalize them." (Yohan Perera)

COPE meeting in chaos
	
A Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meeting which was convened yesterday to get the approval for the final report was reported to be in chaos last evening.
According to one MP who is a COPE member, the meeting was going on till late last evening with no compromise reached to finalise the report. Cope meeting is in chaos, utter chaos, one member said in his twitter message.
According to informed sources differences of opinions on COPEs conclusion on the bond issue had led to the dispute among the members.
Another member who did not wish to be named said some UNP members were of a different opinion on the conclusion on the bond case. The members who represented an opposition party said some UNP members were defending the former Central Bank Governor.
However another COPE member said the allegation was baseless. What rubbish, we have no intention of defending anybody, this member said when inquired by the Daily Mirror.
It was also reported that there might even be two reports as there were two opinions among the members of COPE on the issue. Sources said there were provisions to submit two reports by a select committee similar to the two reports submitted by the select committee which looked into the charges against one time Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon.

GSP+ by March, a possibility: PM
	
Sri Lanka will regain the GSP plus facility by March next year, if the government goes ahead with its economic plans without making changes, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
Speaking to journalists after the conclusion of discussions with the European Union, the European Commission and the European Parliament in Brussels, the Prime Minister said there were positive responses from them with regard to GSP plus.
We have only to resolve some technical issues to regain the status, he said; adding that the European authorities were currently carrying out a technical application assessment.
He said Sri Lanka had been able increase its apparel exports by 87 percent since 2003 while Bangladesh had managed to increase its apparel exports by 406 percent taking advantage of GSP plus. If Sri Lanka was able to increase its apparel exports by 300 percent, the country would not have become indebted to the world, he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and President Maithripala Sirisena would hold discussions with the European Union's member states shortly.

I will donate money from alleged offshore account, if found: MR
	
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that if anyone found the US$18 billion that the government alleges he has stored in secret offshore accounts, he would use it to remove the tax imposed on medicine and use the money to give relief to patients.
Addressing the media at a ceremony held at Nelum Mawatha, the former President said that it was not fair to impose taxes on medicines and hospital charges. Those facilities should be given to people without charging a tax, he said. Accruing tax from patients is an inhuman act, he said.
This government has spent more than seventeen months trying to find my alleged secret offshore accounts, he said.
While rejecting claims that such offshore accounts existed, the former president said if the government found any accounts connected to him the whole amount will be credited to the government.
The upcoming budget would provide the same kind of relief that the public was given in the last budget by this government, he said.
We are not making these accusations as if we have just awoken from our sleep. We are making these accusations based on what we have observed about this government, Rajapaksa said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Rupee edges down on importer dollar demand
	
RETUERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended slightly weaker yesterday on importer dollar demand and as foreign investors sold bonds in the absence of Central Bank intervention, said dealers.
Rupee forwards were active, with the spot-next closing at 147.45/50 per dollar, compared with the previous close of 147.40/50.
The spot rupee was quoted at 146.90/95 per dollar, but was hardly traded. It was steady last week after two weeks of losses.
The spot rupee is usually managed by the Central Bank, and market participants use the forward market levels for guidance on the currency.
We see both importer dollar demand and foreign selling in local bonds, said a currency dealer, asking not to be named. There is a bit of uncertainty with the budget coming up next month. So, all are waiting for some firm direction.
The government is due to present its national budget on Nov. 10.
The Central Bank has been buying dollars from the market to accumulate reserves to meet targets set by the International Monetary Fund under a US $1.5-billion loan deal, dealers said.
Officials at the Central Bank were not available for comments.
Dealers said they expected the rupee to remain under pressure due to seasonal imports.

SLC's dirty sex secret
	
Female ex-employee reveals the rampant abuse by frustrated officials at Cricket's head office
Sexual demands, groping, touching, lude comments and verbal abuse of helpless and silent female employees are common occurrences inside the glamourous offices of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) according to the official testimony of a former female Executive officer of the countrys most internationally recognized corporate body.
In a startling revelation made during a formal disciplinary hearing, SLCs former Confidential Secretary in the Marketing Division, Gayathri Wickramasinghe has exposed the dirty underbelly of the creature that in Sri Lanka governs what is supposedly the gentlemens game.
During the tenure of my service with SLC, I have faced harassments including sexual harassment and perversion by, certain personnel of SLC. I have been offered with club memberships in order to call for evening drinks and certain individuals have related about their extra marital affairs during the official working hours with me revealed Wickramasinghe in her statement at a recent inquiry against her.
Even I have faced sexual harassment physically. In fact, I reported one incident in 2012, to then CEO Mr. Ajith Jayasekara and he has taken the matter up with the then President Mr, Upali Dharmadasa who sorted out the issue, she added.
The individuals I have mentioned here are certain employees of SLC and certain Ex-co members of the SLC. I do not want to divulge the names of them but I would do when the necessity arises. Being an unmarried lady, I did not want to complain and tarnish my image, myself due to the reason of manipulation and finally publishing all bogus stories against the innocent parties, she said.
However bogus stories about me have been published in tabloids and newspapers. Later on Ceylon Today dated 17th September 2014 published an apology. I was the only female involved in organizing tournaments. During the time I was working with tour organizing I have faced sexual harassments and perversion from certain support staff individuals as well said Wickramasinghe.
She went on to drop a bombshell when she claimed that the termination of her employment at SLC was mainly due to her refusal to co-operate with the sexual demands of some perverted officials.
Having stated all these harassments during the past, I feel the allegations which are stated in my charge sheet are meaningless, baseless, lack of coherence and (levelled) to take revenge from me for not obeying them she stated. 
Subsequently, websites published stories about Wickramasinghes allegations, though without solid proof and she felt it obviously was the work of frustrated SLC officials hell-bent on destroying her for not acceding to their perverse sexual demands. It bore all the hallmarks of their usual modus operandi.
Then on September 7, SLCs COO Jerome Jayaratne quoted these web stories and a newspaper article and asked her for a detailed report of the alleged harassment she faced as they were serious allegations.
However, she did not respond as she had more than enough reason to lose confidence of SLC and its officialdom and felt it was another attempt to ridicule her more through web-site mudslinging.

Wickramasinghe, though many may not know her by name, rose to prominence in Sri Lanka as much as SLCs international cricketers in recent years largely thanks to the no-holds barred, un-governed and un-monitored world of cyber journalism which today is a free-for-all and seen by many as a monster beyond control.
Stories made up, according to Wickramasinghe, by frustrated SLC officials often spread like wild fire on gossip media though they had no shred of evidence and sometimes forced SLC to conduct investigations, only to find they held no water.
A weird story of spending a night with a cricketer during a Test match was one such story. A shocking allegation of altering a receipt for a false claim was another example. There are several such examples that made her famous or infamous in the cricket circles. 
Wickramasinghe by nature is outgoing, confident and straightforward. She is talented and was good at her job, exactly the things despised by uneducated and incompetent officials and their henchmen who roamed the offices of SLC. So they resorted to alleged sexual harassment and spreading gossip to get the better of her. Finally, they got rid of her but through flimsy charges, most of which were rejected by her immediate supervisor.
Interestingly, among the charges for her sacking are none to say that she was incompetent. Among the charges levelled by SLC are brushing her hair, applying make-up and painting her nails in the office, talking too loudly on the phone and getting late to come to office though she had covered those hours by staying well behind the closing hours to cover the work assigned to her.
In fact, Wickramasinghe had worked for an extra 39 hours and two minutes more than her stipulated working hours during the period SLC had investigated according to information transpired at the inquiry. Her superior officer confirmed at the inquiry that she had come to office late as she was assigned to collect cheques from SLC sponsors on her way to office.
So frustrated by the sudden sacking even without a letter of warning, Wickramasinghe was forced to come up with the harassment she had silently endured at the hand of some officials. She said she feared reprisals from officials if she revealed them at the time she was working but felt the suffering was meaningless, when she heard of the ridiculous charges trumped-up to get rid of her.
She told Daily Mirror that current SLC officials suspected her of links with their rival parties and have gone to extremes to find a reason to get rid of her.
In his evidence, Wickramasinghes superior Vajira Dassanayake, the then head of Marketing at SLC gave a clear picture on how things developed. Recalling a SLC meeting on May 30, Dassanayake said He (SLC President) told the staff present that he is aware of information leaking out due to the conduct of some staff members. He further told that he would take appropriate action to remove such obstacles and he is aware of the proper legal mechanism to achieve such an action.
Wickramasinghe, describing the said meeting in her statement stated; The President SLC accused the personnel who were present there for leaking confidential information to the media. He further stated that he had further identified the people through his sources who support the opposed parties to SLC. Also the President stated in a threatening tone that he will be taking action against the employees from tomorrow as he has identified them as obstacles for his future plans. He further stated that he very well knew the law and he knows how to tackle the situation.
Recalling what happened the following day Dassanayake added: CEO called me to his office and reluctantly handed over a letter of suspension for a period of three months. After half an hour I got to know that the accused officer (Wickramasinghe) has also been given a similar suspension order.

The two third-year students attached to the Arts Faculty of the Jaffna University had been identified as 24-year-old Sundiraja Sulakshan of Kandarodai in Chunnakam and Nadarasa Gajan of Kilinochchi.
Sulakshan who took his friend to his house the previous evening for a function was returning on his motorcycle to drop Gajan, who was staying at the university hostel.
Jaffna Magistrate S Satheeshkaran who arrived at the scene yesterday morning conducted the Magisterial Inquiry whilst the postmortem of the two bodies had been carried out at the Jaffna Hospital yesterday afternoon.
Although, unconfirmed reports indicated that the Judicial Medical Officer had found ammunition in the victims body, the report had not been publicized by the time this edition went to press last night.
The police in Jaffna who denied any shooting involving the incident maintained that the deaths were due to an accident.
Meanwhile, the Government Information Department issued a statement yesterday afternoon saying that five policemen had been arrested in connection with the student deaths and were interdicted with immediate effect.
A special team from the Criminal Investigation Department was dispatched from Colombo to commence an investigation into incident and the security in the area had been intensified.
TNA Parliamentarian Mawai Senathirajah had visited the hospital yesterday afternoon whilst Jaffna University students in numbers were seen gathered outside the hospital and the Jaffna Police Station throughout the day.
Numerous attempts made to get through to senior police officers either in Jaffna or Colombo for comments were futile. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana, Romesh Madusanka and Pradeep Kumara in Jaffna)

'Usawiya Nihandai' allowed to be screened
	
Colombo District Court Judge M.U. Gunawardena today decided not to extend the enjoining order imposed on the film ' Usawiya Nihandai' which prevented it from being screened in the country.
Considering the submissions made, the court lifted the enjoining order.
The case is to be taken up again on January 19, 2017.
Former District Court Judge Lenin Ratnayake, the complainant in the case, had earlier filed a petition in the Colombo District Court seeking anenjoining order restraining the film from being screened.
He had informed court in the petition that there was another defamation case pending in court pertaining to a television programme that aired in 1999 in connection with the same subject matter. Therefore, filming a story relating to the same content could influence the decision in that case and his reputation. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
