Dampe Village – Your Escape for a Break

Hotel Dampe Village has introduced a special weekend package to meet the growing demand from their local and foreign clients looking for a break to escape from their busy schedule over the weekdays. Under this new package, guests including individuals as well as families can relax having fun in a cool and calm environment with the gentle breeze coming from the Bolgoda Lake on Sundays.
Dampe Village General Manager Chanaka Wanasundara said this is a good option for clients to stay in a hassle free environment on Sundays with their families, friends and relations especially for those who are in need of an escape from the stress of their busy schedules.

The package is available at a very reasonable rate including a buffet lunch and welcome drink with the usage of the swimming pool and Gami Gedara area. It is a whole day of fun at the hotel especially for couples who are getting ready for marriage and honeymooners keen on selecting Dampe Village due to its setting amidst lush green gardens constantly refreshed by the cool breeze of the Bolgoda Lake. Dampe Village is pleased to host the function according their aspirations. Chanaka adds that the Dampe Village team is always ready to fulfill all wedding requirements of the couple in one location assisting them in having an exceptional wedding according to their dreams. The hotel has already gained a best reputation and the honour of hosting thousands of unique weddings over the years.
The hotel has two AC banquet halls with a picturesque view of the swimming pool and the Bolgoda Lake. It can accommodate 250 and 350 guests respectively.

The Hotel was founded by Chairman Srinal De Mel (currently a Member of Parliament) in May 2003. What started with just 10 employees, one banquet hall and five rooms has now expanded to two banquet halls, 15 rooms, two conference halls equipped with latest facilities, swimming pool, restaurants, bar and 46 employees.
It is a only 45 minutes drive from Colombo and one can also access it via the Southern Expressway. The hotel offers 15 well appointed rooms with A/C, TV, hot & cold water, Intercom and for lake view rooms a private balcony. All these facilities will make your stay at Dampe Village a pampering experience. A candle lit dinner by the lake with calypso music will add flare to a dream night.
“The management is also planning to construct additional rooms to meet the growing weekend demand,” he said.
Providing new world cuisine with a local touch has always been the norm of the hotel’s experienced culinary team. Customized menu options offering crunchy salads to luscious desserts have stimulated the taste buds of many of the hotel’s regulars. The hotel has a well-deserved reputation for excellent traditional and foreign food. The hotel’s internationally trained and award-winning chefs are pleased to provide an immersive fine dining experience.
A variety of family sports and activities are offered by the hotel such as tennis, cricket, badminton as well as boat rides and fishing which is most popular among foreigners. The lush green garden shadowed by the Kumbuk, Mango and Mangrove creates a relaxing atmosphere and a break from the packed feeling of a city hotel or a reception hall while a traditionally made “Maduwa” is ideally suited for evening functions or registration and can accommodate up to 60 pax, where they can have all the fun and frolic.
