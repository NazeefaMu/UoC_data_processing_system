President Maithripala Sirisena said today Yahapalanaya was not a joke and he was serious about good governance and that the government had committed itself to fight corruption.

He said in a tweet that bribery and corruption was an organised crime in many government institutions and tender boards.

“Let's fight corruption as a country. If we clean up corruption in some key institutions, a good portion of our budget deficit can be covered. Culprits are a few and we'll defeat them,” he said.
