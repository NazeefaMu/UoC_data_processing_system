A no-confidence motion with signatures of 42 Joint Opposition MPs against Minister Champika Ranawaka were handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today.

The motion seeks Parliament to declare that the Minister is not fit to hold office because of his alleged involvement in the hit and run accident in Rajagiriya.

Earlier, the joint opposition gave a similar motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
