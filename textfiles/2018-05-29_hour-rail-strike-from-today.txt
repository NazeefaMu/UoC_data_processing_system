The Railway Technical Services Trade Union Committee (RTSTUC) yesterday said that they would launch a 48-hour token strike from 4 p.m today (29) claiming that the authorities had failed to fulfil their demands.

RTSTUC President P. Sampath Rajitha told the Daily Mirror they held discussions with several officials in the Transport Ministry including Transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abesinghe in Battaramulla last evening.

The Railway Department had taken steps to increase the salaries of several employees by 12 per cent based on favouritism. Therefore, we demand the authorities to grant a pay hike of 12 per cent for all 12,000 railway employees. Incentives have not been provided to employees since 2004 and we demand an incentive payment be given as well,”he said.

Following the discussion, the Deputy minister had reportedly told the RTSTUC to wait until the issue was discussed with the Sarath Amaunugama Committee.

During the token strike, Railway gate operators, Tail track inspectors, railway operator technicians and compartment connectors will refrain from their duties from today. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
