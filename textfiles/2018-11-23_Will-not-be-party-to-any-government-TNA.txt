The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), which commands the support of 15 MPs in Parliament, said it would not be party to any government though it voted to unseat the current administration.

Jaffna District TNA MP and leader of the People’s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), Dharmalingam Sithathdan told Daily Mirror that it only voted to oust the current government as it was unlawful.

When asked whether the TNA would join hands with the UNP-led political front that was being formed, he said they would not join any alliance and that they had their own alliance of Tamil parties.(Kelum Bandara)
