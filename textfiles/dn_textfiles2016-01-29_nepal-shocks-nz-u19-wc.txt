Nepal shocks NZ in U19 WC

 
Qualifier Nepal caused the first major upset of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2016 when it stunned New Zealand by 32 runs in a Group D match in Fatullah on Thursday.
Nepal, which won the qualifying event in Malaysia last year to return to the World Cup after missing the previous tournament in 2014, bowled out the Kiwis for 206 after it was set a 239-run target.
While captain Raju Rijal top-scored for Nepal with 48, seamer Dipender Airee’s three wickets and off-spinner Prem Tamang’s two helped clinch the dramatic win.
Dale Phillips scored 41 to make a late victory bid for New Zealand before he was last out to spark joyous celebrations in the Nepalese camp.
Three-time champion India overcame a shaky start against Ireland to open its campaign with a 79-run victory in Mirpur in another Group D match.
In Group B games played in Sylhet, Pakistan crushed Afghanistan by six wickets and Sri Lanka overpowered Canada by 196 runs.
Sri Lanka showed why it is one of the tournament favourites when it rattled up 315 for six after electing to bat against Canada.
Skipper Charith Asalanka led the way with 76 off 69 balls, the in-form Shammu Ashan hit 74 off 61 balls, Kaveen Bandara made 61 and wicketkeeper Vishad de Silva scored 51.
Canada was shot out for 119 in reply with Arslan Khan playing a lone hand with an unbeaten 42. Lahiru Kumara, Thilan Nimesh and Damitha Silva claimed two wickets each.
