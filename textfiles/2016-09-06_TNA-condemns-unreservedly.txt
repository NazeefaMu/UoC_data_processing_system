TNA condemns 'unreservedly’


	

The main Opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today in Parliament 'unreservedly’ condemned the assault of Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia Ansar and stressed that perpetrators should be brought to justice.

Making his remarks on the incident along with other party leaders, TNA leader R. Sampanthan said stringent action should be taken against offenders.

He said this was totally unwarranted at a time when Sri Lanka was moving towards harmony and stability.

He noted that such elements did not have the harmful consequences of their foolish acts. He said such acts would play into the hands of those not wanting stability in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Sampanthan said if offenders were Sri Lankans, they should be extradited to be charged here.

"We unreservedly condemn this incident," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
