A swarm of bees stopped play midway through Sri Lanka's innings in the third one-day international against South Africa in Johannesburg.

The bees disrupted play twice - sending players diving to the ground - before the game was officially stopped in the 27th over, with Sri Lanka on 117-4.

A groundsman used a fire extinguisher to try to disperse the bees, before a beekeeper was called to the Wanderers.

Play was able to restart an hour and five minutes later after the delay.(BBC)
