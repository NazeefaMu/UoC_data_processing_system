The decision on whether or not to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as a member of parliament will taken today by the United National Party's working committee.

Party sources said the working committee would meet the party leader -- Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe -- at Sirikotha this afternoon.

It was reported that Field Marshal Fonseka was among those who were proposed to fill the vacancy created by the recent demise of Minister M. K. A. D. S Gunawardene. Field Marshal Fonseka signed an MoU with the UNP led United National Front (UNF) last week.

Meanwhile, the Secretary General Parliament, Dammika Dassanayake told Daily Mirror that no swearing in had been arranged yet for this week in parliament. Parliament will meet on Tuesday February 9, 2016. He said the House had not received a gazette notification from the Commissioner of Elections in order to make preparations to swear in a new MP.(Yohan Perera)
