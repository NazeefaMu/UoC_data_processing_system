When the JO firebrand from Nawalapitiya was arrested for the first time, a group of top team members had called on his family on a comforting mission, on a request from the ‘palace’. 

 


When the firebrand politico got back home after being released on bail recently, he had received a ‘howdy’ call from the ‘palace’.


Even without giving the caller to have his say, the politico had slammed down the phone angrily saying: “Don’t worry about my problems. I can look after my affairs.”
