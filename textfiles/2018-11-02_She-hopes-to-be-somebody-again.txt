She hopes to be somebody again!


	



 

On hearing about the sudden power change, a fair and lovely one who had lost her Diyawanna status rushed to Colombo in double quick time to felicitate her party leader.

 


“I am so happy, Sir, that I have no words to express my feelings,” she told her boss.


However, she could not chat long with the boss as he was at the centre of a flurry of excitement, surrounded by family and party intimates.


Now back in the company of onetime colleagues, the lovely one heaved a long audible sigh of relief and said: “Thank God! My troubles are over now!”


Asked what she meant by saying that her troubles were over, she explained:


“I know that I can’t get back to Diyawanna now. But I am sure I will get a good place where I will be somebody again!”
