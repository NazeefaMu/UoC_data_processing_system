The government has decided to set up a new Secretariat to investigate financial crimes, informed sources said yesterday.

Sources close to the Prime Minister's office said a Bill to this effect will be presented to Parliament soon. The new Secretariat is expected to match with international standards.

This development comes in the wake of the Anti-corruption Secretariat becoming defunct from July this year. (By Yohan Perera)
