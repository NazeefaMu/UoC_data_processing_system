Gestetner of Ceylon PLC continued on the upward trajectory for the financial year 2014/2015. 
The company marked a significant growth in profit for the financial period ending March 2015, with profit after tax for the year growing by 67 percent. 
Revenue for the year also improved notably at a 16 percent increase on the previous year. This can be attributed to a cohesive expansion of the company’s dealer network, with a strong presence of 22 dealers across the island at present. 
The company, which imports office automation equipment in Sri Lanka, has also introduced several new products and services to its portfolio over the last year. Most recently it presented a total document solution, which currently services several top corporates in Sri Lanka. 
Profit-wise, Gestetner marked a robust growth for the year at Rs. 52.33 million, in comparison to the previous financial year’s Rs. 31.31 million. Basic earnings per share also rose from Rs. 13.74 to Rs. 22.97. Dividends per share rose by 80 percent to Rs. 9 per share. 
“The rapid growth in profit we’ve witnessed over the last few financial years is quite remarkable,” noted Chandima Perera, Managing Director for Gestetner of Ceylon PLC, adding that this steady financial growth was largely due to the company’s willingness to constantly reinvent itself. “We’re determined to keep pace with rapidly evolving market needs for the kind of services and products we offer, and that keeps us at the top of our game.” Having pioneered the introduction of digital copiers in Sri Lanka, Gestetner today offers cutting-edge digital document management solutions such as digital duplicators, digital imaging systems, network laser printers, and facsimile machines.  With partners Ricoh Asia Pacific, the company has made significant strides in its retail business, introducing products such as digital copiers and P2P (Print to Profit) copier outsourcing services – another first for the country. Gestetner celebrated its 50th anniversary as a public quoted company in Sri Lanka last year, and commands the market as one of the top three document solution providers 
in the industry.
