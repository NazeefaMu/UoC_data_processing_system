Failure to take action against Coca Cola Company
Environmental, civil society organisations complain to SLHRC

Several environmental and civil society organisations collectively made a complaint at the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) on Wednesday for not taking legal action against the Coca Cola Company, over polluting of the Kelani river.
The complaint was made by the Environmental Conservation Trust, Transparency International Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka National Federation of Fisheries Co-operative Society, Movement for National Land and Agricultural Reform and Government Nursing Officers' Association.
Environmental Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara said that they were of the opinion that the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Central Environmental Authority and Biyagama Police Station had not taken the appropriate legal action against the Coca Cola Company for polluting the Kelani River.
"They did not use the powers vested in them by the law.
Therefore, we requested the Commission to summon the officials of these three institutions and conduct a comprehensive investigation into it. We also requested the Commission to advise those institutions to act according to the powers vested in them from the relevant Acts," he said.
He pointed out the Coca Cola Company could not be proved guilty before the court due to the failure of those institutions to take legal actions.
"Not only that the CEA and NWS&DB were discussing with the Company to settle the matter after the payment of compensation. They were justifying the company's actions. The polluting of the Kelani river and the damage to the Ambatale Water Treatment Plant were matters of grave concern as it is the source of drinking water for over 80 percent of the population in Colombo and the adjacent areas," he added.
