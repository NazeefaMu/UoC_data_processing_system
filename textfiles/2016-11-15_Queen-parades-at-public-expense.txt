A hill capital-based political ‘queen’ has made it a practice to make regular pleasure trips round the country at public expense in the guise of fact-finding tours. 

 


She makes these trips accompanied by a retinue of about 15 close associates and loyalists. The establishment the ‘queen’ heads has to foot a hefty bill almost every month on account of food, drinks and lodging provided to the ‘queen’ and her followers in addition to the usual travelling and other expenses, they say.
