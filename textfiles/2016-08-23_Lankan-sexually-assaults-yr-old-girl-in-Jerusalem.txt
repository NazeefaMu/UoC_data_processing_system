A Sri Lanka expat worker in Jerusalem, Israel has been charged for sexually assaulting a 6-year-old girl in a home he was hired to clean, Israel National News reported on Monday.

The 46-year-old worker was working illegally as a house cleaner despite a work visa which limited him to serve as a caretaker.

According to the indictment filed against the suspect, he had worked in the home for about three years.

Investigators said the man had performed indecent acts on the family’s 6-year old daughter on August 11, while her mother slept in a nearby room. However, the girl had escaped from him and run to her mother, at which point the suspect fled the building.
