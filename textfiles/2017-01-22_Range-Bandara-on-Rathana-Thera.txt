Venerable Rathana Thera did not achieve anything by coming into Parliament but he would be able to achieve much for the country if he resigned as a Member of Parliament, State Minister of Skills Development Palitha Range Bandara said.

He said monks should not come into Parliament as such a thing would not benefit the people and the clergy as well.

Mr. Range Bandara, who was speaking during a ceremony held at the Ministry yesterday, said monks coming into Parliament was a hindrance to the development of the society.

“There were eight monks who entered Parliament in 2004. They were well respected but they had lost that respect by the time they left the House,” the state Minister said.

He also called for discussion among the Buddhist clergy on monks entering politics. (Yohan Perera)
