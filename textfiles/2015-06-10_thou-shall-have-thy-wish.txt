The Betel leaf members who were recently sworn in as Ministers were first given the option to choose the subjects they wanted, they say.
After the Ministers were sworn in, the New Big Boss had sent for a Diyawanna member from Rajarata. When the member turned up at the main Secretariat, the New Big Boss had told him: “I have decided to appoint you as a Deputy Minister. What is the subject you prefer to handle?”
Highly surprised by this unexpected inquiry, the member had said: “This is something unprecedented, Sir. Never before have we ever been consulted prior to being appointed to Ministerial office!”
“Well, we are trying to establish a truly Maithri rule,” replied the New Big Boss adding: “Let me know the subject of your choice.”
The Diyawanna member said: “Sir, I being a member representing the peasantry of Rajarata, I would like to handle a subject connected with lands.” “OK, then get ready to swear in as the Deputy Minister of Lands,” the New Big Boss told the member.
