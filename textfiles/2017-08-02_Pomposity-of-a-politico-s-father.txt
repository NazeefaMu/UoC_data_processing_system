Pomposity of a politico’s father


	



 

The father of a purohita from a coconut growing area was on his way to the nearby town when he drew up his vehicle on seeing a roadside durian seller.

 


He popped his head out and called out: “Boy, bring me two good durian fruits!”


“Mahattaya, come and pick two good fruits yourself!” replied the young seller. 


“Why can’t you bring two fruits? Do you know who I am?”


“I don’t know who you are, Mahattaya! I don’t care who you are either! If you want durian, pick two fruits yourself! What I pick for you may not suit you!”


Highly provoked by this negative reply, the purohita’s father phones up the Police, a Police jeep arrives on the scene in a few minutes and two Policemen getting out force the protesting durian seller into the jeep which immediately speeds away as several bystanders look on shocked and amazed.
The news about the arrest of the young durian seller soon spread like wildfire and a highly concerned son of the purohita on hearing about the incident rushed to the Police station and got the poor durian seller released, they say.
