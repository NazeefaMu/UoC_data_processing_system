Bearded loner choosy about his bedfellows!


	


The bearded loner of the Old left is in an ugly mood these days.  He attended a recent media briefing held by the Betel leaf rebel group. Several fringe political party leaders supporting the deposed strongman had been invited to the briefing.
The sulky loner breezed in as the briefing was about to get underway and his glance immediately fell on a certain politico among those seated at the head table. The presence of this character descending from the Urumaya clan now leading an imitation grouping visibly got the loner’s goat.
“Who invited this fellow to this media briefing?” the loner barked. “If he remains here, I will walk out!”
A highly embarrassed former Ministerial one who presided over education tried to pacify the sulky loner. “We invited him. How can we ask him to leave now?”
“Either he goes out or I quit,” the old Trotskyite put his foot down.
The former Ministerial one held council with a highly disconcerted Urumaya descendant. “You will sit with us at the head table at the next briefing. Wait on the sideline today,” he appealed to the Urumaya politico and the latter quietly moved away from the head table.  
The media briefing began soon after and they fired salvo after salvo at the 100-day regime.
