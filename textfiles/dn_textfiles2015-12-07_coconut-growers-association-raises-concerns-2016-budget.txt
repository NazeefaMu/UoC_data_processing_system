Coconut Growers Association raises concerns on 2016 Budget

The Coconut Growers Association of Sri Lanka (CGASL) has raised concerns about 2016 Budget proposals which spelt out substantive reforms in the coconut industry.
In its reforms in Plantation Economy section 160 reads "Coconut Industry too is faced with the issue of lack of coconuts for value addition. The budget proposals for the first time proposed the import of coconuts to meet the shortfall of local produce for the coconut processing industry.
The Plant Protection Ordinance No: 165/2 of November 1981 prohibits the importation of Coconut Palm products and any imports even under quarantine control would be a violation of this Act.
Sri Lanka is now facing the adverse consequences of relaxation or the lapses of quarantine control with the advent of the Aceria Mite Infestation which commenced around 10 to 15 years ago, and has spread throughout the country retarding the production and size of coconut with the nut weight reduction of about 30% with a severe attack.
The CGASL will support all endeavors to provide more nuts for production by industrialists and support the government's endeavor to increase exports of processed & value added products.We can achieve this through collective effort from all the stakeholders of the Coconut Industry.
Despite the reservations, the Association noted some positive proposals in the 2016 Budget. The CGASL commend on tax holiday to be granted to companies that use drip irrigation methods, and endeavor to use high yielding seeds in Agriculture as a positive move, however these concessions should be offered to the entire spectrum of growers including coconut and not be limited to companies.
The 2016 Budget has proposed to lift the ceiling on ownership of land, this certainly would give an impetus to existing coconut grower to expand their investments in coconut plantation. In summery importation of coconuts to cater to an export market is not a solution as proposed in the 2016 Budget. The village grower is dependent on the price of a coconut to keep his home fires burning. The risk of coconut palm getting infected with virus and predators are very high and could destroy the entire industry. The Valuable Brand name "Sri Lanka Coconut Product" will be diluted. The benefit is only for a few industrialists. Is it worth at the cost of the millions of people who rely on the cheapest & healthiest source of fat in their daily meal?
