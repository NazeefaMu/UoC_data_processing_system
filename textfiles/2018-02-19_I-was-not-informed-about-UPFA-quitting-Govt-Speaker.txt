Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament today that he had not been informed of any decision by the UPFA to quit the national government.

The Speaker said this when joint opposition’s parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene and several other JO MPs quoted media reports saying the UPFA has decided leave the national government.

"Media reports had quoted the deputy speaker and if it was true the Cabinet is defunct," the MP said.

MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Speaker should clarify because the media had quoted the deputy speaker as saying so. The Speaker said he would inquire from the deputy speaker with regard to the media statement sourced to him. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
