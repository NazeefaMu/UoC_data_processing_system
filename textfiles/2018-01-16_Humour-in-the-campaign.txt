Humour in the campaign


	



 

A state purohita from a main political party who attended an electorate level youth conference held in Wayamba as the guest speaker recently got nettled when he saw there were more empty chairs than participants in the hall to greet him. 

 


Even before taking his seat, the state purohita angrily asked the organizers the reason for the poor turnout at the conference. When he received no response from the organizers who just sheepishly looked on, the purohita directed his anger at the audience. He ordered a youth seated in the front row to get up. “You are a youth leader in your area? 


“Yes, Sir!”


“How many youths did you bring to this conference?”


“I came alone, Sir!”


“A fine youth leader,” the purohita murmured under his breath and said: “Sit down.”


Now the purohita ordered the youth seated next to the first one to get up.


“How many persons did you bring to this conference?”


“I came alone! Sir!” he too replied. 


The purohita asked from others too the same way as to how many activists had accompanied them and each of them gave the same answer: “I came alone, Sir!”


The purohita who castigated them all said: “You people are not worth the trouble we are taking for your sake!”


However, the youth participants subjected to this harangue appeared more amused than contrite, they say.
