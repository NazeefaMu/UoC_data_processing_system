A case of brazen discrimination!


	



 

A Diyawanna government politico had recently launched a vocational training programme for housewives in her constituency enabling them to engage in an economically productive activity during their spare time.

 


However, when a group of women from the area called at the Diyawanna member’s office seeking enrolment in a vocational training course, the members of politico’s private staff handling the project had refused to take them in for the course saying that the programme was open only to party supporters, they say.


The women had argued that as the training programme was to be conducted utilizing public funds, they had no right to discriminate against any section on grounds of race, religion or political bias.


However, the politico’s aides and his henchmen present at the place had turned away the women saying, “The question of whose monies are going to fund this programme does not concern us. What matters to us is the Madam’s orders not to recruit for any of these training courses anyone outside our political party. And we know that you all are supporters of a rival party!”
