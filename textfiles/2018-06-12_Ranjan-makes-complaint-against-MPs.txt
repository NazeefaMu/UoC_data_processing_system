Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday said he had made a written complaint against 50 MPs who had allegedly obtained cheques from Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius.

Mr. Ramanayake told the Daily Mirror that he submitted a letter to the Bribery Commission naming 50 MPs from the government and the opposition as respondents for taking bribes from Aloysius.

“On Sunday I spoke to Bribery Commissioner Chief Neville Guruge who requested me to send an official complaint in writing and accordingly I made an official complaint yesterday,” he said.

Deputy Minister Ramanayake declined to reveal the names of respondents but said “I have included names of MPs from several political parties,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
