Proceedings at the PRECIFAC had to be suspended today when the evidence given by ITN Chief Internal Auditor appeared began to contradict himself, an official said.
A senior PRECIFAC official said ITN Chief Internal Auditor Majula Alagiyawanna had contradicted what he had said previously and resulted in the recording of his evidence being stopped halfway through.
He said proceedings were postponed for November 19 and 20.
Former president and Kurunegala district UPFA MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who appeared before the PRECIFAC for the fourth day yesterday to give a statement over the alleged non-payment of bills to the state-owned ITN.
He told the media that the ITN would have to pay him back going by the way the proceedings were moving.
“If the proceedings continuing in this manner, I think ITN will have to pay me. Now a huge amount had been reduced from the amount previously mentioned. It seems that the figures are being changed for political revenge,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said it was a mental harassment to be summoned so many times.
Former ministers Keheliya Rambukwella, Dullas Allahapperuma and Susil Premajayantha also gave statements before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC).
