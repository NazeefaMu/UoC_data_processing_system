The Committee appointed to inquire into the death of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, filing a report in court today agreed not to request for an inquest or post mortem into his death.

Earlier, the Court directed National Hospital Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe to appoint a special panel of doctors to investigate death of Ven. Sobitha Thera following a request made by the CID on a complaint received from Ven. Uduwe Dammaloka Thera.

In a complaint to the CID, the monk said there was a need for an autopsy to be carried out as the details of the Thera’s treatment was missing.

The Thera had received treatment from National Hospital, the Dr. Nevil Fernando Private Hospital and the Central Private Hospital and also the Mt. Elizebeth Hospital in Singapore. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
