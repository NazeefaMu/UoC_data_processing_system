United National Party (UNP) MP Harshana Rajakaruna yesterday said he did not personally welcome the arrest of United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Namal Rajapaksa but was happy to note that justice prevailed.

Mr. Rajakaruna told a media briefing that one should be happy that the Judiciary had become independent at last.

“One should be happy that the Judiciary had become independent at last and rule of law prevails,” he said.

“The Government was blamed for not taking action against those who are charged with corruption, but the arrest of Namal Rajapaksa proves that the corrupt can’t escape,” he added.

Responding to a question by journalists that the charge against Mr. Rajapaksa was fairly a minor one, compared to the allegations made against him and the Rajapaksa family, the MP said there were many other charges against MP Namal Rajapaksa and these would come out soon.

MP Mujibur Rahman, who also participated in the briefing, said the Mr. Rajapaksa was a good catch.

“Some said the government only nets ‘halmessas (sprats) and let the ‘moras’ out. But the government had caught a mora,” he said. He said that many ‘moras ‘would be netted soon.

Asked whether who would be arrested next, both MPs said it was up to the Police and the Judiciary. (Yohan Perera)
