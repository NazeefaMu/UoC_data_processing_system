Lyon spins Australia into strong position

 
SYDNEY Sunday : Nathan Lyon claimed his 100th Test wicket in Australia with the dismissal of top-scoring opener Kraigg Brathwaite late on the opening day of the rain-hit third Test against the West Indies in Sydney on Sunday.
Brathwaite had defied Australia's bowlers and two rain delays before he gave away his wicket late in the day to Lyon for 85.
Brathwaite, one of the few shining lights in a dismal Windies tour with 94 in the first Hobart Test, was in sight of his fifth Test century before he fell to Lyon. It gave the Australia off-spinner his 100th Test in Australia and 184th scalp overall.
At the close, after 75 overs were squeezed in around two lengthy rain interruptions, the West Indies were 207 for six with Denesh Ramdin on 23 and Carlos Brathwaite not out 35 after winning the toss. Australia have already retained the Frank Worrell Trophy after huge wins in the first two Tests and are chasing a 3-0 series clean sweep.
Brathwaite, who along with Darren Bravo has been the best-performing batsman in the series for the struggling visitors, was deceived by Lyon's extra bounce and attempted to steer the ball past slip.
But instead he dollied a catch off his glove to Steve Smith at slip.
His dismissal was quickly followed by the wicket of skipper Jason Holder, who was instinctively caught by Joe Burns at short leg for one off left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe. -AFP
