Investigation against Manusha Nanayakkara
	
An investigation is currently underway against the Deputy Minister of Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara for his alleged involvement in misleading the public by superimposing a false news item on The Hindu newspaper, to tarnish the political image of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Daily Mirror reliably learns.
Colombo Fraud Investigation Bureau has initiated an inquiry following a directive by the former Police Chief N. K. Illangakoon, in response to a complaint lodged by then Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ajith P. Perera on August 10, 2015.
The complaint was lodged against the Galle District SLFP MP Nanayakkara after he produced a false document at a live political talk show conducted by a leading television channel on August 08, 2015.
The talk show was attended by MP Nanayakkara, then Deputy Minister of Womens Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran and UNP Ratnapura District MP Heshan Vithana, the Daily Mirror learns.
At the talk show MP Nanayakkara produces a photocopy of The Hindu newspaper dated July 11, 2012, carrying an article about a statement made by MP Vijayakala Maheswaran to the respective Indian newspaper.
The statement was about a political vow given to her by the then Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe of handing over the Eelam, once he comes to power.
The police following the initial inquiry have learnt that there was no such news item was published on The Hindu newspaper on the said date as shown by MP Nanayakkara.
Instead, the original paper had carried a news item about a statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with his photograph on.
An in depth inquiry had revealed that the copy of the newspaper which was shown through the media by MP Nanayakkara was a one that had been superimposed by a false news item on MP Maheswaran and Premier Wickremesinghe.
The Daily Mirror reliably learns through its parliamentary sources that the Colombo Fraud Investigation Bureau had so far recorded statements from MPs Maheswaran and Heshan Vithana with the permission of the Speaker.
When contacted OIC CFIB Chief Inspector P. P. A. Wijenayake said an inquiry is currently underway against MP Manusha Nanayakkara regarding a forged document but denied to give further details.
However, Deputy Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ajith P. Perera speaking from an overseas destination told the Daily Mirror yesterday, that he personally lodged a complaint with the Police Headquarters last year against MP Manusha Nanayakkara and the CFIB had already recorded his statement.

Rain brings positive results
	
Despite the inclement weather conditions wreaking havoc, it has brought about positive results by filling major irrigation reservoirs sufficiently enabling paddy cultivation feasible during the Yala season, officials said yesterday.
The country experienced a dry spell in March, and as a result the irrigation authorities asked farmers to restrict paddy cultivation under irrigation tanks such as Minneriya, Giritale, Parakrama Samudra in the Polonnaruwa district.
Director General of Irrigation Saman Weerasinghe told Daily Mirror that farmers were asked to reserve at least 20 per cent of their paddy land for supplementary food crops.
We encouraged farmers at that time to opt for other food crops instead of paddy under certain irrigation dams. Now, most reservoirs have been filled enough. Then, farmers will tend to cultivate more and more paddy this time. This is the positive side of adverse weather condition we experienced, he said.
Spill gates of four reservoirs-Tabbowa, Iginimitiya, Deduru Oya and Veheragala- still remains open. In other irrigation tanks, spill gates have now been closed. (Kelum Bandara)

Robbery of flood victims
	
Certain persons who act in the guise of flood victims have taken away cooked food and dry rations in many flood affected areas.
The complaint was made by real victims in Wellampitiya, Angoda, Ambatale, and Meetotumulla.
One resident from Wellampitiya told Daily Mirror that they managed to get some cooked food from the doners but the dry rations are being grabbed by those who falsely claim that they have been affected by the floods. Some have even got into houses which have been left by others and had robbed , he said.
He said the high water levels prevented the security forces and the police from coming into the affected areas to provide protection to the residents.
This situation had occurred despite the assurance claimed by the government that maximum protection will be given to the houses.
Meanwhile, the army spokesman Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera said the Army had provided relief to 116,000 people. The Navy had provided relief to 110,000 people while the Air Force too claimed that they are providing relief as well carrying out rescue operations.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharashana Yapa who claimed that the government is doing its maximum to provide relief to the victims said to dial 117 and lodge complaints if there is any shortcomings. Robbery of flood victims. (Shantha Senaviratne )

SDIG was in vicinity of Thajudeen's accident: CID
	
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake was remanded till May 26 by Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris yesterday over the inquiry of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeens murder.
The former SDIG was produced to the court after he was arrested by the CID on the charges of Causing disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence touching it, to screen the offender and conspiring under the clauses of 198 and 296 of the Penal Code.
The CID revealed in Court that according to a statement of an eye witness; the Senior DIG Senanayake had been in the vicinity of the accident site in civil attire on May 17, 2012 between 2.45 a.m. and 3.00 a.m. in another vehicle.
The CID revealed in court that it had recorded a statement from an eye witness of the alleged accident of the ruggerite.
The prosecution also revealed that the former SDIG had ordered Narahenpita Crime and Traffic OICs to record the incident dishonestly as a fatal accident.
The CID told that the father of the deceased, Wasim Thajudeen, was also informed by the former SDIG that the incident was merely a fatal accident but nothing on 18th of May, 2012.
Appearing for the suspect, counsel Anil Silva PC moved a legal issue that the prosecution has no provision to put clause 296 of the penal code in B report against the suspect, since the charges of fabricating false evidence cannot be linked into the punishment of murder on this particular incident.
And he also moved that the other offences and punishments stated in the B report under the clauses of 190 and 198 of the Penal Code were bailable if the magistrate satisfied to grant bail considering the other facts.
However, the Magistrate Peiris rejecting the bail application held that under the clause of 32 in the Penal Code, Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention, provides more broader provision to a magistrate to consider on remanding a suspect and he also ascertained that the prosecution has provision to suspect someone during an inquiry.

Use of Obscene Language: Harin apologises
	
After Telecommunications and Digital Technology Minister Harin Fernando abused Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage in obscene language, the parliamentary authorities have begun to consider amending the Standing Orders to ensure the dignity and decorum of the House.

It is learnt that MPs who use unparliamentary language would be prevailed upon to withdraw their remarks forthwith or else face disciplinary action. Meanwhile, party leaders have stressed the need to amend the Standing Orders to provide for stern action.
