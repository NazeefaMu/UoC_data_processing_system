Did he act in haste to repent at leisure?


	

Nine opposition political parties held a joint media briefing at the political temple in the city recently. The politico who was invited to represent the Betel leaf party at this show had a hard time in deciding whether to attend it or not, they say. 


	 
The man, looking after a Colombo district constituency closer to Gem City, of course, was quite keen on taking advantage of the event to win more votes by being critical of the Yahapalanaya two. But he had a nagging fear that move could lead to his losing the position as the chief organizer of the electorate he had been tending for years! 
Finally the fear of losing the organizer post gave way to his strong desire to cut a figure before his voters and he attended the media briefing. 
At the media briefing the politico went into pyrotechnics over the acts of omission and commission of the regime. However, his courage and buoyancy oozed out when he remembered soon after the enormity of the risk he had taken. These days he is said to be in a blue funk wondering whether he had unwittingly cleared the way for his bitter rival long eying his organizer post to achieve his goal!
