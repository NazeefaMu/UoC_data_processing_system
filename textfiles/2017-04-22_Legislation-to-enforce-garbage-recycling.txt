The Government will, within two months, introduce legislation to enforce the recycling of garbage, informed sources said yesterday.

They said the Prime Minister was monitoring the progress of the new Bill, which is now under preparation.

“Sri Lanka is one of the few countries in Asia that does not have specific laws pertaining to recycling of garbage and therefore the government has decided to introduce laws pertaining to this issue,” a source said adding that this matter was being expedited in the aftermath of the Meethotamulla tragedy which killed more than 30 people.
