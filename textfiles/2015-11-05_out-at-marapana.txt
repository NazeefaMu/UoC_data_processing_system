Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today hit out at Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe saying that if what they said in parliament over the Avant-Garde floating armoury ship was true, then an inquiry should be launched against the police and action taken against them.
“The Law and Order Minister will have to carry out an investigation against the police and impose the law against them if the police have done something wrong as he said. We are closely monitoring whether he will take action against the police if not, it will be negligence of his duties on his part,” he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka told a news conference that anchoring an armoury at the Galle Harbour was illegal and against Maritime Security Regulations and asked Minister Marapana whether it was not wrong to anchor such an armoury ship.
“Such armoury ships should be anchored 12 kilometres beyond the harbour according to international regulations. But this Avant-Garde armoury ship was anchored in the harbour. We do not accept the minister’s statement,’ he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka said the police had been discouraged due to such statements and asked how the police could mediate in such issues with confidence in the future.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCHPix by Pradeep Dilrukshana
