Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has said he would not enter politics in the future.
He made the remark after attending a religious event at a temple in Udumulla, Padukka yesterday with several politicians including Udaya Gammanpila and Gamini Lokuge.
Rajapakse stated that as the previous Defence Secretary, he had ensured people live in peace and freedom without fear.
“But, I cannot say much about national security now as I am not informed by Intelligence Services anymore,” he said.(Buddhika Kumarasiri)
