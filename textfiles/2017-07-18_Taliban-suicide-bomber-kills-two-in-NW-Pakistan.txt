PESHAWAR AFP July17, 2017- A suicide bomber struck a vehicle carrying members of the paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) in Pakistan’s northwest Monday, killing two and wounding six others, police said, in an attack claimed by the Taliban.   


The attack took place in the upscale Hayatabad area of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.   


The blast came a day after the Pakistani military said it has launched a fresh ground operation in a strategically important valley in the region, part of an operation that began in November to clear the militancy-wracked area.   


 “A suicide bomber hit the FC vehicle in Hayatabad killing two men and wounding six others, including two FC soldiers and four civilians,” local senior police official Imran Malik told AFP.   


The two killed were both members of the FC, part of the Pakistani army who specialise in operations along the border with Afghanistan.
