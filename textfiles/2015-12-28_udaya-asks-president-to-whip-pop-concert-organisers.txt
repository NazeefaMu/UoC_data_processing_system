Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila today asked President Maithripala Sirisena to order the whipping of the organisers of the recent Enrique Iglesias concert.
He said it was the President who had the authority to order such a whipping.
Mr. Gammanpila told a media conference that the environment which made a woman under the influence of liquor throw her underwear on the stage should be investigated.
“As far as I am concerned, drinking alcohol in public is prohibited but distributing and selling them in public is not illegal according to Sri Lanka’s regulations. The President should be responsible in preventing such indecent concerts taking place in the country in the future,” he said.
He said when there were more westernized countries than Sri Lanka in the Asian continent why did the particular singer select Sri Lanka to perform his concert.
Mr. Gammanpila claimed that this was because there was a serious 'sexual demand’ among Sri Lanka’s younger generation.
Meanwhile, he said he would declare a black flag week from January 2 to 8 to mark the election of President Sirisena.
Mr. Gammanpila asked all motorists to display black flags during the week to show their objection to the President and the government.
He said if someone was scared of black defenders, black flags could be made their Facebook profile pictures. (Piyumi Fonseka)
