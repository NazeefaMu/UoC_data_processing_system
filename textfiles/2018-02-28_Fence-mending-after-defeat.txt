Fence-mending after defeat!


	



 

There is a yahapalanaya purohita hailing from Giruwapattu in the deep South where the family of the former strongman reigns supreme. 

 


Our man who once espoused the unity cause later fell out with the former boss and barbs also exchanged between them.


Vigorously campaigning for the hand and the betel leaf at the recent mini-polls fought on a major scale, he did not spare the former boss when launching broadsides against the splinter group. 
But alas!  The man lost both his electorate and the local body there. 


Following the election, the purohita is said to have made overtures to the political offspring of the former boss and on receiving a positive response had promised to go all the way for fence-mending, they say.
