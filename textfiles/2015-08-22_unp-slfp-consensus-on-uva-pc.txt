UNP-SLFP consensus on Uva PC


	

The two main parties are hoping to arrive at a consensus with regard to the appointment of the Uva Provincial Council's Chief Minister and the administration of the UPC, a politician said yesterday.
The post would fall vacant with its current Chief Minister Harin Fernando being elected to parliament at the August 17 general election.
Mr. Fernando told Daily Mirror yesterday he discussed the matter with President Maitripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“I consented to the appointment of a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) if it is the President's wish as well. I requested for two portfolios for the United National Party (UNP),” he said.
The President has agreed to sort out the matter in consultation with the UNP and the SLFP.
North Western Province Chief Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga were among the three chief ministers elected to parliament. (Kelum Bandara )
