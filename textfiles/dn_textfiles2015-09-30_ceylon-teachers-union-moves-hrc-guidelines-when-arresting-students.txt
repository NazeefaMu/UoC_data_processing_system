Ceylon Teachers' Union moves HRC for guidelines when arresting students

The Ceylon Teachers' Union requested the Human Rights Commission (HRC) yesterday to lay down guidelines to be followed when taking a school student into police custody. After filing a human rights violation case at the HRC following the incident of taking a student into custody allegedly by police in connection with the murder of the five year old girl at Kotadeniyawa, the HRC was requested to engage its attention in formulating an appropriate mechanism, Ceylon Teachers' Union Chief Secretary Joseph Stalin told Daily News.
Stalin added that there is no proper mechanism or a systematic process to be followed by security personnel when taking a student into custody or when a student is being questioned. This situation leads to a human rights violations of such students when in custody and moreover to a huge mental trauma.
Besides, the Ceylon Teachers' Union has requested the HRC to ascertain whether the human rights of the student had been violated, since it has been revealed that the student was kept in police custody for three days without making any record.
"We are not saying that students should not be taken into custody but there should be a proper guideline in this regard" he said.
He added that the conduct of the police is highly questionable since the police made various comments on the character of the student saying that he is a drug addict and a viewer of obscene videos. Therefore, the Ceylon Teachers' Union has requested the HRC to look into the conduct of the police. Accordingly, the OIC Kotadeniyawa, SSP of the area, IGP and the Chairperson of the Child Protection Authority had to bear the responsibility.
