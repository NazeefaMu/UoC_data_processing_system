Ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa's son Yoshitha, a Lieutenant in the Navy, and currently in remand custody on charges of financial irregularities at the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) would be sacked if found guilty of the charges, the Navy said today.

Navy Spokesman Akram Alavi said the Navy was also conducting two investigations in connection with Yoshitha's alleged unauthorized overseas travel and his involvement in politics while being a naval officer.

“Yoshitha had travelled abroad without the approval of the Navy Commander and had also engaged in political activities while being a naval officer. It was in the midst of these investigations that he was arrested on money laundering charges. He will be sacked from the Navy if found guilty of the money laundering charges,” Captain Alavi said.

The Defence Secretary had directed the Navy Commander to investigate how Yoshitha joined the Navy, how he received overseas scholarships, his alleged engagement in active politics and other activities while being a naval officer.

He joined the Navy in 2006 as a cadet officer and received his basic training at the Naval and Maritime Academy where he was promoted to Midshipmen and appointed aide-de-camp to his father the then president. He was commissioned as an Acting Sub Lieutenant in the Navy's Executive Branch in 2009.

The Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) questioned Yoshitha Rajapaksa at the Navy Headquarters on January 30, 2016 regarding alleged financial irregularities at the CSN.
Yoshitha and four others have been remanded until February 25. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
