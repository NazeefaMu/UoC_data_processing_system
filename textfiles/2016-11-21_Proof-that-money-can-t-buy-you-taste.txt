It was once a proud home decked out with gaudy wall paintings and other flamboyant works of art that would not have looked out of place in the movie Scarface.

But a series of eerie images have shown how a mansion in Woodstock, Georgia, has been left to rot with an overgrown garden, windows boarded up, a drained swimming pool and paint peeling from the walls.

The mansion was discovered by American photographer Jeff Hagerman who snapped the chilling pictures of the abandoned home. (Daily Mail)
