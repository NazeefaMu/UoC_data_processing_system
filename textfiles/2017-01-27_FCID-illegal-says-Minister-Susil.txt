FCID illegal says Minister Susil


	

I reiterate that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is illegal said the Minister of Science Technology and Research Susil Premajayantha yesterday.

Speaking further, he maintained that only those who are not conversant with the law are scared of these institutions and he was not one of them.

The minister made these remarks in reply to a question posed by journalists at a press briefing held at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.

He said that due to certain actions by the FCID, it led to certain individuals gaining popularity, especially when a minister or a MP is arrested and legal action is filed. He said this could translate into an election victory for the person instigating the arrest.

Referring to the formation of the FCID he said this was not an uncommon phenomenon as with the change of government new law enforcement arms also pop up.
