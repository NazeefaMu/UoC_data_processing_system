Reproduced below is the speech made by former Attorney General Shibly Aziz at the Conference of Attorneys General of ASIA PACIFIC held in Colombo hosted by the Attorney General’s Department.
The dilemma - balancing politics and the law

Given the increasing role of the law and judiciary in deciding fundamental rights in the 21st century, such as how to balance the right to privacy with the right to freedom of speech, or even to decide the fate of the leadership of a country (for instance, in Bush V Gore in the United States), it presents an opportune time to investigate how the crucial role of an Attorney General in different countries manifests itself.
It may be said at the outset the concept relating to the Attorney-General and expectation from the Office seems very similar in whatever jurisdictions you look at. At the same time it is accepted that there are noticeable differences in the matrixes in which he is appointed and operates,- whether as a political appointee or as a non political appointee, to that post.
Some jurisdictions openly make their Attorney-General a political appointee whereas some specifically stress the need for the appointee to be free of any political affiliations or ambitions However, all legal structures emphasize the need of the Attorney-General, however appointed, to be as apolitical in the carrying out of his functions.
Being the Chief Legal Advisor for the Government, without exception, forces the risk of facing allegations of bias, or a proclivity towards the interests of the appointing authority by any holder of that office – creating somewhat of a paradox.
It would seem appropriate to deal very briefly with the manner in which this role has been structured in a few different countries across this spectrum, as this would highlight the various issues and hassles which the holder of this High Office faces, given this dichotomy.
There really are three main categories. One, where the Attorney General is a member of the government (as in the case of the UK). Two, where the Attorney General is a political appointee but subject to vetting (as in the case of the USA). Three, where the AG is someone appointed by the executive branch, but without any vetting (the vast majority of other countries).
UK
In certain countries, as in England, one part of the Attorney General's role is that of a Cabinet Minister. He is a Member of Parliament and is therefore a political appointee. In this capacity the Minister is responsible for representing the interests and perspectives of the Ministry at Cabinet and vice versa.
The Attorney General for England and Wales is the chief legal adviser of the Crown , and a member of the Government. The Attorney General provides legal advice to the Government of the day.
The Attorney General oversees the small Attorney General's Office and also has responsibility for the Treasury Solicitor's Department. The Treasury Solicitor acts on behalf of the Attorney General when representation in court is required.
The Attorney General also has supervisory powers over prosecutions, including those mounted by the Crown Prosecution Service, headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions); the Serious Fraud Office; and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office.
India and Pakistan
In India, the Constitution of India, the Attorney General is not a political appointee. The Constitution does not place the Attorney General in the position of a Minister but elevates him to a significant position. Article 88 of the Constitution under the caption “Rights of Ministers and Attorney-General as respects Houses” - states that “every Minister and the Attorney-General for India shall have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of either House, any joint sitting of the Houses, and any committee of Parliament of which he may be named a member, but shall not by virtue of this Article be entitled to vote.” This appears to give him a pre-eminent role unlike the other public servants in so far as Parliament is concerned- though a vote is not given to him. He is certainly, with this right of audience, in a position to influence decisions of both Houses.
This provision in the Constitution of India is unlike that of the British Parliament, where though a member of the Cabinet, he does not have a right but only an ability to address the members of the body of which he is a member.
The office of the Attorney-General of Pakistan is created by art 100 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 . Article 100(1) of the Constitution vests the President of Pakistan with the power to ‘appoint a person, being a person qualified to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Attorney-General for Pakistan’.
Thus the AG could simply become a legal counsel for the current government that is engaged in defending the government rather than objectively advising on the law. Like as seen in many countries, this leads to the politicisation of the office and can divert the Attorney General from its original function.
Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, the Attorney General is not a member of the Cabinet nor is he given any special position vis a vis the Parliament except in the case of vetting Bills for Constitutionality. Nor is he able to address Parliament in any capacity.
At the 1984 Conference, the then Attorney-General Mr Shiva Pasupathy gave a short but vivid description of the position held by him. He said:
“… the Attorney-General is the lineal successor of the Advocate Fiscal and later, the King’s Advocate. It appears that during the Dutch period in our history, there was the Advocate Fiscal appointed by the Government of Batavia, who combined two different functions. In civil cases, he deliberated and voted as a judge: in criminal cases he was considered as the public prosecutor. During the British period that followed, when in 1802 the Supreme Court of Judicature was established, the office of Advocate Fiscal was retained. In the Charter of Justice in 1833, the Office of Advocate Fiscal underwent the transformation to that of King’s Advocate. It was 100 years ago, in 1884 that the office of Attorney-General was established by law consequent to a decision of the Supreme Court.”
In Sri Lanka the Attorney-General has under successive Constitutions after independence, retained his non-political status and did not become a member of the Cabinet. Hence, the need or the requirement for independence of his office never became the subject of debate or controversy. Whilst the need is accepted, whether the present procedures for appointment is satisfactory - with one factor being the unfettered discretion given to the President to appoint the holder - raises significant concerns as to whether the correct person gets appointed to this prestigious and important post.
Recently the appointments have been to the satisfaction of the Bar, which is the primary body to reflect on such matters, though the salutary provisions which were placed about 15 years ago to ensure this, were repealed, much to the chagrin and disappointment of the Legal Community in Sri Lanka. We hope the earlier provisions will be reinstated with more safeguards built into them to ensure the correct appointments to this office and also very importantly the higher judicial offices, the lack of which has eroded the public confidence in the delivery of justice.
The last many years have witnessed a growing public awareness of the critical role of the Law Officers in the Constitutional framework of Government.
The office of the Attorney-General stands at the intersection of Government and Parliament, the Courts and the Executive, the unofficial Bar and the Public Prosecutor, the State and the citizens. The conflicting pressure inherent in the hybrid nature of the office have made us in Sri Lanka keep the Office of Attorney-General apart from the Legislature and as a separate department of State functioning under the Attorney-General himself, so that his role remains, as far as practicable, independent.
Speaking of the United Kingdom, in 1948 when it was urged that the Attorney-General should not appear before the Lynskey Tribunal appointed to inquire into allegations of corruption against certain members of the Attlee Government Sir Hartley Shawcross the Attorney-General thought otherwise. As he subsequently wrote.
“It was the duty (however personally unpleasant) of His Majesty’s Attorney-General to represent the public interest with complete objectivity and detachment and that to refuse to discharge that duty in a particular case in which the public interest might be suspected to conflict with the interests of certain of his friends or his political colleagues would be tantamount to saying that the office itself was inadequate to represent and protect the public interest against who sever might challenge it.”
Sir Hartley Shawcross emphasised that it was the Attorney-General’s duty to be wholly detached,wholly independent and to accept the implications of an obligation to protect what “he conceives to be the public interest whatever the political results may be.”
Speaking in the House of Commons in 1951 Sir Hartley Shawcross maintained that when a prosecution may concern a question of public policy or national or international importance the Attorney-General has to make up his mind not as a party politician, but must in a quasi-judicial way consider the effect of prosecution upon the administration of law and of Government in the abstract. He said:
“The responsibility for the eventual decision rests with the Attorney-General, and he is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter. Nor, of course, can the Attorney-General shift his responsibility for making the decision on to the shoulders of his colleagues. If political considerations which in the broad sense that I have indicated affect Government in the abstract, it is the Attorney-General, applying his judicial mind, who has to be the sole judge”.
Prosecution of criminal offences
In Sri Lanka, the Attorney-General has very broad power over the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. Investigations carried out by police and magistrates are subject to the Attorney-General’s control and direction. Likewise decisions to indict or not in cases of serious offences and the precise framing of charges and consequent prosecution lie fully within the Attorney-General’s control. The Attorney-General thus holds a central position within the criminal justice system and plays a critical role. The effective exercise of accountability within the criminal justice system requires the Attorney-General to act effectively and independently, as well as the actual existence of a legal framework that permits the Attorney-General to so proceed. This would also apply to any cases of violations during the final stages of a war, as the one we had recently.
The independence of the Attorney-General’s Department has been challenged at particular points in the country’s history. It has been said, and I agree to some extent , recently been weakened; an issue of particular relevance was if that office should assume investigations into senior members of the Government or military for the final stages of the war. Another blow followed the 2010 elections, a gazette notification setting out each ministry’s functions and responsibilities removed both the Attorney-General’s Department and the Legal Draftsman’s Department, whose primary task us drafting new laws, from the Ministry of Justice where they had been previously located. As newly “unlisted” departments, these departments now fall under direct presidential control by virtue if Article 44(2) f the Constitution, and were organisationally located in the Presidential Secretariat.
I believe every AG has realized at some stage of his career that work and the responsibilities indeed can be very painful and can take a toll. Unless of course, you adjust to your role and envisage it as nothing but giving proper and considered legal advice to those who seek it- in this case the Government. Not what your client wants to hear – but what you, in your professional wisdom distilled over the years, thinks what should be given- taking into consideration your clients interests as well as that of the public- with both interests firmly rooted in the law and the Rule of Law.
I believe this is what every fair minded and competent Attorney General aspired or aspires to do, and to a very substantial degree often succeeds in balancing these interests.
No Attorney General can and will ever achieve a perfect harmony in balancing these interests. He or she must resolutely endeavour to do so.
Through time growing up in the Department and by imbibing its traditions and its ways of doing things,the holder becomes qualified in every way to discharge his duties when he or she reaches the pinnacle of office in that Department.
violating legal principles
The Attorney General traditionally has the duty (as recently put very quaintly by the current English Attorney General) (I quote) “to keep the Government and its actions within the circle of justice”(unquote). He must (I quote) ‘police its boundaries” (unquote) and ensure that the Government does not stray out of these. But this does not mean that his role ought to be considered as negative or disruptive of government policies – he must as every public servant be loyal and supportive of the Government and its endeavours – and like every such public servant point out where it is going outside proper governance- and in the case of the Attorney General ‘outside the circle of justice”. He must give his robust and independent advice –tell the Government the manner in which its goals can be achieved without violating legal principles or stepping on legal toes - and this is what AGs in the past have done. It is only then that the post is respected and the advice looked forward to by Governments.
Though one may express these sentiments in the ratified atmosphere we find ourselves in this hall today, avoiding political turmoil and criticism is not easy and the job is indeed tricky. Any rabid politicisation of the office by its holder increasingly diverts the functionary into turbulent waters and prevents him from performing its original function. The politicisation has taken its toll on some holders of the office of the AG in this country as elsewhere.
We all know the story of Lord Goldsmith, Attorney General in the later Blair Government, whose name may never recover from the controversy over his advice on the legality of the Iraq war. At first hesitant about the grounds for invasion, he later gave it grudging endorsement, but only after possibly being pressed into doing so by the Blair Government.
A few Attorneys General have been tarnished with some being called the quintessential ‘hit men’: the history of every country is replete with such aberrations.
Whilst undue loyalty to the Government may cause miscarriages of justice, what is perceived as a failure to appreciate the concerns of the Government may cause similar predicaments for the holder, as the previous English Attorney General found out when he was perceived by his own party as being too subservient to the European Parliament and its Judiciary. He was removed and replaced.
The present English Attorney Generals decision not to refer the five year and nine month sentence given to Rolf Harris to the Court of Appeal, as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it, had its own detractors.
There are various components of the Attorney General's role. The Attorney General has unique responsibilities to the Crown, the courts, the Legislature and the executive branch of government. While there are different emphases and nuances attached to these there is a general theme throughout all the various aspects of the Attorney General's responsibilities that the office has a constitutional and traditional responsibility beyond that of a political minister or as Chief Legal Advisor to the Government.
Some Attorney Generals have supported the government's view. Some have cautioned government on what they have done or proposed to do. But each incident stressed the independent judgment and accountability of the Attorney General.
The Attorney General has to keep the political aspects linked to development and social needs also in mind when his services are availed of by the Government. This is specifically so when his services are sought in the area of economic and social development where he and his Department may get involved in suggesting and drafting laws or expressing opinions in these areas. In the wake of Asia's striking economic progress, issues of law and governance are now seen as critical for the developing, developed and post-conflict states of Asia. The development of law in Asia from the perspective of law reform initiatives intended to create ‘development’ in its various aspects - economic, social, and political. The emphasis will be on rule-of-law entrenchment, good governance reforms, and constitutional change. The relationship between law and economic development has been a central concern of modern social theory. Today, the relationship of law and economic development is again at the very forefront of development policymaking, as government agencies, international organizations, and the non-profit sector advocate the need for strengthening the rule of law in developing countries. Can they sustain economic progress and satisfy the demands for the control of corruption and abuses of powers, and the creation of new forms of accountability.
The questions concerning the role of law in Asian economic development are absolutely crucial to development policy and the Attorney General of today cannot distance himself from playing a positive role in this endeavour. His efforts in this area has to be supported by a well trained set of officers with full exposure to world wide developments in these areas, second to none in their field, which I truly believe has been the case here in our country. After all these officers are our lawyers who represent or advice on matters on behalf of the country and us.
Conclusion
A very percipient observation of our Supreme Court made a few decades earlier (which related to the correctness of a Government decision to permit officers of our Department to private practice).
“The Attorney-General of his Country is the leader of the Bar and the highest Legal Officer of the State. As Attorney-General he has a duty to Court, to the State and to the subject to be wholly detached, wholly independent and to act impartially with the sole object of establishing the truth. It is for that reason that all Courts in this Island request the appearance of the Attorney General as amicus curiae when the Court requires assistance, which assistance has in the past been readily given. That image will certainly be tarnished if he takes part in private litigation arising out of private disputes. I cannot but agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that there are constraints on the Attorney-General engaging in private practice in the civil law as well as the criminal law. It is regrettable that the State has sought to act counter to tradition, (prudence and propriety) in granting the Attorney General and his law officers the right of private practice. Justice is the loser thereby. No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other- or he will hold to one and dispose the other. No Attorney-General can serve both State and private litigant” (Grand Central Case-1981)
In my view however tricky the role is, the discipline of the law which the Attorney General has been subjected to over the years should make the holder resilient and capable of discharging his duties adroitly and with acceptance to the large majority. This training in the law and exposure to time tested legal principles and adherence to them, would undoubtedly be his shield to protect him from unfair and scurrilous allegations. His ability to rely on them in formulating his thinking will protect him. In other words he must not be dishonest or arbitrary in his approach; that is the way to balance the competing demands of the role and serve in the best interests of the people of the country and the government that serves them.
