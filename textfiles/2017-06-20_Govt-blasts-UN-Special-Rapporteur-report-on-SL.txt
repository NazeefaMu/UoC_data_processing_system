Govt. blasts UN Special Rapporteur report on SL


	

While rejecting the allegations made by UN Special Rapporteur on Independence of Judges, Monica Pinto in her report to United Nations Human Rights Council on Sri Lanka's judicial system, the government today said the report was a violation of the country's sovereignty.

“We are surprised by the allegations made by her who was in Sri Lanka for only seven days. Her knowledge on the judicial systems of various countries is questionable " Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said making a statement in Parliament claiming that he is revealing the official stance of the government on Ms. Pinto's report.

“This report will tarnish Sri Lanka's image and violate the country's sovereignty,” he said.

The minister said Ms. Pinto's remarks on the Constitutional Council was unacceptable.

"Ms Pinto in her report has alleged that the Constitutional Council is not independent as all appointments are made by the President. What she does not know is that the President can make the appointments only if the Constitutional Council approves them" the minister said.

He said the allegation made by Ms. Pinto that the Constitutional Council was far from being independent as it comprised politicians was unfair as the representatives of the people wanted politicians appointed to it. “Appointments to such bodies should be made according to the wishes of the people and not according to whims and fancies of any foreign organization," the minister said in this regard.

He said Ms. Pinto's suggestion that the Attorney General should conduct investigations on crime was also unacceptable as it was not a norm practiced by any country in the globe.

"Ms Pinto has probably included information provided to her by NGOs,” the minister alleged and added that the government had already made arrangements to notify its stance on the UN Special Rapporteurs report through relevant diplomatic channels. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
