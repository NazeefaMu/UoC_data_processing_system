The Consular Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry today said they had got approval from the family of Mohamed Siyan Shihabdeen (32), a Sri Lankan expatriate worker who was allegedly stabbed to death by his room-mate in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia a few days ago, to bury his body in Saudi according to Islamic religious traditions.

Mr. Shihabdeen, a resident of Kekirawa, had been working as a glass cutter in a private firm in Yanbu.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, an official from the Consular Affairs Division said the victim’s body would be buried after police investigations into his death were concluded. The police investigation report had not yet been issued, the official said. “Therefore, we cannot give any details as to how the death occurred, and who was involved in it,” he said.

However, Arab news said the Yanbu Police had already arrested a Yemeni worker who was working in the same shop as Mr. Shihabdeen. (Piyumi Fonseka)
