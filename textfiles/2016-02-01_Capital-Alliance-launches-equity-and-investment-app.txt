Capital Alliance (CAL), Sri Lanka’s leading full service investment bank, is about to turn a page in Sri Lanka’s financial markets. In today’s world, people can do almost anything with their smartphones or tablet devices. From checking email, to staying connected via social media, to turning off the lights in the house while out on the town, people rely heavily on their handheld devices. Adding another to this list CAL is launching its new and unique mobile application for trading ‘CAL Online’. CAL Online is the one-stop shop for your trading and investment needs.

The app provides you access to real-time information on equity and debt markets at your fingertips and the ability to trade real-time in a seamless manner off your mobile or your tablet. The users are not required to hold an account with CAL to use the app and gain access to market data on shares, bonds and CAL’s unit trusts.

However, CAL accountholders are provided with premium features such as the ability to trade on-the-go, CAL investment recommendations to clients on a real-time basis and the ability to manage individual portfolios. With the launch of this app anyone who has a smartphone will be able to test their hand at trading and investing. You can essentially buy, sell or just stay in touch with all your investments while you wait, it may be while you’re travelling or even when you’re stuck at a meeting. CAL Online also provides you financial independence, granting access to the capital markets at your own discretion without having to rely on intermediaries.

“We are immensely proud to be the first to launch a seamlessly integrated app of this kind to broaden the horizons of investment and trading in Sri Lanka. A mechanism which both increases transparency and empowers investors is the need of the hour and we believe this app delivers on these requirements. It is this ability to attune and align ourselves to our clients’ needs that has enabled CAL to become a dynamic force in Sri Lanka’s financial markets today,” said CAL Managing Director Ajith Fernando. CAL has built a reputation for itself as a market leader by consistently delivering excellence in execution, world-class research and product innovation. The company’s ethos of being ‘the preferred partner in financial markets’ is built on the deep relationships it enjoys with its clients, regulators and stakeholders alike.

CAL Online will be available for both iOS and android platforms on App Store and Google Play. CAL Group of Companies delivers integrated and customized financial and investment solutions for a diverse portfolio of clients. CAL’s service offering also includes investments and wealth management, fixed income securities, investment banking and equity brokering.

This mix of expertise allows CAL to offer integrated and customized solutions to its customers across the entire financial spectrum. The company strives to build lasting relationships with all of its clients, in order to acquire an in-depth understanding of their needs and goals. CAL comprises a dynamic team of individuals with extensive local and international market experience. Since its inception in 2000, CAL has built a reputation for itself as a market leader, capable of continuously meeting client expectations and delivering excellence in research, ethical dealing, confidentiality and product innovation.
