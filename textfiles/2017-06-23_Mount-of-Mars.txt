BY A.S. Fernando.
The Mount of Mars is two-fold. In fact, there are two Mounts of Mars in two separate locations on the palm. The elevated area located under the Mount of Mercury between the Head and the Heart Lines is called the Upper Mars or the Progressive Mars. 


The area between the Life line and the Mount of Venus is called the Lower Mars or the Regressive Mars. The centre of the palm is called the Plain of Mars.


Each area of Mars has its special influence which makes the reading of Mounts of Mars more difficult than reading other mounts.


Those on whose hands the Mounts of Mars are well developed and are more prominent than other Mounts are called Martians.

 

Leading characteristics
The leading characteristics Martians possess are courage, self-confidence, resolution and the ability to command others. Division of Martian qualities is represented by the two Mounts of Mars. Martians are fighters by nature. They are of two types: those who fight to defend themselves and those who love to fight for the fun of it or due to the natural propensity to fight.

 

Resistive power and aggressive power
Those Martians who fight to defend themselves possess the resistive power and those who love to fight possess the aggressive power. Martians who are resistive by nature have a more prominent Upper Mars and those possessing the aggressive power are identified by a more prominent Lower Mars. Those with equally developed Upper Mars and Lower Mars are both resistive and aggressive.

 

Hot-tempered
A well-developed Plain of Mars crossed with many fine lines shows that the owner is very hot tempered. This means that a person with well- developed Mounts and a Plain of Mars crossed with many fine lines is a very dangerous person whom you have to handle with care!

 

Cowards
If the Mounts of Mars are hardly noticeable on a palm, the owner is considered a coward.

 

Stature of Martians
The stature of a Martian is above the average. He is of medium height, strongly built and looks capable of looking after himself. He is energetic, generous and fond of making friends. Though resolute, he is amenable too. Opposition or inimical attitude would turn him into a fierce fighter. There are bad Martians. You find them among drunkards and criminals.
