After holding the discussion with the Railways unions this evening the Railway Technical Services Trade Union Committee (RTSTUC) said they had decided to launch an indefinite train strike from Wednesday (29) midnight.

Union’s Secretary Saman Pieris told Daily Mirror that they were planning to launch the strike from tonight, but their decision would affect the rail commuters who are planning to visit Kandy to witness ‘Dalada Easala Perahera’ and it will inconvenience Advance level examination.

“We cannot hold someone to ransom as Dalada Perahera and G.C.E. Advance level examination are being held at this moment,” he said.

Therefore we decided to resume our trade union action on next Wednesday (29) midnight.
 
He said they were summoned for a discussion with the President today at the Presidents Secretariat and it was a futile discussion.

“The President told us to be patient for two months until the Sarath Amunugama ministerial committee submitted its report,” Mr. Pieris said.

The union had decided to call off the strike following a discussion with the President on August 12. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
