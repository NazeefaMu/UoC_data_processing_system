UNP is ready to face any election to be conducted next year, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.

Mr Kiriella said this at a function held to mark the distribution of title deeds to plantation sector workers in the Kandy District on Tuesday.

He said there would be a Presidential Election before the end of the next year.

Also, he said it would be preceded by the elections to the Provincial Councils.

“The United National Party will not while away from any of these elections. We are ready to face any election,” he said.

He said it was a UNP Government that agreed to the citizenship of plantation sector Tamils. (Kelum Bandara)
