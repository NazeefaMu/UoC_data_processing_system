The ritual of breaking coconuts performed by the ‘joint opposition’ members at the Seenigama Devalaya to invoke a divine curse   on yahapalanaya is a subject still reverberating in political circles.

 


There was a move by another group of political activists to stage a counter-ritual the same day, but the Police intervention aborted it. 


It has now leaked out that a certain powerful figure with close ties to the government had a special Pooja conducted in secret at a Kovil in the city the same night to ward off the possible malefic effects generated by the breaking of coconuts at Seenigama earlier in the day!
