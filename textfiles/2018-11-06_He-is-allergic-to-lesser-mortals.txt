He is allergic to lesser mortals!


	

The main character in this story is a learned gent serving as the private secretary to a bigwig at the august assembly.

 


Whenever this high-up wants to consult a doctor at the medical centre of the assembly, he would first ring up the Officer-in-Charge of the centre to ask him to clear the place of all other hoi polloi to come there for treatment.


He would fly into a rage if he found an employee of the assembly present at the centre whenever he comes there to consult the doctor on duty, they say.


Some employees meekly leave the place when they are told that so and so is coming for consultation. But there are some others who would refuse to leave saying, “We are too here for what he is coming for!”
