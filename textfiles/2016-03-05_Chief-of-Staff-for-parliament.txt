Chief of Staff for parliament


	

A new post of Chief of Staff has been created in Parliament for the first time in its history with Deputy Secretary General Neil Iddawala being appointed to this post.

The Cabinet has approved the creation of the new post when it met on Wednesday with Prime Minister presenting a paper on behalf of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

Mr. Iddawala said the Cabinet had created the post in line with accepted procedure.

He said he would most probably be in charge of coordinating the staff though a job description was not prepared yet. Mr. Iddawala will function in his new post in addition to being the Deputy Secretary General of Parliament. However, he is yet to receive his letter of appointment.

This will be one of the few changes that are to be made with regard to Parliament in the wake of setting up oversight committees, proving office space for all MPs and handing over the Agriculture Ministry building to Parliament and eventually making it a part of the parliamentary complex.
