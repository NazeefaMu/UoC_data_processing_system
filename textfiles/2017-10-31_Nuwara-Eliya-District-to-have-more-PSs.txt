Nuwara Eliya District to have 4 more PSs


	

The Cabinet today granted approval to carve out four more local authorities or Pradeshiya Sabhas (PSs) in the Nuwara-Eliya District.

This move is being carried out at the request of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), a political ally of the government. Currently the PS' are within Nuwara-Eliya and Ambagamuwa.

Currently, there are 334 local authorities and it is uncertain how and where the new PS will be set up prior to the local government elections expected in January, 2018. (Kelum Bandara)
