In response to New York Times article titled ‘How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port’, MP Namal Rajapaksa today said the article has many inaccuracies.

“Acknowledging the Port is near one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes shows, why it’s still a major focus for the West, fearing China’s growing global influence. Country’s assets shouldn’t be used as geopolitical pawns in this power struggle,” he tweeted.
