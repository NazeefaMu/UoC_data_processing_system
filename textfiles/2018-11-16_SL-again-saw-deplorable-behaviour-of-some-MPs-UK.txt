British High Commissioner James Dauris today said Sri Lankans have again seen deplorable behaviour by some MPs, unbecoming of them and of the Parliament.

“Voters across Sri Lanka elected Members of Parliament to do an important job. But Sri Lankans have again seen deplorable behaviour by some MPs, unbecoming of them and of their noble institution. No parliament can perform its role when its own members stop it from doing so,” he said in a tweet.
