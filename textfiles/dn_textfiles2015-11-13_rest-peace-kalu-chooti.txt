Rest in Peace: Kalu Chooti

I used to refer to her as 'my chubby ball of fur' and when I first went to Arpico Battaramulla and saw her, I was like "that's too puffy for a welcome carpet". But then when I looked in closer, I realized that the 'carpet' was in fact a doggy having the best naps ever and that too at the footsteps of this supermarket.
Being an animal lover and when I see dogs, my first reaction is go pet them, hug them and just have a little chit chat with them (some people think I am cuckoo because I do that). But when I saw her, I didn't want to disturb her peaceful slumber (though I really did want to feel how comfortable she is over there).
Little did I know about her, till my friend who lives in Rajagiriya and frequents this Arpico told me "ahh, yea...she's always there and no one bothers her as well so is safe". That's all I needed to hear. That she is safe and happy there.
I got to know recently that her name is Arpico Kalu Chooti. She was named by Uncle Nihal (he's the one who has dedicated his life to feeding our four legged friends in that area) and was one of Uncle's best friends. This young girl has been at Arpico since they started their construction work. When Uncle Nihal met this beauty 13 years ago, she was pregnant. After she littered, the pups were adopted one by one and Uncle Nihal adopted one girl who is now 12 years old and is still with him.
Everyday Uncle Nihal would visit her which strengthened their friendship. This friendship was so strong that even when other volunteers came to feed her she would wait until Uncle himself came for her to eat. Like one says grace before they have a meal, Chooti would look at Uncle's face before eating.
People would walk in and out of Arpico always giving Chooti a look or two. She would sit and watch the world pass by and not bother a single person. There was a man named Mohamed who wasn't a guard but was there to check on other work and would call her Blacky, bathe her weekly and make sure she looks good always.
Three weeks ago she was not feeling well and there was a kind lady who came and gave her medicine and breakfast. Since she was old, her body was feeling it too. The last time I saw her was a month ago and she was once again sleeping it off. I was told the guards had made her special four foot pen for her to stay safe and sound.
Sadly, last weekend I got a message from my friend that the Arpico Doggy has passed away. It seems that one of their delivery trucks had knocked her down. Uncle Nihal was alerted immediately and he rushed to her side. She had internal bleeding and was quite weak and she breathed her last breath by uncle's side.
Uncle Nihal misses her truly and he had this message that the Off-Road Feeding Programme would like to share with you'll.
"Yes as you said there is lot of sadness and emptiness in the air. She was the biggest strength for me to continue to do the feeding long years ago. Almost everyday before leaving her l used to pet her, give soothing loving words "mage Sudu rattharn, mage wasthuwa, mage manika kaala hondata doi ganna aiya hettath enawa good night'. Then she used to lick my hands with lot of love and said good night by looking at my eyes and booo booo to me several times before l disappear into darkness. In a way l was happy that she had her last breath in my hands and to find a quiet burial under the palm trees. Most of the times it reminds me of the beautiful moments l had with her. Take care may God bless you."
Aprico Kalu Chooti was buried at the private garden of one Dharmaratne who was kind enough to give that space as her forever resting place.
We all miss you Chooti. I hope you have found all our dear friends over the Rainbow Bridge and finally settled down. Till we meet again.
