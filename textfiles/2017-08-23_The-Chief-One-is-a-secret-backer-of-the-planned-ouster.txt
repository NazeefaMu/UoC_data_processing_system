The Chief One is a secret backer of the planned ouster!


	



A move is afoot to oust the Western Provincial purohita handling the subject of Education through a no confidence motion.


By the way, a prominent one lost his portfolio in the recent past when a similar no confidence motion was passed in the council.


As a prelude to the motion to be moved, a plan is underway to defeat the Ministry’s expenditure vote when it is presented in the council come the annual Budget in another three months. 


A sizable section of the council membership has already signed the motion now being circulated behind the scene.  The JO group in the council is in the forefront of this move, they say. A lesser known fact about this drama is that the provincial chief one who is still nursing a grudge over the loss of the education subject he coveted much, is too secretly backing the planned ouster.
