Peace bid draws an angry response!


	

A Diyawanna member currently occupied with writing a book on ‘Government’, made an unsuccessful bid to bring about reconciliation between two former party leaders now at loggerheads.

 


The member had recently called on a former Blue party leader at his official residence in a posh residential area in the city to obtain some information for his book. While discussing matters related to the book, the member had expressed his desire to restore goodwill between the host and the other former leader. 


The proposition had highly annoyed the host who had retorted: “I know a lot about the Raja…s which you may not know. Remember that there are more issues involving them than those appearing on the surface now. Therefore, don’t talk to me about him hereafter…”
