The Joint Opposition (JO) today said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera should apologise to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa for falsely accusing him of allowing the sale of fuel for higher prices when the prices of crude oil were low in the world market.

JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said Minister Samaraweera has charged that the price of a crude oil barrel was USD 40 in the world market but former president Rajapaksa had given a litre of patrol for Rs.122 during his time.

“This is completely false. The highest crude oil barrel prices were reported in 2008 which was USD 146 for seven months. It was only in December 2008, the price went down to USD 34. Throughout the year 2008, the average price of a crude oil barrel was USD 97. When the situation was like this, we gave a litre of petrol for Rs.120,” he told a news briefing.

He said the statements made by a minister of importance such as Finance Minister Samaraweera should consist of truthful facts.

“Minister Samaraweera recently said drug smugglers try to cover their sins by holding high positions in various organizations such as Rotary club and Lions clubs. Later on, he apologised for mentioning the names of the two clubs. Similarly, we urge him to apologise to Mr. Rajapaksa for making false statements,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
