Zimbabwe have recruited Makhaya Ntini and Marvan Atapattu to be assistant coach and batting consultant respectively, according to a report published today on the Zimbabwe Cricket website. The report says Ntini has been given a two-year contract, while Atapattu has been roped in for the duration of Zimbabwe's tour to Bangladesh starting from January 15.
Ntini, 38, has played 101 Tests, 173 ODIs and 10 T20Is for South Africa over a period of 13 years. ZC says he will begin work from February 16, while former bowling coach Douglas Hondo has been reassigned to the Zimbabwe A team.
Atapattu, a former Sri Lanka captain and coach, may succeed Andy Waller as Zimbabwe's batting coach. Currently, he is only a consultant but his "contract will be reviewed after the Zimbabwe tour of Bangladesh, with a view to entering into a longer relationship," the Zimbabwe Cricket report said.
