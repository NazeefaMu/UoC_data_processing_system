 In its onward journey towards seamless, efficient, digitally enhanced in-branch customer experience, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB)’s customer centre in Hulftsdorp, moved across the road to a new 
modern building. 
The opening was officiated by HNB Chairman President’s Counsel Rienzie Arseculeratne and HNB Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo in the presence of many distinguished guests including legal luminaries such as Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) President U.R. De Silva and Law College Principal P.I. Samarasinghe amidst several corporate and legal personalities. 
Arseculeratne, addressing the guests said, “We are committed to becoming a bank that has the customers’ needs at the heart of everything we do and this is one of the many deliverables of this goal - every step is aimed at building HNB as the ‘Go-To’ bank - the destination of choice for our customers and clients.”        
“HNB has been reshaping its customer centre network across the country, improving infrastructure and technology to offer unparallel customer experience and helping them prosper into the future. Upgrading all branches to be totally digitally enabled is part of the bank’s overall transformation strategy,” said Arsecularatne.
The new Hulftsdorp customer centre will also offer customers convenient access to advanced banking solutions and will have an online cash deposit machine plus an ATM, which will allow customers to perform multiple value-adding functions, such as cash withdrawals, bill payments, balance inquiries, viewing of mini-statements, inter-account transfers, real-time cash deposits, cheque and card deposits, etc.
