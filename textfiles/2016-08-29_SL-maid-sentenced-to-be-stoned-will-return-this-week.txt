The 45-year-old Sri Lankan woman whose death sentence by stoning for adultery, was commuted by the Saudi Arabian government last December, will return to Sri Lanka this week, the Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) confirmed today.

The FEB said she will be deported from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after completing her term of imprisonment.

The woman had been working in Saudi Arabia as a housemaid when she had been sentenced to be stoned to death after being convicted for adultery with a Sri Lankan youth employed there.

The youth who had having the affair with Lankan woman had been given 100 lashes as punishment.

Later on, the Sri Lankan Government filed an appeal before the Riyad Court in Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the female domestic worker. As a result of the government’s intervention pleading sympathetic consideration in the case, the Saudi Arabian government commuted the death sentence, imposing a jail term of three years.

At the time she was imprisoned, she had already spent one and half years in jail.

Another one and half years needed to be spent in jail. However, according to the FEB reports, her term of imprisonment was to end in June next year.

According to the Foreign Employment Ministry information, eight women have been sentenced to death in Lebanon, one had been sentenced to be stoned to death and one woman had been murdered in Kuwait. (Piyumi Fonseka)
