Do not follow orders from pseudo ministers: JVP


	

JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said that right now there is no constitutionally elected government, a cabinet or a Prime Minister and therefore, public servants must be extremely careful when carrying out orders from pseudo ministers.

“They may claim to be Ministers, but none of them have been appointed or elected in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Constitution and therefore their orders to state institutions and public officials are illegal”, he said.

He sounded the alarm on public officials and said they must think twice before carrying out orders from members of a bogus cabinet.

“You are bound only by the Financial, Administrative Regulations and the instructions and guidelines of the Establishment Code. As such you must not follow illegal orders given by a politician who claims to be a Minister. If you do so, you will be in trouble in future,” he further stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
