The Cobra has been an object of vivid imagination from very ancient times. It figures in various contexts in Hindu and Egyptian mythology. In fact, there is a reference to a King Cobra named Muchalinda in Buddhist literature as well. 

 


It may greatly surprise you to hear that the mystical King Cobra that fired the imagination of our ancients and occupied a place of pride in mythology has entered the life of one of our prominent politicos live and real in a big way!


A legal expert who once held very high office in the country’s judiciary, this politico is currently heading a provincial administration.


While addressing a public rally in his province, the politico had revealed about a King Cobra that serves him as his guiding spirit.   


“This King Cobra was my pathfinder when I was serving in the judiciary and it continues to show me the way even after coming into politics,” he told a wide-eyed audience.  The politico had also said that King Cobra had come to his rescue whenever he had to face a crisis in life.


The politico’s friendly King Cobra has become the main topic that people in the province are said to be discussing excitedly these days. And some of them even wonder whether it was his King Cobra which advised him to change his political direction as well.
