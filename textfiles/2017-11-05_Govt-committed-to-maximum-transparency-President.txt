Many development projects had been implemented islandwide today allocating a huge amount of money and the present Government was committed to ensure maximum transparency when implementing those development projects, President Maithripala Sirisena said.

He recalled that he left the previous Government because he was against fraud and corruption, and added that in this Government too, irrespective of political differences, legal actions would be taken against all the wrongdoers as it was the main characteristic of the concept of Good Governance.

President Sirisena made these remarks participating at a ceremony to open the newly constructed building at the Elahera District Secretariat on Saturday.

“We can see some officials are reluctant to take decisions in the process of development. No State official should be scared to fulfill their respective responsibilities honestly.

President Sirisena vested several development projects in the Elahera- Bakamuna area with the public and students.

The three-storied building, built at the Mahasen Maha Vidyalaya in Bakamuna was vested with the students by President Sirisena.

The new building has two Technical Units and eight classrooms and was constructed at a cost of Rs.16.8 million.

Nalaka Kolonne MP, Co-President of the Elahera Provincial Coordination Committee Amarawansha Mohotti, the staff of the school including the Principal Gamini Samarakoon, parents, past pupils and others participated. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
