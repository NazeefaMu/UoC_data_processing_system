Former minister Wimal Weerawansa arrived at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) a short while ago in connection with the misappropriation of Rs.1 billion in public funds.

A PRECIFAC spokesman said a statement would be recorded from Mr. Weerawansa with regard to the fraud and corruption that had taken place in the institutions under his ministry.

He said a complaint had been received by the commission alleging that Mr. Weerawansa had given vehicles and fuel from the Engineering Corporation to his personnel staff without following a proper procedure and had given houses and shops to his kith and kin causing a loss of Rs.1 billion to the Government.
