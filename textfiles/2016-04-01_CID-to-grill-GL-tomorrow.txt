The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will record a statement from former External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris tomorrow at 10.00 p.m. over his remarks about the discovery of suicide jackets, explosives and some ammunition at a house in Chavakachcheri, Jaffna recently.

The former minister said there was speculation these were intended for Colombo, and that the authorities concerned should investigate it thoroughly.

Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunatilake at a Cabinet briefing said, the former Minister should be questioned over what he said.

Asked for comments, Prof. Peiris said he was delighted to give a statement to the CID and asked whether this was the government's priority when the national security was at stake.

He said the whole matter seemed to have been politicized. (Kelum Bandara)
