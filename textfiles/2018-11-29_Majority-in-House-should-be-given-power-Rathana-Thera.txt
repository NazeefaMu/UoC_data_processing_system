MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today the faction which commands majority in parliament should be given powers to form a government and that the President could not halt it.

The prelate told that parliament cannot be maintained without the confidence of majority.

"If someone from the UNP commands majority in parliament, President cannot halt it. If we are for upholding democracy, parliament cannot be run without the confidence of the majority," he said.

The Thera said a caretaker government with all parties should be formed for a period of three to six months and go for an election as a solution to the current political standoff.

"This crisis cannot be resolved by blaming the President. When there was no agreement among the executive, legislature and the judiciary, it leads to political impasse," he said.

The issue of the electoral system leads to disagreement between the legislature and the judiciary, Ven. Rathana Thera added. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
