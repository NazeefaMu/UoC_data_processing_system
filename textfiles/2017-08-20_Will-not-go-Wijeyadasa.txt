Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the he did not have any intention of resigning from the Ministerial post just because some people made allegations against him on various issues.

Speaking to journalists after meeting the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter the Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thera and Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter the Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera, he said that he had responded to all the allegations levelled against him

Explaining what happened at the UNP Working Committee meeting last week where he was said o have been criticised by many Ministers, Mr. Rajapakshe told the Asgiriya Prelate that many people behaved and shouted for about two hours compelling him to wonder whether this was the political party founded by the late Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake.

"All what I have to say is that I cannot agree with the selling of national assets whether it is done under the name of selling or leasing. Ninety nine year lease period means four generations," the Minister exclaimed.

He added when the Central, Sabaragamuwa and Western Regional Transport Boards were privatised in 2003 for Rs. 860 million he retrieved them for the State through a legal action in the Supreme Court arguing with many Presidential Counsels.

"Presidential Counsels appeared for money but I fought for the country. It was a great victory for me," he said.

He observed that he had come under mud-slinging and vindictive attacks these days but he patiently watched the situation.

The journalists were not allowed to cover minster's meeting with Malwatte Prelate.

Speaking to the media after his audience with the two Mahanayake Theras, Mr. Rajapakshe stated that he never told that he would resign and neither would he do so.

“It was up to the President to take a decision,” he said.

When asked about the remarks made by the members of the Joint Opposition supporting him he said that they might be speaking according to their conscience.

Responding to a question as to whether he would join the Joint Opposition the Minister stated that he was still a UNP Minister.

Recalling the recent opposition by the SLFP MPs against the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution just 48 hours after the Cabinet agreed upon it, he said these were the occasions of breach of collective responsibility of the Cabinet.

"But some people accuse that I have breached the collective responsibility of the Cabinet, when I said that national assets should not be sold to foreigners," he charged. (L.B.Senarathna and J.A.L.Jayasinghe)
