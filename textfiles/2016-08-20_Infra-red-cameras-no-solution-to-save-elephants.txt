Infra-red cameras no solution to save elephants


	

Several environmentalists said yesterday the Wildlife Conservation Department’s proposal to install infra-red cameras on trains in an attempt to save elephants from being run over was not practical.

Pubudu Weerarathna of the Species Conservation Centre said infra-red cameras or thermal imaging cameras were not only expensive but also required constant maintenance by skilled personnel.

“Moves of this nature are not longstanding solutions to the crisis. Probably someone will enjoy a huge commission by importing and installing these cameras. Maybe that’s why they have come up with the proposal now. Though an infra-red camera is capable of detecting an elephant, a high speed train which travels at a speed of 80 to 110 kmph can’t stop on the spot to in time to save the animal,” he said.

Mr. Weerarathna, who is a specialist in Mammalogy (Asian Elephants), said Sri Lankan authorities paid little or no attention to environment concerns when it came to development projects including laying of railway lines.

“An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report should be obtained when laying railway lines in the middle of forests which are known to be elephant habitats. Elephant corridors should be built so that the animals can pass through them and railway lines should be constructed on top of these corridors on pillars. There is no point of coming up with short-term solutions now,” he said.

Mr. Weeraratne accused the government authorities of submitting reports obtained from pretend-environmentalists to launch their projects.

He said previously too, thermal imaging cameras were installed in trains but no positive outcome was generated because of improper maintenance.

“The authorities should learn from past mistakes and study the shortcomings of the previous proposals when extending railway lines to Beliatta and then Hambantota. Hambantota is a region which is home to large herds of elephants. If we are to prevent elephant deaths along the existing railway lines, the railway officials could increase the brightness of the head lights and slow down the train when passing through elephant corridors. But, then again, slowing down may affect the scheduled time to reach a destination. This is why we need sustainable measures prior to laying railway lines,” Mr. Weerarathna said.

On Tuesday, four baby elephants were killed when they were hit by the Colombo-bound Talaimannar express train near Andiyapulikulam at Chettikulam.

Later, Wildlife Conservation Department Director W.K.S. Pathirana is reported to have said that the department had decided to install infra-red cameras on trains travelling through forests in view of the increasing death toll of wild elephants knocked down by trains along the Northern and Eastern railway lines.

However, he had said the project was yet to be implemented because of the lack of funds to purchase and install infra-red cameras. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
