Kandy SC continue to stamp their authority

 
Kandy Sports Club the reigning league rugby champs of Sri Lanka once again showed their might in this year's tournament with six wins out of six matches played in the first round. The team led by Fazil Marija was ruthless from the kick-off with the motive 'Must Win' attitude carrying them to victory. They withstood the rousing fight back staged by Havelock Sports Club before crushing those 18-8 in their own den under lights.
Surprisingly it was a packed house, and in the gallery there were some famous former rugby players and fans soaking in the evening's action,
The display from the defending champions was a fault-free performance - they always seemed to have this sixth gear they can click into that no other team has.
There is every possibility that they will go through the calendar year undefeated. Their last first round game is on Sunday at Nittawela grounds against Navy Sports Club.
Kandy SC have spent in the last two and half decades or so trying to simplify the way they play the game. On Saturday we saw how far they have got there. They are good in every facet. Solid set-pieces, brilliant break downers, a defense that is incredibly mean, and an attacking team that no other side can match. Whatever said and done the best team won Saturday's block buster clash.
Kandy dazzled with their running and handling of the ball and effectively outlasted the Park Club, who failed with a poor tactical kicking display that played into the winner's hands.
There were a few errors that led to Havies losing, but the main one was their lack in tactical kicking. You need to kick very accurately against a team like Kandy SC or they will punish you. You just can't afford to give them free possession in an area where it is easy for them to run it at you. There were some positive points for the losers particularly in the first half, when they dominated the line outs and also were good in loose play, but lacked good finish.
They enjoyed a really good first half, and the 40 minutes was outstanding, but just before half time they started to lose control of the game and allowed Kandy to take charge.
For the losers there were a lot of tired legs as they make slow progress beyond the half-way line, desperately searching for a gap in the opponent's defence.
They had a lot of ball, but failed to make use of valid possession, the absences of some of their key players were badly felt.
