Classical guitar workshops and concert by Dr Paul Cesarczyk
Love affair with guitar

Dr Paul Cesarczyk, award winning Polish-born American music maestro, played his classical guitar at Carnegie Hall when he was a mere seventeen years old. Ever since, he has played at concerts and mentored aspiring musicians worldwide. Today, with the guidance of the Indian Cultural Center, the Asian Guitar Federation and the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan ears can feast on his music.
The classical guitar is different from the acoustic guitars we are so used to already seeing in Sri Lanka mostly in that they have nylon strings instead of steel ones. The classical guitar has strings that are light and the instrument is built with woods to emphasize resonance. Dr Paul Cesarczyk described the guitar as "an international instrument," and that it in fact likely originated in Asia itself, and travelled from the East to the West and today, back again. "There is always the process of rebirth in classical music," he added.
Dr.Cesarczyk was joined by Iqbal Mohamed of the Guitar Associaton of Sri Lanka (GASL), AvikSaha President of the Asian Guitar Federation (AGF), and the legendary musician Amaranath Ranatunga himself - described by Saha as "the father of the classical guitar in Sri Lanka" - to make an impassioned plea to the public to help create a "resurgence" of classical music in the country. "It is the beginning of what we believe will be a fruitful journey," said Saha.
Music is without language and the boundaries between genres and media as we saw it once are beginning to blur. The result is a global sound, a diverse fusion of musical feedback - DrCesarczyk himself was born in Poland, with an American passport, who now lives and teaches in Thailand. His workshops and concerts in Sri Lanka are made possible because of the friendship between the Sri Lankan Guitar Association, the Indian Cultural Center, and the Russian Cultural Center: an example on its own of the cultural cohesion that music can bring about.
While Dr Paul Cesarczyk will explore teaching techniques in music, guitar appreciation, and simply the joy of playing the classical guitar, in his workshops - this seems to be the beginning of something much bigger. The Guitar Association of Sri Lanka, and the very recently-born Asian Guitar Federation, who have worked with DrCesarczyk, are striving together to create a cohesive, flourishing 'Asian music circuit' - a platform which will promote Asian music and result in more regular and affordable music festivals in the region. Iqbal Mohamed of the GASL went on to say that music is not the only thing to grow out of these projects - "The classical guitar is a way to switch to poetry, and with its promotion, poets will have a way of coming out too."
"Sri Lanka has the greatest history in the region of the classical guitar - the oldest and most vibrant history," affirmed Saha. It seems to be an exciting time in the country to revive and celebrate music, with the enthusiastic collaboration of the GASL, AGF and our own skilled musicians.
Dr Paul Cesarczyk, whose work has merited him the Andres Segovia Award, the Aaron Copland Prize, the Artists International Award and other awards world-over, feels that the adaptation of the guitar in any country is very simple - it is basically a stringed instrument and all countries already have it in their own forms.
Here lies the opportunity for cultural and artistic fusion among different countries. Dr.Cesarczyk's classical guitar workshops are completely free and have been scheduled for October 20 at the University of Peradeniya, October 21 at the Giragama Teacher Training College in Pilimatalawa, October 22 at the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo, and October 23 at the Indian Cultural Center. The workshops seem to be a build-up to a grand concert featuring the music master himself, on October 24 at the Russian Cultural Center.
