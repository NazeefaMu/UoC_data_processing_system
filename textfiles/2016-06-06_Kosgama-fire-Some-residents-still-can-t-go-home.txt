Close to 500 people who were re-located to the Attanagalle Temple due to the fire at the Kosgama Army Camp are still there.

More than 1,000 individuals were re-located to the temple soon after the fire broke out but some have been allowed to return to their homes, after the Army announced the fire at the ammunition dump was under control.

Government sources said the area within a radius of one kilometer of the camp was still dangerous. (Pix by Pushpakumara Mallawarachchi)
