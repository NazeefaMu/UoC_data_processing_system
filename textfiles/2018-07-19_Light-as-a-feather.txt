Most of us would love to grow wings and fly away but this lazy bird decided not to use its flying abilities and instead hitched a lift on the back of an eagle.

Stunning pictures show the eagle resting on a branch in Taipei, Taiwan, as it tried to eat a snake.

A smaller black drongo bird then swoops down from the sky before landing on the back of the Crested Serpent Eagle as wildlife photographer Liu Chia-Pin was taking pictures.

The small bird was brooding and so attacked and drove the invaders, constantly attacking in the trees or in the air. He even stood on the back of this mammoth eagle as it was flying away.'

The black drongo species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds and has been given the nickname 'king crow' for dive-bombing any bird of prey that enters its territory. (Daily Mail)
