Acting Chairman of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLMC) Dr. Somarathna Dissanayake and Secretary to the Ministry of Mass Media and Information Sunil Hettiarachchi have assured that steps would be taken to provide an unbiased coverage of parliamentary sittings and the current political crisis, Speaker’s Office said.  

A statement released by the Speaker’s office said the two officials were summoned by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya after several MPs complained that the state media institute reported the current political issue in a biased manner.

The officials were also summoned to discuss the SLBC’s decision to halt coverage of parliamentary sessions.

The statement said that while Dr. Dissanayake had apologized for the decision to halt coverage of parliamentary sittings and assured that steps would be taken to rectify the issue, Hettiarchchi had promised to direct media outlets to cover the current crisis in an unbiased manner.
