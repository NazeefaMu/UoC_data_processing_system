The Coast Conservation Department (CCD) has decided to suspend the removal of illegal constructions on the Mirissa and Weligama coastal belt until further notice, Director General B.K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi said today.

He told Daily Mirror several owners had informed the CCD that they would voluntarily remove their unauthorized constructions.

However, according to reliable sources two powerful ministers are pressuring the CCD to stop the removal of these constructions.

The CCD identified 17 unauthorized constructions on the Mirissa beach and ordered that they be removed by May 1 in the wake of some Dutch tourists being assaulted there on April 8.

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha had opposed the decision to remove these constructions say it would hamper the livelihood of small scale entrepreneurs.

Several hoteliers and residents said the controversial Water Creatures Beach Guest Restaurant & Surf Bar whose employees assaulted the tourists was a well-known hot spot of several ministers. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
