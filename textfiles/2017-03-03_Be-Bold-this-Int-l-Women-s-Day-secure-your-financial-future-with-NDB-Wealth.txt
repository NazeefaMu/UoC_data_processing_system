‘Be Bold’ this Int’l Women’s Day; secure your financial future with NDB Wealth


	

With the International Women’s Day only a few days away, the time to ‘Be Bold For Change’ is now – and what better way to take that big leap towards ultimate financial freedom and parity than finally taking charge of your own financial future.
“Since 2017’s theme for International Women’s Day is #BeBoldForChange, the boldest step you can take as a woman is undoubtedly securing your own financial future. So, empower yourself by actively taking control of your financial planning,” advised Christina Wesley, a financial adviser with NDB Wealth.
In fact, the need for smart financial planning is even more relevant today despite woman now enjoying a greater degree of hard-won independence. This is because of the lack of corresponding parity in terms of earnings, savings, etc., which means that true financial freedom is still an elusive ideal. 
However, one way to circumvent the many obstacles faced by women, such as lack of equal pay or having to spend fewer hours at work because of taking care of children or having to take maternity leave, is to effectively utilize financial planning tools to not just accumulate savings but actually use them to generate a greater degree of sustainable wealth over the short and long term.
Wesley said, “Sri Lankan women also have to confront the troubling reality that, while they typically have longer lifespans than men, with an average life expectancy of 77 years, they are often paid a lower wage than men.” 
She also commented that Sri Lankan women often take on the additional duty of caring for aging or ailing parents and even relatives, as well as helping those in need in their immediate communities, which adds a further burden that taxes their career, finances, etc.
“This leads to an erratic career that is also interrupted by maternity leave, etc., which is an added reason for women getting less pay. So, what is needed is a ‘bold’ change where you think out-of-the-box and consider innovative financial planning alternatives rather than traditional bank savings accounts and fixed deposits. For example, ‘Wealth Plans’ by NDB Wealth can help you to truly optimize your savings, especially since you may only have very limited time and resources to do so,” 
recommended Wesley.
