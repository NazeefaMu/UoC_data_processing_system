Having her way denied them the use of the stairway


	

The employees of a key government department working on the upper floors suffered much inconvenience recently when they were forced to climb up and down the stairs for four days as a result of the elevator of the building complex being put out of operation.




Inquiries made later revealed that the suspension of the operation of the lift by a strange turn of circumstances was linked to a top white collar female working on the ground floor taking with her the keys of her office room when going on leave for four days and to the still more strange happen-so that the access door to both her office and the elevator control room being one and the same!
All department top executives are expected to leave the keys to their offices with the security division when going on leave and this particular fair white collar one, an intimate of a powerful politico, does not observe this rule, employees say.


All indications are that the errant fair one will not be taken to task for her latest offense either, they say.
