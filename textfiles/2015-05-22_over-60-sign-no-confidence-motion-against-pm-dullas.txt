	UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe so far signed by more than 60 MPs including 14 ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers would be handed over to the Speaker next week.
	He said they were sure to receive the support of a majority of MPs and that it would be significant being the only no-confidence motion submitted against a prime minister with a majority in parliament supporting it.
	“Only two no-confidence motions have been submitted against some former Prime Ministers but the two motions were defeated on a majority vote,” Mr. Alahapperuma said.
	He said the no-confidence motion will state the fact that he was a prime minister with a minority support in parliament and had allegedly caused a crisis in the national economy.
	Mr. Alahapperuma said it was time for the SLFPers who joined the government to take a stand if they really love and are loyal to the party just like the four ministers who resigned their portfolios.
	He said their resignations were influenced by the dissolution of local government bodies.
	“The SLFPers should be loyal to the party at a time when its image is being tarnished or its unity is at risk,” Mr. Alahapperuma said.
	He said the traditional relationship between the UNP and the SLFP earlier likened to that between an elephant and a goad is now being likened to an elephant and a wood apple. (Ajith Siriwardana)
