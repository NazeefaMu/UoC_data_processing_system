Colombo High Court today accepted the bail revision application filed on behalf of former CSN Senior Executive Nishantha Ranatunga, who was remanded on charges of violating the Public Property Act.

However, Colombo High Court Judge M. C. B. S Morais did not grant Ranatunga bail, but directed the Kaduwela Magistrate to revise the remand orders and consider granting bail after taking into consideration only the Bail Act.

The Judge also affirmed that the remand orders given by the Kaduwela Magistrate on January 30 and February 11 cannot be considered under the Public Property Act.

However, the Colombo High Court on Monday released Yoshitha Rajapaksa and three other CSN directors on a bail of Rs.100,000 with two sureties of Rs.1 million.

Five individuals including Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Nishantha Ranatunga, Rohan Welivita, Ravinath Fernando and Kaushal Dissanayake were arrested and remanded for alleged money laundering by the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID). (Shehan Chamika Silva)
