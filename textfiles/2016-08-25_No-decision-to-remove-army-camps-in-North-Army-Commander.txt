While denying the statement made by a parliamentarian, Army Commander Lieutenant General Crishantha de Silva said that there was no decision to remove any Army camp in the North.

“No decision has been taken to remove Army camps in the North and there is no truth behind this claim,” he said.

While addressing the press briefing at the Colombo Defence Seminar 2016 at the Army Headquarters Colombo today he said the Sri Lanka Army would take any measure to ensure National Security. It will take place at Bandaranaike International Conference Hall (BMICH) during September 1 and 2.

“Everyone should know what an Army camp is. A camp is a permanent facility for the lodging of army personnel. We are going to keep only the required area for the camp, and will release the rest of the land. Army camps will be placed at the right places,” the Army Commander said.

“When considering the security situation in the former conflict areas, those areas are peaceful as any other parts of the country. Sri Lanka Army will ensure that national security concerns are addressed,” he also said.

The Defence Seminar, a provenance of the Sri Lanka Army was devised as an annual international forum in 2011 with the aim of setting up platform of rich intellectual interaction on intricacies of national, regional and international interest.

Aspiring to muster wider identification, the seminar is renamed as Colombo Defence Seminar with effect from the year 2016 on a proposal of the commander of the Army. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
