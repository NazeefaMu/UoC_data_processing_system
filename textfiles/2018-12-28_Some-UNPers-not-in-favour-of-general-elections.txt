Some UNPers not in favour of general elections


	

A faction of the United National Party (UNP) is said to be opposed to a snap parliamentary election next year.

This comes in the wake of UNP National Organiser and Minister, Navin Dissanayake having said he had proposed to the party leadership to prepare for a snap general election after April next year.

However, some UNP MPs are not in favour of this proposal and instead are demanding a snap presidential election. According to the Constitution, President Maithripala Sirisena can declare a snap presidential election after he completes four years in office on January 8, 2019, so as to seek a fresh mandate for a second term.
