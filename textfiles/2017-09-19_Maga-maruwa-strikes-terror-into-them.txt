‘Maga-maruwa’ strikes terror into them


	

There is a close relative of a leading politician who is known to be heady with the political influence he wields. Even his tipper truck drivers have now got this ‘infection’, they say.

 


The leading politician’s close relative, a dealer in building materials is the owner of a fleet of tipper trucks which are often seen speeding along roads with a callous disregard for traffic laws and the safety of other road-users.  Traffic Police would turn a blind eye to the traffic offences being blatantly committed by these truck drivers.


Whenever, the pedestrians spot these trucks coming their way at a distance, they would rush to a side far enough for safety warning others with the cry: “Get aside. ‘Maga-maruwa’ (killer on road) is coming!”
