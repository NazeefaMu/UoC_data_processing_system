Led by the 7S strong senior choir of the college well known as St Cecilia’s Choir, the event will bring together over 200 singers and musicians.   
The service will commence with the “CANON in C”starting with the plea “DONA NOBIS PACEM” and “Come Thou Long Expected Jesus”, announcing the entrance procession. The choir will also sing the evergreen Namo Mariyeni, the majestic “Be Exulted” and the German version of “Silent Night” to mark the 200th anniversary of the most loved carol on earth. They will sing BABA JETU (The Lord’s Prayer in an African Language) and the glorious chorus from Handel’s Messiah - “For unto Us a Child is Born”, as well as the song “Do You Know It’s Christmas Time At All” highlighting the suffering of the poor and needy in the world.
