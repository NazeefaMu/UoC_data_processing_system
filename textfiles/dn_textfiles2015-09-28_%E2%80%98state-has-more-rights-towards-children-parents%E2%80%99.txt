‘State has more rights towards children than parents’

Children have many rights. The State has more rights than the parents towards children. When we find a child who is neglected or is likely to be harmed by their guardians or parents, we take the child into our care, said Lakmini Sewwandi Shah, a Cabinet member for Children's Safeguarding (Deputy) and Mayoral Advisor for Domestic and Family Violence in Newham London, UK.
During an interview with the Daily News she said: "Parents cannot hit children. There are rare cases of child harassment and a majority of it is done by someone who is known to the child."
Here are the excerpts of the interview:

Lakmini Sewwandi Shah
Q: Comment about you and your work
A: I was born in Hambantota. My parents are Indrani Palliyaguru and P.M. Dissanayake. My father is from Lenagala, Kegalle.
I studied at Ladies College, Colombo. After Advanced Level, I left for further education to Russia on a scholarship. I finished my education at Moscow with a Business Administration degree in London University, East London. I met my husband, Ash Shah, there. He is of Indian decent. We have three children. My eldest daughter is at medical college and my older son is doing his A/Ls. My youngest son is in Year Nine.
I worked at British Gas Board/ Centrica as a financial consultant until I entered politics in 2006.I was elected as a local government councillor to the East London borough, Newham, UK. This is the place where Olympics was held in 2012. This is my third term in politics. I was elected in 2014 for the third time. There are around 450,000 residents in my borough. We have an Executive Mayor who is elected by the people. There are 60 councillors. My seat is East Ham South. The mayor elects his cabinet and there are eight cabinet members and I am one of them. I am also an advisor to the mayor.
Q: Describe your work as a Labour Cabinet Member for Children’s Safeguarding (Deputy) and Mayoral advisor for Domestic and Family Violence.
A: I am elected as a Labour Party Councillor. Even though the central government is Conservative, Newham is a Labour borough whereby all the elected members are from the Labour Party.
There is a cabinet member for Children and Young People's Services (CYPS). safeguarding or child protection is only one aspect of the CYPS. I lead on safeguarding. I advise the mayor on the problems women and families have and how we can drive the agenda forward according to the policies.
I meet women from various walks of life and women's rights organisations to understand the problems women face in society.
I see two reasons. They are ignorance and financial constraints. Ignorance is when men feel more powerful than women and men feel that they are superior to women.
There is an organisation that we commission to deal all sorts of domestic and family violence. It's called One Stop Shop. One Stop Shop provides all the support women need such as providing for women refugees, providing housing, giving advice and guidance on how to acquire various social and financial benefits, training for women to be employed, finding employment and police protection.
Q: What is your role as an advisor?
A: I have officers who are specialised in policies on women's rights and specialised in domestic and family violence. According to the intelligence or information, I have I set the agenda to make women or men deal with domestic violence. Ten percent of domestic violence is suffered by men, which might not be relevant to Sri Lanka. It all depends on the need of residents. This role is a new role which I was appointed to two months ago. Currently, I am carrying out a fact finding mission to look into the needs in the borough.
Q: From your experience what is the main cause for family violence and how do you suggest to minimize family violence if that could not be eradicated totally?
A: Men feel women need to be behaving in a certain manner. This is different when there is poverty and a woman becomes solely dependant on a man and she has to put up with all the abuse as she has no other option.
This might be more relevant for countries such as Sri Lanka where the State don't provide financial support to women who have faced domestic violence.
Educating men by the State is important. They need to provide support to women who have faced domestic violence. They need to provide housing, employment and training to women so that they become financially independent. A welfare system needs to be created. The first contact, which would be the police, need to have a trustworthy structure and a system where women feel safe to walk in and make that first complaint.
Q: Comment on the people's awareness of your support system?
A: The people know that there is such a role and also that the borough has the One Stop Shop where they get all the support they can access.
Q: How safe are the children in your country? Do you read instances where children are harassed, molested and raped?
A: Children have many rights. The State has more rights than the parents towards children. When we find a child who is neglected or is likely to be harmed by their guardians or parents, we take the child into our care.
Parents cannot hit children. There are rare cases of child harassment and a majority of it is done by someone who is known to the child. In these cases, the police take over such cases. We have registers of offenders where parents can have access to. If there is such an offender living close to their house, parents have the right to know. It is called Sarah's Law. Everyone who works with children have to undergo a thorough police check which is called a DBS check. Without that check, no one is allowed to enter even a school.
There are foster parents who look after children. For every child they foster, the parents obtain £500 per week and all the support they need.
Q: What lessons could Sri Lanka draw from your experience to ensure that our children are treated better?
A: Children should be treated with respect. They should be heard. Schools should be taking a lead role in this. Teachers should be not just teaching books but keeping records of children to see if they struggle from neglect or abuse.
As Sri Lanka is a developing country, there are financial constraints on families. The government should provide for these families. It would be great if there's a long term plan for Sri Lanka to become a developed country. Politicians need to have a selfless plan to achieve this. The answer is very broad. It is not one thing but a long term strategy needs to be driven forward.
Q: In your view, what should the society, State and law making institutions do to ensure that families are safeguarded from domestic violence and safety of children is ensured?
A: Education is needed to eradicate cultural habits. Policies should be in place to protect women. Financial support is needed. Employment and training should be provided to women so that they have financial independence. Politicians need to drive this forward. The police need to implement the law and a welfare scheme should be in place to provide support.
Q: What is your assessment of family life in Sri Lanka in comparison to the UK?
A: I grew up in Sri Lanka until 18 years. So I did not hear much of domestic violence cases as I was a child then. I assume since Sri Lanka is an Asian country, Asia usually has patriarchal societies. I think women have less power over men. This can lead to serious forms of domestic violence.
Q: How do you assess the safety of Sri Lanka for children?
A: I do not like to make comparisons between the UK and Sri Lanka when it comes to child rights.
They are totally two extremes as the UK is a developed country and Sri Lanka is a developing country. Culturally it is different. What is important is to have laws to protect children and rigorously implement them to safeguard children from harm. Again this is the duty of politicians. If politicians abide by the Nolan Principle for elected members, anything can be achieved.
So my advice is to read up on the seven principles of public life and no doubt Sri Lanka will become a developed country.
