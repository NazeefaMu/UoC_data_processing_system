The United National Party (UNP) is in a position to form a Government at anytime with the support of 125 members in Parliament, UNP General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.

At a rally held in Kuliyapitiya he said the UNP had a majority in Parliament though various claims had been made by several groups about forming a new Government.

“As the biggest political party in the country, the UNP is ready to take up any challenge and has already had discussions with other parties regarding the formation of a Government at any given time. For that, we will get the support of President Maithripala Sirisena,” the minister said.

He said the UNP was in the process of setting up a UNP Government, with the majority of the people in the country who wished to implement good governance policies with the support of the President and the Prime Minister.

The minister said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be defeated for the third time at the upcoming local government elections. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
