Budget poses danger - Prof. Tissa Vitharana

The entire country is against the Budget 2016. This is the most dangerous budget ever presented to Parliament. The budget does not offer tax relief for investments. The country will face the same fate as Greece, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the budget has allowed foreigners to suck the essence of the country. The country had US $ 8.2 billion worth foreign reserves when the government was taken over by the UNP. It has gone down to US $ 4.5 billion when the loan obtained from India deducted from the total amount. The budget gap was to be reduced to 4.2 percent, but now, it is seven percent, Prof. Vitharana said.
Prof. G.L. Peiris said the Common opposition will launch a well planned programme to rescue the country from the destruction and to ensure people's say. Legal action will be taken against anything and anyone to protect the people. The government only expects praise from foreign countries. It could have been obtained during the previous government. But, it protected Sri Lanka's dignity, territorial integrity and sovereignty. Sri lanka is not a colony of any country to listen to and follow outsiders' orders.
Democratic Left Front (DLF) Leader and MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the government will win the budget 2016 by using the UPFA MPs snatched by them. The UPFA MPs were snatched by the government opposing the people's mandate and abusing the universal franchise, he said.
