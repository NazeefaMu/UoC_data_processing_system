The Public Education Committee of the Sri Lanka Cancer Society conducted a seminar on May 31 on World No-Tobacco Day. Every year a seminar is held by the committee on this day to educate and create awareness among the people on how the use of tobacco leads to cancer. This year we targeted vulnerable schoolchildren as the incidence of smoking has increased among schoolchildren. It was stressed at the seminar that 87% of lung cancer was due to cigarette smoking and that smoking affects not only the lungs but other areas of the body too, such as mouth, ears, eyes, tongue and oesophagus.   

The first speaker Mr Christie Fernando of the Asiri Surgical Laboratory elaborated his address with a power point presentation. Next an eminent doctor from the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), Dr. Manoj Karunaratne addressed the gathering. With his wit and motivating ability he kept the children engrossed. The children enthusiastically answered the questions put to them. The response was excellent. There were 117 students and 28 teachers, A file with brochures, pamplets, a book mark with warnings on smoking and a booklet on the hazards of smoking, was given to every participant. A questionnaire too was given to get a feedback. Lunch and milk were provided to the participants.
