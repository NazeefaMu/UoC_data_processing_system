Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said today he was satisfied with his ministry and that he had been given more responsibility than in the previous ministry.

“I will try to find a solution to the long lasting human-elephant conflict and to protect wildlife,” he told journalists outside the Presidential Secretariat this morning.

He said he was happy in the previous ministry where he was allocated funds to work for the people at grassroot level.

“I think  I will be able to work for the people in rural areas under the new ministry,” he said.
