MP Namal Rajapaksa said that he was unaware about an incident where a man said to be a security officer of his was caught bearing a gun in the vicinity of President Maithripala Sirisena in Angunukolapelassa on Saturday (25).
"I have seen some reports in social media about such an incident, but what  I have to say is, I am unaware about such a  thing at all and no one informed me about it as yet," Mr Rajapaksa said when the Daily Mirror inquired about the Police claim.
"Anyway, I briefed the President about these claims," he said adding that "I know the protocol and doesn't want to breach the security of the President."
