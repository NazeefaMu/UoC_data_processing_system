The authorities presiding over the task of protecting the human rights in the country held a big conference in the hill city area recently.
The VIPs in the province as well as the media institutions in the country had been invited to attend the event by the head of the body looking after human rights. 
Given the importance of the event, media teams had arrived at the venue on time and set microphones and cameras for the coverage. They were on the go when they were menacingly confronted by an irate Madam breathing fire at them. “Who asked you to come here,” She barked at them. “We don’t want media people here. Dismantle your equipment and get out!”
The media teams who had arrived armed with written invitations had left the place post haste. One of the media personnel had quipped as he was leaving the venue: “Maybe, media freedom is not a human right in their book.”
