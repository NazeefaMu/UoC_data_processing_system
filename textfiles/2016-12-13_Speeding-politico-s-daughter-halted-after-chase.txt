A prominent politician’s 20 year-old daughter, who drove her defender jeep violating traffic laws, was caught by two policemen attached to the Nittambuwa Police station, after giving chase for three kilometers at the Pasyala area on the Colombo-Kandy main road, police said.

The incident had taken place on Sunday at Weweldeniya in the Radawadunna area, when the policemen signalled to halt a defender jeep coming from Kandy, which had been travelling at high speed, overtaking vehicle by crossing the double lines. Despite the police order, the vehicle had sped away, prompting the policemen to give chase.

After giving chase for about three kilometers, the jeep was confronted by the Policemen. At that time, the driver, who happened to be a girl, had told police that she was the daughter of a politician and admitted her fault. Later the police had taken her driving licence, issued her a temporally licence and asked her to appear in the Attanagalla Magistrate Court for the case.
