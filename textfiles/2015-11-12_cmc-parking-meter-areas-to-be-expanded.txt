Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Mayor A.J. M. Muzammil said today that the scheduled parking meters along the Galle Road, R. A de Mel Mawatha and all by roads would be expanded to other parking areas in the municipality as well.
Mr. Muzammil said the installation of the parking meters in the Colombo Municipality would be done on the success of the pilot project.
He expressed these views at a news conference held today to hand over the contract to Tenaga Car parks Pvt. Ltd to commence their work on the project.
“The company was selected on their experiences and capabilities on modern parking management systems and highest revenue to the Council,” he said.
Muzammil said 140 parking meters would be installed along entire Galle Road, R. A de Mel Mawatha and all by roads connecting the two main roads and the project was scheduled to commence on 2016 January 01.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
