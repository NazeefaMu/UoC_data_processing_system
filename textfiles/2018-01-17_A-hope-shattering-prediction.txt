A hope-shattering prediction


	



 

A lady from a very prominent political family now in the opposition quietly called on a soothsayer in a city suburb with a young man in tow.

 


After making customary offerings and making sure there was none within hearing distance, she asked the soothsayer to name the person who would become the country’s leader following the next big poll. 


The soothsayer went into a trance and uttered a name. 


The lady wide-eyed, exclaimed: “Aiyo!” 


She left the place with the young man even without saying good bye to the soothsayer, they say.
