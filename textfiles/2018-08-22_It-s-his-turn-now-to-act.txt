It’s his turn now to act!


	



 

A group of WPC members had called on Number One the other day to make a collective request that the incumbent provincial chief be removed.

 


On this occasion, the scion of the Rajagaha political family had told the big boss: “Sir, if you remove this guy, I and my wife will be by your side from tomorrow!”


Number One by now quite used to this type of assurances had offered the ambitious member a proposition.


“I can certainly remove him from office. But first, make your appearance at our party convention come September!”


This story had soon appeared in various news websites and the man had been inundated with inquiries over the phone from interested and inquisitive parties. But he had studiously avoided giving a reply.


All are now quietly waiting for his next move, they say.
