Huawei nova 3 series is the newly discovered bright star in the smartphone industry. Having entered the market in early August 2018, the Nova 3 series received record-breaking demand from the Sri Lankan youth due to its revolutionary AI features and trendy design. The product appeals to all youth ranging from the tech community, the fashion circle and also those in show biz. 

HUAWEI nova devices have always been gorgeous. Previously, devices in this series earned a warm welcome among the youth with their attractive design. Not willing to be outdone by those that came before it, HUAWEI nova 3 Series comes with a range of trendy hues. The Nova3 is available in Iris Purple, Red & Black while the Nova3i is available in Iris Purple, Pearl White &Black leaving consumers spoilt for choice.

As the first gradient colour offered on HUAWEI nova devices, Iris Purple deserves a proper introduction. Gradient colours are some of the hottest device colour schemes on the market. Huawei has always had great insights into colours and how they affect design. The HUAWEI P20 Pro graced the Sri Lankan market with the breathtaking Twilight colour, bringing the popularity of the gradient colour to new heights. As a device designed for the young, the HUAWEI nova 3 Series sticks closely to the trends, and launched the highly evocative Iris Purple—Huawei’s take on the popular violet purple hue.

News of HUAWEI nova 3 carrying the gradient colour actually leaked prior to its official launch, so consumers had expected it to come, but that did little to dampen its impact and influence that it made at its unveiling. Huawei improved upon its 2.5D curve designto create the new and improved 3D curved glass finish, where the gradient colour shines through with fascinating vibrancy. Humans are naturally allured by colours – and with the gradient color, there are just more colours to love.
Looking back at the history of smartphones, manufacturers have always been keen to bolster their product portfolio with differently coloured devices. And that has worked in the favor of consumers, giving them additional choice. The HUAWEI nova 3 Series, a line-up renowned for its design, is at the forefront of this colour trend. The Iris Purple gradient colour available on both the nova 3 and nova 3i evoke feelings of mystery, excitement and adventure. Such a unique experience is only available through the trendy HUAWEI nova 3 series.

Compared to other devices in the same price range, this series has seen a lot more attention to detail in its design and colour, and the same fact drives the Huawei nova 3 series to lead in the colour and design trends. In the present day the mobile device is considered a fashion expression and addressing this demand is a huge challenge among the handset makers. However the Huawei nova 3 series has accepted the challenge and addressed the demand through the vivid, shifting colours of the Iris Purple.

The Huawei nova3 and nova3i comes with a one year  warranty and will be available for consumers at all Huawei Experience Centers with Sri Lanka’s leading Smartphone marketer, Singer Sri Lanka PLC ensuring the availability of the nova3 series devices island wide. Selected Dialog and Mobitel outlets would also market the new devices with the Huawei nova3 priced at 79,900 and Huawei nova3i priced at 49,900.
