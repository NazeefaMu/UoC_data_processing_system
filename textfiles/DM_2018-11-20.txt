A picnic that went awry
	

The members of a provincial council had been treated to a picnic at an upcountry health resort ahead of unveiling the councils annual budget, they say.

The group on the picnic had been accommodated in a five-star hotel belonging to a family member of a very high political authority in the resort city at a very high expense. The hotel bill running into a hefty amount had been paid in advance.
Nevertheless, due to an unexpected political change, the picnickers had had to return soon after checking into the hotel.
The hotel charges paid in advance, however, had not been refunded, they say.

All govt. payments from January 1 illegal: Mangala
	
All payments of government from January 1, 2019, would be illegal as a result of the actions of the Sirisena-Rajapaksa coup, former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today.
In a statement, he said these payments include public sector salaries, pensions, welfare payments including Samurdhi and all debt repayments.
The full statement issued by former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera
Just 9 days prior to the presentation of the 2019 budget, the Sirisena-Rajapaksa coup ousting the legitimate and lawful Prime Minister and cabinet has thrown the country and citizens into an unprecedented crisis.
The Speaker having gone through all legal procedures in parliament has also declared that as per Article 48(2) of the constitution, the purported Prime Minister and his cabinet are illegal.
As per Article 148 of the constitution, Parliament shall have full control over public finance. In the absence of a legitimate government, a grave situation has now arisen as there is no legal way to meet public expenditure and obligations of the state from 2019. The constitution does not provide for any alternative arrangements for public finance, even with the intervention of the executive envisaged under the limited circumstances of article 150(3) under which the President can only allocate finances for the first 3 months of a new parliament. Thus, under the current circumstances, from January 1st 2019 until a new parliament is convened, the spending power of the state ceases to exist.
As the Finance Minister, I have made allocations to ensure funding until December 31st 2018, however from January 1st 2019, the country will fall into a crisis.
A legitimate government with an adequate majority in parliament would have had the opportunity to present at least a vote on account which would have covered at least the first 3 months of the new year enabling payment of pensions, salaries, Samurdhi payments, and settlement of debts. It is still not too late to reestablish the government that commands the clear majority in parliament to present a budget/vote on account to authorize expenditure from the consolidated fund from 2019.
This illegal government has no majority and are pirating the government benches through force and violence, and they cannot muster a majority to even pass a vote on account, they are forcibly preventing the lawful government from taking the critical steps to provide funding for 2019.
In any event, as per Article 150 (2) of the constitution, only a legitimate finance minister can sign a warrant to release funding. As per the ruling of the Speaker on 16th November, as per article 48(2) of the constitution, the purported government, its finance minister, and cabinet stands dissolved.
As a result of the actions of the Sirisena-Rajapaksa coup, all payments of government from 1st January 2019 are illegal and cannot be affected by public servants. Some of the critical areas include public sector salaries, pensions, welfare payments including Samurdhi, and all debt repayments.
Furthermore, as per the ruling by the Speaker under Article 48 (2) as the purported prime minister and cabinet are illegitimate, as per section 52(3) all ministry secretaries cease to exist and any actions taken by them are null and void and illegal. Such actions are serious violations and would be punishable under the Public Property law and other relevant legislation.
As a result of these actions, Sri Lanka is on the brink of economic anarchy and chaos as never experienced before. The cavalier and irresponsible actions of the president starting on October 26th based on personal animosities and precipitating a series of illegal acts, places at risk Sri Lankas ability to meet its immediate debt obligations. In early January 2019 we have to repay US$ 1 billion of Rajapaksa debt taken in January 2014, the repayment of which is also under the purview of Parliament.
Sri Lanka has hitherto never defaulted its debt obligations. The actions of 26th October have irreversibly undermined Sri Lankas credibility in global markets - risking our ability to service future debt as well. We are being pushed towards a state of economic collapse as we stumble on to a road of a Greece like situation.
The only way to rescue Sri Lanka from this unfortunate and unnecessary crisis is for the President to recognize the Prime Minister and the government that was in place prior to October 26th and continues to command the clear majority in parliament. It is necessary for all like-minded people, regardless of political affiliation, to come forward to save the country from an otherwise impending economic collapse, by supporting efforts to re-establish the supremacy of parliament and the constitution.

Asia summit ends in historic failure
	

PORT MORESBY REUTERS, Nov 18 2018 - Asia-Pacific leaders failed to agree on a communique at a summit in Papua New Guinea on Sunday for the first time in their history as deep divisions between the United States and China over trade and investment stymied cooperation.
Competition between the United States and China over the Pacific was also thrown into focus with the United States and its Western allies launching a coordinated response to Chinas Belt and Road programme.  You know the two big giants in the room, Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime Minister Peter ONeill said at a closing news conference, when asked which of the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group could not agree. ONeill, who was chairman of the meeting, said the sticking point was over whether mention of the World Trade Organization and its possible reform should be in the Leaders Declaration. 
APEC has got no charter over World Trade Organization, that is a fact. Those matters can be raised at the World
Trade Organization.

Battling social factors and achieving medical targets
	
                  World Aids Day 2018                  

Engulfed in social stigma and discrimination, HIV/AIDS is an issue society still addresses in hushed voices despite the progression we claim to have achieved globally. In honour of World AIDS Day 2018 (Celebrated on December 1) the National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) has partnered up with their stakeholders, NGO partners and the private sector to approach this disease with open hearts and minds.
World AIDS Day (WAD) originated in 1988 at the Summit of Ministers of Health on Programmes for AIDS Prevention. This years theme has been announced as Know your status. According to the statistics released by the World Health Organization (WHO), over 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died resultantly since its origin. These inconceivable figures have paved the way for a global campaign which follows a fast tracked strategy to end AIDS by 2030. This incorporates an ambitious 90-90-90 treatment target which is as follows:

By 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status.
	By 2020, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy.
	By 2020, 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression.
Having maintained a relatively impressive low prevalence rate, the Sri Lankan authorities involved in this campaign have moved one step further and modified the global theme to read Know your status to End AIDS by 2025.
The NSACP is well aware of the social and cultural forces which erect a wall between victims and non-victims of AIDS. Such pressures have driven sufferers to deny their illness and shy away from getting their selves tested. It is therefore a foremost target of the NSACP to normalize testing and eliminate societys unfounded fear toward the disease. Dr. Iresh Jayaweera of the World AIDS day organizing team, explained that if HIV testing was perceived as something as ordinary as a full blood count test or a fasting blood sugar test, the social stigma that has been thus far impermeable, may be dissolved greatly. He explained that battling these social factors was the first step toward achieving medical targets. For, only 2/3rd of people having HIV know their status, 1/3rd is still out there- who if diagnosed and treated will allow us to virtually eliminate AIDS by 2025.

Statistics show that over 3600 people are HIV infected withinSri Lanka, of them only around 1355 are under care. Although these statistics may seem trifling there is no room for complacency
Lack of awareness
			Only 2/3rd of people having HIV know their status, 1/3rd is still out there- who if diagnosed and treated will allow us to virtually eliminate AIDS by 2025
			
			Dr. Iresh Jayaweera
			
		
HIV/AIDS is often associated with a defeatist attitude, owing to the lack of awareness concerning treatment possibilities. Despite our unlimited access to information, AIDS is still considered synonymous with a death sentence. In spite of our paramount advancement, AIDS is still a sensitivity which tests humanity. The campaigns carried out by the NSACPA will annihilate age-old myths regarding the disease. There is hope were the words of Dr. Chandrika Jayakody- the National Programme Consultant for IEC and Condom Promotion. She added that through treatment, an HIV positive patient is now able to attain a quality of life (and life expectancy) that is almost the same as of a normal person.  
Owing to local cultural values that are deeply embedded in society, these authorities realize that a change in how people view AIDS cannot be made in the near future. However this is a reality against which the patients will be sheltered from, owing to confidential and anonymous testing procedures. Dr. Iresh stressed on the extremely secure doctor- patient relationships beyond which ones HIV status will not be disclosed to anyone.
Furthermore, the information we generally possess regarding the disease itself is limited, thereby subjecting us to more misconception and misjudgement. Dr. Chandrika spoke of a lengthy asymptomatic period a patient may experience after contracting HIV/AIDS. This may subject him/her to a false sense of security and keep them from getting tested and/or treated. The hesitation surrounding this primary step of getting tested is what the campaign hopes to obliterate.
33 full-timeSTD clinics
Under the NSACP, there are 33 full-time STD clinics and 23 branches around the country. Of these, 21 clinics provide HIV treatment free of charge. Meanwhile, the NSACP is also tackling the problem of stigma at its roots. It is extremely important that an individuals perception of victims of diseases like HIV/AIDS is moulded at their core. Understanding this, the NSACP in cooperation with the Education Ministry has visited 192 schools island-wide conducting sessions to instil awareness among the youth. Additionally, the multi-sectoral unit under this National programme conducts TOTs (Training of Trainers) which enable teachers to be prepared to educate their students in the most wholesome way possible. Blood testing programmes, condom promotion and NGO- supported workshops have been organized. Vulnerable sectors like the migrant, the youth, tourists and prisons have especially been targeted. .However this is just the beginning. The aspiring team is currently working on other developments which will dilute the pessimism, the prejudice and the trepidation of the disease. Preventive and effective printed messages on school text books and informative video clips are a few other budding projects.

Statistics show that over 3600 people are HIV infected within Sri Lanka, of them only around 1355 are under care. Although these statistics may seem trifling in relation to the victim count in African regions which is close to 26 million, there is no room for complacency. Sri Lanka is one of the countries in South East Asia with a rising HIV incidence. Every week 5-6 new infections are reported to the NSACP. Dr. Iresh stressed on a possible increment in the local prevalence rate in future considering the population pyramid which depicts the sexually active youth outnumbering the aged. He also explained how due to migration and tourism being portals for STDs, societys rapidly changing sexual patterns, homosexuality and the role that social media plays in this respect, the condition may only worsen. These are evidentiary reasons this campaign is needed now more than ever.
The reality is that we are striking down the diseased. The vision is that we strike down the disease. However this is unattainable unless certain walls are broken down and a different mindset is practised. Driven by these targets, the NSACP is equipping our community with armour of awareness and vigilance. In the spirit of acceptance, the NSACP together with their stakeholders will be organizing a walk on the 1st of December in honour of the 30th anniversary of World AIDS day. The Walk will commence at 8.30 am in the front lawn area of the Colombo Municipal Council and will reach its conclusion in the front lawn of BMICH where it will be followed by a meeting. Kick starting a series of efforts to eliminate HIV/AIDS from being a public health problem by 2025, these trailblazers request your support in making the changes we urgently need.

Budget approves PMs expenditure so can't be stopped: Bandula
	
The expenditure head of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot be blocked because the funds for the Prime Ministers Office has already been approved in this year's Budget, Minister Bandula Gunawardane said today.
He said once funds were allocated for each ministry through the appropriation bill and passed by parliament, the funds could not be suspended or removed.
The United National Front (UNF) handed over a motion to suspend the expenditure head of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, once funds are allocated to a ministry and approved by the budget, no one can change it. Not even the Finance Minister can do this. Since the budget for this year has already been approved, nothing can alter it till the end of this year, Mr. Gunawardena told a news briefing.
He said no motion has been submitted to Parliament in the past urging the suspension of funds allocated to a ministry. Even if someone presents such a motion, it should be done constitutionally and legally. The UNF submitted motion without following any parliamentary procedures, Mr. Gunawardane said.
He said there was no issue in repaying international loans. Sri Lanka has to repay US$1,000 million in January next year as debt repayment. Settling these loan instalments is the responsibility of the Central Bank and its officials are fulfilling their duties irrespective of the political situation in the country. As a country, Sri Lanka has never refrained from repaying its debts, Mr. Gunawardane said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Caritas Beach clean-up  a great success
	
The clergy participate in the clean-up

A mega beach clean-up campaign carried out by Caritas Sri Lanka-SEDEC in collaboration with Seth Sarana, Sunday Schools and Parish Youth Societies under the theme of Gods Love for All and covering a stretch of 34 km from Palliyawatta in Wattala to Poruthota in Negombo, was held recently with the participation of over 5000 environmental-lovers from all walks of life.

Brief note on Caritas
Caritas Sri Lanka  SEDEC is an expression of the concern of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka for justice, peace and human development. It operates on the mandate of the Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka (CBCSL) which is conferred to the Board of Management (BOM).
It is the National Secretariat of the Commission for Justice, Peace and Human Development of the Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka. In each Diocese, Caritas Sri Lanka  SEDEC has an implementing Caritas Diocesan Secretariat. These are the secretariats of the Commission for Justice, Peace & Human Development of the respective Dioceses.

Beach clean-up campaign
			It is even identified through a research conducted by a team of researchers in the United States and Australia that Sri Lanka is the fifth among the countries that pollute the ocean the most
			
			
		
It was the first time in Sri Lanka that such a long vast beach stretch was cleaned-up within 5 hours. Caritas Sri Lanka -SEDEC National Director Rev. Fr. Mahendra Gunatilleke, and Seth Sarana Director, Rev. Fr. Lawrence Ramanayake and Parish Priests of 11 churches along the beach belt gave the leadership for this enormous task.
The campaign kicked off with a brief multi-religious opening ceremony where children cladded in attire according to different ethnicities, welcomed the religious leaders offering sheafs of betel. Ven Atabage Piyadassi Thera of Abeysekararamaya, Negombo, Moulavi Nawaz of Poruthota Mosque, Shiva Sri Rajendram Kurukkal of Kandsurindugama Skandakumara Hindu Temple represented their respective religions. In their short sermons, all the religious leaders emphasised the importance of environmental friendly facts according to their religions.
Representatives from Presidential Secretariat, Marine Environment Protection Authority, Central Environment Authority, Department of Coast Conservation, Divisional Secretariats of Wattala, Ja-Ela and Negombo, Negombo Municipal Council, Wattala-Mabloa Urban Council, Ja-Ela Town Council, students of Maris Stella College, Negombo, Sunday School students and teachers, Youth Societies, the parishioners and many environmental-friendly organizations featured in the campaign prominently.
A pilot beach clean-up programme was carried out on September 2 as a rehearsal to ascertain the gravity and difficulties of planning a mega beach clean-up project.
Experience gained in that project has immensely helped us to organise the so campaign in a proper manner.

Every citizen should protect the nation
Fr. Mahendra Gunatilleke said it was the duty of every citizen to be clean and to maintain a clean neighbourhood. However, it is visible that our surroundings are very much polluted and an emerging issue is that the oceans are being dumped with plastic and other wastage.
It is even identified through a research conducted by a team of researchers in the United States and Australia that Sri Lanka is the fifth among the countries that pollute the ocean the most. Taking this matter into serious consideration and as a mean of setting Laudato Si a book by Pope Francis in action, Caritas Sri Lanka SEDEC intends to organise a mega beach cleaning campaign with other collaborators covering the coastal area from Palliyawatta to Negombo, Fr. Gunatilleke said.
The Catholic parish priests, Buddhist, Muslim and Hindu, religious leaders in the relevant areas also played leading roles in organising the event. Youth groups, Sunday school students and teachers, YMCAs and fisheries communities including Dheewara Samithiyas assisted us in making this event a success, Fr. Gunatilleke added.

CIDs IP Nishantha Silva appeals to NPC
	
The CIDs Organised Crimes Investigation Unit OIC Inspector Nishantha Silva who was transferred to the Negombo Division, had appealed to the National Police Commission (NPC) over his transfer.
NPC Secretary Saman Dissanayaka said the Commission would ask for a report from IGP Pujith Jayasundara on this matter.
He said the NPC had not recommended IP Nishanthas transfer as the CID did not come under the NPC's functional division. The Secretary said the transfer had been made by the IGP.
IP Silva was the OIC of the CIDs Organised Crimes Investigation Unit which is handling investigations into many major incidents including the murder of Editor Lasantha Wickramatunge and the abduction and assault of journalist Keith Noyahr.
IP Silva is known to be heading investigations into at least 60 crimes committed by the LTTE, the rape and murder of student Sivaloganathan Vithya, the abduction of 11 youths in Colombo and Chief of Defence Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratnes alleged involvement in harbouring a suspect and many more.

Dont be fooled by rumours: Australia
	
The Australian High Commission today warned Sri Lankans not to be fooled by false advertising through social media or by people smugglers that it was possible to get to Australia illegally by boat. 
It said in a statement that the Australian High Commission was aware of the rumours circulating on social media and said Australias maritime pathway was closed.
Australia remains committed to protecting its borders, stamping out people smuggling, and preventing people from risking their lives at sea, it said.
Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson warns Sri Lankans not to be fooled by false advertising through social media or by people smugglers.
Australias borders are closed to illegal migration. The tough border protection policies that have secured Australias borders against the threat of people smuggling and prevented people from dying at sea remain in place.
"Australia maintains a robust operational capability to detect and respond to any people smuggling boat to ensure that no illegal maritime venture makes it to Australia. If you attempt to come illegally by boat, you will be caught.
Every Sri Lankan people smuggling boat that has entered Australian waters in the past four years has been stopped, and all those on board returned to Sri Lanka, High Commissioner Hutchesson said.
Australia continues to work closely with regional partners, including Sri Lanka, to identify and disrupt people smuggling ventures before they even get on the water.
In the past five years, international authorities, with the assistance of Australia, have disrupted 78 people smuggling ventures, preventing 2525 people from travelling illegally by boat and leading to more than 614 arrests. 
By working together with our regional partners, we are shutting down people smuggling syndicates operating in our region and preventing people from getting on dangerous and pointless boat ventures, High Commissioner Hutchesson said.
Since the implementation of Australias toughest ever border protection measures in 2013, Australia has returned 827 people from 34 people smuggling ventures to their country of origin or departure, including 166 Sri Lankans.

Dozens arrested around flashpoint Indian temple
	

PAMBA AFP Nov19, 2018 - Indian police arrested 68 people taking part in protests around a controversial Hindu temple ahead of a Supreme Court ruling Monday on whether it should be given more time to let women enter. 
The Sabarimala temple in the southern state of Kerala has become a major battleground between Hindu radicals and gender activists. 
Tens of thousands of pilgrims have thronged to the hilltop shrine since it reopened Friday amid unprecedented security. We arrested 68 devotees after overnight protests around Sabarimala, V.N Saji, assistant commissioner of Kerala police, told AFP. The region has been increasingly tense with Hindu organisations and Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposing the Supreme Court order to let women in the temple.

## Title: Elections for Bangladeshs eleventh Parliament will be different

Elections for Bangladeshs eleventh Parliament will be different
	
Elections to Bangladeshs eleventh parliament are to take place on December 30 and they are going to be very different from the elections to the tenth parliament which took place in January 2014.
In 2014, the elections were boycotted by the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led byKhaleda Zia. 
The BNP had contended that the elections will not be free and fair in the absence of a neutral caretaker government, a system the Awami League (AL) government led by Sheikh Hasina had abolished in 2011.
The BNPs anger was justified in as much as the caretaker government system was introduced after a struggle jointly waged by it and the AL in 1991. 
As a result of BNPs boycott, more than half the 350 seats in parliament (153), were won by the AL uncontested. The AL won 87 of the uncontested seats (59%), and 105 of the 147 contested seats (almost 69%).
The only party in the opposition was former military dictator Gen.H.M. Ershads Jatiya Party (JP) which got 41 seats (eventually).
In 2015, the frustrated BNP unleashed violence which led to the killing of 197 people, 72 of whom were burnt alive. To the advantage of the AL, the violence alienated the BNP from the people. 
The virtual one-party rule of Prime Minister Hasina was further bolstered by the institution of corruption and money laundering cases against BNP chief Khalida Zia and her son Tarique Zia. 
While Khalida was jailed, Tarique became a fugitive in London. The BNP became leaderless and began to wither. 
However, Hasinas one-party rule bolstered the countrys economy. In 2017 the economy grew at 10% with lots of foreign investments. Per capita income rose to US$ 973. Manufacturing boomed and became the single largest contributor to the GDP (Bangladesh Taka 18 billion). With exports going up, the trade deficit came down to US$6.2 billion. Remittances were at a high US$ 15 billion.
But the boom did not produce as many jobs as it should have. 31% of the people live below the poverty line.According to independent agencies, 47% of graduates are unemployed though the Bangladesh Bank said that 98% of those in the working age group are unemployed. There is under-employment rather than employment.

It was to check the Hasina governments unbridled power that the BNP decided to give up its policy of boycotting elections until they are held under neutral caretaker governments

But the political stability which contributed to economic growth came at a cost. Perhaps deservedly, Islamic terrorism and the drug menace were tackled ruthlessly by extra-judicial killings. Extra-judicial killings numbered 128 in 2014, but rose to 195 in 2016 partly because of the killing of foreigners and upper class guests in a posh restaurant in Dhaka by boys from elite English speaking families.
Recently, under the Special Powers Act of 1974, 14,000 people were rounded up and 300 persons were killed in crossfires. 
Human Rights groups cried foul, but the government and the people welcomed the use of extra judicial measures as Islamic terrorism and drug trafficking had spread like cancer, claiming lives of liberals. 
But unbridled power also led to the Hasina regime dominating and manipulating the administration, the judiciary and the Election Commission. It abolished the election-time caretaker government system in 2011.The Election Commission came under the Executive and the ruling party de facto.
Recently,the Chief Election Commissioner K.M. Nurul Huda said that he cannot guarantee an election without irregularities. And one of the Election Commissioners, Kabita Khanam, said that the commission cannot ensure a 100% fair election but can ensure an acceptable election. 

Jatika Oikya Front - BNP Alliance
It was to check the Hasina governments unbridled power that the BNP decided to give up its policy of boycotting elections until they are held under neutral caretaker governments. As a first step the BNP contested the local bodies elections in 2016 and it is now contesting the December 30 parliamentary elections.
The BNP has joined hands with Kamal Hossains new group, the Jatika Oikya Front (JOF). Hossain, who was Bangladeshs first Foreign Minister, may not be politically very relevant, but he gives the BNP legitimacy. Its image is tarnished by charges of thuggery and violence. The liberals brand it as a fellow traveler of Islamic radicals.

In 2014, the elections were boycotted by the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by Khaleda Zia

JOF has demanded free and fair elections; appointment of a neutral government ahead of elections; the release of BNP chief, Khaleda Zia; withdrawal of all cases against her and other BNP leaders and activists; reform of the Election Commission by appointing people acceptable to all parties; usage of electronic voting machines; assurance of freedom of speech for individuals, newspapers and electronic and social media, and all political parties meetings and rallies; and a halt to legal proceedings in all political cases after the announcement of the election schedule.
Press freedom had come under attack under the Hasina regime. For example, 79 cases, including some sedition cases, were slapped on the editor of The Daily Star for example. Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha had to flee the country after he gave a ruling against the 16th Constitutional amendment which had allowed the impeachment of Supreme Court judges.
Sinha had also said that the Supreme Court could unseat a Prime Minister as the Pakistan Supreme Court did in the case of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 

Hounding Continues
The Hasina government is continuing to go after the BNP even though it is a much weaker party now with its leader in jail and her heir apparent living in London as a fugitive. 
After the announcement of the December 30 elections, 773 BNP cadres were arrested. The BNP has submitted a list of the arrested to the Election Commission.
It is difficult to predict which way the December 30 election will go. A recent survey by the International Republican Institute (IRI) found there is still significant support for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League. But the support base is narrowing. 
62% said the country is going in the right direction, but one year ago, it was 75%. There is also an increase in the number of people not wanting to answer the questionnaire. 40% of respondents declined to say whether they thought political stability would improve or worsen, compared to 29 per cent last year.

Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga Her other name is hope
	
Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sri Lankas former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, and Maldives former presidents Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Mohamed Nasheed and Mohamed Waheed attend the Maldives President-elect Ibrahim Solihs swearing in ceremony in Maldives (Reuter)

Political analysts see her playing a bigger role in politics
But today she sees her blood boil for Sirisena has been accused of destroying the SLFP
She is still a sort-after speaker at many forums
Many of her critics must be reminded of how J.R.J described Chandrika, in politics

Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga is very much in the news these days and even received an invitation to attend the swearing in ceremony of Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, in Male, Maldives.
Like former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Chandrika is another Sri Lankan politician who has earned the respect of the international community. It is reported that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chandrika in the sidelines of the big event in Male and even inquired into the political situation in Sri Lanka.
Political analysts see her playing a bigger role in politics, largely because she is the SLFPs organiser for Attanagalla and also due to the fact that the blue party has been weakened due to losing of many of its high profile members to the newly formed Pohottuwa party.
Chandrika took a backseat in Sri Lanka politics after she was forced to leave office in 2004 because the Constitution barred her from running for presidency a third time. She had constant arguments with her successor Mahinda Rajapaksa, who she accused of working against her interests in politics. Chandrika even accused Rajapaksa of isolating her from politics and also for prohibiting parliamentarians from meeting her. It seems the time has come for her to give the return to Rajapaksa which she did by refusing the present premier an audience with her despite calls being made thrice to set up a meeting between the two. Some see her as stubborn, but Chandrikas official explanation for snubbing Rajapaksa was that she would not meet the man who destroyed the very political party which gave him a shoulder to rise.

sort-after speaker
Chandrikas appearances at political platforms here and abroad give hope to many and also raises speculation as to whether she would return to active politics. Many years ago when there was a debate on whether Rajapaksa could contest the presidency for the third time, she announced that she was interested in becoming the prime minister; not necessarily under Rajapaksa, in case he won.
In 2015 she was in the limelight throwing her weight behind the National Movement for Social Justice in the run-up to the presidential elections. She worked along with Ranil Wickremesinghe and others in a group marshalled by the late Ven.Sobith Thera, shelving the differences she had with the UNP stalwart, Wickremesinghe. She was one key figure behind bringing President Sirisena to the hot seat of the presidency.

Do these signs indicate that Modis vision has caught the sight of a new ally which would help forge Indias interests in Sri Lanka

But today she sees her blood boil for Sirisena has been accused of destroying the SLFP by teaming up with Rajapaksa, who left the blue party to strengthen the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). Chandrika belongs to the era of politics where law makers backed the cause of the common man. She continued in the lines of what her father introduced to local politics; ushering in the era of the common man.
She couldnt have had a better start to politics and worked behind the shadows of her late husband Vijaya Kumaratunga who was slowly working towards becoming the president of Sri Lanka. She was critisised for forming an alliance with several leftists after Vijayas death. But once she assumed power in 1994 she showed that she had a mind of her own to pursue politics in a country which was already severely affected by a civil war.

Ability to promise change
Even when assuming duties, there was hope in the north for peace. She has that ability even now to promise change during periods of distress. At a time when Sirisena is fast losing appeal, analysts believe that Chandrika has the makings to rally the blue party together if given an opportunity.
Recently she released a statement to the media regarding the chaotic political situation in the country. Her statement says, The scenes being played out in the past in parliament destroy the peoples confidence in democracy. The time has come like never before for Sri Lankans to stand up for freedom and good governance. The country has reached a dangerous precipice of chaos, anarchy and breakdown of the law.
She is still a sort-after speaker at many forums and received an invitation to speak at the 29th LAWASIA Conference (Golden Jubilee conference in 2016) in Colombo. There she said, The state must have the political will to engage in a honest process with regard to reconciliation. She had also said that her country had won a war, but still there was no peace.
Very recently we came to know that Indian Premier Modi was dissatisfied with Sri Lankas efforts in carrying out many Indian funded projects in the island. History reveals that Indian has played a role over the years in making inputs to the Tamil cause in Sri Lanka. This could be one reason why Modi was so eager to meet Chandrika in Male. Do these signs indicate that Modis vision has caught the sight of a new ally which would help forge Indias interests in Sri Lanka
Chandrika has a role to play in the SLFP as the organiser for Attanagalla. Many believe that she can take on bigger roles and strengthen the party, which was a force to be reckoned with in the 1950s and the early 1990s. She has said that she regrets some party members joining hands with a political group which is destroying fundamental rights, democracy, democratic institutions and are building disruptive networks of graft and corruption. Her voice has never been heard so loud in the political scenes like now.
In September she declared open the Gonagala Bridge, which falls across the Attanagalla Oya, amidst protests by SLPP supporters who claimed the project was commenced during the Rajapaksa regime. Chandrika showing the willingness to accept the post of Organiser of Attanagalla underscores that she has more years in her to serve the public.
We mustnt forget the fact that she is one of those rare politicians who is armed with a degree in political science. She has also shown through her actions that she stands for fair play and democracy and honours the rule of the law. For the record she is one who believed in a political solution when Tiger rebels were staging war for a separate state. She paid the price for her thinking when she lost an eye when terrorists exploded a bomb at a rally she was attending. Her actor turned politician husband was gunned down near his residence in 1988, a time when the country was feeling the heat of conflicts in the north and south both. But despite all these disturbances in her life she has chosen to return to politics.
Many of her critics who dont take her seriously must be reminded of how former President J.R Jayewardene-terned the Old Fox- described Chandrika, in politics. He had said, Dont take her seriously when she speaks, but watch her closely when she starts working.

Gunadasa Kapuge: What more words
	

Udena Wickremesooriya, talking about his fathers work, the evolution of Sooriya, and the resurgence and upsurge of popular music in this country during the latter part of the sixties, suggested that when compared to the deterioration on almost every front in the political sphere, contemporary artists, especially vocalists and composers, didnt seem to rebel enough against the establishment. Wheres our Arab Spring Wheres our Pussy Riot Where are our Nina Simones and Aretha Franklins
It was not a lament. It was an observation. He did not regret, yet he was not happy either: Music and politics can be strange bedfellows at times, but more often than not, the one complements the other. He pointed at two frequently alluded to names: Nanda Malini and Gunadasa Kapuge. Its impossible to rank them, and it depends on your preferences. Im not sure how Udena would rank them, but as I would place Kapuge at the top. Not because Nanda, and Sunil Ariyaratne, were his inferiors, but because in Kapuge, if we are to take Udenas word for it, we come across a near-perfect complementarity between music and politics.

Music and politics can be strange bedfellows at times, but more often than not, the one complements the other. He pointed at two frequently alluded to names: Nanda Malini and Gunadasa Kapuge. Its impossible to rank them, and it depends on your preferences. Im not sure how Udena would rank them

Protest music, like protest plays and protest films, privileges the political over the aesthetic most of the time. This is known. The truly creative artiste, if he or she has engaged with his or her society well enough, knows how to craft the lyric, the melody, and the script in such a way that they do not become politically relevant at the cost of being artistically confused and clichd. Some of the most seminal works of protest art Ive seen or listened to over the last five years, here, have stood up to that test. That is why Udayasiri Wickramaratnes Suddek Oba Amathayi is a greater political play than most of Rajitha Dissanayakes newer plays. That is also why Jehan Aloysiuss Rag, an indictment (supposedly) on the politics of ragging, tends to negative and contradict its own message in a way that Jayantha Chandrasiris Hankithi Dahathuna does not, even though the latter is patently less political.
What is true for our plays is true also for our music. Pick on any theme: a mothers love. One of the more popular songs delving into it from the recent past is Sixth Lanes Mandaram Wahi Watena. It is moving in a populist way: its lyrics are not fragmentary like most contemporary songs, and it appeals to everyone. And yet, it shares with those songs one problem: a literal-minded approach to its subject matter.
Le kiri karapu amma senehen wadu mage amma
I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, an expert on the Sinhala language and its many poetic nuances, but I cant help notice that whatever the theme, political or otherwise, most lyricists just cant get beyond the immediacy of what they are asked to write about. If its love, we hear the inevitable lament: I love her, she loved me, her father didnt like me, shes gone off with a richer man! If its about the country, we hear the inevitable rallying cry: Sri Lankaaaa mathaaaa! (No offence to Bathiya and Santhush, of course.) Weve banalised the lyrics, in other words, so much so that theres nothing really left to read into them.
The situation is trickier for socially conscious songs, because no one bothers to sing about injustice, disparities, protests, and the brotherhood of man any more. They are content with aestheticising the personal. Thats it.
How different, then, are Kapuges songs! Kapuge did not sing about injustice and disparities and protests and the brotherhood of man only, though his more popular songs delve into these themes. He also sang about mothers who bring up fatherless children, of the bitterest and sweetest tear-drops of unrequited romances, of lovers who part ways in the twilight of their youth, and, soaring above them all, of the ula lena who, cast aside from this cruel world, seeks shelter in the thorny thickets of a forest. There was nothing he couldnt sing about. Nothing he didnt, either.
Who was he, then He was many things. At one point, the voice of the Rajarata Sevaya, where he was sent packing off to, as a punishment transfer, when he was working at the SLBC. My mother and father heard him over the Sevaya, and for their generation at least, that was how he was best remembered. Karunaratne Divulgane, Jayathilake Bandara, Manel Rajakaruna, and Annesley Nanayakkara, on the other hand, will remember him as their teacher, the man who was able to spot out, choose, and nurture young, emerging talent. He was a beacon of light, Divulgane, speaking of the man, told Malinda Seneviratne. Im sure there are others who remember him for other reasons. Like Sugathapala de Silva, whom I shall get to shortly.
As for me, I remember him more than anything else for one song. Well, two actually: Dawasak Pela Nathi Hene and Dam Patin La Sanda Basa Yanawa. The first is about reconciliation, the second about separation. The first is about the sorrow of love, the second about the happiness of parting. I heard them for the first time over the radio when I was young. They captivated me not on account of the words or the melody, but as importantly as both of them, the voice. Amaradevas songs belong to Amaradeva because no one else can (or should, as W. D. Ariyasinghe ought to have realised) sing them. It is the same with these two. They belong to Kapuge.
Dawasak Pela Nathi Hene is the best riposte I can think of to a banal song like Mandaram Wahi Watena because, strangely enough, both of them pick on the same trope: the mother as a shelter for her son. But while Sixth Lanes ditty plays on a more literal interpretation of this troupe, Kapuges song plays on its symbolic value. The title itself brings together the literal and symbolic, a pela nathi hena being a metaphor for a mother who has lost her husband. Simple, yet profoundly unsettling.
I know of youngsters who cry at Sixth Lanes song, and I know for a fact that they are sincere in their response to it. But try as I might, I cant bring myself to weep to the literal mindedness of its lyrics. Can they really compare to the following lines
Otunna bimada duwagena ennada eka pimme
Mang enathuru indikada langa innawada amme
It goes without saying that they cannot. Not because the lyricist of Sixth Lanes song hasnt tried, but because we are now used to being bombarded by the literal meaning of a work of art so much that we dont even try to go beyond the first reading of a text. Popular culture has become a culture of literal artifice: it has no room for a Kapuge, because (and this is what musical connoisseurs and critics have told me) technology is far more alluring to the present generation of vocalists and lyricists than the fact that a song, like any other work of art, has to formalise an experience: not necessarily lived through perhaps, but still heard about, picked up, and relayed.
I heard Kapuge through many other songs. Right at the other end of the sorrowful overtones of Dawasak Pela Nathi Hene were the joyful undertones of Dam Patin La Sanda Basa Yanawa, which, like Kapuges lament for the mother, was also rooted in a personal experience (Lucien Bulathsinghala, who was the lyricist, tells us that he wrote it for a childhood lover who parted ways when he entered Peradeniya Campus and she entered Colombo Campus; Ranbanda Seneviratne, who wrote the other song, tells us that he wrote it as a tribute to his mother).
Those were more personal, though, and, by default, less political. They spoke to our innermost feelings, which bonded the rich to the poor, and the dispossessed to the privileged. You didnt have to be anyone in particular to listen to, or enjoy, them.
There were other songs. These, I will get to later. For now I will say this: they enthral me less because they are interesting as works of art than because they were sung by a vocalist who remained, to his last day, a humanist. I mentioned Sugathapala de Silva before. Heres how Sugathapala (whose Thuranga Sanniya became the first play that Kapuge scored) will remember him. I quote Malinda: Kapuge had collected the payment for his part in the Sunflower samaga (with) Kapuge album, a few hundred thousand rupees, and gone straight to visit a friend who was suffering from cancer and needed money for surgery/medication. He left the money with his friend. Then he went home. Simple. That friend, of course, was Sugathapala.
There were so many stories like that about Kapuge. A true artist becomes a human being first, Victor Ratnayake once told me. Kapuge, in that sense, became a man, a human being, long before any of us picked him up at the Rajarata Sevaya. He didnt leave us as an artist, though. Like Amaradeva, he lingers on. With us.

Intense week of talks ahead of Brexit showdown summit
	

European governments get their own say on Brexit this week as they debate future ties with London in the run-up to Sundays summit to sign Britains divorce papers. 
Ministers from the other 27 EU member states are in Brussels on Monday at the start of what Prime Minister Theresa May calls an intense week of negotiations. The British leader has said she will be in the city herself later in the week to meet the head of the EU commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for last-minute talks. 
Neither May nor European leaders are keen to reopen the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement that was grudgingly approved by the British cabinet last week. 
But both sides are scrambling to finalise a parallel political declaration that will set out a road-map for post-Brexit negotiations on future EU-UK ties. The focus this week will be on the future relationship, May told Sky News. We wont agree the leaving part... until weve got what we want in the future relationship, because these two go together. Specifically, London wants to lay out in as much detail as possible how to get to a free trade agreement before the end of a 21-month post-Brexit transition. 
Brussels, meanwhile, insists Britain cannot have the same privileged access to the single market as it did as a member state after Brexit on March 29 next year. 
European negotiators plan to publish their version of the statement on future relations on Tuesday, after their ambassadors met over the weekend.

If you try to stand in the way of justice for my father & other victims of brutality, you will fail."
Alternatively, you could wait until the independent National Police Commission or a court of law reviews your order and shoots it down.

The statement further said: "It is an accepted fact that there is a chaotic situation among the general public due to the unstable situation that has emerged in the country based on the prevailing crisis in the administrative machinery. This chaotic situation seems to have emerged largely due to those concerned focusing on personal agendas. Priority should be given to the objectives of the people.
The solution to this problem has to be sought according to the theory of Cause and Effect of Lord Buddha. This problem will not be solved when the of the others are going to be highlighted without seeking their own fault.
We urge the President, the Speaker and all political party leaders to act fast to ensure democracy in the country. Since there is consensus for an election from many factions, we feel an atmosphere should be in place for the conduct of a peaceful election.

Moody's downgrades SL's ratings, changes outlook to stable
	
Moody's Investors Service today downgraded Sri Lankan Government's foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to B2 from B1 and changed the outlook to stable from negative.
In a statement, it said the decision to downgrade the rating to B2 was driven by Moody's view that ongoing tightening in external and domestic financing conditions and low reserve adequacy, exacerbated most recently by a political crisis which seems likely to have a lasting impact on policy.
Moody's projections include a slower pace of fiscal consolidation than assumed in July to reflect disruption to fiscal policy implementation in a period of political turmoil.The stable outlook denotes balanced credit risks at the B2 rating level. Moody's expectation is that, despite the current political crisis, any future government will remain broadly focused on implementing important fiscal, monetary and economic reforms that would strengthen the credit profile over the medium term.
However, Moody's assessment is that the government's debt refinancing will remain highly vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment in a period of further tightening in financing conditions and political and policy uncertainty, with limited buffers to face such risk, it said.

More rains can be expected over the island with the low pressure area in the Southern Bay of Bengal likely to intensify into a depression and move westwards, the Department of Meteorology said.
It advised fishermen not to venture out to sea off the coast extending from Mullaitivu to Mannar via Kankasanturai.
Heavy rains of up to 150mm can be expected in some places in the Northern Province, particularly in the Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and North-Western provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts, the Met Department said.
Fairly strong winds of up to 50kmph can be expected over the Northern Province tomorrow while lightning and strong winds of up to 80kmph are also likely during thundershowers.
The Met Department requested people living in hilly areas (particularly in landslide-prone areas) to be vigilant and take adequate precautions to minimize damage caused by lightning activity.
Meanwhile, the highest rainfall of 90.9mm was reported in Mattala in the Hambantota district. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

politicians be cautious; children are watching
	
With the unprecedented Constitutional crisis and the political turmoil in Sri Lanka moving into its fourth week our political leaders need to be aware that what they do or fail to do would have disastrous effects more on the new and next generation than the present one.
Apparently the Constitution is being challenged as are hallowed parliamentary standing orders, ethics and principles. Democracys pillars are being shaken and if this dangerous trend goes unchecked Sri Lankas image may crumble and it is the next generation that will suffer the most. 
We focused on the children and the next generation because today the United Nations International Childrens Educational Fund (UNICEF) marked Universal Childrens Day.
When a crisis-ridden parliament met last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, children were among the millions of people who saw live on television the rowdyism or hooliganism that some MPs indulged in what analysts saw as one of the most disgraceful, if not disgusting parliamentary sessions in independent Sri Lanka. Were these MPs were aware or was it they did not care about the horrible example they were setting to the children, because such behaviour is normally seen only among mafia gangsters or rowdies in marketplaces. We hope that when Parliament meets again on Friday, not only will sanity be restored, but a just solution will be found to the ongoing catastrophe. 
According to UNICEF, Universal Childrens Day was first marked in 1954 and is celebrated on November 20 each year to promote international togetherness, awareness among children worldwide, and improving childrens welfare.
November 20 is important as it is the date in 1959, when the UN General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. It is also the date in 1989, when the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Since 1990, Universal Childrens Day also marks the anniversary of the date that the UN General Assembly adopted both the declaration and the convention on childrens rights.
Mothers and fathers, teachers, nurses and doctors, government leaders and civil society activists, religious and community elders, corporate moguls, media professionals and young people or children themselves can play an important part in making Universal Childrens Day relevant for their societies, communities and nations, UNICEF says. The day offers us an inspirational entry-point to advocate, promote and celebrate childrens rights, translating into dialogues and actions that will build a better world for Children, the UNICEF adds. 
This years theme is Children are taking over and turning the world blue. This year the world is going blue! Were asking individuals, schools and corporate heads worldwide to go blue to help build a world where every child is in school, safe from harm and can fulfill their potential, and we know you do too. Going blue activities include: sharing our promo video for Childrens day, signing the global petition and going blue in support of childrens rights in social media, and much, much more, the world body says.
In Sri Lanka, besides the horrible example being set by some political leaders in recent weeks one of the new major problems for children is wide-scale drug peddling by unscrupulous if not heartless drug gangs often with political support or patronage. Addictive drugs with attractive names such as apple or ice are known to be sold by peddlers around schools and thousands of children are known to be addicted. These drugs often lead to a heroin addiction and cost of a puff is known to have risen to as much as Rs.5,000! Obviously most children cannot afford this. So they join the gangs or become robbers first from home, then elsewhere and eventually engage in big time robberies which will send them to jail for long terms.
We hope that once the political turmoil is ended and the movement towards a just society begins, the government would take tough action against the drug gangs.
People, specially the children, seldom or never listen to preaching only, they need to and have a right to be led by the example set by our leaders. This is a time when some political leaders apparently need to be led by children because as great religious leaders and philosophers have told us the humility and devastating honesty of children are essential factors for a better world.

President should use his new clout to end the crisis
	

Sri Lankas leaders of all political hues are not necessarily the champions of liberal democracy. Nor are the countrys elections, which are regularly held, but generally tainted by misappropriation of state property, free and fair in a genuine sense. However, outcome of elections was often the reflection of the overall popular mood. They were not stolen. There is also an overall political consensus to accept the peoples mandate in the elections, and its reflection in the national and provincial legislature. This broader consensus exercised a moderating influence on the usual ugliness and arbitrariness of politics. That is why we did not have paralyzing strikes and hartals to settle scores between the political elites of the kind generally seen in Bangladesh. That is also why Sri Lankan politics had been free of violent ouster of an elected government, at least since the defeat of the JVP insurgency. 
The on-going constitutional crisis is threatening this consensus. In the first place, the trigger of the crisis is the Presidents highly controversial and arbitrary sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, and subsequent dissolution of Parliament, when the latter failed to muster the support of the plurality of MPs in Parliament. The sequence of these events was guided by cynical calculations over the time and space to orchestrate cross- overs from the Opposition, and to manipulate the judiciary. Each of these steps went wrong. MR and Sirisena failed to lure sufficient number of MPs. Then, facing a No Confidence Motion against the former, the President dissolved Parliament. The presidential proclamation was suspended by the Court which issued a staying order against the dissolution of Parliament. 

The trigger of the crisis is the Presidents highly controversial and arbitrary sacking of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the PM

The Court order effectively turned tables against the President and his Prime Minister appointee MR. Yet, it is at that point that the constitutional crisis ceased to be constitutional. It is now being guided by extra-constitutional means, that treat the constitution with contempt. 
The President can no longer defends his course of action, his PM has failed to muster a majority support in Parliament. The game plan has effectively shifted from defending their actions in the name of the constitution to the disruption of due constitutional process in order to fight off the constitutional challenge. The UNP, JVP and TNA have passed three consecutive No Confidence Motions within a week against MR. The MPs of the Joint Opposition disrupted the proceedings and the vote each time and wreaked havoc inside the House. They refused to take part in a vote by division, leading the Speaker to take a voice vote, which President Sirisena has used as an excuse to refuse to accept the outcome of the vote. 
The Presidents conduct and justifications of his action is ludicrous and childlike. Yesterday, IP Nishantha Silva who had been leading the investigation into a number of war time atrocities, including the abduction of eleven Tamil youth by a Navy intelligence unit, was transferred out of CID, reportedly on the instructions of the President. The latter has also re-enacted another phase of highly expensive cross overs, setting a deadline for MR to show his majority in the House.
The President is increasingly becoming detached from reality. He triggered the worst ever constitutional crisis, simply because he did not like the face of Ranil (for which latter may have reasons, but, the Constitution does not provide pretext for settling personal prejudices). By doing so, he plunged the entire country into turmoil, the economy is taking a heavy tool. The rupee is on a free fall. International image of the country and the president is in tatters. 

Each move by the President to prop up his position has come a cropper. Yet he keeps digging in the hole he dug himself into, perpetuating the crisis

Each move by the President to prop up his position has come a cropper. Yet he keeps digging in the hole he dug himself into, perpetuating the crisis. His personal calculations have taken the better of him at the expense of the country. He is presiding over a reign of disorder.
He seems to ravish the power he wields momentarily over both his oppositions and allies. But, he has done precious little to make use of that clout to resolve the crisis. He held an all party meeting during the weekend, and another yesterday, ostensibly to find means to end the stalemate. Both meetings ended inconclusively. But that might serve the calculations of Sirisena and MR and their goons. They believe in perpetuating the crisis so at one point , the UNP and the other parties will give in to their call for snap General elections. Elections extracted through the threat of political and economic disruption would set a bad precedent and could well be emulated by others in the future. 
President Sirisenas fall from grace is spectacular. That is his own making. However, the country and the people should not be held hostage by his whims and fancies, and personal political calculations. He should clear the mess that he himself created and use his authority to instruct his loyalists to allow and take part in an orderly floor vote. The outcome of the vote should end the rival claims as to who command the majority in Parliament. 
President Sirisena is not inclined do that as the JO and a government that he appointed fall well short of majority.

TEACHERS TRAINING COLLEGE IN MY TIME - 66 YEARS AGO
	

Entrance to the Training College was through a competitive examination known as the Government Teachers Training College Entrance Examination. I sat for the examination and was successful and after being interviewed by the Principal, Mr. S.F.de Silva, I was selected. The training course was for a period of two years. 
It was in February, 1952 that I walked in through the famous portals of the Government Training College, Maharagama to start my teaching career as a trained teacher. There were about 125 students in my batch, both males and females. The Mens as well as the Womens hostel were on the same premises, separated by a barbed wire fence. 
The very next day after the new batch arrived, we were ragged. It was all done in pure fun, with no malice whatsoever. It was more or less, the second year students, trying to get acquainted with the newcomers. I remember we had a Beauty Parade, refreshments consisting of grass- filled sandwiches and sweets made of poonac. A few of the newcomers developed stomach pains, after partaking of these delicacies. Eventually, it forged a great camaraderie between the second years and the freshers. 

Our lecturers were a class by themselves. Almost all of them have gone to their eternal reward. Its not surprising, since the students they lectured to at GTC are all octogenarians or nonagenarians themselves now- most of them have reached their journeys end

Our lecturers were a class by themselves. Almost all of them have gone to their eternal reward. Its not surprising, since the students they lectured to at GTC are all octogenarians or nonagenarians themselves now- most of them have reached their journeys end. We had many outstanding lecturers. Some of the names that come to my mind are Mr. S.F. de Silva, who was the Principal and Mr. C.N.C. Jayawardena, Vice Principal, Mr. D.G. Sugathadasa, Mr. W.M.A. Warnasuriya, Mr. S. Wanigatunga, Mr. R. Thenabadu, Mr. Douglas Walatara, Mr. Wijewardena, Mr. Abegunasekera, Mr. Thangarajah, Mr. Karalakulasingham, Mr. Tambimuttu, Mr. Duncan White, Mr. Saranagupta Amerasinghe, Miss. Damayanthi Dunuwille, Mr. T.U.de Silva, Mr. Leslie Handunge, Mrs. Geddes, Mrs. Snell, Mrs. De Mel, Mrs. Pate, Miss. O. Perera, Miss. Davidson and Mr. Edwards. Our Hostel Superintendent was Mrs. Weerasinghe ably assisted by Mrs. Thalgodapitiya. 
The students were a harmonious mixture of all nationalities. Looking back on those far-off days one remembers not so much the lectures and the routine work, but the little pranks and escapades-like a few of us cutting lectures to go and watch a movie. These may sound silly and school girlish today but in the context of 66 years ago, they were most daring as well as enjoyable. Life at GTC was full of fun, frolic and study. The teaching methods then were quite different from those that apply today. We had a Dieting Committee consisting of both male and female students. The committee had to do the marketing and they provided us with all the meals. We paid. Rs.30/= per month which was a big amount 66 years ago. I dont think you can get a cup of milk tea for Rs.30/= now. 
I made many close friends during the 2 years at GTC. Kusuma Alles, Catherine Amerasinghe and Chandra Peiris were my bosom pals. Only Catherine and I are left out of the Quartet. Many romances blossomed in the college. Some lasted a short time, while others lasted till they left college and got married. The A1 classroom and the Catchment Area were the usual haunts of the courting couples. 
I have vivid memories of those GTC days. We went on many educational tours, including the 7 days All island trip. The year 1952 turned out to be a very eventful one GTC celebrated its Diamond Jubilee with a number of activities. There was a grand educational exhibition. The celebrations began with a ceremonial procession. If I remember right, Minister P.B.G. Kalugalle was the Chief Guest at the ceremony. It was just after I joined GTC, that King George VI died and the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth was held on February 6.
All too soon, the year 1952 drew to an end. The second years were leaving GTC and there were many sad farewell. Parting was such sweet sorrow, especially for the lovelorn couples. 
In February 1953 the Freshers arrived and the usual rag was held. It is with nostalgic memories that I recall the halcyon days and the wonderful times, we had at GTC. We, as secondary trained teachers were able to maintain the high standards we imbibed at GTC over six and a half decades ago. The secondary trained teachers who passed out of GTC were an indispensable, capable group of teachers, who were not confined only to classroom work, but they were also the backbone of Maha Vidyalayas and Madhya Maha Vidyalayas, where they were in charge of Cadetting, Scouting, Guiding, Athletics, Cricket, Football, Netball and other activities, like drawing up timetables, working in the library etc.
Because of the all-round capabilities of the secondary trained teachers, they were appointed as Supervisors at the GCE examinations and also as Marking examiners. They were competent to teach English as well as subjects like Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Advanced Maths and Applied Maths in Sinhala, for the first time. 
Alas! The Government Teachers Training College, Maharagama is no more. It has been relegated to history and secondary trained teachers trained at Maharagama GTC are a vanishing tribe. Those halcyon days will never come back and only nostalgic memories of those good, old days remain fresh in our minds.

The secret is out
	
A prominent political authority hailing from a district which had served as the seat of an ancient kingdom had covertly sabotaged the development projects launched by another Diyawanna politico representing the same district.
However, the young politico had been under the impression that it was the white-collar high-up in the district who was responsible for stalling the implementation of his projects.
Following the fall of the yahapalanaya administration, the white-collar high-up had confessed to the young politico that he had to sideline the formers development projects on the orders of the senior political authority. I am sorry, Sir, I couldnt help but follow his orders, the white-collar high-up had explained.

The seeds of my success were sown in early childhood
	
          Today is Universal Childrens Day            


The role of parents is important in a childs life and through simple actions such as play and stimulation, they can positively shape their childs development

Many Sri Lankans were not eating the right, nutritionally rich and diverse foods needed to fuel their brain and body development

As the world marks the anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of the Child on World Childrens Day, we must ensure every child in Sri Lanka has the same opportunity for success.
Two months ago, my life somewhat changed. Unbeknownst to me at the time, an old university colleague from Princeton did a talk at an event in Washington DC that was widely reported in the media, in which my name was kindly mentioned. What made this notable was that this old colleague was Jeff Bezos - Founder, Chairman and CEO of Amazon. He kindly remembered me as the smartest guy at Princeton.
While I certainly dont believe that I was the smartest guy at my university, I do believe that several factors, especially in my early childhood, enabled me, a young man from Sri Lanka, to attend one of the worlds best universities. Now that I have children myself, I believe that certain simple yet vital early childhood development factors where critical in enabling me to reach my full potential, and that they can and must be replicated for every young person in Sri Lanka. 

Equally important is for parents to answer the endless stream of questions from their young ones to the best of their ability, to encourage imagination and curiosity

So, what were these factors First and foremost, it was the love of my parents and the simple actions they undertook to nurture me and my creativity. Second, my early education and the stimulation it provided, and finally, good nutrition.
I believe my parents, who were not rich but educated, were ahead of their time. My mother who was a teacher, and father, who was an accountant, enabled me to express myself, nurtured my creativity and stimulated my thinking. One of my earliest memories is being free to draw all over the house, including on the walls, with pencils and crayons, to the shock of my aunts and uncles. Each month, after my mother encouraged me to count her modest salary to help me with numbers, she would buy me simple short story books for us to read together, or creative toys like Meccano, that I would spend hours on each day, building and re-building. Later in childhood my parents would encourage me to play chess, learn musical instruments, do puzzles and would nurture learning opportunities. This freedom of expression, which I replicated with my own children, and the nurturing and stimulating environment that was facilitated by my parents at home was critical in my early years, and is critical to every childs early development. The role of parents is important in a childs life and through simple actions such as play and stimulation, they can positively shape their childs development. Equally important is for parents to answer the endless stream of questions from their young ones to the best of their ability, to encourage imagination and curiosity. 
Secondly, my parents paid for and enrolled me in Montessori pre-school from an early age. This was rare at the time, as most children aged three were at home with their grandparents, but at pre-school I would interact with other children, play, and learn by doing, as opposed to the rote learning often favoured in Sri Lanka. This undoubtedly had a major impact on me and my development especially when I progressed to primary school and beyond. In fact, Jeff Bezos too has often talked about how formative his own pre-school and Montessori experience was in propelling him to become the highly successful person he is, now the wealthiest person alive. I was fortunate to have this opportunity, yet at present, less than 50 per cent of children in Sri Lanka attend quality pre-schools. I believe this must change.
The final crucial factor was nutrition. I grew up in the 1970s, and while we always had enough food to eat, when I compare our diets then, with my children who grew up in the USA, it is clear that many Sri Lankans were not eating the right, nutritionally rich and diverse foods needed to fuel their brain and body development. Our rice-based diet with limited protein and other nutrients were not sufficient for optimal development. Good nutrition is especially important in the early years, when a childs brain is growing so rapidly. I urge parents to ensure that their children get the nutritious food they need, especially in the first 5 years of life. Even a nutritious breakfast snack that could be provided by the school system to children could go a long way in addressing this need. This is practiced in developed countries such as the USA, and even in the schools my children attended.
When the founder of Amazon mentioned me in his talk, I know many Sri Lankans were proud that a fellow countryman was being championed by one of the worlds leading business people. But my message is simple. I was able to reach my potential and compete on equal terms with the worlds brightest because of the steps taken by my parents in the early years of my life, ensuring that I was stimulated, had access to nutritious food, and had the chance to benefit from early learning opportunities at pre-school.
As the world marks the anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) on World Childrens Day 20th November, I am joining forces with UNICEF to call on all Sri Lankans, parents and law makers to ensure that all of our children have the best start in life, by prioritizing early childhood development. 
One way you can do this is by visiting www.unicef.lk/crc and adding your name to UNICEFs campaign to ensure that all children under five years in Sri Lanka have the opportunity to access quality pre-school, just like me and my friend Jeff Bezos. Who knows, with the right start in life, the next Jeff Bezos could very well be from Sri Lanka. And that would be something for all Sri Lankans to be proud of.

Top Huthi rebel calls for halt to attacks in Yemen
	

SANAA AFP Nov19, 2018 - A high-ranking Huthi official has called for rebels to stop firing rockets and using attack drones in the conflict in Yemen, as a UN envoy prepares to travel to the country to prepare peace talks. 
Mohammed Ali al-Huthi, head of the Higher Revolutionary Committee and an influential political figure, tweeted that his group wants all official Yemeni parties to demand a ceasefire. 
We announce an initiative to call all official Yemeni parties to ask to end launching rockets and drones against aggression countries... in order to deprive them for any reason to continue their aggression and siege, along a readiness to freeze and stop all military operations on all fronts in order to reach peace, he wrote. 
His comments come after UN special envoy Martin Griffiths said on Friday that he plans to travel to rebel-held Sanaa in the coming week to finalise arrangements for peace talks to take place in Sweden soon. Griffiths -- whose efforts at kick-starting peace talks collapsed in September -- said both the Saudi-backed government and the Huthi rebels have shown a renewed commitment to work on a political solution and have given firm assurances that they will attend the talks. No date has yet been set.

Wests concern and the Speakers U-turn
	
It is anybodys guess whether diplomatic visitations by foreign invitees put Jayasuriya under pressure, or whether he was emboldened by them (Pic AFP)

it was common knowledge that the worst kind of horse-trading took place behind the scenes
This type of internal political impasse is not unique toSri Lanka
Sri Lankas non-Western friends have reacted differently to these events
It is not the job of the Speaker to convene Parliament

Although recent developments have made it near-impossible to anticipate the changing political landscape from one day to the next, there are some aspects of Sri Lankas ongoing parliamentary/ constitutional saga that have come into sharp focus. One is the unusual concern shown by the West in what is a purely internal issue for Sri Lanka. Another is the extraordinary trajectory of the Speakers behaviour since the onsetof the crisis.
Following the Supreme Court stay order on dissolution that paved the way for reconvening of Parliament, there took place on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday some of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed in the legislature. MPs verbally and physically attacked each other and vandalised the Chamber, causing early adjournment. Earlier, it was common knowledge that the worst kind of horse-trading took place behind the scenes with MPs putting themselves up for auction at prices reportedly ranging from Rs.50 million to 500 million. It was a race between the new Government and the old, to ratchet up numbers and show a majority in the House. On Wednesday, in a move that seemed to have been scripted in advance, a No Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Government was proposed, seconded and purportedly passed, at record speed. This was done in a dubious manner and surely in violation of Standing Orders because an NCM was not on the Order Paper. It would anyway have required five days notice and a debate. Taking everyone by surprise, the Speaker hurriedly declared, amidst an incoherent cacophony of voices, that the voice vote was in favour. In a further surprise on Thursday he enacted a similar drama amid hurled waste paper baskets and other flying objects.
During these events Western envoys were in the visitors gallery, reportedly at the Speakers invitation. Notwithstanding Wednesdays raucous Parliament session, the US Ambassador made a deadpan statement in a tweet that day saying she was glad that Parliament was once again fulfilling its constitutional role. One is left to wonder by what stretch of the imagination the mayhem witnessed that day could have conformed with the ambassadors idea of parliament fulfilling its role. There was nothing to applaud in these ignominious events. Could the ambassador have been so nave as to believe the claims of feckless cross-over MPs that they were following their democratic conscience etc.

As for the conduct of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who figured prominently in the drama of the last few days, many aspects of it remain a mystery

What becomes apparent in this dispute between political factions supporting, respectively, the ousted PM and the new one, is that these Western powers are taking sides. This type of internal political impasse is not unique to Sri Lanka. But it would seem that in Sri Lankas case, alarm over possible geopolitical consequences of Ranil Wickremesinghe - a pro-western prime minister, being replaced Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is seen to be pro-China - has set off unprecedented reactions.

Interest on Sri Lanka
Why is Sri Lanka the focus of all this interest asked Dr Palitha Kohona, Sri Lankas former Permanent Representative to the UN in New York. There must be something more to it than the need to protect democracy he said, addressing an Eliya briefing on Tuesday.
At an international level, I find that the current spate of interventions in our domestic affairs is ungainly and unacceptable. It is not consistent with contemporary diplomatic practice. One might even argue that it is illegal under international law he asserted. Kohona, one-time head of the UN Treaty Section, suggested that with the unexpected ouster of Wickremesinghe many western countries and their embassies, high commissions in Colombo were wrong-footed. They did not expect this. They assumed they had enough time to deal with the emergence of the Rajapaksas between now and the election due in 2020. The suddenness of these developments may explain the gaps in their logic and reasoning, he said.
Sri Lankas non-Western friends have reacted differently to these events. There were no demands as there were from Western missions and foreign offices, that Sri Lankas Parliament must reconvene immediately! etc.
China said this was an internal problem it believed Sri Lanka would find ways to overcome. Indian Government spokesman Raveesh Kumar told reporters in Delhi This is something which has to be handled within Sri Lanka. In a statement in Delhi, seemingly attributed to Indias Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale, Sri Lankas state-run Daily News said they are willing to work with any Prime Minister in the interests of both countries. Similar remarks were reported in the Sunday Morning newspaper citing unnamed Indian Foreign Ministry sources. The message in these somewhat cryptic reports  not contradicted by Delhi - would need to be deciphered in the light Indian media accounts of the red-carpet welcome that was accorded to Rajapaksa, a former president, when he visited Delhi two months ago at the invitation of BJPs Subramanian Swamy.

Diplomatic visitations
Japan has expressed the hope that stability will be ensured through due process and the law. Contrary to foreign media reports, Japan has not threatened to withhold a $1.4 billion loan for a proposed Light Rail project. The loan is not suspended or put on hold, a spokesman from the Commercial section of the Japanese Embassy, who did not wish to be named, told the Daily Mirror.
As for the conduct of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who figured prominently in the drama of the last few days, many aspects of it remain a mystery. Initially he accepted the prime minister and cabinet appointed by the president, and assigned offices and seats for them accordingly in Parliament. Later, in an inexplicable turnaround, he wrote to the president claiming that his conscience compelled him to accept the status that existed previously because the presidents actions were undemocratic and unconstitutional.
Was it a coincidence that the Speakers sudden substitution of Conscience for Standing Orders came after he had been visited by envoys from Europe and Canada, along with the UN resident rep, and warned of adverse consequences of Wickremesinghes dismissal US Embassy officials too are reported to have met him in parliament around this time. A few days later eleven Colombo-based envoys again met him and collectively urged him to reconvene Parliament so that they could determine which the Government in Sri Lanka was, according to the Sunday Times political column of 04.11.18.
It is not the job of the Speaker to convene Parliament. It is anybodys guess whether these diplomatic visitations put Jayasuriya under pressure, or whether he was emboldened by them. What is apparent from his actions, visible to all on public television over the last few days, is that the Speaker has adopted a course of action that is partisan, and influenced by his party affiliation.
So much so that one must ask if he has forfeited his claim to a role that requires him to be independent and even-handed. The unnatural determination shown by him to have a NCM against the Government passed, by fair means or foul, disregarding Standing Orders and parliamentary tradition, has contributed to reducing the House and its proceedings to the level of high farce.

WPC to block porn, social media for councillors in the Chamber
	
Steps have been taken to block access to websites with pornography and social media from the computers of the Western Provincial Council (WPC) Chamber after some councillors had reportedly watched porn during the Budget presentation, Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said today.
It was reported that when the Chief Minister was presenting the Budget for the year 2019 at the councils new chamber, some councillors had allegedly watched porn from Chambers computers.
Chief Minister Devapriya said he had instructed Western Province Chief Secretary to look into the incident and conduct an investigation.
If such an incident had taken place, specially during the budget presentation, it is regretful. Computers and other facilities were not given to watch social media or to watch films. Those facilities were for the use of councils work. I have instructed the Chief Secretary to obtain a report from relevant institutions which can look into the searching histories. The councillors should have paid attention to the budget presentation, he said.
He said initially he had informed the Sri Lanka Telecom which is the network provider for the computer devices to block social media and unnecessary web sites from the chambers computers.
 It a fault of the SLT as well if they havent blocked these sites even after I instructed them to do so. However, we are still looking into this, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
