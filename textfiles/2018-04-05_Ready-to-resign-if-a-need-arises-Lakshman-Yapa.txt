State Minister of Public Enterprise Development Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena today said that the UPFA members who voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) are ready to resign from their portfolios if a need arises.

He said the SLFP Central Committee appointed a separate committee to prepare a report on the Central Bank bond scam and that they voted in favour of the NCM based on the committee’s findings.

State Minister Abeywardena said though they had issues with the Premier’s actions, they never had any personal issues with him. (Indika Sri Aravinda)
