The Socialist Youth Union affiliated to the JVP today filed a complaint against Minister Sajith Premadasa with the Bribery Commission against a recently leaked video clip which purportedly showing him recommending jobs to a group of youth.

National Organiser of the SYU Comrade Eranga Gunasekera said they hoped the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (BC) would soon start investigations into the complaint.

Speaking to the media while leaving from the Commission premises, Gunasekera said that the Minister had played with tears of the unemployed people, which are around 3.5 million in Sri Lanka, for his personal political agenda.

“The Housing and Constructions Ministry belongs to the government and it is not his private property to give jobs to whoever he wants, based on certain selective methods,” he said.

He also said even though the political appointment were not something new and strange to the Sri Lankan society, this kind of strong evidence had not been publicised earlier. (Piyumi Fonseka)
