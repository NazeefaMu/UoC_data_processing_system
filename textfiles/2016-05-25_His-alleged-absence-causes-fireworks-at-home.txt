His alleged absence causes fireworks at home


	



 

The furor that rocked the august assembly the other day when the opposition made a noisy protest claiming that the score on a vote taken on an important Bill has even made newspaper headlines. 

 


A political bigwig living in the Kalutara area had to face a serious domestic problem as a repercussion of this incident. 


This Diyawanna member had left home early in the morning on the day in question saying that he had to be present on time in the council to register his vote.  However, the better half of the member had learnt later that the name of her husband was not on the list of members who voted for and against the Bill.  The lady already wise to the flings of her gallivanting husband put two and two together and created an ugly scene when the latter returned home. 


The Diyawanna member had protested his innocence, but the wife would not listen to him.

 Meanwhile, there was a buzz in the lobby, they say,  that the poor man, in a bid to pacify the lady breathing down his neck was planning to seek the Speaker’s help to prove that he was present in the council on that particular occasion.
