E-tel launches Microsoft and Intel powered KeyTab

An innovative 2-in-1 that converts from a laptop to a tablet PC has been launched in Sri Lanka by E-tel, offering the combination of technology and affordability that propelled the brand's meteoric success in the local smartphone market in a new peoduct line.
Unlike most tablets in the market which are Android powered, the E-tel KeyTab comes pre-installed with genuine, state-of-the-art Microsoft Windows ten Operating System software. Additionally, the KeyTab has a screen that separates from the keyboard in order to convert into a tablet, offering users the choice of using it in either mode.
With its versatile 10.1-inch screen, powerful 1.83 GHz, quad core Intel(r) Atom(tm) processor with L2 2MB Cache Memory, 32GB Internal Storage, 2GB DDR3 Random Access Memory and Intel HD Graphics, the E-tel KeyTab delivers the robust performance of a laptop with the expedience of a tablet, eliminating the need for two devices, Dr. Tariq Marikar, Director and Chief Operating Officer of Brantel, the sole distributor of E-tel products island-wide, said.
Brian Kealey, Country Manager, Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives said: "The E-tel KeyTab represents an exciting value proposition which is exactly what a market like Sri Lanka needs. There are large numbers of students and corporate executives requiring work-space mobility that require these types of devices. This device will satisfy their work and recreational needs, whilst ensuring the use of genuine softwarefor online safety and reliability."
Indika De Zoysa, Country Business Manager at Intel EM Ltd - Sri Lanka Liaisons Office said: "The Intel-powered E-tel KeyTab is a great example of the innovative 2-in-1 devices that offer users both the laptop and tablet experiences at affordable prices."
