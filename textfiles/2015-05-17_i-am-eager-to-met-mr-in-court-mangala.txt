Confirming that he has received the letter of demand sent by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over his statement about the former first family’s assets, foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said he was ready to meet Mr. Rajapaksa in Court.
“The letter of demand with three pages sent by my former friend Mahinda Rajapakse requesting one billion rupees was received. I am eagerly waiting to meet him in Court and I have so many things to tell him,” he said addressing a meeting in Matara on Saturday.
He also said that the assistance was sought from four countries to find out the robbed money by Rajapakse family members.
These were no money deposited in Sri Lanka.  They have swindled billions of money with the name of development,” he added. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)
