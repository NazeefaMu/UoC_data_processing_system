He doesn’t want to lose the votes already there for the taking!


	


	This Diyawanna member who once captained a team that won a World Cup is now the Blue party organiser for an electorate which has produced two Prime Ministers.

Recently this politico went round his electorate meeting his constituents from all walks of life.
An elderly person who was among the people the politico met, inquired from him as to why he was going round the electorate alone. “We expected the Madam to accompany you whenever you visit this area,” the senior citizen added.
The Diyawanna member smiled, but offered no reply.
The elderly person raised the same query again.
Realizing he could not dodge giving an answer, the politico decided to take the old man into his confidence.
“Loku Unnehe,” the politico addressed the man in a conspiratorial tone. “I want to retain intact at least the votes already there for our party in this area. I don’t want to lose such sure votes by providing an occasion for someone to indulge in the habit of tongue-lashing various people in my presence.”
The elder nodded in agreement.
