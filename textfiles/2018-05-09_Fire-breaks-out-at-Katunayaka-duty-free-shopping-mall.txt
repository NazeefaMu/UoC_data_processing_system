A fire broke out at an electrical home appliance shop in the Duty-Free shopping mall at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) this morning, Airport duty manager said.

He said the fire was immediately doused by the fire brigade attached to the Katunayake Airport with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Army fire brigade.

“Electrical home appliances such as refrigerators, televisions and washing machines were destroyed due to the fire. One floor of the duty-free shopping complex was filled with a dark smoke so we had to use a backhoe to break down a wall of the shopping mall," the manager said.  

The cause of the fire has not been identified  and officials are yet to calculate the estimated loss of electrical items that were destroyed in the fire.

Katunayaka police are investigating the incident. (T.K.G.Kapila)
