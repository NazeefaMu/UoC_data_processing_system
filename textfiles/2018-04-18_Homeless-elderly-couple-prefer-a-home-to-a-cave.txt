Homeless elderly couple prefer a home to a cave


	

An elderly couple of Serankada in Padiyathalawa has been destined to spend their autumn of life in a cave. This cave is in an archaeological site that’s covered with shrub jungle. They have lived there for 29 years after being left homeless following a flood in 1992. The flood had destroyed their wattle and daub house.   


The destitute couple, R.B.Dharmadasa (75) and J.M.Bandara Menike (80), has been living alone after their children found employment in other areas. They said that they were compelled to find shelter in a jungle cave, despite being exposed to the danger of wild animals and venomous snakes.   


“Our children, our kith and kin nor the Government authorities have yet paid any attention to our predicament. We depend on the Samurdhi allowance worth Rs.2000 for want of any other income. We are not allowed to clear the jungle to supplement the Samurdhi allowance with Chena cultivation. We rarely have two square meals a day. We starve for days when the Samurdhi allowance is exhausted. Our children living in distant areas are not in a position to take care of us. Archaeological officers have warned us that we should leave the cave since it is located in an archaeological site or else we would be liable to legal action” Dharmadasa said.

They appealed to philanthropists and the social service organizations to look into their predicament and provide them with a house before they are removed from the jungle cave by the authorities.
