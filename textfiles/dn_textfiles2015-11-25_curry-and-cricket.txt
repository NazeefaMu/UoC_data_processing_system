Curry and Cricket

It was curry and cricket in the Presidential suite at the Saravanamuttu Oval!
Sir Garfield Sobers, the game’s greatest all-rounder, Clive Lloyd, Michael Tissera and Sidath Wettimuny, Dr HIK Fernando (wicketkeeper) and I seated at the lunch table enjoying a sumptuous lunch while while watching the Sri Lanka West Indies Test match, vying for the Sobers-Tissera trophy.
I have lunched with great politicos around the globe. But, here I felt immensely privileged to be in the company of such legends in the cricketing world for the first time.
It was so absorbing to listen to Sir Garfield who nostalgically recalling his past in grounds around the world. It was akin to watching his long innings on the cricket pitch. When I was introduced to him by Brendon Kuruppu, as a pioneer in cricket commentaries (Tamil) he said, “Oh that’s great! Have you commentated when Sathasivam was batting?” I replied I was in school but enjoyed seeing the classic batting of Satha with Sargo Jayawickrama. The Satha-Sargo batting partnership was the best Ceylon has ever seen. Sir Garfield responded, “Absolutely so!” Then I recalled the agility of Ben Navaratne (Zahira/SSC) behind the sticks - he was the best wicket-keeper in the world in that era. Sir Garfield nodded in agreement, “I remember once batting when Ben was keeping wickets...”
When Darren Bravo (61 runs) was facing the Sri Lankan spin, Sir Garfield recalled, “I had coached him in his school. When he was selected for the Test team, Darren brought a photograph taken with me in his school and asked me whether I could remember the occasion.”
“Yeah, of course, go ahead and prosper in the middle young maan.”
Brendon Kuruppu just then came to the table. I told Sir Garfield, “Here is a man who holds a world record for being in the field for the full five days of a Test match - first scoring the slowest double century of 201 not out against New Zealand at the CCC grounds, Colombo on 19 April, 1987.
“Oh maan (in typical West Indian accent) you are a great champ”, Sir Garfield complimented.
When Duleep and Sunil were downed by Thomson
An interesting character, possibly our version of Percy, Keith FC Van Anderson the Pipeman- the West Indies super fan, who on his own initiative travels around the world cheering his team, who was seated at the adjoining table with KM Nelson, Sunil Wettimuny, Anuruddha Polonowita and other cricketing stalwarts turned around and asked me if I had watched the Prudential Cup matches. I replied, “Of course, yes. I was at London Oval when Aussie took on Ceylon on June 11, 1975, when Duleep Mendis and Sunil Wettimuny were bruised and broken by the Aussie tearaway Jeff Thomson – first while Duleep Mendis was batting ferociously on 32, Thommo sent a tornado which hit squarely on his forehead. He fell heavily on the crease and had to be carried away. Thommo sent down another hurricane which tore the toes of Sunil and he too had to be carried away. The Ceylon spectators who were present in large numbers so agitated loudly chanted “Rosa, polla genen balla maranda..” I happened to be seated in front of the Aussie dressing room recording this fearsome moment in my camera.” Sunil turned towards me and wanted to have a copy and I said I shall.
I recalled the day that I watched a match at St Helen’s in Swansea, with Azahim Mohamed (Founder of Apollo XI Cricket Club, Borella) and Omar Kamil (later Mayor of Colombo) the ground in which Sir Garfield etched his name in the history books by clobbering six sixes in one over.
Bravo Brendon
It was the same grounds in which you, sir, playing as captain of Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at St. Helen's in Swansea, hit that famous six sixes in one over. “Brendon, hit such a huge six straight, which flew over the tallest telecommunication tower outside the ground. A well-dressed English gentleman wearing a smart cap seated beside us exclaimed “Oh good gracious, I’ve been watching cricket in these grounds for the last 45 years and never seen such a huge six!” Instantly displaying the sharpness of his mind at his ripe age of 79, Sir Garfield chuckled with a wink, “I wonder for how many days he had visited the grounds”.
When Prakash Schaffter of the Tamil Union came to the table to see how best the legends were enjoying the local cuisine, Garfield said, “Most tastiest curry on the table here and absorbing cricket below…”.
When Devendra Bishoo was run out, the West Indies innings came to a close conceding the Garfield-Tissera trophy to the brave Sri Lankan team. Sidath Wettimuny the President of Sri Lanka Cricket then escorted the legendary Sir Garfield Sober and Michael Tissera downstairs-with our one man cheer squad Percy as usual in his jubilant mood holding the Sri Lankan flag above their heads and walked to the presentation area. Sobers-Tissera Trophy was jointly presented by them to the proud Sri Lankan captain Angelo Matthews.
Post script - the final scene of the whole episode - when the man who has bowled against several West Indian teams in his heyday - the dual purpose Daya Sahabandu - dragging on his feeble frame, escorted by a comrade, slowly walked upto the presentation area and with great exuberance, shook hands with Sir Garfield Sobers. It was a touching moment of emotion!
