The entrants for US Diversity Visa (DV) programme could check their visa application status starting today and should retain confirmation receipts until September 30, 2016, the US Department of State said.
“Entrants for the Diversity Visa Program can check the status of their applications on the website (http://www.dvlottery.state.gov).  Entrants should retain confirmation receipts until September 30, 2016,” it said.
The Department also advised the public to be vigilant about a notable increase in fraudulent emails and letters sent to applicants.  
“The scammers behind these fraudulent emails and letters are posing as the US government in an attempt to extract payment from DV applicants. There are no hidden fees in the Diversity Visa program.  Selected applicants for the DV programme will be required to pay $330 USD in person only at their interview at the U.S. Embassy beginning October 1, 2015,” the Department said.
Diversity Visa applicants must check their status online, and will not receive a notification letter, email, or phone call from the U.S. government.  DV Entry Status Check will only be provided through the Department of State secure online site, http://www.dvlottery.state.gov.
