President Maithripala Sirisena had led by example how the Ministers should use Government funds with diligence, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday pointing out the Presidents’ recent visit to Singapore.

“When he visited Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne, the President did not allow any Minister to accompany him using Government funds. All Ministers used their own money even to take their fares,” he said.

He said the President had made this as an example.

“No delegation would be allowed to tour foreign countries. As members of the SLFP, we should appreciate the Presidents’ example,” he said.

President Maithripala Sirisena completed twelve official foreign visits since February 15, 2015 to date after the Government came into office.

The President had made his first three-day overseas visit to India on February 15, 2015 on the Invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In his visits he tried to rebuild the country’s broken relationships with other countries.

“We should highlight how the President tried to take out the country, which had been shut out from other countries,” he said.

“The members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) know their limits, while being in conventional Government. Our policy is toeing the Government line, while strengthening the Government sector,” he said.(Chaturanga Pradeep)
