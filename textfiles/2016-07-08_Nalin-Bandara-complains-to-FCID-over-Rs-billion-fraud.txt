UNP MP Nalin Bandara today lodged a complaint with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) alleging that more than Rs. 4.2 billion had been defrauded by the authorities of the previous regime by purchasing two ships at a cost of USD 35 million in 2014 though it actually cost only Rs. USD 20 million in the market.

MP Bandara said one ship named Ceylon Breeze (IMO 9734563) had already been brought to the country while the Deputy Minister and Chairman of the Shipping Cooperation had left to bring the other ship to Sri Lanka.

He said even though these two ships were claimed to be brand new, they seemed to be old ships repaired to look new as their IMO numbers, which denotes the date of its year of manufacturing, starts with 97.

Mr. Bandara said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the cabinet minister of Ports, Rohitha Abeygunawardane was the project minister of ports while Jayanath Colombage acted as the Chairman of the Ports Authority when the purchasing took place.

He requested the FCID to conduct an investigation into the incident and reveal the culprits behind the corruption. (Ajith Siriwardana)
