The special news conference scheduled to be held this morning by Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Limited Chairman Major (Retd) Nissanka Senadhipathi to state their side of the controversy, had been postponed until further notice due to a sudden illness of its Chairman.
Secretary to the Chairman, Kamal Gamage said the news conference was organized to educate the media on the real facts referring to various information provided to the media and the general public on Avant Garde following the special meeting convened by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday.
He said Major (Retd) Senadhipathi, who was to chair the conference underwent an abdominal surgery last month in Singapore and had been advised to an initial post surgery period of 41 days total bed rest and to avoid strenuous activities for three months.
“However, he was deprived of such rest as he was compelled to attend to certain commitments in business in Sri Lanka. His excessive schedule of work within the last few days had led to the development of a sudden pain and slight discharge from the post surgical area last evening and was recommended by his local physician not to move and to follow complete bed rest until further post surgical evaluations to be held in Singapore,” Mr. Gamage said.
He said that they would call upon the press briefing when Senadhipathi’s health condition improves.
