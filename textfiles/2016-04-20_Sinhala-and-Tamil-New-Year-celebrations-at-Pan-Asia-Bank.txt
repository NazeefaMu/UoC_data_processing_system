Pan Asia Bank, being a truly Sri Lankan bank, takes pride in celebrating national and cultural events such as Sinhala and Tamil New Year.

Due to the overwhelming positive response received from customers, Pan Asia Bank’s Avurudu promotion, which is valid for all the fixed deposit (FD) products including Suwasavi, savings accounts, children’s savings accounts and Pan Asia Salary Saver accounts will continue till April 30 at all Pan Asia Bank branches.
