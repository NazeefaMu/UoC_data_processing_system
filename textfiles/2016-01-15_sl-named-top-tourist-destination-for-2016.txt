Sri Lanka has been named as a top under-the radar destination for 2016 by the Fox News, a post on the FoxNews website said.
“This tropical Island in the Indian Ocean offers sweeping landscapes of lush green countryside, towering waterfalls and golden sand beaches. Sri Lanka has several national parks and eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Temple of the Tooth, which is said to hold Buddha’s tooth relic. It’s also known for its tea plantations,” the website said.
Many tour companies are offering trips to Sri Lanka this year. “We want to get there before everyone else discovers it and it changes,” it said.
The other destinations in the top ten-list are Colombia, Japan, Switzerland, Greenland, Ohio, China, Georgia, Montenegro and Nicaragua.
