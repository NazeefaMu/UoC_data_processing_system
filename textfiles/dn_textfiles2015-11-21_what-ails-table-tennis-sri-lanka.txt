Past greats blame Ministry of Sports for decline in standards
What ails table tennis in Sri Lanka?

Table Tennis at one time was one of the glamour sports in Sri Lanka even popular than cricket, but over the years the game has eroded to a stage that no one is bothered to look at what's happening to the sport nor want to make a genuine effort to revive it to its former glory.
For former stars like Nimal H Perera and Tamara Hewage who have been icons in the sport and spent much of their time trying to develop it the present status has only saddened them.
Recalling those glory days Perera, a former national champion and Sri Lanka player said, "In 1975 table tennis was one of the very famous sports. I became no. 1 in the Bristol Sports Star of the Year 1975. We had Jothipala Samaraweera (another former table tennis star) at no. 6 and top class cricketers like Duleep Mendis and Anura Tennekoon including world billiards champion M.J.M. Lafir were all under us. It shows that table tennis was very popular at the time."
Perera said the general declination of the sport started in 1991 when unwanted individuals who had not played the game or done anything to uplift it started to gradually make their entry into the sport.
"During the 60s and 70s we had people like Major Kamal Fernando, Pesi Pestonjee, Parakrama Molligoda, M Balaji, Nesaratnam and a few others who helped popularize table tennis. Their intention was to promote the game not to make money out of it," said Perera.
"Today the situation is different there are unsuitable individuals running the game. There are so many paper clubs who can appoint anyone to the top posts like president, vice president, secretary or the ExCo committee. This has been happening since 1991 and it is one of the reasons why table tennis standards have gone down."
Speaking further Perera pointed out that there is talent in abundance but the lack of a proper national coach is stalling their progress.
"They should appoint somebody who can handle these players and send that person for training abroad to be trained as a coach. There is plenty of talent in Sri Lanka today. At the moment there is no senior or junior national pools, players are not sent abroad for training they only go to play matches. What's the point of taking part in matches if you don't have adequate training?
"There are also no Open tournaments. There are age group tournaments because the administrators can make money. During our time we had men's singles and doubles, women's singles and doubles and mixed doubles at Open events. Today except in the senior nationals you hardly find those events in an Open tournament and a ranking tournament will be held only with men's and women's singles events.
"The tournaments they tout for mainly are age limit tournaments where good money can be earned. Each player has to pay about Rs 500 for two events and that is big money. Apart from that they charge a registration fee," noted Perera.
The former national champion and qualified coach bemoaned the fact that there no international teams had visited Sri Lanka for the past two decades or so.
"During our time teams were selected and sent to the Indian circuit to gain experience and we had an All-India doubles champions in PV Gopalakrishnan and R Dharamdas. Apart from Chinese and Japanese teams Indian sides also frequently visited us," said Perera. "We had a quadrangular tournament every year with India, Pakistan and Nepal participating. That's how the game became very popular and players improved their standards by pitting their skills against international opposition. Today you hardly see a foreign team playing in Sri Lanka, teams are only sent abroad to participate in tournaments."
Perera pointed out that recently a probe report initiated by former Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake had revealed that 40 out of 54 clubs who cast their vote at elections were paper clubs.
"These clubs don't have active players who are playing in tournaments. They have no proper accounts. One person holds the post of president of one club and the post of vice-president of another that's how it rotates at the moment," said Perera.
"The constitution was changed after the 1992 SAF games. There was a Board of Control for Table Tennis who conducted the SAF events. The Sports Minister Nanda Mathew had appointed such a Board because he found that there was plenty of unwanted clubs functioning. But when elections were held the very same people who had held office earlier came into power games and took control of the association.
"At the last AGM I pointed out to the Sports Ministry representative that the accounts were not presented but she completely ignored it. How can you hold an AGM without audited accounts? Likewise there has been so many lapses which the Ministry has turned a blind eye," he said.
Perera blamed the Ministers of Sport down the years for the sad state of affairs the sport is in today. "Part of the blame for the decline of table tennis is due to the Ministry of Sport not taking suitable action against paper clubs and allowing them to continue to operate which has on the long run proved detrimental to the progress of the sport," said Perera.
"There are some individuals inside the Sports Ministry including some high ranking officials and assistant directors who are involved and support these incompetent individuals who run the game. They are not bothered at all for the sport they just want to be there, nothing else, less headache if you don't question."
Perera's suggestion to the present Minister of Sports is to dissolve the present association and appoint a Board of high caliber people who could serve the game.
"We need a board of control for table tennis at least for one year appointed by the Sports Minister. There are past officials and players willing to come forward to serve the sport like Col Molligoda, Maj Gen Kamal Fernando, Deepak Naraindas, Annesley Gomes and Rasakanth Rasiah. Why not get these people and do something for the sport. I can't see any development taking place the way the game is being handled at the moment," Perera said.
