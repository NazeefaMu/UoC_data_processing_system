India skipper Rohit Sharma has funded the ticket of a Sri Lankan cricket fan so that he could return early to be with his father during a surgery.

According to the Mid-day news, Sri Lanka's three die-hard fans Gayan Senananyaka, Pubudu and Mohamed Nilam have been supporting the Sri Lankan team during the Indian tour.

During the third and final Test in New Delhi, Nilam's father had been diagnosed with throat cancer in Colombo.

His return had been scheduled from Mumbai on December 26 after the final T20 Internationals.

It was reported Nilam's father had to undergo an urgent surgery but Nilam was unable to return earlier than scheduled due to issues with funds.

Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma who was informed of the situation by Indian fan Sudhir Gautam had arranged for Nilam to return to Sri Lanka on December 5.

“Rohit called me and gave the ticket,” Nilam told Mid-day from Colombo yesterday.

Nilam said his father is much better as the surgery went well. “I was disturbed when I heard about my father's health, but Rohit has a big heart and he immediately arranged for my return ticket. He is a gem of a person,” said Nilam.

Nilam revealed Rohit also offered financial help for his father's surgery. "He even asked me whether I need any financial help for the surgery, but I refused to take any money. I am grateful that he arranged for my ticket," said Nilam.

Nilam said even Virat Kohli, who is in Italy for his wedding with Anushka Sharma, had messaged him and asked if he needed any help.

“I congratulated Virat on his wedding. I feel blessed and lucky to get so much love from Indian cricketers. They have always been very helpful in arranging match tickets whenever we come to watch them,” said Nilam.
