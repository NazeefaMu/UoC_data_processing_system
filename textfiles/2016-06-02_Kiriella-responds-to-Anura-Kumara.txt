Kiriella responds to Anura Kumara


	

Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella responded to an allegation by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, saying that he only had one consultant approved by the Cabinet.

He said Mr. Dissanayake’s accusation that he had 94 coordinating secretaries was baseless.

“There is only one consultant in my Ministry. He is Dr. Wimal Gunawardena who is internationally renowned. The Road Development Authority has given appointments to supervisors, management assistants, clerks and Project Public Relation Officers attached to the Authority. I also wish to state that I do not have such a large amount of advisors or coordinating secretaries. Every Ministry is given one advisor approved by the cabinet,” Mr. Kirella said.
