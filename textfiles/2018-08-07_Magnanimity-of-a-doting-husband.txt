Magnanimity of a doting husband!


	



 

A white-collar high-up who has offered the post of coordinating secretary to his wife has also provided a separate office to her on a different floor in the building. The magnanimity of the doting husband has not stopped at that; he has also given her two assistant secretaries too though she has hardly any work to do!

 


Despite receiving a regular monthly salary, the lady is said to be attending office only by fits and starts. And when she does attend, she does not formally register her attendance either.


Meanwhile, another white-collar subordinate occupying a cubicle adjoining the high-up’s office room is attending to the work expected of a coordinating secretary. Only the top four high-ups of this establishment are exempt from the requirement of registering their attendance. The lady is also enjoying this privilege unofficially, they say.
