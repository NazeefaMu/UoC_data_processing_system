Despite Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's request to the UNP back-benchers to withdraw their no-confidence motion against six SLFP ministers who voted for the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister, the back-benchers are now hoping to resubmit fresh motions against all 16 MPs, UNP MP Mujibur Rahman said yesterday.

He said the no-confidence motion was to be submitted against Ministers S.B. Dissanayake, John Seneviratne, Anura Priyadharashana Yapa, Susil Premajanyantha, Dilan Perera, Dayasiri Jayasekera, Deputy and State ministers Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene, Sudharshini Fernandopulle, Susantha Punchinilame, Sumedha Jayasena, Anuradha Jayaratne, Tharanath Basnayake, T.B. Ekanayake and Deputy Speaker Tilanga Sumathiapala.

When asked when they were going to hand over the motion, the MP said they had not fixed a date yet.

“We will do so when the Prime Minister gives us the green light,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
