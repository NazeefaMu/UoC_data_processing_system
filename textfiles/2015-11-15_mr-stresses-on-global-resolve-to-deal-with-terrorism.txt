	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa while expressing his condolences to the French government said the ‘barbaric act of terrorism perpetrated against ordinary citizens has once again underscored the need for global resolve in dealing firmly with terrorism’.
	In a letter to the French President Francois Hollande, Mr. Rajapaksa said Sri Lanka had suffered the scourge of terrorism for well over three decades and such attacks were commonplace in the country.
	‘This is why my government resolved firmly to put an end to terrorism. Today, my country is at peace with no terrorist attack reported since May 2009,’ the letter said.  
	“It is with shock and disbelief that I heard of the terrorist attacks in Paris which has left well over 100 people dead and scores more injured. Only those who have endured the same agony will fully understand what the people of France are going through at this moment,” the letter further said.
	The former President also conveyed his condolences to the families in France and his sympathies to the injured.
