The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said President Maithripala Sirisena had given a positive response to its demands during the discussion its members had with the President yesterday afternoon.
During the discussion, the GMOA had put forward some issues including their strong opposition to the South Asian Institution of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) and some budget proposals.
Addressing a media briefing, GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the President had given them an assurance that the final decision with regard to their demands would be taken after a discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“He responded positively to our proposals, but said in case some proposals were not be fulfilled in the budget, they would be done even after the budget,” Dr. Herath said.
Referring to the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) with India next year, he said the President had assured that it would be signed only after discussions were held with professionals in the country.
He said that the president had assured that doors were always open for discussions. (Piyumi Fonseka)
