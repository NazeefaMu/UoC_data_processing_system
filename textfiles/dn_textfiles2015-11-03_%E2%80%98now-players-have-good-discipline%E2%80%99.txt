Referee D Nimal aims to be top gun once again
‘Now players have good discipline’

Rugby refereeing is not for the meek or faint-hearted since a single mistake may be blown out of proportion.
It requires courage and determination for someone to continue serving the game with unbridled joy despite facing tremendous odds.
Dharmapalage Nimal’s rise to stardom from CR and FC ground boy to top gun is a fascinating story in Sri Lanka rugby folklore.
A man who has never forgotten his humble beginnings, Nimal is growing in stature while keeping his feet firmly on the ground to face the challenges ahead.
Nimal has become a regular at the Lanka Lions Inter-School Tag Rugby Sevens tournament, taking charge of the Cup final between Isipathana and Trinity held in Sharjah recently.
One of four officials who flew in from Colombo for the 11th edition of the tournament, both Nimal and Gamini Indrasena, praised the high standard of tournament and discipline of players.
“In Dubai, all players are highly disciplined. The tournament was also well organised,” said Indrasena, a former Havelocks player, who also officiated at the Dubai Sevens for four years.
Nimal, a referee for the past 24 years,wants to prove he is still the best in the business.
“I have shown that I performed well during the school season. I’m hoping to do the same in the club season by refereeing well,” said the 43-year-old who was on the verge of quitting three years ago.
That was when he was suspended following a blunder he made during a match between Army and Up Country teams.
“I admitted making a mistake. But it kept coming back to me and I wanted to give up,” said Nimal who also courted controversy after blowing a Bradby Shield match between Royal and Trinity.
However, having grown up in adversity, Nimal is a fighter.
“I took it up as a challenge not to be defeated by that incident. I wanted to prove that I wanted to become a better referee for another two years,” recalled Nimal who officiated the Asiad final between Japan and Chinese Taipei in Chinese Taipei in 2006.
No mean feat for someone who studied at Jawatte Central and never played rugby but was infatuated with the oval ball. It also begs the question why more national players prefer coaching than refereeing.
“We are saying they (national players) are needed for good of the game but they are trying to avoid. They can also enjoy the game while refereeing. National players take up refereeing and then begin coaching because it is more lucrative,” observed Nimal, himself coach of Carey for the past 18 years.
“We are trying to promote young referees. In about three years we will have good referees,” added Nimal reiterating the need for former national players to take up refereeing.
He reminded those who throw brickbats at local referees that mistakes happen even at the World Cup.
“A referee has only two eyes. We do our task in all earnest and enthusiastically. Sometimes referees make small mistakes but please don’t put blame on the referee,” said Nimal who felt it was coaches who incite players to go against referees.
“It is coaches who start attacking referee with their actions on field or when they start shouting on field that the referee has made a wrong decision. And players follow suit by challenging decisions,” pointed out Nimal.
“After playing for more than one hour, a coach should not blame referee for one mistake. Coaches are responsible for training and tactics. Players have to be blamed if they fail to execute the game plan,” he added.
However, Nimal noted a change in attitude of player behaviour during the recent past.
“Now players have good discipline. This year, school and club players accepted referees’ decision when a penalty is awarded. If they respect referees, there would not be any problem. Earlier, they used to yell at the referee and players start fighting among each other. Now when a penalty is given they go back,” said Nimal who wants to be the best.
