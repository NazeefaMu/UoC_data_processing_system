Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) revealed yesterday that fifteen applications have been received by the Health Ministry and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to establish private medical institutions in the country.

In a press briefing held at Colombo the GMOA's Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said in 1980 there were around 100 State owned medical institutions in India with no private institutions however 30 years later its has exceeded 200 private medical institutions while government owned only 183.

Dr. Aluthge said that the demand for Indian graduate doctors are decreasing in the global perspective due to various shortcomings following the increase of private medical institutions in the country. He added that same situation will prevail in Sri Lanka if the government allows more private institutions to operate in the country.

“Indian politicians offer licenses to open up private medical colleges to their supporters as bribes and fortunately our politicians bribe their supporters by permitting them to establish bar or fuel stations. However in future SL politicians would too follow the footsteps of Indian politicians and drop the country’s medical education in a chaos, he said.

He said that according to the international media, one sixth out of 400 medical institutions have been corrupted as most of them were established through political affiliations.

Dr. Aluthge warned that our country will become worse than India if the government allows to establish private medical institutions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
