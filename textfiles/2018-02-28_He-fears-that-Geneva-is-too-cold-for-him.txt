The government has received a forewarning that the human rights commission in Geneva is set to take Sri Lanka to task at the annual sessions due next month.

 


Having decided to meet fire with fire, the government leadership had hand-picked a group of officials capable of rising to any occasion for the country’s delegation to Geneva and a yahapalanaya heavyweight to lead it.


The group of officials picked for the delegation had later called on the political heavyweight to discuss their strategy at the Geneva sessions. 


However, the visitors had been aback by the lukewarm attitude of the bigwig. “I say, how can I go to Geneva these days? They say it is terribly cold there.  My health is such I cannot stand cold weather!” The officials had left the place wondering as to why of all those available fit to fill the bill, this man was chosen to lead the delegation to Geneva.
