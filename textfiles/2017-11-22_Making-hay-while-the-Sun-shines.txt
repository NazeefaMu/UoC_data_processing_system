A political high-up in yahapalanaya is making a bid to acquire a big building that stands in the heart of the city of Sri Dalada.

 


The politico who has planned to start a business venture in this building valued at Rs. 150 million is said to be bargaining hard to buy it at the lowest possible price. The bigwigs representing yahapalanaya in the central hills have already posted the political authorities at the centre on the prime property interests of the politico, they say.  


The politico is one who had been so fortunate as to find the portals of Diyawanna council open for him to hold high office no matter whether he won or lost at the polls.


An owner already of two cozy mansions in the hills, the politico is also busy setting the stage to introduce his offspring too into politics.
