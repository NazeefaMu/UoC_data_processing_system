Joint Trade Union Alliance of the Ceylon Electricity Board a short while ago said that it would resort to indefinite countrywide strike from tomorrow morning.

Trade union Convener Ranjan Jayalal said all CEB executive grade officers would join in the proposed trade union action.

He said employees would not attend to islandwide emergency repairs and breakdown until their demands were met.

Meanwhile, Mr. Jayalal said that the higher rank officials would be obstructed and will not be allowed to enter the CEB head office tomorrow.

Several journalists had been injured when protesters were baton charged and three female CEB employees were also addmitted to the Colombo National Hospital with cut injuries. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
