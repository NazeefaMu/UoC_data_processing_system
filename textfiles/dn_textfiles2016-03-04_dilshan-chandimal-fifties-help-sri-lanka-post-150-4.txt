Openers Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal hit brilliant fifties before Pakistani bowlers struck four quick wickets in the tenth Twenty20 International of the Asia Cup 2016, being played between Pakistan and Sri Lanka .
 
After sent into bat by Pakistan, Sri Lanka openers provided a fine start making together 110 runs – the highest opening stand of the tournament.
