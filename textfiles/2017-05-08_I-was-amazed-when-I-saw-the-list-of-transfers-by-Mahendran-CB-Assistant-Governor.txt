Central Bank Assistant Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, who testified before the Presidential Commission investigating the bond scam, said he was taken aback by the irregular internal transfers undertaken by the then Governor Arjun Mahendran.

Citing an example he said Deepa Seneviratne, an official not competent in handling public debt, had been appointed as the head of the Public Debt Department.

He said Primary Dealer Perpetual Treasuries had failed to settle the interest free loan of Rs. 11 billion granted under the one-day loan facility offered.
