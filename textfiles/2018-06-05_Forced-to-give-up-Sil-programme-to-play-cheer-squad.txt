Forced to give up Sil programme to play cheer squad


	



 

There is a certain unit in the main office of a security service that conducts a special religious programme every Pun-Poya Day. And the organizers were not able to conduct this programme on Poya day due to the interference of a sidekick of a high political authority, they say.

 


The sidekick had brought pressure on the authorities concerned to release 25 personnel from each division in the head office to attend a competition event held at an institution related to youth affairs on the Poya day leading to the cancellation of the regular Poya Day religious programme. 


So, the security personnel who were keen on participating in the Poya Day programme had to attend the youth competition just to make up a big audience for the occasion. The only job they were required to do was to applaud loud when signaled to do so, they say.
