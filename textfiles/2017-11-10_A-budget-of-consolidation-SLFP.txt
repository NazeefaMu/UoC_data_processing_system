A budget of consolidation: SLFP


	

SLFP Minister Susil Premajayantha said more funds have been allocated to improve innovation and enterprises in the budget.

He said the only way to bridge the budget deficit within the next three years was to attract investment and improve exports.

“There are some policy decisions proposed by the Ministry of Finance. I am happy about that. You cannot expect too much relief at this stage. The finance minister is managing the budget with great difficulty by imposing a super luxury tax for vehicles and taxing the rich without passing the burden to middle income earners and the poor.  (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
