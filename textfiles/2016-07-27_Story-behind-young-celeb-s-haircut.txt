Story behind young celeb’s haircut


	

Young Diyawanna member from the former royal family had an unusual experience during his recent brief stay at the Welikada state lodge. 


When the young member was released on bail, his intimates were surprised to find his good head of hair reduced to a crew cut. So they asked what became of his long hair when he was in the state lodge. 


So the young one narrated how he came to sport a crew cut. There is an inmate at Welikada who has specialized as a hair dresser. When he met the young member from the famous family, he asked the latter: “Sir, your hair has grown too long. What about a haircut?”


However, the young celeb was not keen on getting a haircut. Hair dresser inmate was not a person who was prepared to take ‘no’ for an answer. “When you leave this place – it might happen soon – I am going to miss a life-time privilege of giving a haircut to a VIP like you! So let me give you a fine haircut…I assure I’ll do a superb job!” And the inmate pulled out a pair of scissors and a comb, had the young man seated on a bench nearby and proceeded to cut his hair.


The young celeb was quite pleased with the haircut. And he regretted that he had no money to give him as his fee. However, he offered the man a bright prospect by way of consolation. “When you get your release from this place, come and cut my hair on a regular basis.” And that greatly cheered up the inmate, they say.
