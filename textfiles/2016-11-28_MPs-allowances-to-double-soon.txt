The Government was mulling an increase the office rent allowance up to Rs. 100, 000 per month each on offices maintained by 225 Members of Parliament.

The allowance for attending Parliament, which was now Rs. 500 would also be increased to Rs.2,500 for days of their attendance to Parliament meetings.

The new move has been introduced, instead of the earlier move to pay Rs.75, 000 as office rent allowance and Rs.5,000 attendance allowance for committee meetings.

The new move is due to be presented in Parliament soon by the Ministry of Parliament Affairs, it is learnt. The relevant Cabinet Memorandum had been signed by the minister on Friday according to the sources.

Accordingly a Parliamentarian is entitled for a total allowance Rs 20,000 per month on eight day’s attendance in Parliament meetings.

It is also learned that steps were being taken to increase insurance coverage offered to an MP and already negotiations have begun with an Australian Insurance Company.

When inquired about the decision to increase the MP’s allowances, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said the matter was now being considered and a decision would be taken next week about presenting it to the Cabinet.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)
