Lanka to pursue eco-sensitive civilization - President

Sri Lankan government fully supports the adopted Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda, Sustainable Development Goals and targets, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
“I declare that the Government of Sri Lanka will act with the determination of a pioneer of eco-sensitive civilization emerging in the 21st century,” the President said, addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development summit.
“Sustainable development encapsulates the equilibrium between social and economic development and environmental protection. The Government of Sri Lanka anticipates achieving these goals fully by 2030,” he added.
The President said Sri Lanka’s rich history, dating back beyond 2,500 years provided the country with the inspiration and strength in this endeavour.
“We will also formulate a state policy on resource consumption based on the sustainable capacity of the environment,” the President stressed.
“The relevant policy framework would be implemented within an institutional structure based on the principles of good governance,” he added.
“We will strive to minimize risks of possible environmental hazards,” President Sirisena said adding that the country would work towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty.
“Sri Lanka will be fully committed to dealing with the thirteenth sustainable development goal relating to climate change. We will strive to minimize the risks of possible environmental hazards. I firmly believe that a proper study is required to ascertain how climate change aggravates Sri Lanka’s
contemporary development challenges such as poverty alleviation, food security, increasing ageing population and natural disasters,” he added.
“In conclusion, I wish to affirm that in the preparation of development policies for Sri Lanka as an aspiring upper middle income country, our special attention is focused on poverty alleviation, achieving food security, energy, education, minimising income disparity and urban development,” the President further added.
