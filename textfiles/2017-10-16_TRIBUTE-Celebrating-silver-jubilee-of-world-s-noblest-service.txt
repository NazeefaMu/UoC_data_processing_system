TRIBUTE: Celebrating silver jubilee of world’s noblest service


	



St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa

 

As great Indian philosopher Chanakya stated, a teacher is a person who can produce construction and destruction in his lap. The quotation indicates the power of teaching; one of the oldest and noblest services in the world. Ms. Roshani Fernando, Ms. Berny Perera and Mr. Lakmal Fernando are also such great personalities who moulded the minds of students, dedicating 25 years of their lives for teaching.   
The trio enlightened thousands of students at St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa. They shared their experience of last 25 years with the Daily Mirror and responded individually to a common question regarding their opinion on the creativity of children nowadays. They were of the view that lack of artistic programmes in school curriculum, less time for children to engage in different activities and mounting pressure on children has caused the loss of creativity in the young generation. They stated that teachers should create more space to allow children to think freely and to express themselves in unique manners.

I consider myself privileged to study as a pupil and work as a teacher in the same school

- Lakmal Fernando

“I started my education from grade 1 way back in 1977 at St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa and have grown personally and professionally along with this institution. I consider myself privileged to study as a pupil and work as a teacher in the same school. I assumed duties as a teacher in October, 1992. Having been worked as the Head of Grade eight section for 10 years, currently I am specializing Commerce and Business Studies for Ordinary Level students. Teaching has always been my passion and this noble profession has given me an opportunity to give direction to my students.”  
“Parents focus only to get their students passed from all the examinations; ultimately the children fail to pass the greatest and most important examination called life. They lack social knowledge. Consequently, the young generations easily become victims of various anti-social things. We should create more space for them to spend more time with the nature. Education should not be confined into a classroom. At one point, parents should be held responsible because they are the ones who are pushing the children towards the competition. It is rare to find teenagers who read books and listen to good music. I try to plant this idea in my students’ minds.”    

 

As a teacher, I have learned the lessons of life from the innocent students also

 - Berny Perera

 

“I stepped into this school on July 13, 1992. The subject I am teaching is Sinhala for grade 7 and 8 students. I am also the Sinhala Subject Head of secondary section of the school. Frankly, during the first few years, 
I was a typical teacher. By the 
time, I realized that there was much more 
I could do for the society as a teacher. Then, I started moulding the minds of students how to be sensitive human beings who have empathy and ability to see the life in a different way. As a teacher, I have learned the lessons of life from the innocent students also. It is another important thing about the profession of teaching as it enlightens both sides of the teacher as well as the student.”  
“I think the number of subjects should be reduced and only most important subjects should remain. Educational changes should be made to take the students out of the classroom and keep them engaged in different activities that foster their creativity. Current situation poses a huge threat to the thinking ability of the future generation. As an Arts teacher, I believe there should be more lessons related to entertainment and Arts. Regularly, we hear news about teenagers who committed suicide. It is evident that the education system has failed to address the minds of the young generation and has created a generation who are not able to face problems in their lives.”  

 

Twenty five years of memorable service was possible only because of caring, human attitude of everyone associated here

 - Roshani Fernando

 

“I have been associated with this prestigious institution since January 22, 1992. St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa is my second home. Currently, I am teaching Mathematics for Grade seven and eight students. 
“When I joined the school, Rev. Bro. Granvil Perera was the principal. When looking at the past, I see our school has gradually developed thanks to many reverends especially Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle. However, it is hard to express the satisfaction I have had being a teacher. Twenty five years of memorable service was possible only because of caring, human attitude of everyone associated here.”  
“In our school days, there was no pressure on us. By the time, syllabuses became much bigger, leveling pressure on students and reducing leisure for them to engage in extra-curricular activities. It goes without saying that the competition is uncontrollably high nowadays. Innocent children are struggling with time to cover everything. As a result of this unhealthy trend, students who are produced to the society lack empathy, patience and ability to face unexpected challenges in their lives.”
