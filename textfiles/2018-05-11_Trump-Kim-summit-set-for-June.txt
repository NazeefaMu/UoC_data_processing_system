Trump-Kim summit set for June


	

US, (Daily Mail), 10 May 2018 -  


US President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take place in Singapore on June 12.  


The location and date of the landmark meeting -- the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader -- were announced by presidential tweet just hours after North Korea released three American prisoners.  


US officials said their freedom removed the last major obstacle, providing Trump with tangible evidence that his twin-track policy of engagement and “maximum pressure” was working.  


“We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!” Trump wrote.  


Technically the United States and North Korea are still at war -- a stop-gap armistice ended the brutal three year war between the two countries in 1953 and around 30,000 US troops remain in neighboring South Korea.
