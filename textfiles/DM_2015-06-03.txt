He is now a hero before  his voters!
	
	This politico was a Cabinet Minister of the previous regime.
He accepted a Deputy office in the current administration, but quit it soon after.
The politico had a chance meeting with a long standing friend recently. Small talk over, their conversation drifted to the current political situation.
By the way, why did you accept a Deputy office in this government despite once being a Cabinet Minister the friend asked the former Minister.
The politico looked around furtively as if to check whether there was anyone within earshot and said in a conspiratorial tone: Machang, in those days whenever I visited Nuwara Eliya as a Minister the Policemen treated me like a king. I was the centre of attraction. The SSP on seeing me would stand to attention and salute me. When you are in politics you cannot do without Police security and respect. When I visited Nuwara Eliya one day as an MP, the Police didnt care a tuppence for me! So I decided to accept at least a Deputy office so that Police and others would pay me some respect. Machang, coming down to brass tacks, you lose your image among people when Police and other high officials stop dancing attendance on you!
But why on earth did you quit the portfolio the friend asked him.
Well, I took the decision after carefully weighing the pros and cons, said the politico. My voters expected from me a lot of things when I became a Deputy. But I was not in a position to do them any favour. So I thought it was better for me to quit as a hero than remain in office and fall from their grace!

A new political alignment in the offing
	
	
	Behind the scene moves are afoot to get up a new political alignment to take on the UPFAs rebel group backing the deposed strongman, informed sources say.
Several like-minded political stalwarts from both minor and major parties had rendezvoused recently to lay the ground work for the proposed alignment. By the way, practically all these stalwarts had been at the forefront of the campaign for the common opposition candidate at the last Presidential poll. The participants in this confab had reached agreement to contest the coming general election as an alliance and most of them had favoured the idea of contesting under the Swan symbol.
The Bell party was not represented at this meeting. The Field Marshals party and certain Green party old timers are not likely to back the new alliance in the offing, they say.

A tussle between two politicos and a state official
	
	
	Two Ministerial ones have been taking an unusual interest in getting the Transport authorities to expedite settlement of some outstanding bills in respect of spare parts supplied to the CTB during the previous regime.
The Transport Ministrys chief accounting official was highly irked by the pestering by the two Ministerial ones to expedite payment to the spare parts suppliers when his own Ministerial one was silent on the matter.
The Ministerial duo had cajoled and threatened the official, but the official had stood his ground. I am prepared to go home. I will not make the payments without the Treasury approval, he had put his foot down. The tussle is expected to drag on with both parties vowing not to give in, they say.

Video: DPF, UPF, WNC form new political alliance
	
	Three upcountry Tamil political parties yesterday signed a Memorandum of Understanding forming the new political alliance Tamil Progress Alliance (TPA), with the intention of addressing the needs of the Sri Lankan Tamils living apart from the North and East Provinces.
	The parties joined together were Democratic Peoples Front (DPF), Upcountry Peoples Front (UPF) and the Workers National Congress (WNC), sources said.
	DPF and TPA Leader Mano Ganesan said the alliance would continue to spread equity for the 1.5 million Tamils residing outside North and East within a unitary Sri Lanka upholding reconciliation among ethnic groups.
	There are far more pressing issues facing the Tamils. Our only mission is to solve these burning issues, he said.
	He said the TNA would look into the issues in the North and East.
	WNC Leader and TPA Joint Deputy Leader Minister P. Thigambaram said the TPA was not formed to promote hatred, extremism or racism.
	Previous rulers kept promising on the wellbeing of the estate workers but to no avail. We are here to address these concerns with the countrys present intelligent leadership, he said.
	UPF Leader and TPA Joint Deputy Leader State Minister V. Radhakrishnan said the alliance was not formed for personal gain but to benefit the entire Tamil community living outside North and East.
	UPF Secretary A. Lawrance was appointed as TPA General Secretary, sources said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Duo set to return to Mahagedara!
	
	
	
	Two Deputies of the previous regime are now set to double-cross to the Green party, they say.
One of the double-crossers is said to be a politico from the South now representing an electorate in the hill country. The other one is currently representing an area north of the City of Pearls and was involved in foreign matters under the previous regime.
Both of them have told their intimates that the time had come for them to return to their Mahagedara  the ancestral home.

Video: Govt. has no money: Susil
	
	The Opposition would give priority to pass the No Confidence Motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, UPFA General Secretary Parliamentarian Susil Premajayantha said today.
	Addressing the weekly media briefing at the SLFP head office Mr. Premajayantha said the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had not been moved in Parliament as yet and therefore, the Opposition wanted to debate and pass the Motion against Mr. Karunanayake as early as possible.
	He said that the monetary management of the government was poor and the government had failed in financial discipline.
	"The Treasury has no funds even to pay salaries to public servants, let alone the continuation of development projects launched by previous government. The government therefore, has no option but to go for foreign loans on high interest rates. But Mr. Karunanayake displays huge billboards at busy junctions carrying his and President Maithripala Sirisena's pictures to convince the public that the government has achieved much success in the last five months in development which is untrue," Mr. Premajayantha charged.
	On the curtailing of the lunch hour of public servants to thirty minutes by the government, Mr. Premajayantha said the action would lead to inefficiency, distress and low productivity in the Public Service and added what required was a total reform package for the Public Service.
	"Do not forget that this is the government that suspended recruitment to the Public Service for two years and prune the Public Service by half, when they were in power from 2002 to 2004," Mr. Premajayantha said.
	The government has come to a standstill as it has no business to go forward as the government was formed only for 100 days," he charged.
	Mr. Premajayantha said the rupee was steadily spiralling in value and government's promise to create one million jobs was a day dream. It was improper to ask former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to retire by a party that has suffered electoral defeats more than 20 times in the last two decades.
	Commenting on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, Premajayantha found fault with the UNP and said while the UPFA was fully supportive of the electoral reforms, the UNP was scuttling the process in order to hold general elections under the highly criticised PR system.
	"We are for the 20th Amendment and we want to conduct the Parliamentary polls under the new electoral system that does away with the Preferential Voting System. We put our full weight behind it and try to pass it in Parliament as quickly as possible," he stressed.
	Higher Education Project Minister Sudharshini Fernandopulle said the development -mega, medium or micro level- had ground to a halt as no funds were available.
	The government has failed to release even a rupee out of Rs. 10 million, promised to each lawmaker from the mini-budget, she said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)Video by Sanath Desmond

He is not the only victim!
	
	
	So the Customs Chief finally bade farewell to his job. He is reported to have bowed out because he could no longer stomach the harassment and interference by a certain political heavyweight.
They alleged that the political heavyweight would often give the official orders like release that container, grant that person some relief and give him a duty waiver. And he never listened when the official tried to explain the legal snags in the way of carrying out his orders. Incidentally, an excise bigwig also quit his job about three weeks ago, because the same political heavyweight had become a severe headache to him, they say.

	This Ministerial one of the present regime held similar rank in the previous one too.
He once got into hot water by shooting off his mouth. They say that he is back with the same habit, but he is not likely to wear the jumper again.
This politico from the hills is said to be armed with a list of names of the top brass of the previous regime who, he claims are on the way to the state-run lodge in connection with a variety of offences committed by them under the patronage of the deposed strongman.
After taking in the evening a shot that generates courage, the politico would rattle off the names of the wrong doers of the previous regimes and the crimes they had committed. The suspected murder of a ruggerite, the mystery surrounding the killing of former MP Raviraj, white van abductions, Avant Garde scandal and Siriliya Saviya irregularities are among the cases he often refers to, they say.

HSBC plans thousands of job cuts: report
	
		 		 
		 
			
AFP - Scandal-hit global bank HSBC plans to cut thousands of jobs across its global operations, broadcaster Sky News reported yesterday.
The number of job cuts has yet to be finalised, but insiders said that it was likely to be between 10,000 and 20,000, Sky reported.
The cuts to be announced by chief executive Stuart Gulliver at an investor update on June 9 would be implemented by 2017, according to the report.
A spokeswoman for the bank, which employs 266,000 people around the world, declined to comment.
Europes biggest bank has weathered a stream of scandals in the past year, including accusations its Swiss private banking arm helped wealthy clients dodge taxes.
The Asia-focused lender faces a French criminal investigation over the allegations.
Last year, it was separately fined by US and British regulators for attempting to rig foreign exchange markets.
Investors next week may be keen to hear whether the bank will relocate its headquarters from Britain, where it has been based since 1992.
Founded in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 1865, Gulliver has said the bank may relocate due to increased British regulation and taxation of the banking sector.
HSBC currently employs 48,000 across Britain, including around 8,500 at its London headquarters.

Video: Duty free container with liquor, swords seized
	
	Customs officials today seized a 40-foot container with liquor bottles, pasta and two swords, imported abusing a duty free concession granted to migrant workers, Customs Spokesman Leslie Gamini said.
	Seventy eight liquor bottles, 37 wine bottles, 5000 kilograms of pasta and two swords, valued at Rs. 684,750 in total were seized, he said.
	The container arrived on May 21 from Trieste, Italy and was detained by the Customs Revenue Task Force at RCT, Orugodawatta.
	It has been declared as tax free import under a concession given to migrant workers by the government, he said.
	The goods were declared as personal effects of five passengers from Chilaw under passenger baggage allowances, Gamini said.
	The two swords are valued Rs.10, 000 each and it should have Ministry of Defence approval, Mr. Gamini said.
	The Customs would have lost Rs. 1,133,716 in duties had container was allowed in, he said.
	He said that the owners had been informed about the detection and that the Customs would take legal actions against them. (Chaturanga Pradeep) Video by Chaturanga Pradeep

Jaya writes to Modi on fishermen arrest
	
	In her first letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after taking over as chief minister, J Jayalalithaa on Tuesday sought his personal intervention for the release of 14 Tamil Nadu fishermen who were arrested by Sri Lankan authorities on Monday night.
	"I urge your immediate personal intervention in this issue and request you to direct the ministry of external affairs to take up the matter with the Sri Lankan authorities to secure the immediate release of the 14 fishermen who were apprehended on June 1 and their three fishing boats along with the 18 fishing boats which are already in the Sri Lankan custody," she said.
	"I write with a deep sense of anguish that right at the beginning of the fishing season on June 1, after a 45 day fishing ban, 14 fishermen from Tamil Nadu, along with their three fishing boats, have been detained by the Sri Lankan navy," said Jayalalithaa.
	Three mechanized boats which set sail for fishing from the Rameswaram fishing base were apprehended by the Sri Lankan navy in the late hours of Monday and were taken to Thalaimannar in Sri Lanka, the chief minister said.
	"There are already 18 boats belonging to our fishermen in Sri Lankan custody. I would like to specifically point out that of the 80 boats impounded since June, 2014, 16 boats were completely ruined beyond recovery and could not be salvaged. Boats and fishing gear which are essential for the poor fishermen to earn their livelihood are deliberately not released by the Sri Lankan authorities while releasing the fishermen," she said.

Loyalties and habits die hard!
	
	The new Big Boss chaired a Betel Party conference held in Uva recently.
The first to address the confab was the former talkative Ministerial Madam. She started off with the customary preamble of seeking the permission of the chair, but the name she used was that of the deposed strongman! There were immediate titters from the audience and the talkative Madam correcting herself begged the permission of the new Big Boss in the chair to proceed with her speech.
She later declared several times during her speech that the comeback of the deposed strongman to the Betel Party was a must if it is to win the upcoming general election. Her repeated calls for the former strongmans return to active politics to lead the Betel Party to victory drew applause from the audience. However, there were dissenting voices that led to a charged atmosphere. And tensions had run high until the New Big Boss rose to his feet to deliver his address.
The New Big Boss in a hard hitting speech traced the history of the Blue party and admonished the members for failing to learn lessons from the history of the party. And the once noisy audience listened to him in pin-drop silence, they say.

	The US on Tuesday said President Maithripala Sirisena had moved Sri Lanka away from divisive politics and crony capitalism toward a new path of reconciliation.
	Democratic elections have brought about a sea-change in US- SL relationship, where the new President has moved the country away from divisive politics and crony capitalism toward a new path of reconciliation and inclusive development, Richard E. Hoagland, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said.
	Speaking at the Washington International Business Council, he said they would support Sri Lankas pursuit of strengthening its governance, especially its judicial and financial institutions.
	This new path will be a boon for the Sri Lankan people, as well as U.S. interests. We can now work together with Sri Lanka to promote good governance and human rights abroad, as well as improve maritime security in the Indian Ocean, he said.

Six senior officials of the CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) and 16 others from various commercial banks across the country were arrested over currency fraud, said Wilson Uwujaren.
The arrests come just days after new President Muhammadu Buhari took office. The 72-year-old has pledged to crack down on endemic corruption in government at the highest level.
Uwujaren, from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), said the body was expected to charge the suspects with offences related to economic fraud in the coming days.
They were expected to destroy some old and mutilated currency notes running into billions of naira but they fraudulently did not do so, he alleged.
In a statement Monday evening the CBN said the bank itself had handed over some unscrupulous staff for prosecution.
The anomalies came to light during a routine internal audit of the CBNs southern Ibadan branch in September 2014.
On further investigation ordered by the (CBN) governor, it was discovered that a systematic scheme, which has been on for several years, was being run in which mutilated higher denomination notes originally meant for destruction were swapped with lower denomination currencies.
The bank said a nationwide audit showed this was an isolated scheme at Ibadan branch and pledged to work with the EFCC to ensure the suspects were brought to justice.

Pakistan firm fears losing $84mn contract with SL
	
	An international contract of $84 million of scanning, digitising and delivery of captured data for identity cards of the Government of Sri Lanka is slipping from the hands of Pakistans National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) after the authority has been subjected to unnecessary criticism over voter verification process, sources say.
	The sources said that Nadras credibility had been badly damaged after the political parties started criticising it and Nadra has started getting vibes from the Sri Lankan government that they might not award Nadra the contract for issuance of fresh ID cards to Sri Lankan citizens.
	The sources said that Nadra had won the multi-million dollar international contract in 2013 and had completed the first phase and it was most likely that it would win the second phase of the project too, which is worth $84 million but the political parties started criticising Nadra for a crime it never committed and because of it, the Sri Lankan government might give a second thought to its decision. Nadra has started getting the vibes from Sri Lanka and things are not in its favour, the sources added.
	In 2013, Nadra by successfully executing identification-related projects in a number of developing countries, including Sudan, Nigeria and Kenya broke the international monopoly once enjoyed by the western companies. Nadra had won the first phase of the Sri Lankan governments identity cards project, through open bidding.
	The international drivers licence system of Bangladesh was also delivered on BOT (build, operate and transfer) basis, and the authority assisted the UNHCR in the registration of Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan as well.
	Sri Lanka floated international tenders for its computerised identity cards project back in 2007. Nadras bid was one of the most technically competent almost half the price of the competitors.
	However, the tender was scrapped at that time. In 2013, the Sri Lankan government invited bids once again and Nadra was declared the successful bidder for the first phase. Consequently, it carried out the first of the three-phase project, which amounted to 715 million in Sri Lankan rupees and was focused on the digitisation of legacy data of over 9 million forms.
	In the second phase, Nadra would issue fresh ID cards to Sri Lankan citizens. Of late, Nadra also objected to interference of political parties in its internal affairs at a crucial time when the authority is busy in the process of voter verification in disputed constituencies and being presented as witness before the judicial commission.

Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) urged the political parties including the United National Party (UNP) to support to get the 20th Amendment to the Constitution passed without holding it up in Parliament.
General Secretary of JHU Patali Champika Ranawaka insisted the government to keep the election promise that was made by the President to change the existing electoral system since it lets unsuitable people get elected.
There is a group who are geared up to sabotage this process of the 20th Amendment getting passed. They hoodwink the people by taking up unnecessary topics in Parliamentary debates. As a result, the process has become trapped in the house, Mr. Ranawaka said.
The UNP who was forefront in forming the new government should not go backward, when the national need has come to change the electoral system, he said.
He said that arguments made by few parties that the minority parties were affected were baseless.
We have to increase the number of Parliamentarians to increase the representation minor parties to a considerable number. Nowadays, some are criticising even the decision to increase Parliamentarians, Mr. Ranawaka said.
He said there was a public discussion since 2002 about a new electoral system, when a committee headed by MP Dinesh Gunawardane took the issue in to consideration. (Piyumi Fonseka)Video by Sanath DesmondPic by Kithsiri De Mel

	The derelict loner of the Old left who created a sensation when he spewed out scorn with choice filth on the Green leader in the Diyawanna House recently took even close political associates by surprise when he declared his opposition to giving nomination to the two siblings to contest under the Betel leaf at the coming general election
Intrigued by the derelict loners avowal, some inquisitive persons had made discreet inquiries and came up with the reason why this loner is opposed to at least Sibling G: because the latters entering the fray will dim the prospects of at least two stalwarts of the rebel group he is now running with these days, they say.

Udayanga Weeratunga visits SL embassy in Tehran
	
In a strange turn of events, Sri Lankas former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, whose name has been implicated in an arms deal controversy, has visited the Sri Lankan Embassy in Tehran with a request to certify a power-of-attorney copy in order to get some of his heavy baggage in the Colombo port to be cleared.
His visit to the Tehran embassy was confirmed by the new Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne today during a weekly press briefing held at the Ministry premises.
Former Ambassador Weeratunga had visited the Sri Lankan Embassy in Tehran, Iran on May 5 with a request for his copy of power-of-attorney to be certified and had provided an email address to the embassy officials to continue further communications on the matter, she said.
However, his request had been declined on the condition that he returns his diplomatic passport to which he had replied via email on May 9, stating that he would not return the diplomatic passport.
Colonne stated despite his objection to return the passport, the Sri Lankan Immigration Department has already taken measures to cancel it with immediate effect and added that all the relevant Sri Lankan Missions have also been notified of the cancellation.
She stated they were awaiting an update from the Ukrainian government concerning the progress of the ongoing investigation against Weeratunga regarding his alleged supply of arms to 19 Ukrainian rebels, while he was serving as Sri Lankas Ambassador to Russia.
Furthermore, Colonne noted that Weeratungas passport could not be impounded, since the allegations against him have not been proven and therefore no basis existed upon which it could be implemented.
She however added that officials in Sri Lanka want Mr. Weeratunga to return to Sri Lanka as he is implicated with several other ongoing investigations domestically as well, including the MiG-27 deal that is being probed by the Financial Fraud Investigation Department. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Taking a ride on gravy train!
	
	Our locals very often refer to proverbial schemers capable of carrying fire through water.
And here is a story about certain schemers in real life capable of spinning money out of water!
They say that the present government is saddled with the job of making payments to contractors who handled work on a series of water supply projects undertaken by the previous regime.
Payments due to these contractors for the work completed add up to a massive Rs.21 Billion, they say.
A certain Ministerial authority responsible for releasing these payments to contractors had realized there is more than enough gravy for him just for the taking. And he had planned a modus operandi for collecting the gravy.
The authority these days, they say, is summoning the contractors one by one to his office. When they turn up he would have a cordial chat with each of them and would finally tell them: I know that you need the money due to you urgently. I will see to that you get your money without further delay. But I want you also do me a favour. We are operating a social welfare fund. Can you please credit at least 6 per cent of your payment to this fund
Some contractors who are pressed for money readily make this payoff. But a group of contractors highly concerned about this racket are planning to lodge a complaint against the chief ministerial authority concerned, they say.
