Is Govt. using Sunny Leone to promote casinos?: Wimal


	

The good-governance proponents, who condemned casinos in the country, should confirm whether they are planning to promote the casino industry by bringing the well-known erotic actress Sunny Leone to the country, National Freedom Front Leader and Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa said today.
Ms. Leone is said to be planning to visit Sri Lanka in December and during her visit, she is expected to present a musical concert at the premises of a casino in Colombo.
Ms. Leone is reportedly being sponsored by a businessman who has a chain of casinos in Sri Lanka.
Mr. Weerawansa said Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera should raise his voice against actress Leone’s visit to the country because he was one of those who spoke against the casinos during the previous government.
“We can’t imagine what will happen to the country at this rate. We saw an organization calling itself the Centre for Sex Worker’s Rights (CSWR) requesting the President to legalise sex workers and provide them legal recognition. There were reports asking for legal rights for gays as well and in the meantime we hear that the well-known erotic actress Sunny Leone is visiting our country to promote casinos. Where are the religious groups and other politicians who protested against casino projects? This concert will definitely help to expand the casino industry. We should not let it happen,” Mr. Weerawansa said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
