The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has come up with a concessional package for those affected by the recent floods, a ministry statement said.


Accordingly electricity tariffs due from those whose houses were destroyed by floods will not be charged while a two-month grace period will be given to those whose houses were damaged, to pay their tariffs for the months of May and June this year.


In addition new connections will be given free of charge to those whose houses were destroyed and for those living in temporary houses will be given free connections for a period of six months.


Small business holders belonging to the GP 1 category whose claims are less than 42KVA, will be given the opportunity of paying their bills in six installments.


Also the statement said a mobile service had been introduced for the benefit of these who are still facing inconveniences.  (Yohan Perera)
