Mounts, the slight elevations on the palm assume great significance in the study of Palmistry, because they cause the formation and development of the main lines on the palm. Besides, the Mounts account for the main divisions that make up the palm.


According to ancient Indian palmists, there are seven mounts on the palm named after the seven main planets in the Solar system excluding the shadow planets, Rahu and Ketu who too figure in Astrological calculations. However, modem Palmistry experts have divided the palm into 12 Mounts, sub-dividing certain areas on the palm assigned to the main planets earlier. 
The planets after whom the five additional Mounts are named are

Harshal, Neptune. Rahu (Dragon’s Head), Ketu (Dragon’s Tail), and Pluto.
	Uranus is referred to as Harshal, Herschel and Prajapati in Hindu Astrology)
