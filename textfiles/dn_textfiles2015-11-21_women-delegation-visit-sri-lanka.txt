Women delegation to visit Sri Lanka

A delegation comprising 22 members from WE (Women Entrepreneurs), a forum of Tamil Nadu Chamber Foundation from Madurai would be visiting Sri Lanka for five days beginning November 25, said WE chair person Rajakumari Jeevagan here on Friday.
 
Exploring business opportunities on the one side, the visit would also be an intellectual tourism for the delegates who would be able to understand the requirements of the island nation during one-on-one interactions with business houses in Sri Lanka.
 
Speaking to reporters, she said that apart from meeting members of Women Chamber of Industry and Commerce there, factory visits had also been arranged. The WE, had earlier been to the USA two years ago as part of knowledge development programme, she added.
 
Earlier, sharing his experiences with the WE members, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry senior president S. Rethinavelu said that after the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island nation a few months back, prospects for bilateral trade with Sri Lanka looked bright.
 
Export opportunities were abundant in automobile, garments, jewellery, fabrics and among others. “We can even think of opening shops there as workforce was available in plenty,” he added.
 
Export Promotion Council, a wing of the Tamil Nadu Chamber Foundation, member Tirupathi Raja, a successful exporter, gave tips to the members during the interactive session. He suggested them to carry adequate samples of their products. From Tuticorin VOC port, Colombo port could be reached in about six to seven hours, thus members may look for exporting perishable goods as well, he noted. (The Hindu)
