“Be in the crowd, not on the stage!”


	


	
	Leaders of four constituent political parties of the former ruling coalition held a meeting at Nugegoda recently to push the demand that the alliance headed by the Blues nominate the deposed Big Boss as their Prime Ministerial candidate at the general elections round the corner.

The alliance members of the Western council (except four or five of them)   including their Chief decided well ahead of the event to attend this rally.
On hearing about this decision, the national organizer of the Blue party called the Western Council Chief, “Is it true that you people are planning to attend the Nugegoda rally?” he asked.
“Yes. We are planning to attend the rally,” replied the Provincial Chief. “On one hand, it is our duty to attend this rally.  On the other hand, it is the belief of our members that the former Big Boss should lead the alliance from the front at the coming elections if we are to emerge victorious.”
The national organizer said: “True, that the rally is being organized by four constituents of our alliance. You may attend the rally if you are really keen. But don’t appear on the stage. If you do appear, you may have to face the consequences.”
“We are not going to change our decision to attend the rally,” replied the Provincial Chief.  “However, we will comply with your request not to appear on the stage.”
