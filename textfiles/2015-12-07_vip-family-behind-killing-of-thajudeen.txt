	Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday the CCTV evidence is available to prove that members of VIP families were involved in the assault and the killing of Havelock’s rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen.
	 “There is CCTV footage which shows Mr. Thajudeen leaving a club after having meals, he is then seen being stopped, assaulted and killed. The video shows members of some VIP families engaged in these activities,” he said.
	The minister said the real culprits would be identified once the footage is produced in court by the CID.
