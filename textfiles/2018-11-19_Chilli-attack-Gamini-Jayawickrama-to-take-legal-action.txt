UNP MP Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said today he would take legal action in connection with the attack made on him in parliament on Friday.

He said he would first complaint to the Police and then proceed to take legal action in the court.

Mr. Perera was attacked with chilli powder mixed with water during the tense situation in parliament last Friday.

“The punishment as laid down in the Parliament Act is not sufficient for such deplorable behaviour. MPs of both parties have to be blamed. I believe other MPs will do the same. This decision was made to ensure that similar events will not occur in future. I will also seek further action following the court decision,” he said.
