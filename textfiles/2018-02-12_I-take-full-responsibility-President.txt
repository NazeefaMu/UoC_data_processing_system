President Maithripala Sirisena has told SLFP ministers who met him yesterday that he would introduce far reaching changes to the government following the LG polls results in the days to come. 

“I take full responsibility for the SLFP’s electoral setback. The people of the country have voted for a change and I will respond positively to their message and introduce necessary changes accordingly as soon as possible,” President Sirisena has reportedly told the ministers.   (Sandun A Jayasekera)
