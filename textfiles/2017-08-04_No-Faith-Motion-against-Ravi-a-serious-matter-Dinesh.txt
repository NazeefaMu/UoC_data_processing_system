No-Faith Motion against Ravi a serious matter: Dinesh


	

The No-Confidence Motion against Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake should be taken seriously not only by Parliament but also by the government and the people of the country, Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane said.

After submitting the motion to the Secretary General of Parliament, the MP told Daily Mirror that it should be included in the order book following Speaker’s approval.

“The party leaders will then have to decide a date on which to take up the motion for a debate followed by a vote,” he said.

He said the motion was handed over to Parliament yesterday on the basis that Minister Karunanayake was no longer fit to hold a ministerial portfolio. “We seek his resignation,” he said.

The motion was signed by 32 MPs of the joint opposition. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)
