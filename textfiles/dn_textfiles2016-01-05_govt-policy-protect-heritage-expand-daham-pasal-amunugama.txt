Govt policy to protect heritage, expand daham pasal - Amunugama

 
The Sunday daham pasal system in Sri Lanka should be further expanded. That it is the policy of the government, Minister of Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
He made these comments at the opening of a newly built relic chamber at the Sri Nagabodhi Purana Viharaya in Doranuwa, Ruwanwella.
"At a time when various ideologies are spreading in our country our Sunday-school system should be further expanded. We as a government pledge to promote the daham pasal system. We will take all the steps necessary towards that end," the minister said. He said the distinguishing mark of Sri Lanka is Buddhism: "We should not forget that Buddhism is intimately tied up with Sinhala-ness. The world recognises us as a Buddhist country. If we go to Thailand, Cambodia or Burma our country is recognized as one with good Buddhists. Therefore we must safeguard that situation," Dr. Amunugama said.
"We should not forget our heritage while our society changes. Not only must we not forget it, we should also protect it for the future generations. I must state that the President and the government are committed to that task," the minister said.
Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province, Minister of Power and Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and several Provincial Council Members participated at the ceremony.
