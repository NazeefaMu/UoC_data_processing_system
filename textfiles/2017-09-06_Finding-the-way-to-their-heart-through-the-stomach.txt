Finding the way to their heart through the stomach


	



 

A group of about 20 Green backbenchers was seen at a hotel named after a fish on the Mount Lavinia beach in an evening the other day.

 

This group in fact, had been invited to a dinner at the hotel. The host was a filthy rich powerful former top team purohita. 


The members who were dined and wined to their heart’s content had learnt later that the motive behind the grand dinner hosted to them by the affluent politico was to win their support for a ‘radical pressure group’ within the party which he has planned to lead. 


Some front-runners of the Green party who have got reservations about the former purohita’s move are said to be keeping a wary eye on him these days.
