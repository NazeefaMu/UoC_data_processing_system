The members of the joint opposition will boycott State functions including the Independence Day celebrations on February 4 at the Galle Face Green to protest what they described as the ‘suppression’ by the Government, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said today.

He accused the government of carrying out a political witch hunt against its opponents and acting against the norms of good governance and democracy.

“Therefore, we will boycott State functions and will not attend the Independence Day celebrations,” he told a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella.

The news conference was held after a several members of the joint opposition visited former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son Yoshitha at the Welikada Prison.

Mr. Gunawardena said the FCID, which arrested Yoshitha, was illegal being appointed in violation of democratic values, fundamental rights and the judicial process for the survival of the government and hunt down political opponents.
