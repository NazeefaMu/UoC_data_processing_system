Dinesh: Unitary State, place of Buddhism omitted in new proposals


	

The government had omitted certain significant Articles of the 1978 Constitution, including those on upholding the Unitary State of the country and giving foremost place to Buddhism from the new Constitution, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) MP Dinesh Gunawardane charged today.
Speaking at a media briefing MP Gunawardane said the people were not informed about the omission of two Articles, which mainly affect the country.
He charged that the government’s intention was to obtain approval of the people through a referendum only for two issues - to abolition of the Executive Presidency and replacement of the Proportional Representation System with the First Past the Post System.
He claimed that the clauses about the Unitary State and place of Buddhism had not been mentioned in the document submitted to MPs with regard to the proposals to be presented to Parliament on January 9.
He said he suspected whether the changes were a result of the proposals presented by the Tamil National Alliance, and the Muslim Congress.
“Even though the first anniversary of the government is falling on January 9, pledges made by the government to the people have not yet been fulfilled. The so-called good-governance and economic development are not established in the country. Meanwhile, the country is being going to another dangerous situation. If these proposals are made laws, eventually the country will be divided into two. The government should carefully work on the proposals which affect the country without being relied on political parties. We should stand against this dangerous situation irrespective of caste and religion,” MEP Leader said.
He said before major changes regarding the Unitary State or the place of Buddhism are made in the proposed new Constitution, people should be consulted at a referendum.
Speaking on the abolishing of Executive Presidency, he said even if the Executive Presidency should be abolished, certain powers which decide on the national security should remain as they are needed to make strong decisions on issues pertaining to national security. (Piyumi Fonseka)
