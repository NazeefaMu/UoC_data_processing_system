State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said today that the process of setting up a Volkswagen car plant in Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala is moving ahead and the BOI had handed over the concluded proposal to the project company.

He said the next step of the process is to build the plant by the project company. “I’m not certain as to how many days it will be but once the plant is completed, the company will start their production,” the minister told the Daily Mirror.

He said the process was lengthy and took time as a suitable land had to be identified, surveyed, and had to be acquired.  “Due process had to be followed. Now, the BOI has acquired the land,” he said.

The longer process, he said could be shortened in the future.
