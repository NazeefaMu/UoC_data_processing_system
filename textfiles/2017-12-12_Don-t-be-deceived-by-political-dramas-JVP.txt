Don’t be deceived by political dramas: JVP


	

Referring to joint opposition members joining the government, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today people should not get deceived by the political dramas being enacted today.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said people should learn lessons from what was happening these days because they would bring no benefit to the nation.

“Those who crossed over have done so, expecting some benefit. Weerakumara Dissanayake is one of them, and there is also a lady who had joined the government in the morning after voting against the budget the previous night. Isn’t this shameless,” he asked.

Responding to journalists who asked him whether the JVP had lost its campaign machinery, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said some former JVPers such as NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa had fallen into the dustbin.

“Even the Front-line Socialist Party which broke away from the JVP are unable to contest an election,” he said.

When asked why party posters cannot be seen today unlike in the past, Mr Silva said the poster campaign had got competitive.

"The poster competition is so volatile that a poster will only remain on a wall for an hour, because a different poster is pasted over it,” Mr. Silva said and highlighted the fact that the party had sufficient cadres to handle the campaign. (Yohan Perera)
