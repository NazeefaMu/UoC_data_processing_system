Melbourne, (Daily Mail), 21 December 2017 -More than a dozen pedestrians, including a toddler, have been injured with two fighting for life in hospital after a car ‘deliberately’ ploughed into rush hour crowds in the heart of Melbourne.    A white Suzuki SUV with p-plates, driven by 32-year-old Afghanistan immigrant, who The Herald Sun have identified as Saeed Noori, crashed into a large group of commuters and shoppers at the corner of Melbourne’s busy Elizabeth Street and Flinders Street at 4.41pm on Thursday.    The 32-year-old lone wolf driver was known to police and was arrested at the scene.    The driver, who is an Australian citizen, is under police guard at hospital with shoulder and hand injuries.
