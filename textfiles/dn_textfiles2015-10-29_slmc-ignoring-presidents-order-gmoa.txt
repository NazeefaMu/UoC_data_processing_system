SLMC ignoring President's order - GMOA

President Maithripala Sirisena has ordered the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to use a transparent mechanism to select office bearers through the election, but the SLMC is ignoring the order. The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will complain about the issue to the President, GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said.
According to Dr. Herath, the SLMC is not conducting the election of office bearers and functioning without transparency. The SLMC Central Committee rejected the allegation. The request for a transparent election will be forwarded to the Health Minister.
GMOA Media Secretary Dr. Navin de Soysa said as a policy, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake agreed to the proposals made by the GMOA during a discussion held on October 26. The GMOA hopes that the minister will include the proposals in the next budget.
The GMOA pointed out the importance of increasing salaries according to the National Policy. A policy should be formulated in connection with allowances and salary increments for public servants, he said.
