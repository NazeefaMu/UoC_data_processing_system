Test and one-day cricket - SLC must strike a fine balance

In this age where money rules over everything and can be a distraction Sri Lanka Cricket as a responsible controlling body for cricket in this country must closely monitor the progress of its cricketers especially the young ones who have broken into the international circuit.
Sri Lanka Cricket must clearly look at which way it wants the cricket to go whether the shortest form of the game Twenty20 cricket is more important than Test cricket.
Sad to say that Sri Lanka despite having fought so hard to obtain Test status are today nowhere near to being a force in Test cricket. To be more frank they never were in their 34 years of their chequered Test career.
We may have produced great batsmen and bowlers in Test matches but never a team that continued to dominate Test cricket the way Australia, West Indies, England, South Africa and India have.
There was a time when Muthiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas were in their prime that Sri Lanka proved unbeatable at home but even that assurance has diminished over the years so that visiting sides of the recent past have found no difficulty in coming to Sri Lanka and winning a Test series.
To win a Test match it is not only the batsmen’s job to put runs on the board but there has to be bowlers who can get you 20 wickets. It is in this area where Sri Lanka has struggled since Muralitharan and Vaas left the international scene.
Where the SLC have failed is to strike a balance between Test cricket and one-day cricket (ie 50 overs and 20 overs). In the need and greed for greater financial gains they have foregone Test matches for one-day cricket and the result of taking such imprudent decisions is reflected in our current Test rankings where Sri Lanka are lying a lowly seventh ahead of only West Indies, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.
Since the ICC rankings came into being in 2003 or even before that we have never achieved top one-two position and we never will unless we change our attitude towards Test cricket. The longer format hardly attracts the spectators in this part of the world as 50-over and 20-over cricket. That is quite understandable because it is only in the two shortest formats that we have emerged world champions – 1996 in 50 overs and 2014 in 20 overs.
Succeeding cricket administrators over the years have failed to see Test cricket as a money-spinner and opted more for the two shorter versions which has had a detrimental effect on our image as a Test nation. Even the spectators are geared towards coming to watch a T20 or fifty-over international than spend five days at a Test match. It seems that Sri Lanka does not have a Test cricket culture but one that is more heavily weighted towards the shorter formats, which is a sad reflection when one finds how competitively Test matches are played in countries like England, Australia, South Africa and quite recently in New Zealand. These countries too have T20 and fifty over cricket in their domestic and international structure but they have struck a fine balance between them and Test cricket so that the latter gets top priority over the other two. Sadly that is lacking in Sri Lanka for things have worked out in the reverse.
After quite a while we have unearthed two good bowlers who could win Test matches for us in the future – Dushmantha Chameera and Jeffrey Vandersay but what are they doing playing in the T20 format? Exposing them to this type of cricket at this young age is only going to destroy their careers as future Test cricketers. These bowlers should be nurtured and retained to play only Test and possibly fifty-over cricket not exposed into the negativity of bowling in T20 cricket and their young minds poisoned with earning fast megabucks.
The national selectors look at it from a different perspective altogether. They are of the view that present day generation cricketers need to adapt to the current formats of cricket and that 16 cricketers from Sri Lanka having been listed for the upcoming 2016 IPL auction is proof that their talents and performances have been recognized internationally. They also bemoan the fact that they have only limited resources to select national teams from and thus, they have no other option but to select certain players to play in all three formats.
This is where the SLC has to step in and decide who should be and who should not be playing in the IPL or T20 cricket. Constant exposure to cricket has left Sri Lanka with an incoherent bowling attack or batting line up when the more important Test matches are played. As a result the performances suffer as Sri Lanka are not at full strength and it has been happening with alarming regularity. Without the exposure of IPL cricket Sri Lankan bowlers are still finding it hard to keep themselves injury free to play a full series of Test matches.
These are important points for the newly elected SLC committee to deeply ponder and make constructive decisions so that Test cricket stays vibrant and alive in this country and not follow the path that West Indies cricket has taken.
