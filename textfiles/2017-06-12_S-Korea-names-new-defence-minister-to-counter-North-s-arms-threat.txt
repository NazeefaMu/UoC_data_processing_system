REUTERS, 11th JUNE, 2017-South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in on Sunday nominated a former navy chief as his defence minister, the president’s office said, as the government faces challenges tackling North Korea’s rapidly developing weapons program.


The nominee, Song Young-moo, was well suited to deal with North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat, the presidential Blue House office said.


Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the mainland United States. The North test-launched a new type of its cruise anti-ship missiles on Thursday, its fourth missile test since the South’s Moon took office on May 10, pledging to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang.


Song, who served in the navy for more than three decades, was Moon’s main security adviser during his presidential campaign, reprising his role in Moon’s 2012 presidential campaign. A decorated veteran, Song took part in a 2009 skirmish between North and South Korean naval vessels off the western coast of the Korean peninsula.


Song’s appointment does not need parliament’s approval, but he must attend a hearing and answer questions from lawmakers.
