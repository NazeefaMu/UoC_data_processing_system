SAITM struggle will continue with or without GMOA: IUSF


	

Although the GMOA appeared to have settled their differences with the Health Minister on the SAITM issue, the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) said today it would continue the SAITM struggle regardless of the GMOA backing out.

IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said the GMOA can have its own opinion over the SAITM struggle irrespective of the IUSF’s opinion.

“We will appreciate it if the GMOA continued to stay with us, but we do not have any grudge now that they have opted out of the struggle. The student movement has no reason to trust either Rajitha or the Government, though the GMOA has done so,” he said.

Mr. Weerasekara said any ally could breakaway from the alliance and the tempo of the fight could change by such moves.

“We no longer believe that discussions with the authorities will help in resolving the matter,” he said and added that the IUSF would continue its struggle and had no faith in discussions. “We will support any ally in any justifiable struggle but if anyone betrayed the struggle they will have to bear the results as well," he said.
