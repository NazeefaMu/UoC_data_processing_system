Thursdays with AFA

The premise behind ‘Thursdays with AFA’ is to create a friendly and healthy environment for artists in Sri Lanka to perform and grow their talents in a relaxed and encouraging atmosphere. The informal setting is the perfect opportunity for the less assertive artist to hone their skills and cultivate confidence in front of an intimate and welcoming audience. The event is also a good occasion to network and meet other artists for a collaborative project
Thursdays with AFA is an event held every other week by the Academy of Fine Arts. The Academy provides the space free of charge to the artists, and opens the ensuing event up to the public to create stress-free entertainment with a tranquil ambience. Open to the public from 7.30 to 9.30 pm, it’s the perfect pit-stop to unwind and avoid rush hour traffic after a hard day’s work.
The premise behind ‘Thursdays with AFA’ is to create a friendly and healthy environment for artists in Sri Lanka to perform and grow their talents in a relaxed and encouraging atmosphere. The informal setting is the perfect opportunity for the less assertive artist to hone their skills and cultivate confidence in front of an intimate and welcoming audience. The event is also a good occasion to network and meet other artists for a collaborative project.
The event was launched on September 24, and the opening act was a soulful original song by Kirk Michael, an acoustic guitarist and singer. He followed this act with a catchy rendition of Walking on the Moon (originally by Police) with an experimental and rewarding reggae twist. Kirk was followed by a walk-in artist, rapper Abadi, who decided to do a few impromptu raps to fill in a time slot. The third act for the evening was the young artist, Lara Modder, enlivening the evening with her performance of Pumped Up Kicks (by Foster the People), Radioactive (by Coldplay), and Drops of Jupiter (by Train). After ending her planned-performance, Lara bravely took requests from the audience including an impressive rendition of Zombie by the Cranberries. The evening quickly dissolved into magic and mayhem with a happy mix of collaborations between the artists and sing-alongs by the audience.
This was exactly the atmosphere that the Academy of Fine Arts was striving for. The Managing Director of AFA, Shyamala Pinto-Jayawardena said, “An Artist needs the right atmosphere, an inspirational space to think and grow with self-confidence, and an abundance of encouragement. AFA will always aim to provide a creative space for artists from various walks of life to blossom”.
The free event on alternate Thursdays is a deliberate move by the Academy to give young creatives free use of the Academy space to encourage the arts be it for musical, dance, stand up comedy, poetry readings, skits, or just about any form of creative Art! The Academy provides the cosy space for various forms of art with the aim of creating a platform to support and promote amateur artists, and a hub for like-minded people to mingle, and find inspiration.
If you would like to use the AFA open mic space to perform, hold a workshop, practice or just jam, contact the Academy on [email protected] or 077 920 8445.
