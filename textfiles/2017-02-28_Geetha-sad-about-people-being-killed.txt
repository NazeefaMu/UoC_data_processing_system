Galle District Joint Opposition (JO) MP Geetha Kumarasinghe said today it was disheartening to see people being killed by underworld figures in the broad daylight.

She expressed these at a news conference organised by the JO Women Representatives over the upcoming World Women’s Day and Government’s negligence over the issues of women.

MP Kumarasinghe said that JO women political leaders would conduct a protest against several issues, which had occurred due to the failures of the Government.

Meanwhile, JO MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi said that they would hold a protest march on the International Women’s Day near the Lipton Roundabout in Colombo.

She said that women in the country had been oppressed due to the social and economical failures of the current Government.

“Women in the country had been oppressed with several social and economical issues and the current Government is responsible for these issues,” she said. (Yoshitha Perera)\
