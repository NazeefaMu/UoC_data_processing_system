Ready to accept any MP who quits government: Wimal


	

We are ready to accept any MP who would leave the Government, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said today.

He expressed these views to the media after concluding a discussion held with the 16 SLFP MPs who left the government recently at NFF Head Office today.

“We have negotiated with the 16 SLFP group as to what ways we can strengthen the opposition. We need a strong majority of MPs to the opposition to defeat the 20th amendment to the Constitution and other proposals which are adverse to the future of the country,” Weerawansa said.

“We are open to any MP who wishes to join us in the move to weaken the coalition government. We have observed that we are already having the required amount of MPs to form the majority in Parliament. But if anybody wishes to join us, he is mostly welcome,” Weerawansa said.

Meanwhile, he said they were also working to make former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Leader of the Opposition. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
