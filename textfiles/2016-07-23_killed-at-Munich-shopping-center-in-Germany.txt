At least nine people were killed and 21 others hurt Friday in a shooting rampage at a busy shopping district in Munich, Germany, police said.

Police searched for attackers, thinking there might be three, and found a man who'd killed himself on a side street near Olympia shopping mall, police Chief Hubertus Andrae said.

Based on surveillance video and witness statements, police concluded he was the sole gunman, Andrae said.

The unidentified attacker was an 18-year-old German-Iranian who had lived in Munich for more than two years.

The man was not known to police and his motives are unclear, authorities said. No group has claimed responsibility.

Many children were among the casualties. Police said 16 people remain hospitalized.
The shooting comes as recent terror attacks have put Europe on high alert.

This week, a teenager who said he was inspired by ISIS stabbed passengers on a German train before police shot him dead. Only eight days earlier, 84 people were killed when a man drove a large truck through a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, France.(CNN)
