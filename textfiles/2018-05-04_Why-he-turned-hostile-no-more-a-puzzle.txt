This pro-left university academic with close ties to Pohottuwa has suddenly become a virulent critic of the 16-member group which crossed over to the opposition to the puzzlement of his political associates, they say.

 


By the way, sources close to this academic who is known to be a strong advocate of nationalist causes say that he has already indicated his wish to be the chief organizer of a certain electorate as a prelude to winning a seat in the Diyawanna council at the next general polls. 


Meanwhile, some inquisitive ones who have made discreet inquiries say that they have stumbled on the real reason why the academic has suddenly developed an unaccountable malice towards the 16 – member group. It is nothing but his fear that if this group joins forces with the JO, he would lose the chance of getting the chief organizer post he has been eyeing for some time, they claim.
