Channa de Silva was welcomed as the new Chairman on 10th October 2016 (subject to approval from Central Bank of Sri Lanka) at a simple but graceful occasion held at the company’s head office. The ceremony was graced by the Founder/President of Sarvodaya Movement, Dr. A. T Ariyaratne, corporate management and staff.

Guided by the social philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi and the spiritual teachings of Buddhism, Sarvodaya, founded by Dr. A T Ariyaratne, is currently the oldest non-governmental organisation in Sri Lanka. De Silva too is committed to these principles and will ensure that these values remain at the core of the company’s future plans. The new vision articulated for the future growth of the company is steered by its commitment “To be a catalyst in creating an economically progressive society, living in dignity”. 
The retiring Chairman Narangoda, who turns 70, made a significant contribution to the company’s strategic transformation, implementing the strategic business and corporate plans and policies to restructure the company as Sarvodaya Development Finance.
