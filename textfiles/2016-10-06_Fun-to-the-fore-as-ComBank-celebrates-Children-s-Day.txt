More than 3,500 children and parents celebrated the World Children’s Day at the Sri Lanka Rupavahini (SLRC) premises on October 1 at a fun-filled event sponsored by Commercial Bank.
Organised under the banner of ‘Arunalu’ – the bank’s flagship children’s savings account, this was the fifth occasion that Sri Lanka’s largest private bank supported an event of this nature to engage with children and adults on a day universally dedicated to children.
Large numbers of children participated in games such as wall climbing and archery and special Arunalu sponsored activities at this event, to win Arunalu-branded school bags, umbrellas, caps and pouches, while their mothers were provided an opportunity to join in the fun and win attractive gifts from ‘Anagi’ – Commercial Bank’s exclusive savings account for women.
Offering an interest rate of 6.5 percent per annum, Arunalu is considered the best children’s savings account in Sri Lanka. The Arunalu account has established the largest cash prize scheme in the country for Grade Five students with a three-tiered scholarship scheme that rewards students placed first, second or third at the national, district or school levels at the Grade Five scholarship examination.
