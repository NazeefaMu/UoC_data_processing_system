Battle between antibiotics and acne superbugs

Art student Jenny Pearson believes there can be few treatments for acne that she has not tried.
Jenny, 25, has taken almost every antibiotic available to reduce the symptoms of severe acne, which first began when she was 14.
Yet nothing has worked, and her skin remains so bad it affects her social life and confidence.
‘It feels like everyone is looking at me,’ she says. ‘Acne is soul-destroying, and no one understands how much it controls your life until you experience it.'
Acne is caused by an overproduction of sebum (or grease) in the skin, which blocks microscopic hair follicles. This, in turn, provides the perfect breeding ground for propionibacteria: the bugs that cause the characteristic white heads, black heads and red cysts.
Antibiotics have been a mainstay treatment of acne for decades and work by killing the propionibacteria.
The problem is they are rapidly losing their curative powers because the bacteria are becoming resistant to them.
According to a recent study by Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust, four out of five sufferers could have acne that is resistant to commonly given antibiotics, such as erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline.
People using antibiotics for too short a course is thought to be to blame, but also treatments that continue for longer periods, regardless of whether they work or not.
One study in the journal Clinical Therapy, in 2002, showed that antibiotic-resistant strains of propionibacteria can emerge after only eight weeks of antibiotic therapy.
They become resistant because not all bacteria may be killed immediately, and random mutations occur that mean the bacteria are protected from the drug onslaught.
Doctors are leaving patients with severe acne on antibiotics for an average of 11 months, according to research in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
‘It is clear that long-term over-prescribing of antibiotics allows bugs to build up resistance in some cases,’ says Professor Nick Lowe, a consultant dermatologist and medical director of the Cranley Clinic in London.
‘A teenage male was referred to me recently with severe acne, and he had been trying different antibiotics for more than a year which weren't working,’ he says. ‘It's a trend that's developed over the past 15 years.'
Jenny suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that affects the way women's ovaries work and leads to higher than usual levels of male hormones called androgens.
This hormonal imbalance can lead to an over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands, leading to more greasy skin and higher acne risk.
Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist in Brighton, says antibiotics can keep severe acne at bay in women with PCOS but does not get to the root of the problem. ‘Hormonal imbalance can often be corrected by the contraceptive pill,’ he adds.
Yet Jenny has been given only two choices by her dermatologist - try yet another antibiotic, or a powerful drug called Roaccutane. The latter can be prescribed only under the supervision of a consultant dermatologist because it can cause damage to babies in the womb and is associated with serious side-effects, such as mood disorders.
Jenny says: ‘I feel I am running out of options. Antibiotics haven't worked and the alternatives could have a knock-on effect on my health.'
Antibiotics should be used only for moderate to severe acne, for no longer than 90 days, says Professor Lowe. ‘Some people may need to take them for longer but this is rare,’ he adds.
Latest government figures show that 43 million antibiotic prescriptions were written in England in 2012, up 5.4 per cent on the previous year. ‘Antibiotics often become ineffective after three to six months of use and can allow the bacteria to become resistant, so over-prescribing of antibiotics is an issue,’ says Dr Shergill.
Acne is very common - it is estimated that 80 per cent of teenagers suffer from it at some stage, but it can affect adults, too.
The first cases of antibiotic resistant acne were documented by researchers in 1979, and since then propionibacteria has developed resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline.
Newly diagnosed patients may find that the drugs simply don't work from the outset, or they may work only for a short period of time. In the worst cases, oral antibiotics may have to be abandoned so those affected have to rely on less-effective antiseptic creams or washes.
Professor Lowe says there are other options if the antibiotics stop working. For example, PCOS sufferers can take a pill called spironolactone, which has no effect on propionibacteria but it helps slow down sebum production.
Another option is Isotrex, the gelform of Roaccutane, which works by encouraging regulating skin cell growth. It can cause irritation, redness and increased sensitivity to sunlight, but does not lead to mood disorders. Pregnant women should avoid it in case it leads to birth defects.
Laser and light treatments can also help reduce the appearance of skin lesions. They penetrate the skin and kill bacteria.
However, Dr Neill Hepburn, a consultant dermatologist and a British Skin Foundation spokesperson, says antibiotics still have an important role in clearing up infected cysts, but he would like to see shorter treatment periods and says alternatives should be tried whenever possible.
