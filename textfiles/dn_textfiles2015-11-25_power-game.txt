The power game!

A three day visit by Special US envoy Samantha Power concluded on Monday, after a final meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Power’s meeting with Prime Minister touched on a number of issues, focusing on commission of inquiry in to war crimes proposed by the recent UN resolution and the judicial mechanism to be implemented.
Four other key ministers, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement, D. M Swaminathan and Minister of City Planning and Water Supply Rauff Hakeem, also participated in the meeting.
The meeting was “fairly good”, a minister who participated claimed. The US envoy was also told of the 19th amendment and government’s efforts to release and rehabilitate political prisoners. “We said that we are doing whatever possible to release prisoners and rehabilitate them”, the minister said.
Prior to this final meeting Power, a Journalist turned diplomat and the US Representative to United Nations did a tour of the North and held separate meetings with Northern Province chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran and a group of TNA members led by Opposition Leader R. Sambanthan. Both Wigneswaran and Sambanthan exploited this opportunity to urge the United States to influence the government to address a number of issues faced by the people of the North.
Among them, the issue of political prisoners and heightened military presence featured prominently. Perhaps it was Wigneswaran’s comments on lackluster attitude towards development and claim that some fractions in South is blocking the flow of investments to North that prompted Power to state that “there is an inherited legacy of neglect” in the North. Wigneswaran also requested Power to tell the government to reallocate funds assigned for defense in the 2016 budget to development activities in the North.

In an interview with Daily News Power said that the concerns raised by Wigneswaran regarding continued militarization, delays in releasing lands for civilian resettlement and economic activities will continue be concerns for the US as well.
Sampanthan too echoed Wigneswaran’s claims and urged US and UN to influence Sri Lankan government to fully implement the US sponsored UNHRC resolution adopted in Geneva this year. The resolution was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and many other countries as well. Sampanthan also wanted the US help in arriving at a long term solution for the rift between the North and the south.
The high ranking diplomat stressed that the US would remain “vigilant and cautious” and monitor the situation at the ground level. However she said “Our tone is positive as much has changed here” and emphasized that the country has an opportunity for peace and prosperity.
Power is the second high ranking US official to visit the country after January 8 elections. She follows US Secretary of State John Kerry, who visited in May this year, followed by a combined visit by Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Tom Malinowski in August and Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues Catherine Russel in October.
The steady line of high profile US visitors to Sri Lanka is stirring the South, skeptical of the obvious western influence on the new government. Questions are now being raised if these are goodwill visits as portrayed by the government or if the US is in-fact on monitoring missions disguised as friendly calls. Added to these concerns the delisting of some of the suspected LTTE fund organizations and individuals and the release of a number of individuals held in remand custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act is giving rise to uneasy feelings among Southerners which is also paving the way for hardliners to exploit the situation. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed that the visit was yet another attempt by the US to introduce federalism in the country. The opposition is obviously irked by the parading US diplomats who arrive in the country time and again.
Most of the opposition politicians who profess of an indigenous mechanism to probe the alleged war crimes oppose any foreign element included in it. It is difficult to fathom the ground situation as far as these matters are concerned and there could be people centric agitations in the country whipped up by the opposition if they feel that there appears to be international interference in domestic matters. Hence it is important that the government move cautiously in sensitive areas such as this. The international community should help and allow time and space for the government in power to resolve residual matters meticulously taking into consideration other political factors on ground.
Evidence not rumours stands to reason in court
While discussions and deliberations are under way to establish a special judicial mechanism to facilitate the commission of inquiry proposed in the Geneva resolution, for the first time in the judicial history in Sri Lanka a sitting Supreme Court judge, Justice Sarath De Abrew was indicted by the Attorney General on grave sexual abuse charges. Justice De Abrew is currently released on bail. He was released after he surrendered to Mt-Lavinia police in July, following a complaint lodged by his domestic aid on assault and sexual abuse. The Attorney General’s department finalized the indictment after a thorough examination of the facts and sifting through the evidence available. The indictment to a certain degree negated criticism against the Attorney General’s department for inaction and procrastination. It was the position resolutely taken by the Attorney General that he could not depend on hearsay or fabricated stories as evidence.
In this backdrop Attorney General Yuvanjana Wijayatilake last week utilized a very unlikely resource to give send out a strong reply to his critics. AG has been under severe criticism both by politicians and civil society groups alike for his apparent lethargic attitude on taking action against corruption charges filed against former ministers. Some even called for his resignation after his opinion in the Avant Garde case figured in parliament, accusing that his impartiality has been bought over. Delivering the Henry Steel Octott lecture last Saturday the Attorney General sent out a strong message to his critics. His department’s decisions are based on evidence not on popular belief.
Drawing parallels between law of Evidence and Dhamma, AG said “Just as much as the law of Evidence requires law and judicial officers to take into account the judicial process, cogent evidence which appeals to reason and conscienceless not faith, rumor or popular belief” – a strong message in light of the current discourse especially in connection to the Avant Garde case.
Replying to criticism leveled against AG’s opinion explaining lack of evidence to proceed on corruption charges against politicians of the previous regime, he highlighted the need for the prosecution “to establish a case beyond reasonable doubt the essential ingredients of an offence”. AG Wijetilake highlights that to initiate or maintain a prosecution in the absence of such evidence “would be against a fundamental rule of law and indeed principle of justice.”
Budget: Crouching Bull hidden dragon
However more than anything the focus of the people these days are on the ‘revolutionary’ budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake the debate of course commenced with a heated argument mixing up of documents related to the budget proposals. On Monday MPs found a fresh copy of the budget speech and annexed tables on their tables. MPs who came geared for the debate after combing through the documents provided on Friday’s reading worried that there was additional information which were not made available to them at the time of the Budget speech. Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena raised the issue at commencement, followed by several other MPs who recorded their protests. House was adjourned for ten minutes, and after Speaker Karu Jayasuriya met with the party leaders to discuss the issue the matter was sorted out. It turns out several pages containing tables and graphs were missing from the Sinhala print, instead of giving only those pages the whole speech was reprinted and distributed creating confusion among the MPs.
On the outlook the budget appears to be welfare oriented. The budget has been hailed as a development focused one targeting big time investors and boosting exports. Colombo Stock exchange too reacted positively to the 20016 budget. Minister Karunanayake proposed Tax reductions on 11 essential items, gas prices have come down, and allocations for education and health services have gone up. However all is not well. Education allocation was calculated taking into account values of capital assets such as buildings, a method of calculation employed by the new world, Minister of Megapolis Champika Ranawaka told Parliament. Gammanpila however was not convinced, he publicly requested his former political buddy now opponent to name one country where such methods have been employed.
Many in the opposition called out on the minister’s attempt to tax the poor man. Apart from the obvious fee hikes for emission test for vehicles and the additional tax piled on vehicle imports, the budget has increased a number of taxes affecting general public. Utility bills of majority households will shoot up as Nation Building Tax doubles with the budget, while Ports and Airports development Levy (PAL) has increased from 5 percent to 7.5 percent, with the exemption of building machineries used for construction, dairy and agricultural industries. This will significantly increase the prices of all commodities imported to the country.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti was severely critical of the proposal, claiming for a tax relief of Rs.3000 million the government is earning a tax revenue of Rs. 9000 million on Nation Building tax alone. From PAL the government is poised for approximate gain of close to Rs. 20000, he claims.
While relief has been given to both Tea and rubber sectors, coconut plantations have been ignored. A welcome two year tax relief has been granted to Tea and Rubber industries, which are facing worst market conditions in the history of the entire plantation sector. Instead of exploring avenues to boost coconut production which Minister Kanrunanayake claims to have dropped over the years, He proposed to import Coconuts to develop value added products targeting export market. This he claims would address the coconut shortage in the market providing for value addition industry. He has also proposed an allocation of Rs. 250 million for a re- plantation programme.
Fertilizer Vouchers
The government also seems to love voucher systems. A few weeks ago Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasm introduced a voucher system for free school uniform materials. Teacher unions are up in arms against the move, but the ministry is going ahead with the plans disregarding warnings of how the system can open a whole new avenue of malpractices, where some even fear the uniform vouchers will be sold for money. A concept not all that new for the country, it was such corruption that leads to revamping of fuel subsidy voucher system given to fishermen by the previous government.The budget introduced yet another voucher; fertilizer voucher for the farmers.
A cash voucher will be issued to farmers to buy fertilizer for the whole year. Serious concerns whether the fertilizer stocks will be available in the market to meet the demand and if the value of the voucher given would be sufficient to buy the entire quantity of fertilizer needed for the farmers have been raised. To a question posed to the Finance Minister if the minister gives assurance that farmers can buy their entire fertilizer requirement with the proposed voucher a perturbed minister replied that he has never been a farmer so he has no experience. He can only make decisions based on what government officers’ recommendations on the issue, shrewdly distancing himself from the issue while leaving the government officers to take the blame if the plan goes belly up.
Dissident group gives an ultimatum
Following the budget presentations number of SLFP heavy weights in opposition were making hasty plans to oppose the budget, only to be doused by the President Maithripala Sirisena. A quick meeting between the President and SLFP parliamentary group on Monday night assured that all members would vote in favour of the budget. Issuing a statement SLFP General Secretary said that SLFP will be voting for the budget 2016, a decision taken by the party central committee, which all members will have to comply with. However not all SLFP members were happy. SLFP opposition group MP Kumara Welgama requested for a separate meeting on Tuesday morning, between the President and the 49 SLFP members in the opposition (Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists) as they were strongly against the budget proposals presented by the Karunanayake. Welgama also claims that they were informed their vehicle entitlements would be axed and the proposed funds for village development will be with held if the MPs do not vote in favour of the budget.
President Sirisena was able to negotiate a settlement with the SLFP rebel group on Tuesday Morning before he left for the Commonwealth heads of States Meeting in Malta. He promised to ensure an open debate between Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the SLFP opposition MPs to help iron out points of disagreements in the budget.
“If they are able to amend the budget and fix the issues we point out following the debate, then we can vote in favour of the budget” claimed Dallas Alahaperuma. If not the group plans to bring in a no confidence motion against the Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. If the group follows through the plans, this would be the second time such action is initiated against Karunanayake. In July this year a signed motioned was submitted by the opposition only to be negated by the dissolution of Parliament. Whether the second No Confidence Motion, proposed by Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists gains momentum remains to be seen.
