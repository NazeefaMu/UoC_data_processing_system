The dark side of Rajapaksa politics will be revealed in front of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said yesterday.

Denying allegations made by the parliamentarian that Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka had hidden Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera, the party stated that Gamampila was engaged in a mudslinging campaign.   

JHU Media Coordinator Anuruddha Karnasooriya explained that the MP who now threatened to expose party secrets played a crucial role in pushing the party to withdraw from the Rajapakse government.

 “It is hilarious that the individual who wanted the JHU to withdraw from the Rajapaksa government became the Rajapaksa’s defender. Gammanpila’s challenge is a great opportunity for us to prove the dark side of the PHU’s political agenda,” he said.

Meanwhile, Karnasooriya also said that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was carrying out an organized mudslinging campaign using leftists and several print and electronic media in a bid to prove the allegations they have made. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
