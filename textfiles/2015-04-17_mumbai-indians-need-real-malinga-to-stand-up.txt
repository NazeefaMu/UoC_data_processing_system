Mumbai Indians need real Malinga to stand up


	

One of the major reasons why Mumbai Indians have started their IPL campaign on a poor note is due to Lasith Malinga's steep decline in form, India’s Zee news agency said.
In 2014, Mumbai lost five matches on the trot and this year is no different for them as they have lost three consecutive matches against Kolkata Knight Riders, Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals respectively.
Malinga, who is the highest wicket taker in the IPL, has picked just three wickets so far. In the previous match against Rajasthan Royals, he was expected to show his mettle in the death overs but was thrashed by Steven Smith all over the park. The slinger ended up conceding 41 runs from 4 overs.
Malinga underwent surgery on a troubled left ankle last year in September, and missed Sri Lanka's one-dayers in India and England after that. He wasn't at his best in the ICC World Cup as well.
Mumbai's resurgence last season was a result of back-to-back formidable knocks played by Lendl Simmons, who helped the Rohit Sharma-led team reach the playoffs.
But in order to come back on track this season, they need Malinga to be at his best in the remaining matches.
