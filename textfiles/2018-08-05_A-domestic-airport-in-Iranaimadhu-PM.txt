Iranaimadhu Airfield in the Kilinochchi District would be developed into a Domestic Airport as a part of the plan drawn by the Government to develop all areas from Point Pedro to Dondra, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said during the weekend.

He said this at the opening of several buildings belonging to the Faculties of the Jaffna University in Kilinochchi on Saturday.

“Developing the Iranaimadhu Domestic Airport and the Kankesanthurai Port is among the main focus of the Government when it comes to the development of the North,” the Prime Minister said.

He said an industrial zone would also be set up in Kankesanthurai and lands would be allocated for it soon.

He said plans were afoot to construct the Mannar-Vavuniya-Trincomalee Road.

The Prime Minister reiterated that coconut would be planted in the North and in the East as many trees would have to be felled in Gampaha and Kurunegala Districts.

“The Government will also look at the industrial development in the North,” he added.

Premier Wickremesinghe said the Government would also look at developing the Education Sector in the North.

“There is a University in Jaffna which is of high standards before the conflict. We hope to bring this high standard back,” he said.

Minister of Higher Education Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said his Ministry was also making a special focus to develop higher education in the North, just like the other areas.

He said the Government will also focus on providing hostel facilities to the University of Jaffna. (Yohan Perera and Sithum Chathuranga)
