The Meteorology Department today warned navel and fishing communities to be vigilant because of the possibility of sudden roughness of the sea associated with sudden increase of wind speed up to 70-80kmph.

Issuing a warning at 12.30 p.m. today for the next 24 hours, the department said the deep and shallow sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Trincomalee via Galle, Hambantota and Batticaloa could be rough due to the active cloudiness associated with a low level disturbance in the Bay of Bengal which is in the east of Sri Lanka.

“Heavy showers can also be expected in these sea areas,” it said.
