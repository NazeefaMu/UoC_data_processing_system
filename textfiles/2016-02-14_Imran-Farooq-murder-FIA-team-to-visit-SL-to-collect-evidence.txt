The Pakistan Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Akbar Hoti on Saturday allowed the investigation team to visit the United Kingdom (UK) and Sri Lanka to collect evidence for the murder of British-Pakistani politician Imran Farooq.


Imran Farooq, the founding member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), was murdered in Edgware, northwest London in September 2010. He had claimed asylum in Britain in 1999 as he was wanted in Pakistan in many cases of torture and murder.


Three accused, including Khalid Shamim, Moazzam Ali and Kashif Khan Kamran are currently on judicial remand at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. According to sources, Khalid Shamim and Mohsin Ali had already recorded their confessional statements, while Moazzam Ali - who is said to be the prime suspect - was unwilling to do so.


Mohsin, in his statement, stated that Moazzam had handled their travel documents to visit the UK. He said they had monitored the movements and activities of Dr Farooq in London to know about his routine. On the day of the murder, he grabbed Dr Farooq while Kashif stabbed him and then bludgeoned him with a brick, he said. (Daily Times)
