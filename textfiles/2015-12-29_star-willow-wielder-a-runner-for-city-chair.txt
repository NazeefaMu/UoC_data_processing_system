Star willow wielder, a runner for city chair?


	


The big chair of the city is about to fall vacant and the battle for it has already begun.
Among the main characters tipped to enter the fray are the incumbent Muzza, the chair of another council and a former fair Diyawanna member.
The name of a member of a very high family is also being mentioned in certain circles, they say.
However, the latest name being bandied about is of a gentlemen’s game super-star, who went on retirement recently.
The super star no longer in the firmament has now thrown himself into community welfare activity and it’s a cinch that he could be the next occupant of the big chair if he decides to make a try for it, they say.
