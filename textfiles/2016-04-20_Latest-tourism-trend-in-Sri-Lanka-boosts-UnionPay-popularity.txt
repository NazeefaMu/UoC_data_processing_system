UnionPay International is partnering with Sri Lankan businesses to help them attract valuable new customers.
Leading the international travel spending, Chinese tourists spent US $ 215 billion abroad last year, a 53 percent rise from 2014, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. In Sri Lanka, China has taken the number one spot among the most number of tourist arrivals. Statistics released from the country’s tourism promotion bureau revealed that the number of Chinese tourists rose 17.4 percent to 32,186 in February compared to the 26,083 in January.
“Sri Lankan tourism industry has a strong growth momentum,” UnionPay International Head of South Asia Derek Chang said. “Our goal is to contribute in such development through cooperation with businesses in the industry and share our rich market resources to maximize the partnership potential.”
From major players (e.g. SriLankan Airlines) to local hotels and restaurants, more and more Sri Lankan businesses are partnering with UnionPay International to drive incremental revenues. 
“What the Sri Lankan businesses are asking for is not just another payment brand. They want another revenue stream by tapping into the emerging tourism opportunities in Sri Lanka.”
“Now, UnionPay card is not only the most commonly used payment tool by Chinese outbound tourists but also a preferred payment option of an increasing number of global consumers,” Derek said.
“With five billion UnionPay cards issued globally, we are committed to help Sri Lankan businesses to attract our global cardholders and turn them into new customers.”
