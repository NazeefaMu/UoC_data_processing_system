Indian Presidential voting begins: Ram Nath Kovind set for easy win


	

Ram Nath Kovind is set for an easy win in today's election for the next President of India versus Meira Kumar, with the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance confident that the former Bihar Governor will get about 70 per cent of the vote.

Former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar has been fielded by the opposition, which has pitched the contest as a battle of ideologies.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was among the first to vote in Parliament this morning, has congratulated Mr Kovind in advance and has said that "the presidential poll this time is historic.

Probably for the first time no party made any undignified or unwarranted comment on the rival candidate." (NDTV)
