The Government will implement the Enforced Disappearance Bill soon, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday at an election rally in Vavuniya.

“The government has already got the Enforced Disappearance Bill approved and is now ready to implement it,” he said. “The Government is fully aware that justice has to be meted out to people in the North. We are also ready to empower the widows in the North who need help. We are also aware that the youth in the North wants employment and the government has a plan to fulfil that expectation."

Mr. Wickremesinghe who elaborated on the government's economic development plans for the North said a highway network would be constructed in the North. He said a highway will be constructed from Kandy to Trincomalee. He said a Singaporean company had consented to develop the Trincomalee Port.

“Areas around Trincomalee including Vavuniya will also be developed as a result of the development that will take place in Trincomalee. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka will be in charge of the development work in Trincomalee. Minister Rishard Bathiudeen will be in charge of the development work in Wanni while Minister D.M. Swaminathan will be in charge of the development work in the North. An industrial zone will also be set up in Mankulum,” the Prime Minister said.

Minister Bathiudeen said the government-led by the UNP would do its utmost to develop villages through local bodies. (Yohan Perera, Priyantha Hewage and Sithum Chathuranga)
