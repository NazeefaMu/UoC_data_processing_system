Reading Macbeth – The Riddles of The Witches

Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's shortest plays. There is no sub-plot. Shakespeare has constructed it with great structural economy even without introducing the main characters. Shakespeare wrote Macbeth during the last quarter of his writing career.
He probably wrote it in 1606 and it comes amid other tragedies including King Lear, and Anthony and Cleopatra after Hamlet and Othello and before Coriolanus, the last of his tragedies before he moves to the romantics (Smith, 2013).
The year 1606 was a turbulent one in early modern England with James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth I on the English throne. Shakespeare became the chief dramatist of the king. Shakespeare turned his attention on royal interests. Macbeth in one sense is a regicide play like Richard II (1595) and Julius Caesar (1599) though the contexts are different.
Macbeth also contains a story of deposition like in As You Like It, The Tempest and Hamlet. Shakespeare analyses the mind of a political assassin in Macbeth. In Hamlet, he scrutinises Hamlet's revenging ego. But in Macbeth Shakespeare deals squarely with Macbeth's burning ambition.
The greatest weakness of Macbeth was that he failed to understand the metaphorical language used by The Witches. This caused his downfall. He completely misjudged their prophecies. What their poetic language articulated and connoted, Macbeth misunderstood whereas Lady Macbeth seriously pondered.
Act 1 Scene 1 presents the three Witches in an open place in a thunder storm on the moorland before sunset. It is in Scene 3 that the witches encounter Macbeth and Banquo who were on their way home after their war victory.
While reading the text the readers are often attracted to the poetic language used by The Witches:
“When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightening or in rain?
When the huryburys done,
When the battle's lost and won.” (1.1.3-4)
These syllabic, short lines in blank verse are iconic, rhythmic and packed with imagery and mystic power. The opening scene of Macbeth produces rich audio visual effects upon the audience when the witches mention about the clap of thunder, the flash of lightning and the pitter-patter of pouring rain; thus creating a stormy future atmosphere.
These Wearied Sisters (The Witches) greet Macbeth thus:
“All hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
All hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
All hail Macbeth! That shall be king hereafter.” (1.3.48-50)
In this verse there is repetition of same words (anaphora) used as a rhetorical term in the beginning of the lines.
Macbeth very well knew that he was already Thene of Glamis through inheritance caused by Sinal's death. But how could The Witches know it? His greatest astonishment was the other two prophecies of The Witches, in particular the predication of him becoming the future king. About becoming Thane of Cawdor, Macbeth was aware of the execution of Cawdor through the king's message.
But Macbeth becoming the future king too has been professed by The Witches. This prophesy too should be correct. But there is already King Duncan on the throne and Macbeth is not the legal, royal, traditional heir. This fact vexed Macbeth tremendously. Initially he left this third prophecy to be fulfilled perhaps by chance. Macbeth was perturbed, surprised and frightening over the last prediction. But he was afraid of Banquo who was with him when The Witches stated these prophesies. No doubt an Oedipus effect began to torment Macbeth's train of thoughts at the end of the first meeting with The Witches. This effect was nursed, encouraged and ignited by Lady Macbeth's strategic interventions by persuading Macbeth to commit murder. Again the power of The Witches is revealed in Act 1V Scene 1. When Macbeth arrives to consult them, The Witches were preparing a foul broth and arranging their spell. They create three apparitions in order an armed head who warns Macbeth against Macduff; a bloody child who informs him that he cannot be harmed by one ‘borne of woman’, and a crowned child carrying a tree who guarantees Macbeth's safety until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill.
As a response to Macbeth's question about Banquio's descendants, The Witches show him eight Kings ushered in by the spirit of Banquo. The Witches vanish when Lennox brings the news of Macduff's flight to England. Macbeth decides to murder every member of Macduff's family.
The Witches do not make promises. They utter riddles. Macbeth in his weakness interprets in his own ambitious interest. He is not deceived by the Witches, but by his ill-founded reliance on his own interpretation (Macrae, 1980). Shakespeare reveals that Macbeth until the end has been clinging to the prophesies of The Witches. The prophesies have been correct. But Macbeth has been misled.
