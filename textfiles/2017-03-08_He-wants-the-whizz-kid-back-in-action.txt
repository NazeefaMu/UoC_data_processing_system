He wants the whizz kid back in action


	



 

A few members of the once prestigious now defunct CCS had forayed into politics in our country from time to time. It may be news for some particularly those belonging to the younger generation that the last surviving member from that rare tribe happens to be a senior member of yahapalanaya top team. He is a holder of a doctorate too.

 


A high political authority in yahapalanaya the other day surprised this ex-mandarin by offering him the public purse portfolio which is due to fall vacant shortly, they say. 


However, the ex-mandarin was not quick to grab the offer with both hands. He replied with a sardonic smile: “I once did this job. Should I handle it again?”


On being pressed to accept the offer, the ex-bureaucrat relented and said: “Okay. If I am to accept this portfolio, please at least grant this request of mine…Please let me have that former secretary as my secretary as well!”  He mentioned the name of a onetime top bureaucrat who himself is a ‘doctor’.
Taken aback by this unexpected request, the high political authority had said: “I’ll see about it!”
