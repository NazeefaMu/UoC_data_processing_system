Utilizing Affinity Number formula for arriving at a more potent number


	



 

We presume that our readers are quite conversant with what the Birthdate Number is and the importance of harmonizing vital landmark events in their life with the Birthdate Number with a view to achieving the best possible results. 


One may find the signification of one’s Birthdate Number does not suit the effects that the Number denotes or signifies or his past experience has proved that the number is not favourable. One in such circumstances, could look for an affinity number which can be expected to produce the desired effects. 


Besides, certain numerologists say Number 1 is a number too sacred for success of worldly and material affairs. In such an eventuality, the subject can look for what is called an affinity number for use in day to day affairs for good luck. 


We have explained what Affinity Numbers are in a previous article. But we wish to recapitulate the Affinity Number concept for the convenience of readers. 


We know that there are nine Basic numbers and these nine basic Numbers are further classified under five groups on the basis of their affinity with each other as follows: 


(a) 1 and 4
(b)  2 and 7
3,6 and 9
5 
8


You may have noted (i) type comes under two groupings (a) and (b). This means No: 1 people have affinity with No: 4 dates and No: 4 people and vice versa.  Further No:  1 and 4 dates and people have affinity with No: 2 and No: 7 dates and people as well.  No: 3,6, and 9 dates and people have affinity  with each other, but affinity of No: 5 dates and people  is restricted to  only 5 dates and people and that of No: 8 people  is limited to  only No: 8 people. 


Thus the groupings of affinity numbers that No: 1 or No: 4 people can pick 2 or 7 as an alternative number for use. 


According to the numerological principle relating to harmony and vibration, No: 1 and No: 4 people should associate themselves as far as possible with the No: 2. 


If a Birthdate No: 8 person wants to get more fortunate vibrations or to avoid conflict with the No: 4 people, he can alter his Name value Number to obtain a more potent or positive number.  For example, say person  was born on the 8th, 17th or the 26 of a month, giving him 8 as the Birth Number, but still he can work out his Name value Number  to a Basic Number like 1,3,5 or 6 so that he can drop his Birth Number 8  in all transactions  and start  using the stronger  new number. A Number 4 person too can do likewise. 


Nevertheless, it must be emphasized it is the Birth Number that influences us most in our life.  In the first instance, it is inalterable, secondly, it reflects the cumulative planetary influence at birth and thirdly the mysterious law of vibration at the moment determines the note of harmony which continues to influence the natural pattern of life from the cradle to the grave.
