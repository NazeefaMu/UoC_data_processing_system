The way in which the political crisis in Sri Lanka was resolved is a testament to the strength and resilience of Sri Lanka's democratic institutions, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said.

In a letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, on his new appointment as Premier, she said the commitment of political stakeholders to the democratic process was also reflected by the way the crisis was resolved.

“I write to welcome the peaceful resolution of the political crisis in Sri Lanka and to congratulate you on the occasion of your swearing in to mark your re-installation as Prime Minister. In particular, I commend you and other political stakeholders for your steadfastness in defence and support of the rule of law and the constitutional framework,” she said.

She also said the Commonwealth remains ready to support Sri Lanka's efforts to improve political reconciliation, progress constitutional reform, and entrench the rule of law.

“I trust we will be able to progress a number of engagements which we are hoping to take forward with Sri Lanka, and very much look forward lo building on the longstanding and fruitful partnership between your country and the Commonwealth Secretariat,” she said.
