A baby is a bundle of joy for all mothers and will be loved and cherished by everyone. Nevertheless, with the onset of parenthood, some mothers are prone to go through an ordeal of stress, anxiety and exhaustion that leaves them depressed, with feelings of being let down in life. Known as a depressive disorder, Postpartum Depression is a severe form of mental illness that reflects characteristics such as low energy levels, depressive mood levels and in severe cases, even suicidal tendencies in most mothers following childbirth.   


Although not true in all cases, many mothers experience either baby blues or its severe counterpart, Postpartum Depression, which ensues a few days after delivering the baby. According to the World Health Organization, nearly ten percent of pregnant women and thirteen percent of women who have just delivered a baby experience a mental disorder in the form of depression, globally. WHO also notes that the rate of women experiencing depression is even higher in developing countries, with statistics indicating a 15% increase in women during pregnancy and a 19.8% increase in women following childbirth.   


While in most cases first time mothers may experience symptoms of a depressive disorder, it should also be noted that this could have a negative impact on the health of the baby as well, in terms of growth and development. Speaking to Health Capsule, Senior Registrar in Psychiatry at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Dr. Suhashini Ratnatunga explained how Postpartum Depression could have an adverse effect on the health of the mother and child, while further elucidating the symptoms, risk factors and treatment options available for the illness. She emphasized that maternal mental disorders such as Postpartum Depression were treatable with proper and timely intervention and that it was crucial to raise ample awareness among mothers on how best to cope with Postpartum Depression. Excerpts of the interview are given below.
