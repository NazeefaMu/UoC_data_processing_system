Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the Samurdhi Bank would be soon brought under the control of the Central Bank.

“All banks except the Samurdhi Bank are monitored by the Central Bank," he said at the UNP May Day rally held today at the Sugathadasa Stadium.

“Even the EPF is monitored and controlled by the Ministry of Finance.

However, the Samurdhi Bank is not being monitored or administered by any institution and therefore, we will bring it under the control of Central Bank,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
