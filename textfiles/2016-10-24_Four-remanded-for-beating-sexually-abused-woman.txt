Four members of the administrative panel of the Jummah Mosque in Nallandaluwa, Puttalam were remanded indefinitely by Puttalam Magistrate Bandula Gunaratne today -- on charges of beating a woman, who had earlier been sexually abused, with a coconut spathe bowl (hanassa).

The suspects had allegedly beaten the woman a hundred times with the hanassa.

The woman had been sexually abused by a man at her residence a few days earlier.  

The woman had complained to the Police about the sexual abuse. She had later been beaten by the members of the administrative panel of the mosque while police investigations to apprehend the suspect were in progress.

The victimised woman had later lodged another complaint, through her lawyer, over the second incident.(Hiran Priyankara Jayasinghe)
