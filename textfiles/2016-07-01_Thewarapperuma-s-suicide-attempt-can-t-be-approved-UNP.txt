Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma's suicide attempt cannot be approved by any means, his fellow UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said today.

He told a media briefing that his colleague's deplorable action was uncalled for and whatever the issues might have been could have been resolved through discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe without making any foolish attempt to end his life.

“Hanging himself is not a solution. However, panicking is one of his personality traits,” Mr. Jayamaha said. (Yohan Perera)
