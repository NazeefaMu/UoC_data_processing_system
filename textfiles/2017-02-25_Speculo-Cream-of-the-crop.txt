Schoolchildren from remote areas such as Jaffna, Mannar, Bibile, Silawathura, Kalaoya and Balangoda had sent their entries to the exhibition that is currently being attended by hundreds of people including the clergy. 


In a bid to flock the creative community, event’s host SriLankan Airlines has also taken an unprecedented step in displaying the paintings of nine inmates in the Welikada prison.
