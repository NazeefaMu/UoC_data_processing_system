6th Month Remembrance of Rukie Eheliyagoda (26.03.1926 - 19.03.2017)

 

God looked down on His creation  
Saw a life that was a godly celebration  
Held out His hand and invited her in  
The crown of life for her to win.  
She brought me happy days, day after day  
Though I willed it, she could not stay  
My need for her will never abate  
But heaven’s need was not for debate.  
Broken I whispered, “God knows best”  
As she entered God’s eternal rest  
Leaving behind a powerful legacy  
Following her footsteps won’t be easy.  
When the setting sun paints the canvass of the sky  
With sweeping colours that enchant the eye  
Lingering golden memories in cascading poignancy  
Embrace me leaving me lonely.  
At her feet the valuable lessons learnt  
Keep me happy, wiser and unhurt  
 “No path in life is easy and straight”  
Those words of wisdom reverberate.  
Until someday on that golden shore  
Together again forever more  
In God’s eternal home on high  
Never again a need to say goodbye.  
Forever my love
