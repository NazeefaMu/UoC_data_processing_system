The family, relatives and well wishers of Kesara Kahandaliyanage, a youth with autism, who had been abused at his workplace in June, held a protest in front of the Gangodawila Court Complex today to call for action against the perpetrators.
Sister of the victim Nuwanthi Kahandaliyanage told the Daily Mirror that they all were protesting to see justice being done to her brother.
“He is a youth with special needs but we haven’t been served justice up until today. The system can’t take five years to get the law in to hand,” she said.
“Today my brother is living in fear and the more these people delay the case the more he will be unable to recall, what exactly happened because that is what his condition is like.
“The perpetrators are walking free and everybody has turned a blind eye on this matter,” she said.
Kesara Kahandaliyanage was abused, while working at a restaurant and the family was made aware of the incident on June 12, 2015.
A complaint was lodged with the Kohuwala Police and a letter was a written to the Attorney General’s Department but Nuwanthi said they hadn’t received any response from them. (Kamanthi Wickramasinghe) Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana
