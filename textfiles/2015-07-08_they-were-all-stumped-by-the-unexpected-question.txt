They were all stumped by the unexpected question


	


The Nomination Board of the Blue party appointed by the Compassionate One interviewed the hopefuls last week. 
A certain unexpected question put forward by a member of the selection board had made the nomination aspirants squirm in their seats, they say.
As soon as an aspirant sits down before the board, this member, a Ministerial one, would ask him: “From which camp are you, Mahinda or Maithri?”
Some nomination seekers had later complained to the party high ups about the embarrassing question put to them.
The secretarial one of the Betel leaf party, an avowed loyalist of the deposed strongman had later made an appeal to Senior Banda from the Hills not to put this embarrassing question to the nomination aspirants.
“We are doing our best to unify the divided party. You are asking a question that surely leads to the division of the party,” the secretarial one 
had remonstrated.
