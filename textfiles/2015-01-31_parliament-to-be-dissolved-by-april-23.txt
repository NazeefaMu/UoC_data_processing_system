		Prime Minister Ranil Wickramsinghe has announced today that the Parliament will be dissolved by April 23 this year. 
	
	He had stated this at a meeting held for UNP organisers in Kandy. "We should start the organising now and work hard towards establishing a UNP government at the upcoming general election," he had stated. 
	Meanwhile  he had also commented on the 2015 interim budget that was presented before the Parliament on Thursday. 
	"We have given a lot of benefits and relief for the people through this budget. . . Our aim is to lend a helping hand for everyone to prosper economically irrelevant of their political affiliations," he had said while adding that it is pointless to become multi-millionaires if that money has been earned by heavily taxing the poor and through corrupt deals. 
	He had also pledged to secure the futures of the youth and children. "I am not a person who hugs and embraces children, but I will ensure that their futures are secure," he added. 
	The PM had also emphasized on the importance of steering the country in a new direction. 
	"This country has to be completely turned around from its present plight - the eduation and health sectors have to be developed and there is a need to generate over one millioin jobs for the youth. . .," he had stated.  ( JAL Jayasinghe )
