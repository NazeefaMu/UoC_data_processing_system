NEW DELHI AFP July12, 2018-A British lawyer assisting Bangladesh’s opposition leader in her fight against corruption charges has been refused entry to India where he was scheduled to give a press conference about the case.   


India’s foreign ministry said Lord Alexander Carlile, a former MP and international lawyer, was denied entry at New Delhi on Wednesday evening for visa irregularities.   


The peer returned on a flight to London after being deported from Delhi’s international airport.   


 “Carlile, a British national, arrived in New Delhi... without having obtained appropriate Indian visa,” foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement.
