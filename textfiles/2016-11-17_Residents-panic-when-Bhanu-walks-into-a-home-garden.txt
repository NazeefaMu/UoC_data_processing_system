Some of the residents in Pinnawala panicked today after the elephant named ‘Bhanu’ attempted to enter a home garden after exiting the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage.

However, the keepers at the Pinnawala Orphanage managed to bring the elephant back to the orphanage safely.

‘Bhanu’, which was kept at the Kataragama Devalaya premises without a permit, was handed over to Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage on a court order last month.
