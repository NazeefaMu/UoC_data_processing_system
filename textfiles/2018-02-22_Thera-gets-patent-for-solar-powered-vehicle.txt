The chief incumbent of the International Meditation Centre at Rathmalkanda Aranyaya (hermitage) in Kitthalella, Bandarawela Ven. Madawala Upali Thera has received the patent license for his invention of solar-power operated motor vehicle.

A unique feature of this vehicle is that there is no emission of carbon dioxide and sulpher dioxide to the environment, thereby helping to minimise air pollution and reduce global warming, according to the thera.

This vehicle will be helpful to persons who have difficulty in walking as well as those who are looking for a cost efficient mode of transport that can get them from A to B. The vehicle, with a maximum speed of 30 kmph, can accommodate two passengers.

Before entering the Buddhist order the thera was a science teacher and while he is unlikely to abandon the order and leave the priesthood, he enjoys experimenting. (Palitha Ariyawansa)
