President Maithripala Sirisena said he had directed the IGP to take necessary action against those involved in ragging in universities with the co-ordination of university authorities.

Referring to the ragging by some students of the Peradeniya University, the President said it was a disgrace to free education and the universities for senior students to rag the freshers.

He said this when participating at the 75th anniversary of the Ananda Sastralaya in Matugama today.
