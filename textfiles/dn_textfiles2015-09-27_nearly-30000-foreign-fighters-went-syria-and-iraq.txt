Nearly 30,000 foreign fighters went to Syria and Iraq

US: US intelligence fears nearly 30,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Iraq and Syria since 2011, many of them to join the Islamic State group, The New York Times reported Saturday.
The number, which reportedly includes many westerners including perhaps 250 Americans, represents a doubling of last year's US assessment and will dismay US war planners.
The New York Times' report cites anonymous "intelligence and law enforcement officials."
In recent weeks, there have been allegations that the US military has been playing down the IS threat in intelligence reports, to paint a rosier picture of its efforts.
But US President Barack Obama will on Tuesday next week chair an international summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly for leaders fighting the IS group and "violent extremism." And on Tuesday, a US Congressional report into foreign fighter flows is expected to paint a bleaker picture, suggesting that a year of US-led air strikes has not slowed recruitment. - AFP
