Human Rights Council is UN’s greatest failure: US


	

United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley on Wednesday said the Human Rights Council was the UN's greatest failure.

She expressed these views while discussing the United States’ withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC.

“Judged by how far it has fallen short of its promise, the Human Rights Council is the UN's greatest failure. It has taken the idea of human dignity. The Council has reduced it to just another instrument of international politics which is a great tragedy,” she said.

She said the United States’ withdrawal from the Human Rights Council does not mean that they give up the fight for reform.

“On the contrary, any country willing to work with us to reshape the Council need only ask. America can no more abandon the cause of human rights than abandon itself. It is who we are. It is who we’re proud to be. And it’s who we will always be,” Ambassador Haley said.

She said no one should make the mistake of equating membership in the Human Rights Council with the support for human rights.

She also said the US does more for human rights, both inside the UN and around the world, than any other country.

“We will continue to do that. We just won’t do it inside a Council that consistently fails the cause of human rights,” she said.
