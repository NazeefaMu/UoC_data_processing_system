Paying bills nobody’s baby


	



 

This holiday resort located in an ancient kingdom has for some time become the haunt of the lackeys of a leading politico. 

 


Now a question has arisen as to who should foot the electricity and the water bills of this holiday home which have run into hefty amounts.


The state establishment which owns the holiday home has refused to settle the bills saying that they did not use the place for its guests during the period relevant to the outstanding water and electricity bills. 


Neither the leading politico nor his lackeys who had been enjoying the full free run of the place had come forward to pay the bills.


By the way, the CEB which would not normally fail to serve the ordinary electricity consumers with the red notice even if the dues have not run into arrears for more than a month or two, has yet to issue such red notice warning to the authorities responsible for running this holiday home despite that the dues had already run into arrears amounting to several lakhs of rupees, they say.
