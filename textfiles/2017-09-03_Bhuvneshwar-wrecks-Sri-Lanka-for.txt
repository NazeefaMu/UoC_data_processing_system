Bhuvneshwar wrecks Sri Lanka for 238


	

Bhuvneshwar Kumar captured his maiden five-wicket haul as India restricted Sri Lanka to a modest total of 238 in the fifth and final One Day International (ODI) in Colombo a short while ago.

Captain Upul Tharanga (48 from 34 balls) gave Sri Lanka a flying start, but none at the other end managed to provide any support.

Despite a few early wickets, Lahiru Thirimanne (67) and Angelo Mathews (55) consolidated the innings in the middle order.

However, the Indian bowlers pulled things back in the last 10 overs, to wrap up the hosts for a lowly 238.

India already leads the series convincingly with a 4-0 margin.
