Keheliya says he said no to Ranil’s offer


	

Former Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella alleged that following the Presidential Election in January, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had offered him a ministerial portfolio if he were to join the United National Party (UNP).  
The Parliamentarian said he was contacted by the Prime Minister who offered him a portfolio if he would leave with the 26 SLFPers who joined the government.
“During the three hour conversation the PM said the number would be increased to 30 members. He said if I were to join the party before January 5 (2015) I would be given a powerful ministry,” he said.  
When questioned as to why Harin Fernando, UNP Parliamentarian elected from the same district (Kandy), was not given a ministerial post, the PM had allegedly stated there was a communication issue, Rambukwella said.  
The Parliamentarian said he would never leave the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) as long as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was in politics.
“As long as the leader who defeated terrorism is in politics I will be with him or I will remain at home,” Rambukwella said. (DS)
