Popular tele drama actress, Udayanthi Kulatunga who is alleged to have had financial dealings with drug king pin Wele Suda, said today that she was innocent and she did not know who Wele Suda was.
Speaking to the media outside the Hulftsdorp Magistrate Court after a petition filed by her seeking court intervention to unfreeze her bank accounts was taken up for hearing, she said she did not know that it was Wele Suda who called her during a show in Dubai.
“I thought he was one my fans who call me often. However, the CID recorded a statement from me over the phone call.Since then all of my bank accounts have been frozen. My sister’s bank account where I deposited money that I borrowed from her husband was also blocked. I came to courts today in connection with a petition that I filed to free my accounts,” she said.
Speaking about the alleged connection between her sister’s business and Wele Suda’s drug business, she said her sister’s business was not being run on Wele Suda’s money but with their hard earned moneyfor 22 years.
The case was fixed for July 3.
Last week, Ms.Kulatunga told Colombo Chief Magistrate GihanPilapitiyathat drug dealer WeleSuda had given her Rs 350,000 to produce a tele drama.
She made this assertion during an inquiry into a motion filed by the actress’ sisterChamilaNilminiKulatunga seeking a court order to the CID to free her assets in several bank accounts that were frozen by the CID.
Counsel AselaRekawa appearing with KosalaJayakody and Sajitha Jayawardena for ChamilaNilmini told the Magistrate that drug dealer GampolaVidhanage Samantha Kumara alias WeleSuda had met Udayanthi during a musical show in Dubai in 2013.
ThereafterWeleSuda had obtained Udayanthi’s telephone number and after discussing to produce a tele drama, had paid Udayanthi Rs 350,000 as part payment which she had given to a producer to produce a tele drama. However as the balance sum was not paid the tele drama was not produced. Later during CID investigations on WeleSuda they had found the telephone number of the teledrama actress in WeleSuda’s telephone and had frozen the assets of the tele drama actress’sister who was a business woman running tyre shops with her husband.
The Counsel said the CID froze the petitioner’s accounts because Udayanthi had returned Rs. one million to her sister which she had taken as a loan and deposited it in her bank account.
The Counsel said when his client went to withdraw the money she was told that her accounts and other monies in the Fixed Deposits etc had been frozen by the CID.
The Counsel said his client could provide detailed reports as how the money was earned and thus to lift the freezing orders to the concerned banks and financial institutions.
During the inquiry Counsel MadhawaRupasinghe appearing for Kalutota Finance Company told the Magistrate that two of the vehicles that were used by the petitioner belonged to them and those two vehicles were also being restrained from transferring the ownership. They asked the court to lift that restraining order. (Piyumi Fonseka)
