VIdeo: CB Bond probe politicised: UNP
	
	The UNP today accused COPE Chairman D.E.W. Gunasekera of politicising the parliamentary probe into the sale of Central Bank bonds.
	Deputy Justice Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe urged that the controversy should be investigated by parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises which would be set up by the future Parliament. He said this probe should be much broader and should include a number of other shady deals involving the sale of treasury bonds in the recent past.
	He said that though it was reported that Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendrans son in law had some connection to Perpetual Treasuries it was also revealed that even former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraals sister had been a director of Perpetual Treasuries.
	He said there were three different reports drafted by the COPE with regard to the bond issue with some information in the original report being deleted in the other two reports.
	The deputy minister said the original report recommended that a more detailed study had to be done summoning more witnesses but this had been cut off in the other reports. He pointed his finger at COPE Chairman D.E.W. Gunasekera for having politicised the probe.
	The deputy minister said the incumbent Central Bank Governor had not been directly charged in any of the three reports. (Yohan Perera and Dharshana Sanjeewa)

BBS to contest election as BJP under Cobra symbol
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) would contest the upcoming general elections under the name Bodu Jana Peramuna (BJP), BJP Leader and BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said today.
He said the BBS would remain as it is but for upcoming elections it would affiliate itself with the Eksath Maha Sabha Pakshaya (EMSP) which is a registered political party. The EMSP would in future be called the Bodu Jana Peramuna or the BJP with a new symbol and new officials.
The Thera told the Daily Mirror that new officials have been appointed to the BJP and was waiting the Elections Commissioners approval for its Cobra symbol.
We have requested the Elections Commissioner to reserve the Cobra symbol for our newly formed party and looking forward to his approval, he said.
He said the Elections Commissioner had earlier refused to register any new political party in keeping with election regulations and that was why they had affiliate with the EMSP. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Harin vows to give up politics if MS joins MR
	
I will resign from politicsiIf President Maithripala Sirisena joins former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Uva Chief Minister Harin Fernando said.
I firmly believe that President Maithripala Sirisena will never stoop to second class political activities. The former president is attempting to come to power so that he could take revenge from the people and his opponents and not to develop the country, he said at a meeting in Badulla.
Mr. Fernando said he received 1,450 permits for jobs while there were 4,301 applicants from the entire district. He assured that everyone would be given jobs.
I have done Rs.700 million worth of work in the Uva Province, and during the 100 days I allocated one million rupees to each Grama Niladhari area. The 100-day programme was not meant to provide employment. It seems that, those who worked for President Maithripala Sirisena's victory are left out while those who obstructed him at every turn are gathering round him. It is shameless to see the former president visiting temples. Instead of the sound of Sadhu, what you hear now at these temples are the sound of Jayawewa, Jayawewa.
Mr. Fernando also handed over cash donations of Rs.50,000 to each of the Daham Pasals in the Badulla Secretariat Division.
He also handed over Rs.2,500 to the pre-school teachers of Badulla. (Prasad Rukmal)

JVP urges govt. to postpone polls
	
	The JVP today urged the government to postpone the general elections to the first week of September so that it won't affect students sitting the GCE Advanced Level examination.
	JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a rally in Malabe that the date had been fixed for the polls is the earliest possible day in accordance with election laws. He therefore urged the government to consider re-scheduling the election to early September.
	The JVP leader said nearly 200,000 children would sit this year's Advanced Level Examination and questioned as to how they could concentrate on studies amidst loud speakers, rallies and processions. The fixing of dates for the election it self show how sensitive the present rulers are towards issues pertaining to ordinary citizens of this country, Mr. Disssanayake said.
	He said none of these issues would have arisen had the Parliament been dissolved just after the enactment of the 19th Amendment as the election would have been completed by now.
	Referring to investigations on corruption, Mr. Dissanayake said his party would come out with some shocking details on corrupt acts of the Rajapaksa administration and the preset regime. He said he too possessed files on corruption. Elaborating more on the subject the JVP leader charged that both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisghe were sweeping all investigations under the carpet while the former President was also influencing the rulers to do so.

	Against the backdrop of these developments, the president has appointed this committee, comprising Mr. Dissanayake and Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane and Sarath Amunugama.
	Asked for comment, Mr. Dissanayake told Daily Mirror that the committee was not solely for the purpose holding talks with the faction supporting Mr. Rajapaksa.
	We will speak with those who are with us and those who have have left us for the moment. We have to unite all possible factions to win this election, he said.
	Meanwhile, a former minister who backed Mr. Rajapaksa, said it was yet uncertain whether the two factions could be united ahead of the election.

	Police officers attached to Colombo city limits expressed their dissatisfaction over Colombo Mayors decision to allow pavement hawkers to conduct their businesses on certain streets in Pettah.
	Police officers who wish to remain anonymous told the Daily Mirror that this decision would lead to violation of several statutory laws of the country including the Penal Code, the Police Ordinance and the National Thoroughfares Act.
	Colombo Mayor A.J.M. Muzammil had told that he had given permission for the vendors only along the by-roads of First Cross Street, Second Cross Street and Third Cross Street in Pettah to carry out their businesses and their stalls would be given an identification card to operate.
	An OIC attached to a key police station in Colombo stated that this situation would allow politically motivated gang members to operate back in the Colombo city. He stated that police have found that there were several instances that drugs and pornographic materials were being sold under the guise of pavement hawkers. He stated that if this situation continues it might lead to rapid theft and other offences in the Colombo city after victimising the locals and foreigners who visiting the Colombo C ity.
	Under Section 63 (f and k) of the Police Ordinance, the police officers are empowered to exercise their duties to prevent obstructions and nuisances on roads.

Seylan, first Lankan bank to reach 200,000 Facebook fans
	
		 		 
		 
			
Seylan Bank reached a social media landmark this week, reaching 200,000 fans on its Facebook page and that too with a far superior engagement score to its peers signifying the true engagement it has with its fans and customers.
The first bank in Sri Lanka to reach this milestone, Seylan Bank has been spearheading social and digital media marketing in the banking and financial sector in Sri Lanka since 2012. Having aimed to be the most socially engaging bank, social media has since been an integral part of the banks customer engagement strategy and has grown from strength to strength.
As a leading bank in Sri Lanka, digital marketing is a vital part of our strategy to provide a better banking experience to our customers, interact with them and to constantly innovate and augment our offerings, said Seylan Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing and Personal Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera.
We use social media as a platform to engage and add value and we are grateful to our fans for their continued support. We are extremely humbled and proud that 200,000 people have chosen to be a part of our social media endeavours and help in creating a robust and thriving banking community with true engagement as opposed to simply becoming fans. Seylan Banks social media success can be attributed to its innovation and efforts to address its customers needs through real-time interaction via its customer support tab, a variety of interactive apps to enable Gamification and a series of special promotions to reward its fan base. A firm proponent of organic fan growth and value addition, the bank also engages with its customers by sharing interesting and relatable content, information about its products and services and news of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts.
Innovation has been at the crux of the banks digital communication strategy and the bank makes considerable effort to bridge both its online and offline worlds, offering access to all its customers alike. Seylan Bank launched its first-ever game app to supplement Seylan Tikiri, its popular childrens savings account and also launched the first online art gallery through a childrens art competition.
Seylan Office Challenge was yet another first in the banking industry, where teams from offices were invited to take part in a series of challenging games which were hailed by many organisations and participants for its innovating and engaging approach. During Avurudu, fans were given a chance to play Avurudu games on the Banks Facebook page while 40 winners were rewarded with gifts. Seylan Bank has sponsored popular events such as the Sesame Street Show, Barney  Live in Concert and Jurassic World, rewarding its customers with tickets and prizes through its social media efforts. A special promotion is currently underway to celebrate the banks social media milestone by rewarding 200 fans with a unique gift, via Facebook app developed solely for this occasion.
The number one Sri Lankan bank on Facebook to date, Seylan Bank has been lauded at numerous award ceremonies around the world for its innovative social media initiatives. Most recently, the bank was recognized at the Global Marketing Excellence Awards 2014 organised by the World Marketing Congress, the Customer Engagement Award organised by Asian Customer Engagement forum and the Golden Globe Tiger Awards.
A pioneer in digital communications and channels, Seylan Bank also focuses on Internet banking, SMS banking and other social media platforms such as Twitter, Linked-in and Youtube to consistently add value to its customers.

SL ranked 114 in Global Peace Index
	
Sri Lanka ranked 114th on the global peace index conducted by an Australian-based Institute for Economics and Peace which measured national peacefulness in 162 countries.
Bhutan ranked at 18th place, Nepal at 62, Bangladesh at 84, India at 143 and Pakistan ranked 154 with Afghanistan at 160. Iceland had retained its place as the most peaceful country in the world.
The most peaceful countries are Iceland, Denmark and Austria. The countries that made the biggest improvements in peace over the past year, generally benefited from the ending of wars with neighbours and involvement in external conflict like Guinea-Bissau, Cote dIvoire, Egypt and Benin, the report said.
The institute released its Global Peace Index for 2015 recently, which ranks nations based on factors like the level of violent crime, involvement in conflicts and the degree of militarisation. The nations are given a score on that basis and the higher the score, the less peaceful a particular country is.
Sri Lanka had ranked at 114 with a score of 2.188. Sri Lanka scored 2.0 marks in Militarisation, 2.6 in Society and Security and 1.8 in Domestic and Internal Conflict sub categories out of total five in each.
The US ranked 94 scoring badly in terms of militarisation, homicides and fear of violence. China ranked 124.
Syria and Iraq where the Islamic State terror group has taken over large swathes of land are at the bottom of the table as the least peaceful countries, the Business Standard said.
