A stickler for yahapalanaya principles, but he had to go


	


The Customs got a new chief last week. Incidentally, he was the third to be appointed in quick succession to this key post under the Yahapalanaya.
Many inquisitive ones naturally made inquiries as to why the Customs Chief despite being a stickler for yahapalanaya principles was suddenly ousted. And they soon discovered the reason behind the virtual ouster: He had refused to carry out orders from powerful politicians.  
The latest “wrong” done by him was the sealing of a container shipment imported by some close pals of a political high authority from Rajarata. The Customs Chief had stuck to his guns despite repeated requests to release the containers.
The Customs Chief later found himself at the receiving end of abuse from the disgruntled political high ups and he quit the post in utter disgust and returned to his old job, they say.
