(RT.COM) 05.01.2017- Top Turkish officials have questioned the use of Incirlik Air Base by the US-led coalition, citing a “confidence crisis” with Washington and inadequate support for Turkey’s ground forces in Syria.  


The US-led coalition does little to provide aerial support to Turkish troops deployed in Syria as part of the Operation Euphrates Shield, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told state-run Anadolu news agency on Wednesday.  


“What purpose are you serving if you do not provide aerial support against Daesh [Islamic State] in the most sensitive operation for us?” he added.  


In his Wednesday statement, Cavusoglu also accused Washington of aiding Kurdish militias – considered terrorists by Ankara – and “preferring terrorist organizations over its ally [Turkey].”  
His remarks were echoed by Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik, who said that the lack of US air support for Turkey’s operation in al-Bab “raises questions” about the American presence at Incirlik.
