Bribery Commission is full of corruption: Maithri Gunaratne


	

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption which was established to inquire into corruption was full of corruption, United National Freedom Front Secretary Maithri Gunaratne charged.

“The Director General and couple of Commissioners of the Commission are reported to have purchased three Mercedes Benz cars worth Rs. 4.5 million each on rent basis in such scenario where they have been provided with three luxury vehicles by the Commission. It is utterly misappropriation of public funds,” Gunaratne told a news briefing today.

“The other funny thing is that although these three newly purchased cars are electric motor cars, it was reported that they still get the fuel allowance granted by the commission,” he said.

“On the other hand, there is an official in the commission who frequently goes abroad in the first class or the business class. According to the information we gathered from an official of the commission, he goes overseas to buy sweets and other food items for his family members,” he added.

He said it was the funds of the people that were being used for these journeys.

Nevertheless, he said the Director General of the Commission used to spend funds between Rs. 6mn to Rs. 7mn to get his office cabin repaired.

“Is this we should expect of a commission like this which has been placed to investigate corruption and bribery? They should set an example for others instead of involving in misappropriation of public finds,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
