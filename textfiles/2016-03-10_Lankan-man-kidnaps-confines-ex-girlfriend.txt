Lankan man kidnaps, confines ex-girlfriend


	

A Sri Lankan manager with other four compatriots allegedly kidnapped and confined a woman to force her resume her friendship with him, the Dubai Criminal Court heard.

At around 5am on January 22, AD, 37, manager, NS, 26, cook, RS, 43 driver, SM, 37 salesman, and AM, 32, waiter, broke the door of the house of WJ where she was staying.

They used knives and wooden bars to break the door of the room where the woman and her friend lived. The manager AD beat her up and dragged his ex-girlfriend out of the room.

The attackers pushed her into a car and drove her to a flat where they confined her for three hours before she managed to flee to a police station and report the incident.

The woman told prosecutors that the manager had previously came to WJ’s accommodation and threatened to kill her and anyone with whom she may have friendship. He did this to compel her to resume her relationship with him, she said.

WJ, 44, Sri Lankan businessman, repeated corroborative testimony, saying that the attackers also assaulted him and that he reported the incident immediately to the police.

Forensic reported that the woman had bruises caused by a hard tool.

The victim recognised her assaulters and kidnappers when shown to her via identification parade.

The accused denied the accusation before the court and the manager claimed that it was not true. He told the jury that he had asked the woman to arrange a meeting but she told him that she was with someone. “I thought that he was keeping her by force so I went to release her. We did not break or assault anyone,” he claimed.

The court will reconvene on March 24. (Emirates 24/7)
