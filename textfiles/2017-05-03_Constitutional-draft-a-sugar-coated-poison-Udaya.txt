The Constitutional draft which is being made is sugar-coated poison and no one should fall for it, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.

Commenting on a recent interim report of the Constitutional Assembly’s Steering Committee, the MP said it had put forward a number of proposals which are detrimental to the unitary character of Sri Lanka.

“The interim report had been submitted to the Constitutional Assembly by the Prime Minister as the Constitutional Assembly’s Steering Committee Head. The reforms are only unitary in name but federal in function. Therefore, we should make people aware of this danger to nip it in the bud,” he said.

Addressing a news briefing alongside with National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa on the constitutional reforms, MP Gammanpila said they would create a broad front to defeat the constitutional trap which is ahead of the country.

Elaborating on the report, he said the proposals on the place given to Buddhism from the Constitution were contradictory.

Meanwhile, he said powerful countries like the US, China and India which like to get hold of resources of Sri Lanka would prefer it divided into separate administrations so that they could get their objectives completed easily. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
