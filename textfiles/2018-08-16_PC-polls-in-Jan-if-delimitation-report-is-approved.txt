PC polls in Jan. if delimitation report is approved


	

Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said today that elections to six provincial councils could be held in January 2019 if Parliament approved the delimitation report this month.

This was after Minister, Mahinda Samarasinghe told reporters that Parliament would take up the delimitation report for debate on August 24.

The main impediment to holding the PC polls was the delay in approving the delimitation report as it is mandatory to demarcate new provincial council boundaries on the basis that the PC polls will be held under the new electoral system. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
