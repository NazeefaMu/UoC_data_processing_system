Ministers making a mockery of the law: MR


	

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa today claimed that it was a mockery of the law for the ministers to have predicted Namal Rajapaksa's arrest by the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) 24 hours before the arrest.

Mr. Rajapaksa told journalist that his son Namal had been arrested by the FCID even without a proper complaint and an aggrieved party.

“This is an era in which my son has been labelled as a suspect and made an accused despite there being no complaint and an aggrieved party. Even though the Government is in a political witch-hunt, none of the opposition politicians would run away from politics. These incidents only motivate us even more,” he added.

Meanwhile, he said there were many groups all over the world who approve this Government's actions.
“They approve whatever this Government does including that of attacking the Rajapaksas,” he added.

Mr. Rajapaksa said this Government could be toppled like what had previously happened to even more powerful governments. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
