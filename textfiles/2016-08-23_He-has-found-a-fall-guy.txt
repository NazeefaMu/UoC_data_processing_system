The white collar bigwig at the august assembly who should take the rap for the VAT Bill fiasco had conveniently found a scapegoat, they say.

 


He had washed his hands off by putting the blame on a woman sectional head. He had not stopped at shifting the blame on her; he had also severely reprimanded her. The poor lady is said to be in tears these days, they say.
