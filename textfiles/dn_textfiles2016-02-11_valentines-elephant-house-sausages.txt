Valentine's with Elephant House Sausages

On this Valentine's Day, the legendary Elephant House sausages category has taken the lead to pamper the lads and lasses who adore great times.
Since 1966 Elephant House Sausages have delivered distinctive flavours of sausages beyond excellence.
Premium meats blended with authentic Sri Lankan spices give the bursting zest coupled with mouthwatering taste and a sizzle on a pan is a devouring sight.
"Elephant House Sausages have once again made an attempt to create an experience that is unforgettable.
In this valentine Elephant House Sausages have made the room available to create & share the most unforgettable moments with their partners", John Keells Holdings Vice President Sales and Marketing Neil Samarasinghe said.
To win a luxury dinner out with a partner at '8 Degrees on the Lake' at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo all one has to do is purchase any Elephant House Sausages pack from Keells super/Arpico or Laughs, scratch & try your luck. Offer valid until February 13.
