UNP will defeat any conspiracy - Sajith

Deputy UNP Leader and Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday said that the UNP is ready to defeat any conspiracy being hatched against the government’s development drive.
He said many investors who have identified the able administrative skills of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are coming to Sri Lanka for investment purposes. Those who see the proposed free trade agreement as a betrayal of the country should not oppose the government’s programme to provide one million employment opportunities to youth.
Premadasa was addressing a mammoth rally organised against opposition conspiracies in Colombo yesterday.
The march started at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre and ended with a rally at Hyde Park. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe listened to the speeches of senior party leaders at the rally. Minister Sarath Fonseka addressing the rally said “the people are living freely without fear. Thousands of youth have flocked here in protest of the opposition’s move to stifle the country’s development drive,” he said. He said those who plundered the Treasury and public assets for their own well being are trying to deter the country’s development march “The people made us vicotorious twice with an objective of taking the country forward,” he said.
He said that he intends to complete 200 villages under Udagama concept by end of this year and housing schemes would also be initiated for the benefit of city dwellers.
“The country’s War Heroes did not face any problems due to the able leadership and foreign policy of President Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe,” he said.
He said that those in the Common Opposition have been conspiring against the government by trying to mislead the public.
“Those who were plundered the Treasury will be brought to book. We do not protect wrongdoers. Legal action would be taken against those involved in corruption and financial irregularities irrespective of their status,” he said.
