Medium pacer Nuwan Kulasekara has announced his retirement from Test cricket with immediate effect, Sri Lanka Cricket said. Kulasekara, 33, last played a Test in 2014 against England. He will continue to play limited over cricket.

In a letter addressed to SLC, Kulasekera says, “I would like to retire from playing Test cricket with immediate effect. After much thought I believe it is the right time to retire and I hope it will allow me to better prepare for ODI and T20 cricket, which I would like to continue playing for Sri Lanka subject to good performance and selection.”

The former strike bowler with 48 test wickets to his name and best innings figures of 4/21, was ranked the ICC ODI No1 bowler in March 2009 after a 47 wicket haul in the preceding eleven months.
