Soma Wimalasundera (1921-2017) You have left a void never to be filled


	

One year ago on this day, you left us forever   
Leaving a void never to be filled   
You were unique, in so many ways   
Hard to describe, and at times to understand   
Born to a family of prestige from down South   
You led a happy life till the age of six   
When your mother passed away all of a sudden   
Your life changed completely   
Home schooled from then on you missed all the fun   
But you grew up, to be a beautiful maiden   
Attracting the attention of a handsome young man   
You entered wedlock and raised ten kids   
Supporting Thaththa in all his endeavors   
You stood by him to guide him along   
Being versatile in all aspects of life   
Your common sense proved always right   
With courage and determination you mothered us ten   
Sometimes strict at times not   
Secure future for us all   
Was, foremost in all your deeds   
With all that done you turned your attention   
To the love of your life, to care for him till he passed away.   
Looking back, what strikes me most is the dedication to us   
An example you set, in no uncertain terms   
May you attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana dearest Amma.
