President Maithripala Sirisena should take up the issue of Arjuna Mahendran with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, when he visits Sri Lanka next week, the Joint Opposition said today.

Addressing the weekly JO news briefing, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said the Singapore Premier’s visit would create an opportunity to bring back former Central Bank (CB) Governor.

“Would it be bad to make a proposal to the visiting Premier requesting to extradite Arjuna Mahendran, who is a Singaporean, to Sri Lanka to aid a bond probe? This is a great opportunity to let Singapore Premier know that one of his citizens had led Sri Lanka to bankruptcy,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
