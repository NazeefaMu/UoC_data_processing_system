He wanted to mark his presence on the sly!


	


The deposed strongman moving from temple to temple these days as part of his strategy to make his comeback to the political centre-stage was recently in Kandy to participate in a lotus flower Pooja at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. 
A sizable crowd of former Ministers, provincial councillors and members of local bodies in the area had turned up at the Pooja to demonstrate their solidarity with their one-time boss.  However, conspicuous by his absence was a provincial chief elevated to his present status by the deposed strongman.
However, the provincial chief was seen making an eleventh-hour appearance at the Maligawa through a rear entrance as the deposed strongman stepped into the inner shrine.  The provincial chief had later approached the former strongman and apologised to him for being late, but the latter had ignored him knowing that the late comer was just marking his attendance.
Realising that the former boss had got wise to his double game, the provincial chief had faded from the scene soon after.
