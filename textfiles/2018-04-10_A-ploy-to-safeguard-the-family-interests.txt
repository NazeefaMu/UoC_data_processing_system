A ploy to safeguard the family interests?


	

There are two siblings – an Akka and Malli – in the thick of politics whose family interests would remain unaffected, they say, no matter which party is in power for they represent the two main political parties.




The Malli, a purohita of a previous regime, lost his seat in a district located in an area where a kingdom once flourished. However, he is in active politics. 


The Akka too in active politics, sporting a different political colour, successfully contested the recent mini-polls on the Pohottuwa list.


Politics of this Akka- Malli duo has become a good joke for the people in their area who say that whichever the party that comes to power, it would be invariably either Akka’s or Malli’s and their family fortunes would remain intact!
