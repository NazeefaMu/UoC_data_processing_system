Reading with Kipling

Joseph Rudyard Kipling was a British Journalist, Novelist, Poet and a Short Story writer born on 30 December,1865 in Bombay, India during the British Colonial era. John Lockwood Kipling was his father and Alice McDonald was his mother.
Rudyard Kipling learnt the local language at his young days both he and his younger sister Alice enjoyed the exotic scenic beauty of the surroundings and the cultural and ethnic diversity in India.
At the age of 6 years Rudyard Kipling and his sister Alice were sent to England to receive formal British education. Rudyard Kipling lived with a foster family known as Holloways.
Mrs. Holloways ill-treated the young Kipling in the most horrendous manner and at the age of 11, he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Under these unfortunate circumstances, young Rudyard Kipling found solace only in reading books written by Daniel Defoe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Wilkie Collins sent by his parents.
In 1877, Rudyard Kipling was sent to United Services College in Westward Ho, Devon.
During this period, he started writing ‘ Schoolboy Lyrics ’ In 1881, he came back to Lahore and became the Assistant Editor of Civil and Military Gazette.
On 18th January 1892, Rudyard Kipling got married to Caroline Balestier and settled down in Brattleboro, Vermont, and compiled two of his famous works ‘ The Jungle Book’ and the poem ‘ Gunga Din.’ At the age of 32, Rudyard Kipling became the highest paid writer in the world.
‘ Echoes by two Writers, Civil and Military (1884),’, ‘ Departmental Ditties and other Verses, Civil and Military Gazette( 1888),’ ‘ The Rhyme of True Thomas ( 1894 )’ , ‘ Recessional’ (Victorian Ode in Commemoration of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee 1897), ‘ Poems, Ballads and Other Verses (1899)’ ‘ Wee Willie Winkie’ and Children’s Stories (1888),’ ‘ IF ’ (1895), ‘ Gunga Din’, ‘ Kim ’ ( 1901) and ‘ The Jungle Book’, ‘ Just So (1902)’are some of the major works of Rudyard Kipling.
He won Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907 and known as the highest paid writer of the world. In 1902, Kipling family settled permanently in a house called ‘Bateman’s in East Sussex, England. At the beginning, Rudyard Kipling became the target of anti-imperialism dominant in the countries under the British colonial administration.
Majority of his works had been portrayed as imperialist jingoism and ethnocentrism. Rudyard Kipling was brought up in a multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-ethnic pluralistic environment in India. Contrary to the bitter criticism against Rudyard Kipling as an advocate of the British imperialism, numerous works compiled by Rudyard Kipling if viewed in another perspective has exposed his genuineappreciation of diversity of cultures, customs, rites and rituals of Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews and Anglo-Indians lived in India.
For instance in the “ Ballad of East and West ” the first few lines of the introductory stanza of the poem have confused and misguided some of the literary critics.
“Oh! East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet, Till Earth and Sky stand presently of God’s great Judgment Seat: But there is neither East nor West, Border,Breed nor Birth, When two strong men stand face to face they come from the ends of the Earth. ”
Closer analysis of Kipling’s poems revealed that even if he had been branded as a staunch imperialist advocating the course of the British imperialism he had conveyed a message of balance point of view in the majority of his works.
‘But there is neither East nor West, Border, Breed nor Birth ’ reveals that Rudyard Kipling’s works have an aura of pluralism and tolerance of diversity. Vast experience he had garnered during his numerous travels the world across and living among the people of the East and West and their belief systems had lively portrayed blended with an invisible slight tinge of imperialism in his works.
It is quite natural for Rudyard Kipling as a British expatriate writer in India under the British empire and as a person involved to some extent in the British politics toblend his works with imperialism.
But in his works he had conveyed strong warnings of the consequences to the perpetrators of the crimes of pillage of the treasures and the exploitations of the other races in the British empire. Rudyard Kipling conveys the message through his poem ‘ Recessional ’ that the service done by the British by expanding their empire is negligible on comparison to the mighty service done by God for the humanity.
‘For frantic boast and foolish word,
Thy mercy on Thy people Lord!’
In addition Rudyard Kipling conveys the message that ‘earthly powers are transient ’ reminding the fate of two fallen empires of Ninevah and Tyre.
IF is one of the most famous didactic poems composed by Rudyard Kipling in 1895 giving inspirational instructions on bothethical and moral behavior. Rudyard Kipling had been influenced by his knowledge on Buddhism, Hinduism ,Christianity and myriad of other rituals and belief systems prevailed in the Indian subcontinent. According to literary analysts, the poem ‘ If ’ has been identified as Kipling’s instructions to his son John.
‘ IF ’ comprises of essential qualities such as ‘ patience ’, ‘ rational nature ’, ‘honesty’, ‘ dependability ’, and ‘ perseverance’ required to be an ideal man.
Origin of Kipling’s ‘ If ’ has been attributed to numerous other sources. ‘ If ’ can also be considered as a compendium of Stoicism. ‘ If ’ was first written as a series of instructions for children in his children’s book based on a story ‘ Brother Square Toes’ depicting George Washington as a model leader to be emulated bythe children.
