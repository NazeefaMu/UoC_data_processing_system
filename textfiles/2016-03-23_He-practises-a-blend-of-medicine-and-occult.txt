He practises a blend of medicine and occult


	



 

Two Diyawanna members have taken the initiative to get down here a physician from abroad specialized in treating rare ailments. 

 


This physician is said to be an expert in occult sciences as well. His services, a blend of medicine and the occult, are already in much demand among Diyawanna members, and the two politicos who brought him here have decided to introduce him to the highest echelons in yahapalanaya too, they say.


The two Diyawanna members have already picked a certain sacred ground in the Rajagiriya area as the consultation centre of this physician, a typical double of the ‘medicine-man’ of the former royal family.
