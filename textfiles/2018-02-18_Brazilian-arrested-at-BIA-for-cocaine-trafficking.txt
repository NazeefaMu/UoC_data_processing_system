A 36-year-old Brazilian man has been taken into custody at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on Friday on charges of cocaine trafficking, Acting Customs Spokesman Vipula Minuwanpitiya said.

The suspect had arrived from Sao Paulo, Brazil carrying capsules containing cocaine weighing 1 kg and worth around Rs. 20 million in his stomach.

The Customs officials had interrogated him and found out that he had swallowed condoms filled with drugs. He was later admitted him to the Negombo General Hospital.

Following an X-Ray examination, medical officers had confirmed that the suspect had swallowed capsules of cocaine.

Mr. Minuwanpitiya said the medical officers were able to take out some 69 capsules containing cocaine by this morning.

However, further examinations had confirmed that there were more capsules in the suspect’s stomach.

Therefore, Mr. Minuwanpitiya said the foreigner was detained at the hospital to take the rest of the drugs out.

Meanwhile, Custom officials had received a court order from the Minuwangoda Magistrate to keep the suspect in 14 days remand custody until March 1.
