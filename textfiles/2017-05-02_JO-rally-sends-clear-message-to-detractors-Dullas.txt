JO rally sends clear message to detractors: Dullas


	

The joint opposition (JO) said today the massive crowd at its May Day rally was a strong message to the embassies of Western countries and the elite class in Colombo about its strength.

JO national organiser and MP, Dullas Alahapperuma said he hoped the government would read the message and realize as to which party was the real opposition in the country.

“The number of people who were present at our May Day rally was three times as big as the number of people who attended the rallies organized by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). The people joined us as a protest against the government’s oppression of the people,” he told a news conference.

The MP said the rally held at the Galle Face Green was a turning point and probably the largest ever May Day rally in the country's history.

Meanwhile, he said the government should hold local government elections without delay.

“If the government continues to delay elections, the people who thronged Galle Face Green will surround the key institutions in the capital,” the MP said.

Referring to a challenge thrown by Minister P. Harrison that he would shave his head if the JO filled the Galle Face Green with its supporters on May Day, the MP said the challenge had been met but requested the minister not to cut his hair. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
