Don’t expect any more arrests of those alleged to have committed acts of corruption or any more political reforms from this government, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said on Thursday.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who addressed a public seminar in Tangalle said no one else would be arrested because such arrests were being blocked by political interference.
He blamed the present situation on both the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Mr. Dissanayake said there was political interference by the UNP because the party feels that it would be an advantageous position if the SLFP was be divided over the Rajapaksa clan turning out to be powerful while there is interference by the SLFP because President Maithripala Sirisena was keen not retain the support of his party members.
“This is the present situation despite an assurance given to us by President Sirisena that he will not nominate any one facing corruption charges,” he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said same thing was happening with regard to the controversial sale of Central Bank bonds which too would be swept under the carpet.
He said the country had come to a standstill with the only solution left was to hold a general election but this too was being delayed by the President for political reasons,. (YP)
