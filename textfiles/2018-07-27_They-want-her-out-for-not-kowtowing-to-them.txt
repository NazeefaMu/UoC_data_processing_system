They want her out for not kowtowing to them!


	



 

There is a political heavyweight in yahapalanaya hailing from Digamadulla area trying his level best to send out on punishment transfer a fair white-collar high-up in the ‘Kandiya’ division.

 


This fair white collar high- up at divisional level has incurred the wrath of the pro-yahapalanaya local politicos for not paying them the ‘due respect’, they say.


Following representations made to him by his local sidekicks, the political heavyweight has pressed the white-collar authority at the district level to transfer out the lady with no success so far.


The main allegation that the pro-government local politicos make against this fair white collar up is that she does not stand up and greet them when they call on her!
