The prevailing situation regarding dengue in Sri Lanka will definitely have an effect on Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. The island attracts visitors from other countries by virtue of its biodiversity and strategic location. When examining the impact on the tourism industry, Director of Public Relations at the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Dushan Wickramasuriya, revealed that there is some sort of an indirect impact on the Sri Lanka tourism industry due the present dengue epidemic. He said that as a result there has been a considerable decline in the arrival of foreigners since May. The Monthly Statistical Bulletins, which offer information regarding tourist arrivals and hotel occupancy, provides the following information for the period between January to June 2017

The data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) reveals that Sri Lanka’s tourist arrivals declined in March by 2.5 percent compared to the same period last year. Wickramasuriya further stressed that the reason for the decline in the arrival of foreigners doesn’t only depend on dengue alone, but it has been one of the core grounds for the drop in the number.   
Tourism Minister, John Amaratunga told Daily Mirror that the country hadn’t been able to record the expected tourist arrivals during the month of June mainly due to the floods, dengue outbreak and the garbage crisis.  

 


"If you  need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 011 2691111 and ask for an ambulance"


 

 “The dengue epidemic itself didn’t adversely affect the tourism arrivals this month. When the flood situation was on the surface, there was a considerable decline in the arrival of foreigners. But now the floods are over. Even dengue is now on the decline, so we are confident that tourist arrivals will receive a boost and we will be able to achieve our targets,” Amaratunga said.  

He added that tourist arrivals established a record last year with the figure reaching 2 million. The authorities are expecting an additional 2.5 million tourists to arrive this year.  

The United Kingdom High Commission declared that the UK Government has issued a health advisory to visitors from the UK ensuring that their people are secure from the prevailing condition of dengue. This kind of travel advisory indicates that dengue in Sri Lanka is pathetic. The travel advisory is as follows as: All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever.
