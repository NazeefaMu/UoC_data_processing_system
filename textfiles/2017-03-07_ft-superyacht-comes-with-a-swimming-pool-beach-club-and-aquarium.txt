A record-breaking superyacht the size of St Paul’s Cathedral has been built in Holland.  The luxury liner comes complete with a swimming pool, beach club and aquarium.  


At 360-feet (110 metres) long, the Jubilee is the largest yacht ever to built in the Netherlands - and is in the Top 100 of the largest superyachts in the world.  


The Jubilee has six decks and can accommodate up to 30 guests in 15 staterooms.   




The plush liner also features an exclusive suite for the yacht’s owner and a helicopter landing pad.   
It will be put through its paces in trials in the North Sea over the coming weeks and is set to sail over the Mediterranean this summer.  


The blue and white 4,500-tonne vessel is made of steel and aluminium and can travel at a top speed of 18 knots.  


And the boat’s power comes from a pair of MTU diesel engines.  


Its ribbon-like exterior creates an aerodynamic flowing design with no obstructions.  


The superyacht was built in a specially-made 460ft (140m) long enclosed dry dock.  




The dock was built at the end of 2014 and is designed so huge, multi-millions vessels can be made under wraps  


The state-of-the-art 100ft tall six level building in Alblasserdam, near Rotterdam, is made of concrete and is impervious to outside weather and ground water temperatures.   


A spokesman for Dutch yacht manufacturer Oceanco said: ‘Jubilee is truly a vessel in a class of her own with a unique and architecturally challenging design which creates a visual effect of multi-level decks never seen before.  


‘She represents a number of firsts in yachting and is a visual and technological tour de force.’
