Thirteen illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh had been detained by the Ukrainian border guards of the Lviv and Lutsk detachments, the Ukrinform News agency reported on Thursday.

The Ukrainian State Border Guard Service has said guards have spotted six foreigners who did not have any documents with them and watched two people cross the Western Bug River along the border line.

“Border guards immediately informed their Polish counterparts. As a result of joint and coordinated actions by the Ukrainian side, Polish border guards detained two more people. They were citizens of Russia and Azerbaijan,” a statement issued by the Border Guard Service said.

It said that all details of preparations for the violation of the state border were established during verification measures.

In particular, it was established that a Russian and a Azerbaijani intended to send five Sri Lankans and an Indian to the European Union in search of a "better life."

At present, Polish foreign colleagues are expected to send the foreigners to Ukraine. The foreigners detained by Ukrainian border guards, after their identification, are to be held accountable for the attempt to break the border.
