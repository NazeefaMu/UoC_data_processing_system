President Maithripala Sirisena said the decision taken to spend large sums to provide vehicles on rent basis to 58 Parliamentarians who were holding the Chairmanship posts of Regional Development Committees would not be implemented.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror he further said a decision would be taken to implement a new system at the cabinet meeting held next week.

He further said the decision taken to provide vehicles on rent basis would ultimately result in the renting company owning the vehicles, and not the Parliamentarian or the government.

He also said he had discussed a new system for supplying vehicles to Parliamentarians with the Prime Minister. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
