Southern Provincial Councillor Geetha Kumarasinghe said today the drug menace in the country could not be eliminated by refusing nominations to a few MPs charged with involvement in drug trafficking.
She said there was no doubt that the drug menace should be eradicated from Sri Lanka’s soil and safeguard the younger generation suffering directly or indirectly because of drug addiction.
“Anyone can make allegations but they have to be proved in courts. We cannot eradicate the drug menace by refusing nominations to a few individuals,” Ms. Kumarasinghe said.
She said she spent her private funds for the benefit of the people whereas some others were involved in corruption and fraud.
“I am contesting the general election not to gain anything for myself. I have obtained all I need,” she said.
When asked about the incidents that she was involved in during the past with the politicians of the same party, Ms. Kumarasinghe said she had no rivals at present and that she hoped to carry out the political campaign with her rivals peacefully and added that those who were against her in Benthara Elpitiya had also extended support to her.
She thanked President Maithripala Sirisenafor giving nominations to ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa because he was the one who rescued the country from the clutches of the terrorists and should be handed over the country again. (Ajith Siriwardana)
