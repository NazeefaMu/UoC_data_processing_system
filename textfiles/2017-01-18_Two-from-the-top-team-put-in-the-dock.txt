Two from the top team put in the dock


	



 

Number One in Yahapalanaya held a powwow with the front-liners of the Betel leaf party at his official residence recently.

 


At the outset, two party stalwarts – a vociferous young top team member from Wayamba and an equally vociferous spokesman from Uva -  made a request that they be allowed to make some important revelations. And the Number One immediately gave way to them.  


The duo had then begun making serious allegations against two top team members who, they charged were undermining the unity government by resorting to self-seeking nefarious activities. 
Asked whom they were driving at, the two stalwarts had named the two top team members they put in the dock and proceeded to describe their charges against them. Of the two top team members who had come under the vociferous duo’s fire is from the upcountry and the other is from the Colombo district, they say.


After giving an attentive ear to the litany of charges made against the two top team members, Number One had confided in those present the action he proposed to take against the two top team members.  As the Betel leaf bigwigs had vowed to guard as a secret what Number One confided in them, they refused to divulge it to us.


As to what action Number One proposes to take against the two top team members facing serious charges – your guess is as good as mine!
