The use of square pin plugs will in future be the standard for Sri Lanka and as such the import and manufacture of appliances other than G-plugs commonly known as square pin plugs will be banned in future, Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) Chairman Saliya Mathew said today.

The ban on the import and manufacture of round-pin appliances will take effect from August 16 next year while the ban on their sale will be effective from August 16, 2018.

“From August 16, 2016, the wiring of new installations, the addition of circuits to existing installations or complete re-wiring of existing installation, should be carried out with 2.5 mm 2 (7/0.67 mm Cu) and must be compatible with type G-13A socket outlets,” Mr. Mathew said.

The regulations of a national standard for plugs and sockets for non-industrial applications will be implemented with the aim of uplifting the safety of electricity consumers

“The Commission has decided that the Type G-plug and socket outlet, widely known as the 13 Ampere plug and socket outlet, commonly referred to as the “Square Pin” plug and socket is to be the national standard in Sri Lanka,” the PUCSL said.“However, the transition to the type G-standard plug and socket should not require any premises to be re-wired purely for the purpose of accommodating the new standard, and that the existing wiring may remain until the end of its life period.”

The PCUSL said Sri Lanka currently used different types of plugs and sockets to make a connection to a wall socket and often the plug on an appliance does not fit to the base.

"Electricity users adopt a variety of methods and devices, most of which are unsafe and cause the connection to be unreliable," it said. “There has been some 95 electrocutions in 2015 up from 76 in 2013 and 73 in 2014. Use of substandard plugs, sockets, electrical accessories, adaptors and extension cords are one of the main causes for electrocution and fire." (Chaturanga Pradeep)
