A personal lawsuit has been filed against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera in Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court today by four complainants on the allegation of high noise levels sustained by the residents living around the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda where Dhammaloka is the Chief Incumbent.

Residents alleged that the exposure to such high level of noise constituted a health risk and there were sufficient scientific evidence to prove that danger due to the loudspeakers operated by the temple.

The complaints requested the Court to impose an appropriate order to prevent the temple being continuously amplifying such high levels of noise.

In the complaint, the residents said that they had on several times informed certain authorities and the Dhammaloka Thera too about the difficulty that they had to undergo. Yet, no actions were taken.

Complainants, Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr. Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Halok, Milinda Moragoda and Kamalesh Johnpillei had filed the personal case citing Ven. Dhammaloka Thera as the defendant, in line with the Section 98 (136) of the Criminal Procedure Code, where people are permittd to file personal complaints in a Magistrate's Court without Police.
