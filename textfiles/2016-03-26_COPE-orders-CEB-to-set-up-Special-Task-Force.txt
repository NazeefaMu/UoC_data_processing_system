The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has been ordered to establish a Special Task Force to find alternative power solutions to the power crisis, Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman MP Sunil Handunnetti said.

He said the CEB Chairman was ordered to establish the Special Task Force since hydro power was limited and thermo power was expensive.

The MP said COPE had already received a number of proposals on possible alternatives to the power crisis. (Dayasili Liyanage)
