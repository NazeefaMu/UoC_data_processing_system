Lasitha Wimalaratne, Deputy General Manager – Life Operations of Softlogic Life recently addressed the prestigious Insurance Claims and Underwriting Management Asia Summit 2017 which held at The Furama River Front Hotel, Singapore. 
Organized by Equip Global, the summit provided an exclusive platform to bring together global leaders from Asia Pacific to discuss on how insurers and reinsurers can improve customer experience during the claims and underwriting process, enhance operational efficiency and quality of claims/underwriting processes and create sustainable and profitable operating models.
Wimalaratne conducted a pre-summit workshop on how to improve claims operations and customer operations by shifting to online and mobile channels. On the second day of the main summit, Wimalartne spoke to leaders on the use of technology to improve client experience in life insurance claims. He showcased some of the exemplary case studies from Softlogic Life and explained how the company manages life insurance claims of their users without losing the human touch. He also took part as a panel member where he shared his views on utilizing new technologies and innovations to align claims and underwriting. 
Summing up his experience, Wimalaratne said, “It was a great honour for me to have been invited to be at this event and it was a wonderful opportunity to meet with so many influential and interesting people from the region. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to take to the stage and share the story of Softlogic Life with a great audience.”
