DPA, 19th DECEMBER, 2017 -  Bangladesh and Myanmar have formed a panel of officials to jointly oversee the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh in recent months, officials said on Tuesday.


The formation of the “Joint Working Group” marks a step towards ensuring the return of the Rohingya to their homes, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali told reporters in Dhaka.
“We hope the repatriation process will begin soon,” he added.


An estimated 655,000 Rohingya refugees crossed into the neighbouring country from Buddhist-majority Myanmar after the army launched an offensive against suspected Muslim insurgents.
