CPC TU strike unacceptable, says Minister


	

The indefinite strike announced by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Unions’ Collective on couldn’t be justified and the demands were groundless, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today.

He said the Government had not taken any decision in favour of the China Bay Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalee.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror Minister Weerakkody said that the unions were not aware about the facts and therefore were making false allegations about the Oil Tank Farm and the Hambantota Port.

“I have submitted a Cabinet Paper requesting permission to develop tanks in Hambantota in partnership with the CPC and the Sri Lanka Port Authority.

“The Trincomalee tanks were given to India for 35 years at a cost of 100,000 USD per annum and the payment had been made for 15 years,” he said.

He said that of the 99 tanks ten would be taken back, while the rest remain on a shared basis with the Lanka IOC and the CPC.

Therefore, Minister Weerakkody said what the unions were accusing the Government was ill-founded.

He said that however, that the demands of the TUs would be negotiated tomorrow.

Minister Weerakkody assured that so far no agreement had been closed regarding the oil tanks in Hambantota or Trincomalee and therefore the trade Unions should not create unnecessary fears among the general public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
