The Higher Education Ministry has written to SAITM requesting it to await the ministry decision with regard to its student intake, SAITM Registrar Husni Hussain said yesterday.

“SAITM has two student intakes annually. As of now, we have completed our student intake for May. The next student intake is in September,” she said adding that SAITM had not received any directive from President Maithripala Sirisena was functioning on directives received from the Higher Education Ministry.

However, the presidential secretariat had recently announced that the government had directed SAITM to halt student admission and the awarding of degrees until government gazettes the medical education standards to be adhered to by private medical colleges. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
