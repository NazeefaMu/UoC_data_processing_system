President Maithripala Sirisena today vowed before the mortal remains of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera that he would do everything possible under his command to abolish the Executive Presidency and introduce electoral reforms which the late prelate fought for in the past years.
 

	The cremation of the Ven. Thera (1942 – 2015) took place under state patronage at the Parliament Grounds in Kotte last afternoon amidst a large gathering of Buddhist monks, Buddhists devotees, religious leaders, devotees of other religions, politicians, diplomats, Buddhist delegates from other Asian Buddhist countries, armed forces personnel and many others.
	President Sirisena addressing the grieving gathering of all walks of life further said the Thera passed away at an unexpected time and before fruition of his wish and expectation of creating a ‘just society.
	“Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera devoted his life in the last few years to create a just society and promote the concept of good governance in Sri Lanka without politicizing it and paying little attention to his own well being which ultimately led to the deterioration of his health. The National Movement for a Just Society’ he formed to achieve those goals and gave the leadership put the foundation to the mass campaign to bring myself and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the present positions and to form the regime of Good Governance of today,” President Sirisena said.
	He recalled how Ven. Sobitha Thera worked tirelessly for the welfare of the Sinhalalese, Tamils and Muslims during the conflict which could be termed as a national service and Yuga Mehewara.
	President Sirisena reiterated his pledge to create a just society, good governance, fully restore the rule of law and strengthen democratic institutions the Ven. Thera wished to establish through his campaigns.
	“The Ven. Thera being a Buddhist monk was completely a different character, who took a different path to create a just and decent society. It was a diversion of the commonly accepted path for Bhikkus. But his struggle itself took the better of his life and made the Thera sick and weak which created shock and sorrow among all of us. The greatest honour we can give Sobitha Thera is by following in the path he showed us and endeavouring to achieve a just society and good governance,” President Sirisena stressed and concluded his speech wishing the supreme bliss of Nirvana to the Thera.
