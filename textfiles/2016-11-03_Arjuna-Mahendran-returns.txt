Arjuna Mahendran returns


	

Central Bank's former governor Arjuna Mahendran, who was out of the country for almost a week, returned to the country a short while ago.

Mr. Mahendran left the country just days before the parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) released its report holding him responsible for the bond scam.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament last week that Mr. Mahendran had informed him about going abroad to attend a wedding.
