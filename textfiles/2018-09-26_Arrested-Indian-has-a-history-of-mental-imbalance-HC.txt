The Indian High Commission in Colombo on Wednesday said the Indian national, who had been arrested in Sri Lanka over the alleged assassination attempt of President Maithripala Sirisena, his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa and family members ‘has had a history of mental disturbance since 2000.’

A Spokesperson of the High Commission said they had seen media reports that an Indian national, claiming to have information about the threat to lives of prominent Sri Lankan leaders, had been detained by Sri Lankan Police.

“Taking a serious note of the matter and acting on limited information provided to us by Sri Lankan authorities, we immediately alerted Indian counterparts to conduct a background check of the said individual. Preliminary inputs indicate that the said individual has had a history of mental disturbance since 2000. We have shared the details with the Sri Lankan authorities and have assured them of full assistance and cooperation for conducting a thorough and professional investigation into the matter,” the Spokesperson said.
