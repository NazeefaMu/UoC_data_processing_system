The hanging gardens of Manhattan?

*Architectural firm OCA New York imagined stretching the Manhattan skyscraper vertically, adding gaps between every two floors
*Within these gaps are housed luscious green sculptural gardens - spaces that are accessible directly from the building's apartments
*Construction work is expected to begin in April or May of next year, a spokesperson for the developers said
*The tower will be built at 303 East 43rd Street, near the heart of Manhattan, and will be overseen by developers Triangle Assets
A set of stunning skyscraper designs look to combine urban living with the benefit of a suburban-style garden.
The proposals for the gleaming tower include entire floors that are dedicated to hanging gardens, blooming in the sun's rays.
Architectural firm OCA New York imagined stretching the conventional Manhattan skyscraper vertically, adding gaps of around five meters between every two floors. Within these gaps are housed luscious green sculptural gardens - spaces that are accessible directly from the building's apartments.
As a result of adding such spaces, the designs state that every 2,800-square-foot apartment would have around 1,400 square foot of open green space.
The tower will be built at 303 East 43rd Street, near the heart of Manhattan, and will be overseen by developers Triangle Assets.
Construction work is expected to begin in April or May of next year, a spokesperson for the developers said.
The designs that are currently in place will reduce the wind load on the building, provide sufficient sunlight to maintain the green and increase overall natural light - all without sacrificing the endless 360-degree views of the Manhattan skyline.
Manhattan has seen a trend towards ultra-slender residential towers which have been purchased as residential properties or by the private sector.
With this move away from New York's traditional, corporate-dominated skyscrapers, OCA believe there is more room for expression within these towers.
It is hoped that such a residential building will create a new way of urban living, providing some of the external benefits that are lost by living within an inner city apartment.
Eran Chen, the founder and executive director of ODA, said: "There is a huge disconnect between how we live in our cities and what we need, as human beings, for quality of life.
'By 'stretching' the building vertically beyond its original program, we were able to create gaps, 16 feet in height, between every two floors.
'I don't think that we should be forced to choose between enduring in the city or escaping to suburban areas.
'So with all of our projects we look for ways to amplify natural light and provide access to green spaces, and this is the ultimate example.
