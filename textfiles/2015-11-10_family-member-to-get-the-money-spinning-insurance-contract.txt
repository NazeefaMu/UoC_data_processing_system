There is a big insurance scheme in operation at a certain government institution coming under the purview of a key Ministry. It has always been the practice in the past to award the contract to provide the cover package under this insurance scheme to a state-owned insurance company.
A rumour is abuzz in city business circles these days that the political bigwig in charge of the portfolio is planning to award this insurance contract worth Rs.200 million to a family member. Meanwhile, the trade union activists highly concerned about this move by the political bigwig known for his double talk and nepotism have decided to make representations to the new Big Boss and his second in command, they say.
