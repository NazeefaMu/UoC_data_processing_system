A former Wayamba PC chairman and a member of the Blue party who were badly disappointed when their claims were rejected and a complete ‘outsider’ appointed as the organizer of an electorate located close to Kurunegala had immediately joined forces with the joint opposition, they say.

 


These two local politicos who had closely associated with a Blue party front-liner from the inception of their political career had distanced themselves from the JO up to the time of being overlooked for the organizer post.
