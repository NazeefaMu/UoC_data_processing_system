Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today accepted UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena’s challenge to a debate on the economic crisis and in turn challenged former president and finance minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to a debate on his government’s economic policies which resulted in the country being mired in an economic crisis.
The minister said he accepted the challenge because it was only ethical and reasonable that he took part in a debate with a person of a similar interenst in the subject.
“This is why as the current finance minister I challenge the former finance minister to a debate. Mr. Rajapksa is a major critic of the current economic policies. I like to debate on the subject of how the previous administration ruled this country for 12 years and ruined its economy. It is because of the political interference and mismanagement by the Rajapaksa regime that the economy is in ruins,” he told Daily Mirror.
The minister said he hoped the former president would come forward to address these issues and pointed out that if he was worried, concerned or unable to accept the challenge then Mr. Rajspaksa could send his ‘mouthpiece’ Bandula Gunawardena to the debate.
The minister said opposition members were at a loose end unaware of what steps to take next and that was why they were challenging him to a debate and planing to submit a no-confidence motion against him.
“Various elements keep throwing challenges but we have done so much to revive and maintain the economy during these 120 days,” he said.
On Saturday, Mr. Gunawardena challenged either the minister or Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva to a debate on the current economic crisis in the country.
The deputy minister has accepted the challenge and said Mr. Gunawardena had gone missing soon after. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
