Anuradhapura tanks filled to the brim

All main, medium and small scale tanks in the Anuradhapura district are filled to the capacity due to torrential rains. District Irrigation Director S. M. A. Nelugolla said no damage is reported to any tank. Farmers can continue their Maha season cultivations without any shortage of water, he said.
Meanwhile, referring to 3,056 minor irrigation tanks under the Agrarian Services Department, Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Services Development Commissioner S. Y. D. A. Somawansa said 1,700 small tanks were holding water capacity between 75 percent and 100 percent whereas the water capacity of 700 minor irrigation tanks was at the level of 50 percent to 75 percent. Farmers depending on village tanks will cultivate around 80,000 hectares or more during the Maha cultivation season, the Assistant Commissioner said.
