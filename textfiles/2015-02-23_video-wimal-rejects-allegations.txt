Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa today rejected the allegations levelled against his wife Shashi Weerawansa as possessing a fake diplomatic passport and said the charge was ‘a complete lie’
He said he would prove that the allegations were false in court.
Addressing journalists outside the CID office in Colombo, Mr. Weerawansa said the Yahapalana Officials had been agitated by the huge turnout at Nugegoda Rally and that therefore they were attempting to end his political career.
 “They would also make allegations against our children in future,” he said. (Sanath Desmond and Lahiru Pothmulla)
