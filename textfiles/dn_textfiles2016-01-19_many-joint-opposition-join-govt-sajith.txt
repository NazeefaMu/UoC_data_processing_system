Many in joint opposition to join govt: Sajith

Several joint opposition members will soon join the government, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
Speaking at a public event at Hambatota, Premadasa said that the government was assured of a two thirds majority in Parliament to pass the constitutional reforms.
The minister also predicted that the so-called joint opposition will cease to exist in the near future as most of its members have now realised it has no future.
He said even in the Rajapaksa stronghold of Hambantota, UPFA members who earlier backed the so-called joint opposition were now supporting the government.
Premadasa also denied reports that those joining the government were doing so for positions and perks and added, they were doing so to support the government’s development drive and serve the country.
“We are making them partners in the government’s development drive.
We are giving them responsibilities to make them active stakeholders in this process,” he added.
Premadasa said the government had already proved it can obtain a two thirds majority in the House when it passed the last budget.
