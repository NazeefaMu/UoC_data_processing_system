United National Party (UNP) MP Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday whatever the President or the Prime Minister said during this election period should not be taken seriously.

He said that was a matter to be considered after the election.

“What is said by the President or the Prime Minister during election time should not be taken seriously. We will have to consider these matters in the future,” he told journalists during an election campaign at Bloemendhal.

He said this in response to a question about the Marapana Committee recommendations about assistant leadership of the UNP. (Ajith Siriwardana)
