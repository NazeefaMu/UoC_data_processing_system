Construction of 65,000 houses to commence soon
	
The construction of 65,000 houses for conflict affected families in the North-East will begin in the next two months and the selection of beneficiaries is being carried out by District and Divisional Secretaries of the two provinces right now, a senior Cabinet Minister said.
Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M.Swaminathan speaking exclusively to Daily Mirror from India yesterday said there would be no calling of new tenders or revisit of the tender offered to Arcelor Mittal Construction in France or call tenders afresh as requested by the Joint Opposition.
Reluctantly though, we have to accept one fact which is that local contractors or investors are not capable of undertaking a massive project of this magnitude. That is why we offered the tender to Arcelor Mittal which is a globally recognised multinational construction company. We also want to finish the task within the targeted time and resettle 65,000 families in two years, Minister Swaminathan said.
Elaborating on the controversial housing project he said the Cabinet has decided to award the tender to this prestigious French construction company to ensure the quality and durability of the houses to be built. There were doubts whether a local company would successfully complete the project in a given time frame and whether required resources and raw material like sand, cement, bricks, roofing and human resources were available in the local market.
Minister Swaminathn said priorities will be given in the allocation of houses to conflict affected people residing in welfare centres, conflict affected women headed families, families with disabilities due to conflict, families with missing persons and disappearances due to conflict and refugee returnees who lost their shelters and lived in welfare camps.

New Year strengthens reconciliation among communities - President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said that the New Year is the foremost national and cultural festival of the Sinhala Buddhists and Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka. The importance of the New Year is that they celebrate it upholding their rich cultural traditions and values.

Issuing a message, the President said;
One of the great and significant moments of the New Year customs and traditions is preparing and partaking meals by all of us in all solemnity at the same auspicious time. New Year is a combination of customs and traditions like sharing and appreciating, respecting elders and giving gifts to each other. Lets determine to celebrate this New Year with due consideration to the core values of this festival and sustaining our distinctive cultural heritage.
The New Year is a colourful spring festival, which symbolises the movement of the sun from MeenaRashiya (the house of Pisces) to MeshaRashiya (the house of Aries) and it also rekindles our relationship with the beauty of nature. This is a time when houses are filled with the joy and sweet words of hospitality, come, sit and eat. I see the New Year festival as a link that promotes and strengthens reconciliation among the communities.
I call upon every Sri Lankan to celebrate this years New Year in a way to actively contribute to building a country free of intoxicants, adhering to the national programme initiated by us.
I extend my heartiest wishes to everybody to have an auspicious New Year. May milk-rice be cooked even in the poorest of the household; a smile be blossomed on the lips where there was no laughter; tenderness and kindness replace violence and hatred; amity and goodwill supercede rivalry and antagonism.
Lets determine to rise as One Country - One Nation unhindered by divisions or disparities but genuine peace and equality, and to build a drug-free, alcohol-free country in the New Year commencing today.
I wish you all a very happy New Year!"

New year symbolising national unity-MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his Sinhala and Tamil New Year message said that this is a time when the Sinhala and Tamil people conduct traditional New Year observances at the same auspicious times, symbolising national unity and reconciliation.
I wish the people of Sri Lanka a happy and prosperous new year. The New Year is an annual celebration of North-South unity which could not be shattered even by the gunfire and bombs of terrorists.
The New Year is celebrated with hopes of prosperity and well-being in the coming year. This is a time when we should be mindful about agriculture and food security. We must not forget the agrarian roots of this festival which is all about food production, self-sufficiency and a vibrant domestic agriculture. It is the duty of adults to pass on our new year observances and practices to the younger generation to ensure that our traditions survive.
We must be thankful for being able to celebrate the New Year in a country that is now free of war. By the Sinhala and Tamil New Year of 2009, the war against terrorism had entered its final and decisive phase. As we express our gratitude to Mother Nature for her bounty during the New Year festival, I believe we should at the same time remember the war heroes who brought peace to this country.
I wish you a happy and prosperous new year!"
