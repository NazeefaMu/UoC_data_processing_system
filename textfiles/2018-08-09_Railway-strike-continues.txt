The work stoppage by the Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA) is continuing in the absence of any signs of the matter being resolved, RTUA Co-Convener Lal Ariyaratne today said.

Mr. Ariyaratne said no discussion had been offered to them by any authority concerned and added that the strike would continue.

“We have launched a sudden strike, which started at 3.00 pm yesterday until further notice over several issues including salary anomalies,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Education Ministry confirmed no disruption had been made on students who were attending the GCE Advanced Level (AL) Examination due to the railway strike. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
