MR’s security detail first reduced, then restored


	

In a dramatic turn of events, only hours after the government decided to reduce the security given to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa by a further 50 personnel, it was restored without an explanation being given on the about-turn.

Initially, an order was sent to recall 50 personnel attached to the security detail of Mr. Rajapaksa. They had, in fact, been specifically identified. However, by late last night, the order was cancelled. Sources close to Mr. Rajapaksa said the reason for the change of heart was not known.   
Earlier, soon after May Day, 42 personnel attached to the security detail of the former president were recalled. The governments said it was done after a threat assessment being conducted.  (Kelum Bandara)
