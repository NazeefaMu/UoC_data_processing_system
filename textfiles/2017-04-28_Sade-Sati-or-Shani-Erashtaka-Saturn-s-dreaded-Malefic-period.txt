Sade Sati or Shani Erashtaka Saturn’s dreaded Malefic  period


	



 

By Sandagomi
Shani or Senasuru Erashtaka is a familiar term to people in Sri Lanka.  In Vedic Astrology Shani Erashtaka is referred to as Sade Sati. 


People in our country also know that Saturn is the most malefic or evil of all planets. 

 

Peculiar to Saturn


There are several other planets like the Sun, Mars, Rahu and Ketu who are considered natural malefics, but Vedic Astrology has not assigned a particular malefic period to them during their transit through the 12 signs of the Zodiac or the 12 Bhavas (Houses) in the Horoscope.  Therefore, Erashtaka or malefic period is something peculiar to Saturn.

 

Three different Erashtakas


Saturn, according to Vedic Astrology, causes three types of Erashtaka. They are Lagna Erashtaka, Ashtamaya Erashtaka and Jamma Erashtaka.  Of these three evil periods the most malefic one is Jamma Erashtaka. 


Jamma Erashtaka signifies either Saturn conjoining the Moon in a sign at birth or Saturn’s advent to the sign the   Moon occupies during its journey through the Zodiac. The advent of Saturn to the sign previous to the sign which the Moon occupies at birth marks the beginning of Jamma Erashtaka.  Saturn’s transit in the sign which the Moon occupied at birth is considered the mid-part of the Erashtaka.  Saturn’s transit in the sign next to it is the last part of the malefic period.  The Erashtaka ends with Saturn leaving the last of the three signs.  For example, say, the Moon occupied the Aries (Mesha) sign at birth. The Shani Erashtaka would begin when Saturn enters Pisces (Meena) sign. The Erashtaka would end only when Saturn leaves the sign next to Aries i.e. Taurus (Vrushabha).
Saturn takes about 2 ½ years to travel past one sign in the Zodiac.  Therefore, the length of Shani Erashtaka is about 7 ½ years.  Ashtamaya Shani Erashtaka is an exception to this general rule, duration of which is restricted to 2 ½ years. 


A native would come under the Lagna Shani Erashtaka either when Saturn is placed in the Lagna with the Moon at birth or when Saturn travels in the sign before the Lagna – the 12th House, in the Lagna and in the sign next to it or in the 2nd House. In the first case, the Erashtaka runs for about 5 years and in the latter case its duration is 7 ½ years. 


Ashtamaya Shani Erashtaka is Saturn’s transit in the 8th House in the horoscope. The duration of this Erashtaka as stated before is only 2 ½ years. 

 

Principle governing Ashtamaya Erashtaka


The principle relating to the duration of the other two Erashtaka, Jamma and Lagna does not apply to this Erashtaka due to valid reasons.  The House next to the 8th is the 9th which is a trine or a Moolatrikona in the horoscope where even malefic planets produce favourable results.  Saturn, despite being a malefic planet would not normally produce evil results when he occupies the 9th House.  The House before the 8th is the 7th.  Saturn is powerful in the 7th House and he commands Digbala in this House. Normally he would not produce evil results when he is in the 7th House. This explains why the Ashtamaya Erashtaka duration is restricted to 2 ½ years. 

 

Signs that mitigate the evil effects of Saturn


It is noteworthy that Saturn would not cause serious harm to the native when he is passing through certain signs. They are: Libra, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius.  Saturn causes maximum possible damage to the native when he passes through the sign of Cancer.

 
There are good reasons why Saturn is partial to the signs, Libra, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius.  Saturn attains exaltation in Libra. Sagittarius is the favorite sign ruled by Jupiter and Saturn becomes powerless to cause evil when he is in this sign.  Capricorn and Aquarius are ruled by Saturn himself and he normally causes no evil when he is occupying his own abodes.
