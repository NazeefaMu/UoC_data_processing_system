An evening of classical music awaits music lovers country wide as ‘Swetha Bhumi Gee Miyesiya’ is all set and ready to hit the stage with high notes this week, Friday (November 24). The show will be held at the Maharagama Youth Centre auditorium from 6.30 p.m onwards.

A fund raising project aimed at donating a computer lab to the Monaragala Dehikindagama Vidyalaya, the musical show also stands out as the very first initiative organised by the Aorta Sri Lanka Foundation. The Foundation itself is a new found organization with its mission focused on extending a helping hand to the less fortunate.   
Commenting on their first huge initiative, Founder and Instructor of the Aorta Sri Lanka Foundation and Medical Officer of the Neuro Surgical Unit of the National Hospital of Colombo, Dr. Upul Narandeniya explained that the school is located in a rural area and lacks the facility of a computer lab, which is felt as a vital need for various academic purposes. “The Principle of the Monaragala Dehikindagama Vidyalaya is Mr. D.M.L. Dissanayke and the school boasts of having a high rate of students who successfully pass the grade 5 scholarship examination.
