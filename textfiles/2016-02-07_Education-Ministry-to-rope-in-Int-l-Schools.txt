The Ministry of Education would bring in new regulations for International Schools to bring the education of International Schools under the purview of the Education Ministry, Ministry Secretary W. M. Bandusena said.

The move follows the election manifesto of the Government.

“The ministry will focus on the quality of education provided by international schools and facilitate them to upgrade the education of the students studying at international schools,” he said.

“We have received complaints from authorities of some international schools that they had faced difficulties in certain instances including getting text books on time. They had said that they preferred that International Schools are supervised by the Ministry. Therefore, the Ministry is now focusing on bringing those schools into the mainstream. When they are attached to the State system, they will be monitored by the Ministry,” he said.

However, he said the Ministry did not plan to control the International Schools by interfering into the administration of the schools.

He said the regulations would be implemented after several rounds of discussion with the representatives of these schools.

“I cannot give an idea of what kind of regulations will be implemented as the process in still at discussion level. But, I can assure that the programme is focusing to facilitate the International Schools since it is the responsible of the Ministry to supervise the education of those who study at these schools,” Mr. Bandusena said.

Meanwhile, General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers Union Joseph Stalin said that the Government should take over all International Schools. (Piyumi Fonseka)
