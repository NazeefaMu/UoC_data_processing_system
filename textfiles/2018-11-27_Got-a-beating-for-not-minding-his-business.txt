Got a beating for not minding his business!


	

A Coordinating Secretary of a political heavyweight was badly roughed up by an angry crowd on the day the posse of Policemen had to protect the chair of the august assembly.

 


An attempt by him to enter the chamber earlier along with his boss had been foiled. However, when the political heavyweight was coming out, the man had rushed to his side and presenting himself as a protective shield, had tried to prevent others from even talking to him. Angered by his high-handed manner, some of the crowd had violently treated the man, they say.


The secretary had later protested that he was only trying to protect his boss, but his unsympathetic colleagues had told him, “You got what you really deserved!”
