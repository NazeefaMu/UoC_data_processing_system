England beat Colombia 4-3 on penalties after Eric Dier scored the decisive spot kick to send them through to a World Cup quarter-final against Sweden.

England had previously lost all three World Cup shootouts and three of four in the European Championship but prevailed on Tuesday when Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca failed to convert, leaving Dier to win the game for England.

It was the first time Colombia had been involved in a World Cup shootout and they took first blood when Jordan Henderson missed his spot kick - but for once fortune smiled on England.

Earlier, Harry Kane smashed in a 57th-minute penalty, his sixth goal of the tournament, and England looked to be through until Yerry Mina headed an equaliser in the third minute of stoppage time. (aljazeera)
