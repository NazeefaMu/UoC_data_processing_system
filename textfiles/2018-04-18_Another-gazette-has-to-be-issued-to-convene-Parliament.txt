President Maithripala Sirisena will have to issue another gazette notification specifying the time as to when the new Parliament sessions would commence if the House is to convene on May 8, 2018, Parliament sources said yesterday.

Deputy Secretary-General of Parliament Neil Inddawela who confirmed this situation told Daily Mirror that President will have to issue another gazette notification specifying the time which the House would convene.

“There is an option as President could either specify the date and the time when the house would be convened when he is issuing the gazette notification to prorogue Parliament,” Mr. Inddawela said.

In this particular case, he said President will have to issue another gazette notification to specify the time when the House would convene.

The President is expected to issue another gazette notification when he returns from his tour to London according to Parliament Sources.
