Briton Geraint Thomas wins Paris-Nice

 
Nice, Sunday: Briton Geraint Thomas claimed his maiden Paris-Nice victory on Sunday after the seventh and final stage won by Belgium's Tim Wellens. Thomas, who only took the race leader's yellow jersey off Australian Michael Matthews on Saturday's stage, finished four seconds ahead of two-time Tour de France winner Alberto Contador of Spain.
The 29-year-old Welshman's victory was Team Sky's fourth in five editions of the Paris-Nice.
