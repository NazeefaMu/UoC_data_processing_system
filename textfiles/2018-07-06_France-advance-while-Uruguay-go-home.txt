France advance, while Uruguay go home, 2-0


	

Raphael Varane's glancing header and a goalkeeping blunder that gifted Antoine Griezmann a soft goal gave France a 2-0 victory over Uruguay in the first World Cup 2018 quarter-final.

Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera had no real chance of stopping Varane’s first-half header, but his massive error on Antoine Griezmann’s second-half laser ended all hope for a team already down one of its two true scoring threats in Edinson Cavani.

As a result, France advanced to the World Cup semifinals for the first time since its run to final in 2006. Les Bleus will face either Brazil or Belgium on Tuesday in St. Petersburg.
