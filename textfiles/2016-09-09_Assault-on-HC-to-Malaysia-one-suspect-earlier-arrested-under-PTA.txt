One of the five suspects who had been arrested over the assaulting of Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to Malaysia, Ibrahim Ansar, at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, was reported to be a man who was arrested in Sri Lanka under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the Joint Opposition said yesterday.

Speaking at a media briefing, Joint Opposition member A. H. M. Azwer MP said several Tamil newspapers in Malaysia had reported that the suspect, named Kalei Mugilan, had been released after his jail term.

“It has been reported to us that the five men including Mugilan had gone up to Mr. Ansar at the airport premises and threatened him and asked him to reveal the whereabouts of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who was then in Malaysia for the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP). Mr. Ansar had denied providing them with any information about Mr. Rajapaksa,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
