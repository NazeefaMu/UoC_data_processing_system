PM asks Vijayakala to resign


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had requested State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran to resign from her State Ministerial post, sources close to Premier Wickremesinghe said today.

Mr Wickremesinghe had advised Ms Maheswaran to resign when he met her for a special discussion on Wednesday night.

Meanwhile, the UNP has decided to continue the disciplinary inquiry even if she resigns from her post.
A committee to carry out the inquiry is to be appointed shortly.

Ms Maheswaran came into the center of controversy after she called for the resurgence of LTTE at a State function held in Jaffna recently. (Yohan Perera)
