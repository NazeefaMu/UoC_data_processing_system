Some guidelines for the new constitution

It is in the Sri Lankan Government's agenda to move a resolution in Parliament for converting the House into a Constitutional Assembly, marking the formal inauguration of the process of making a new Constitution in the place of the 1978 Constitution. Most significant truth of the constituting any constitution is, it must contain living provisions. Instead of mere declarative existence, the pragmatically living life must be its central trait. Otherwise, it will be tantamount to be dead in death. But, for the constitution to live, it should be peopalized. It can be peopalized via protecting their rights, by means of the guarantees of constitutional provisions. Then, it is the people, who truly power the competence of the constitution. Therefore, in any constitutional composition or revision, aimed at the culmination into its fruition, an innovative explosion in to the revolution of peoples' rights and their constitutionalization represents a pivotal importance.
The writer of the present text cannot cover all statutory guiding maxims herein, due to the finite space, available to be accessible. Hence, his humble wish is, to be pertained to some of them that are in correspondence with frustrated times. The writer also proposes the Government, not to limit the constitutional revision, only to a confined set of provisions, amending powers of the President, increasing the competence of the Parliament, relinquishing the proportional representation etc, but to espouse a holistic approach to near the proximity of completion and perfection.
Sri Lanka was an exploited colony, with discernible pluses and condemnable minuses of the British rule. Hence, in the context, it comprises its own historical experience and also the circumstances, occurred subsequent to its independence. That is on one side. On the other, when the first constitution of Sri Lanka was framed, its framers brought to their deliberations a coherent philosophy, to manage the means and ends of the governance. This philosophy of governance incorporated several major political doctrines. Among them are: natural rights, republicanism, and constitutionalism. These ideas were part of the common intellectual currency of eighteenth century of the civilized world.
Right to life (R2L)
The constitutional story of Sri Lanka, related to right to life, is not only infelicitous, but tragical. From the very inception, up to now, no provision in any constitution of this resplendent island has been formulated, to guarantee the right to life to our citizens. The only endeavour to include this inalienable right to the constitution of Sri Lanka was made, by the erstwhile President Chandrika Bandaranaike, back in 2000, when she produced before the Parliament, the Sri Lanka Constitution Bill, the act, to repeal and replace the constitution of Sri Lanka, the Chapter 3, Article 8, Paras:1 & 2, of which wrote:"
(1) Every person has an inherent right to life and a person shall not be arbitrarily deprived of life.
(2) Any restriction shall not be placed on the rights declared and recognized by this Article.
Unfortunately, the proposed constitution contained other issues and on the strength of them, the whole Bill was crushed by the politicians of the then Parliament and along with it, the above right too was quashed. The R2L is the most centro-prominent fundamental right of all human beings and animals. The intensity of its eminence and the extraordinary and outstanding depth of its dominance, not only not debatable and indubitable, but absolutely absolute. As the fundamental law is for the country, so is the R2L for the populace.
R2L Judicial theory
The Jurisprudential interpretation of R2L should not be constrained by its general constitutional declaration, to the exclusion of its statutory depth and legitimate versatility. The R2L, envisaged by the above said Constitution Bill, proposed by the former President CBK, certainly is a very progressive stride in the adventurous journey, yet, not variegated enough, as to be diversified, in order to accommodate, if not all, at least, the majority of jurisprudentially debatable issues and rightly address them, in order to administer justice, to the judicially illiterate and innocent people of this country.
Firstly, the present writer wishes to respectfully draw the kind attention of the constitution framers, to the interpretation and determination of the subjects of the provision in question. Who are the subjects covered by the provision? Is it the State or any other department or cooperation, acting on its behalf or at the behest of it? Or is it both, the state and its operative organs? Are normal citizens, as individuals, included in the doctrinal concept? Or are they excluded? If a violation of a private individual amounts to the encroachment upon deprivation of another's life, would such infraction fall, within the parameters of the stipulated provision?
Tribal traditions
There are laws, grounded on brutal tribal traditions of uncivilized nomadic community of the ancient times. For example, chopping fingers of and beheading the believers of other religions or stoning to death etc. Such uncivilized ancestors of the humanity, though very unfortunate, can be pardoned, since, they, materially and intellectually, were not developed. This is the twenty first century with man, reaching the material moon, which some communities worship, in the recognition of its divinity. Sri Lanka is a land of the Buddha, Lord Krishna, Jesus Christ and with some Islamic community. Here, the absolute majority of religions teach love, loving-kindness, compassion and equality. Therefore, the advent of extremist religions and introduction of their animalistic traditions would contaminate the innocent minds of our people and polarize the populace in to conflicting frictions.
It is really amazing that in some communities, there are laws on divorce, according to which, if a man wishes to divorce his wife, all what he has to do is, call two friends or people walking on the road and pronounce a specific word of their language three times, before the wife and two witnesses. The meaning of the word in English is: "divorced, divorced and divorced" and that's all. As a scholar of International Law, back in the university, abroad, while listening to the professor, I and many other friends-students stunned in to speechlessness and could not believe in our own eyes.
Therefore, a provision should be made for the new constitution, disallowing and prohibiting the introduction, teaching and practice of such tribal traditions in this beautiful country, as a device to depolarize all the communities, conditioning their unity, understanding, sharing friendship and cooperation.
Natural rights
Formulating the constitutional provisions, the framers should wish to think seriously about government and, there are certain basic questions, Lankans must pose. For example, we need to figure out, how legitimate governments are established, or to put it in slightly different terms, it should be asked, "What is the foundation of legitimate political authority?" The people also will want to determine, what the extent of political authority ought to be. Should political authority extend to all aspects of life or only to certain of our actions? This question is closely related to the problem of deciding, why we need a constitution and a government at all. To figure out, why we would prefer to live under a constitution-governed government, than to have no government, is to answer one of the basic questions of governance philosophy and will help us to determine, what constitution type, the people should decide on and what governance, the instituted Government must execute.
Sri Lanka has to make an earnest choice. That is to continue with a strong presidential system or to create a blended model with president and parliament or to design a supreme parliament. As for the presidential system, Sri Lankans had enough of it with differing political leaders. The practice has demonstrated that a strong president is a post, pregnable with the potentiality of danger, which may obliterate the freedoms and democracies of the people, to a perceptible degree. Therefore, a polity, rooted in civilized democratic principles, which would protect inalienable rights of all individuals of the island, is a sine qua non, for any constitution to be framed for Sri Lanka.
There is a reason for it. The individuals possess these rights, not because of politicians, but, simply by virtue of their humanity. They antedate the existence of any constitution, politician or a government. The authority exercised by governments, is exerted, on the basis of the consent of the governed and they consent to the execution of that authority, in order to acquire security for their natural rights to life, liberty and properties.
Hence, the constitution designing legal experts must be theoretically well-armed with the best answers for couple of questions, in order to discard the despotism of dictators.
The example of history cannot be viewed as authoritative. History will show what has been and not what should be. Many rulers have acquired power simply by deceiving the trusting public of innocence. After capturing power, it was used primarily to aggrandize themselves. This, however, generally cannot be regarded as an example of legitimate political authority and its validated use. To determine the difference between legitimate and illegitimate political authority, we must engage in a contemplative philosophical reflection, in which, we attempt to make arguments, supporting our view of the difference, between good and bad governance of Governments, in the plenitudinal spirit of constitutional consistency.
Social contract
It is seen that in some countries, in framing the contents of constitutions, the framers formulate such legal provisions, empowering the Head of the State, not to be subject to the law of the country, violating the principle of all-pervading equality of all, before the law. This unfortunate state of despotism is due to lack of knowledge or by reason of intentional abuse of the power, consented and delegated by the general public. This is just an occasion, no constitution composer could miss. Yet, how this consent is granted? It was originally given through the social contract, in which, the individuals give up the natural liberty they enjoyed, in the state of nature, in exchange for the civil liberty, possessed by the citizens of politically democratized and constitutionalized society. The difference between the two is: "The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of Nature for his rule and role. The liberty of man in society is to be under no other legislative power, but to be under that, established by consent of the community. Nor to be under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but, to be ruled, by what the legislative shall enact, according to the trust consciously deposited in it. The freedom of men under a constitutionalized government, is to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it, by the social contract of people's consent. One of the prerogatives, the appointed Sri Lankan team for the revision of the constitution should bear in their minds is, not the elite, comprising the handful, but the general public, constituting the totality of the community. No constitution could be legitimate in the void of the respect to the social contract.
Extent and end
It is really inquisitive to identify the extent and end of government's authority to be constitutionalized. The great and chief end, therefore, of men, uniting into socialized communities, and putting themselves under a constitutionalized government, is the preservation of their rights and property. The power of the society or the legislative, constituted by them, can never be supposed to extend farther than the common good. The exercise of political authority thorough governance, granted by the constitution, ought to be limited to those actions, which are necessary for the accomplishment of those tasks, for which that authority was established. What are those tasks? They are: the attainment of security for the lives, liberties, and estates of the citizens.
What this means, of course, is that in addition to believing that political authority, engendered by the constitution, must be based on socio-contractual consent and it has to be organized in such a fashion, that, it could not be exercised in arbitrary ways. Yet, the liberty of a political society consists in being subject, only to the lawfully constituted and exercised authority, to which, people have consented. The problem at this point of framing the constitution of Sri Lanka is, to find a way of organizing the governance of the government, in such a manner, that it will do only those things, which government is supposed to do.
Self-evident articulation
The most important phrase, the depth of the constitutional insight of Sri Lanka, ineluctably must comprise is, "We hold above truths to be self-evident". To be self-evident, the constituting terminology of the constitution must be comprehensible and after the comprehension it should be able to be apprehensible. Now, the comprehensibility and the subsequent apprehensibility demand linguistic simplicity. The much clamoured noise, that the terminology of the fundamental law of the country cannot be articulated in simple linguistics, is an old cry of condemnable boredom, which leads no one to anywhere. Those, who yell thus, are from among those, with vested interest, wishing to seed the innocent people in the ambiguous constitutional obscurity, in order to castrate the power of their individuality, converting them in to spados and impotents. This is one sine qua non, the framers of the Sri Lanka constitution, must be pragmatic about. And the proposal should not be confined only to English, but to all three languages, including Sinhala and Tamil.
