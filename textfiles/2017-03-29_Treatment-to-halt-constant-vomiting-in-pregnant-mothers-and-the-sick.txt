Treatment to halt  constant vomiting  in pregnant mothers  and the sick


	



Vomiting in the early stages of pregnancy is common and  many mothers go through it. Ayurvedic physician D.D.A. Hettiarachchi  enlightens us on an ancient practice that has been forgotten in  society.   

The method
Find some shards of a fresh and unused clay pot or buy a a  water pot better known as a “Navum Kalaya” from a local pot vendor.  Expose the pot to extreme heat by setting seven or eight coconut shells  on fire. Place the clay pieces in the fire until the shards become  change their colour (at a certain higher temperature they appear to be  white in colour). Put the burning pot shards into clean lukewarm water.  Let the water cool and remove the shards of clay. Filter the water using  a cloth and administer the water in small quantities to the vomiting  person. “This is the ancient saline used by our people” Dr.  Hettiarachchi emphasized adding that special care of cleanliness in the  process is a must.

  

The science behind the practice
Fresh clay in newly made pots includes salts. When the  freshly-built clay in a pot is burned and added to water, the salts in  the clay seep in, which is similar to saline that is given to the sick.     
According to the experience of Dr. Hettiarachchi, this treatment can be used to stop continuous vomiting in a patient.   


We also approached Consultant Community Physician – Dr.  Shanthi Gunawardena to ask about the stance of Western Medicine in such a  practice.   


“It could have certain properties as mentioned by the  Ayurvedic doctor. In western medical practice, it is difficult to  approve this treatment without scientifically tested results,” Dr.  Gunawardena said.
