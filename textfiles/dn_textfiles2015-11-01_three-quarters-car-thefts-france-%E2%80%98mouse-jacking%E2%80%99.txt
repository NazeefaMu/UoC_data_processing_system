Three quarters of car thefts in France by ‘Mouse Jacking’

FRANCE: Three quarters of car thefts in France are carried out using electronic hacking, it was claimed yesterday (Thursday), prompting calls for security improvements in a range of vehicles sold in Europe.
The Smart Fortwo model was France’s most stolen car, with the Ford Fiesta and Peugeot 406 models also popular among thieves who it is feared could use the same tactics in Britain.
The figures were disclosed two months after computer scientists in the UK warned that thousands of cars, including high-end marques such as Porsches and Maseratis, are at risk of electronic hacking. Their research was suppressed for two years by a court injunction for fear it would help thieves steal vehicles to order.
The kit required to carry out such “mouse jacking”, as the French have described the practice, can be bought on the internet for around pounds 700 and the theft of a range of models can be pulled off “within minutes”, experts say.
The figures prompted urgent calls by a leading French car magazine for manufacturers to “secure your cars”.
Many cars use radio frequency identification chips which are designed to verify the identity of the ignition key being used to start the car engine. If thieves get into the vehicle without the right key, the engine should refuse to start.
