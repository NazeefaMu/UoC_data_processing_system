Proceedings of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) on the ITN controversy were postponed for tomorrow.
Evidence was to be recorded from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today in connection with the non-payment of money owed to the ITN.
However, proceedings had to be postponed after the lawyers appearing for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa requested a document filed by the complainant.
Former president Rajapaksa had not reported to the commission today.
