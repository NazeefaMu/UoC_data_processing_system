Where phenomenal performers take centre stage


	

Seventh Guitar Fest of SL Guitar Association



The seventh guitar festival held by the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka was an improvement on the previous year, when this popular event which brings together guitarists and other musicians from this country and abroad seemed to lack direction and tottering due to internal disputes within the association.   
Despite the loss of its flamenco guitar component, principal organiser Mohammad Iqbal has evidently been able to put together a colourful and varied performance this time. The festival was held at six different venues, from Colombo to Kandy, Badulla and Jaffna, from January 21 onwards.   
That evening at the Russian Centre in Colombo, fans were treated to a different spectacle. Usually, Guitar Fest performers come casually dressed, the flamenco-attired musicians from the University of Performing Arts being the exception. This time, at least three groups of very young musicians came splendidly attired in cowboy outfits and played a joyful combination of guitar, violin, cello and drums, evoking the heady music of the Shadows era as well as Sri Lanka’s golden age of pop as exemplified by pop bands including the Golden Chimes. These energetic musicians have been trained and nurtured by Rohan de Silva, Wickrema Palliyamulla and Sumith Liyanage.   
Also dressed like a true performing artiste was young singer-guitarist K. P. Thilangi, who made a dazzling debut at last year’s Guitar Fest. She can not only look like a diva but sing like one too. A classical guitarist, she followed up a rendition of Asturias by Isaac Albenez with her own song, written by her sister in honour of the guitar. She has an impressive vocal range which brings to mind a blues singer, and was ably backed by a ‘family’ band which includes father K. P. Thilakaratne playing the Accordion, with her mother and husband playing percussion instruments.   
Japanese classical guitarist Ken Gonzo Sugamata is now a regular performer at the fest. The chubby, cheerful, classical guitarist performed his trademark ‘sing along’ track involving the audience, followed by a mellifluous rendition of Brazilian guitar music.   

 

"They played folk tunes which provided an interesting interlude in a programme otherwise geared to mainstream music, be it classical or pop"

 


Aditya Gandhi, a young Indian classical guitarist trained in the U.S., impressed the audience with his performance that included contemporary original compositions, particularly ‘Africa,’ an instrumental piece with haunting, evocative melody lines. Unlike some artistes, Aditya is quite articulate and able to communicate his ideas to the audience.   
While there was less classical guitar than usual, the electric guitar component was exciting with veteran heavy metal guitarist Andrew Obeysekara impressing with his virtuoso vibrato playing. Zion de Silva was a new face, blending rock, funk and heavy metal with aplomb. Saeed from the Maldives was another spirited performer who played several pieces including his own compositions with gusto, though his four pieces sounded a bit repetitive towards the end.   
An interesting new feature was provided by a duo of young musicians from Jaffna – Athputhan playing banjo and Bismarck playing udukee, a traditional percussion instrument. They played folk tunes which provided an interesting interlude in a programme otherwise geared to mainstream music, be it classical or pop.   

 


Mohamed Iqbal and his wife Gayathri Gananathapillai are regular performers at each guitar fest. Iqbal composes and sings his own songs, and this time he performed one he had written about national hero Keppetipola Disawe, first performed by him several years ago. Gayathri is a pan flute player and backs him with that instrument.   
Guitar Fest is an entirely voluntary effort and entry this time was free of charge as it has always been. As Aditya Gandhi noted at the event’s conclusion, people have the impression that music is moved worldwide by recording companies and industry giants. But the truth is that major contributions are made towards that end by individuals like Mohamed Iqbal. While many people and institutions contribute to make Guitar Fest a reality (this time, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Indian Cultural Centre contributed), it is no exaggeration to say that without Iqbal, there would be no Guitar Fest.
