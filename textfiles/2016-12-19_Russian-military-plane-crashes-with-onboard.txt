An IL-18 aeroplane belonging to the Russian defence ministry has crashed in Yakutia in Siberia with 39 people on board.

The defence ministry said 16 people were seriously injured, correcting earlier reports that 27 had died.

The plane was carrying 32 passengers and seven crew when it came down near Tiksi in the Bulun district of Russia's far east.

Weather conditions were reportedly bad in the area when the crash happened.

The plane was carrying out a scheduled flight from Kansk when it came down about 30km (18 miles) short of Tiksi at 04:45 (19:45 GMT Sunday).

The plane broke into three pieces in what appears to have been an emergency landing.

Three Mi-8 helicopters were despatched to the crash site by Russia's Emergency Ministry.

As well as the 16 seriously injured, another seven people on board the plane required hospital treatment.(BBC)
