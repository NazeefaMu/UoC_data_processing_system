A yahapalanaya purohita hailing from a well-known political family in the West has set his heart on setting up an LP Gas power plant in the Hambantota harbour premises. 

 


A close friend of this purohita is also closely associated with the latter in mooting this project. 
Meanwhile, the proposed project has come in for flak from several experts. However, the purohita in question is determined to go ahead with the project undeterred by protests and opposition, they say.
