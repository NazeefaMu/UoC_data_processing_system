The bus culture in Sri Lanka stinks!


	



 

The private bus industry is reaching a deteriorated condition. This situation is tarnishing the reputation of the country.   

Needless to say several countries in the world have better transport services, hence commenters can travel conveniently compared to Sri Lanka. We must be ashamed of our transport system.    

In Sri Lanka people are packed into buses like sardines. They can’t travel in comfort.  Bus commuters in Sri Lanka are forced to hear the indecent language used by the conductor. They also have to put up with the loud music played inside these buses.  The sound is so loud it deafens you.   

When inside the bus there is no polite talk at all. Bus journeys are an unpleasant experience. Most conductors don’t know how to talk to commuters. Only a handful of them indulge in gentle talk.   

 


Some bus conductors don’t give the balance to passenger. The passenger has to go behind the conductor to collect the balance. This bus culture  brings great injustice to the public.   


 

When a tourist travels by bus in Sri Lanka, he notices the culture that’s present. Is it fair by the rest of the citizens when foreigners judge our culture through what they witness in these buses. This behaviour tarnishes the country’s name, which we have built since the time of Prince Vijaya.   

On hearing this unprintable language small children get spoiled.  This language dulls the mind. They don’t know how to talk respectfully to a person.   

Some bus conductors don’t give the balance to passenger. The passenger has to go behind the conductor to collect the balance. This bus culture  brings great injustice to the public.   

When an elderly person boards a bus, the conductor may order him to go to the rear of the bus. But when he wants to disembark the conductor orders him to get down in a jiffy. This is so inhuman. They don’t consider even his age. How can an elderly person get down from a bus in such a hurry?    

Going by the principles of Buddhism we must respect our elders. In private buses most elders become frustrated. If a patient travels in such a bus his ailment aggravates. It is high time that the Government takes measures to correct these shortcomings in the private bus industry.   

First of all the Government should impose a set of rules to instill discipline in the private bus industry. Wrongdoers should be punished if they breach the rules. Their licenses should be canceled.   

Nobody can destroy our culture which is descending from the time of  Prince Vijaya. Maintain some standards in the private bus industry.
