A ‘love-sick’ Ministerial one hailing from the Uva has become a pain in the neck of a fair Diyawanna member from the hills, they say.
The Ministerial one, they say, has made it a habit to follow this fair member like Mary’s little lamb. “He is ever on the lookout for an opportunity to greet her and hold her hand while expressing his pleasure at meeting her,” a Diyawanna source said. The fair member has by body language conveyed the message that his amorous advances are not welcome. But the thick-skinned fellow keeps on annoying her, they say.
