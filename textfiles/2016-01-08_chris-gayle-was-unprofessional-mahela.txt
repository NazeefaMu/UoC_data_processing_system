Sri Lanka great Mahela Jayawardene says Chris Gayle did not handle himself well when he made suggestive comments towards a female TV presenter.
Gayle was slapped with a $10,000 fine from Melbourne Renegades over his comments to Channel Ten's Mel McLaughlin, which he described as a "simple joke" with no offence or disrespect intended.
Speaking after the Adelaide Strikers' BBL win on Tuesday night, Jayawardene said the big-hitting West Indian should have acted more professionally.
"I've known Gayle for a long time and he's a funny guy," Jayawardene said.
"I don't think he takes that many things seriously but obviously people react differently as well. I reckon we could probably tone it down a bit.
"At the same time, Chris should've realised that it was a much more professional situation and handled himself a bit better."
Gayle's comments provoked widespread condemnation as sexist and inappropriate, with former Test opener Chris Rogers saying he was concerned for the example his former Thunder teammate set for younger players.
But Jayawardene said the cricketing world should move on from the incident.
"I think we can move on from that - what has happened has happened," he said.(The Sydney Morning Herald)
