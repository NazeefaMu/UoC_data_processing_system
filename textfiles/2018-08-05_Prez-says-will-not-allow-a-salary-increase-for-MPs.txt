President Maithripala Sirisena said on Saturday that he would not allow a salary increase for Members of Parliament.

“I will not allow a salary increase to Parliamentarians even by 5 cents,” he said addressing an event in Polonnaruwa.

“Do you think I am getting a huge sum of money as the President? No I am only getting 95,000 per month as the salary, whereas ministers were getting more than 400,000 each per month,” the President said.
