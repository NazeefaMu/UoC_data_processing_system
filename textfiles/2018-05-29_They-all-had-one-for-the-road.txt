There is a PC, whose current lease is to end in another three months and its politicos and white-collar ones had a good time the other day at a grand bash held at a five-star hotel in Dambulla under the pretext of holding a workshop, they say.  

 


The so-called workshop which served as a happy term-end get-together had cost Rs.2.5 million which could have been used for a better purpose for the public good, they say.
