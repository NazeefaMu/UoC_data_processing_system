Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday announced that he had received copies of seven petitions filed in the Supreme Court against the Judicature Amendment Bill.

The Bill seeks to create a special permanent High Court-at-Bar which could sit daily to hear serious cases.

Several petitions have been filed against the Bill including Joint Opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane. Some of the government MPs including Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, State Ministers Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickramaratne and Ajith P Perera have filed counter petitions in favour of the Bill.
