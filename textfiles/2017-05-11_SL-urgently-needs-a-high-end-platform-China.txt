China has said Sri Lanka is in urgent need of a high-end platform and the Port City Project is planned in the best interests of Sri Lanka.

“Sri Lanka is in urgent need of a high-end platform to attract financial institutions, multinational companies, shoppers, tourists as well as providing jobs to well-educated locals as a part of its post-war reconstruction. The Port City project is planned in the best interests of Sri Lanka,” said Sun Ziyu, Vice President of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) in an interview with the South China Morning Post.

China is building a new city along Colombo’s coastline that will become the city’s central business district by 2030, creating 80,000 jobs for Sri Lankans, under the mainland’s “Belt and Road Initiative”.

With an initial investment of US$1.4 billion, Colombo Port City is China’s biggest project in Sri Lanka, a key node along the Maritime Silk Road of the Belt and Road plan.

Sun said the development within Sri Lanka’s biggest commercial city, which will be built on 269 hectares of reclaimed land, would accommodate 200,000 residents and consists of apartments, hotels, offices, shopping malls, exhibition centres.

He said the reclamation work had helped transform the area’s coastline which was previously hit by strong winds blowing towards the Indian Ocean making it less livable.

“This has also improved coastal protection, and is a boon to the environment,” he said.
