EU’s Mogherini sees military HQ ‘within days’


	

BRUSSELS AFP May18, 2017- EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said Thursday remaining differences over a planned military headquarters had been resolved and it could be formally launched in a few days.   


Diplomatic sources said previously that British objections to any suggestion the headquarters could have an operational military role had held up agreement but Mogherini stressed the way was now clear.   


 “I understand it is finalised. I understand we have a couple of days to have the official text in place,” Mogherini told reporters after an EU defence ministers meeting in Brussels.   


She stressed there was no holdup nor need to revisit the political decision all 28 member states took in March to set up the Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) facility.   


There had been some expectation that after EU foreign ministers approved a text Monday, the formal launch could be announced Thursday. 


Mogherini has led efforts for the EU to take on a much larger defence  and security role given the uncertainties raised over Washington’s  commitment to European security by President Donald Trump.
