The rise of English as a global lingua franca has encouraged more  innovative, reflective and rigorous research into the area of  second-language studies in Sri Lanka. In order to provide a forum for  such research, the Colombo University English Language Teaching Unit  will hold its second International Symposium on Language Studies at the  Arts Faculty on September 28 and 29 under the theme ‘English as a Second  Language: Knowledge, Learning and Production.’   

Proposals for papers, poster presentations and workshops  are now open, and must be submitted before July 17 for consideration.  Proposals can be made under the themes of Language and Education,  Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Innovation in Language Teaching,  Translation Pedagogy and Language, and Power and Ideology. Proposals  must be submitted in softcopy and hardcopy formats and a blind review  process will be followed. For more information on the preparation  guidelines for proposals and registration visit the website http://arts.cmb.ac.lk/eltu/symposium2017, email irsels2017@eltu.cmb.ac.lk or call 112-506 705.
