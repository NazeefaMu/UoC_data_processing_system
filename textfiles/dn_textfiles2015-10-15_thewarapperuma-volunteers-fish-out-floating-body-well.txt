Thewarapperuma volunteers to fish out floating body from well

UNP MP Palitha Thewarapperuma yesterday climbed down into a five-meter deep well in the Ittapana village in Mathugama, and brought out a body of a father of two.
He came forward to perform the task of taking out the body floating in a common well at Ittapaana when everybody refused to perform the task.
MP Thevarappuma climbed down into the well using metal bars which were on the side of the well. Thevrapperuma and villagers had to wait until 4.00 p.m. to take out the body because there was a delay in the arrival of the Judicial Medical Officer at the scene.
