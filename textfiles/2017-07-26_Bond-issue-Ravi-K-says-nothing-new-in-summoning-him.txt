Bond issue: Ravi K says nothing new in summoning him


	

Minister of Foreign Affairs Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said there is nothing new in summoning him to the Presidential Commission investigating the bond issue.

Minister Karunanayake came up with this remark in Parliament in response to Joint Opposition MP Mahindananada Aluthgamage who made some allegations against him earlier during the sessions.

“MP Aluthgamage was engaged in assassinating my character earlier during the sessions and the person who did that today faces corruption charges himself,” the Minister said.

He said what Mr Aluthgamage came up with in his speech in the House was not relevant for yesterday’s debate.

“ I was summoned to the Presidential Commission today but I informed the Commission that I cannot attend as it was important to attend Parliament sessions as a Minister,” he added.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
