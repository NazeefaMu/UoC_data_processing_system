	Nava Sama Samaja Party Leader Vickramabahu Karunaratne yesterday raised doubts whether MP Hirunika Premachandra followed the footsteps of her father who he identified as a hoodlum in Kolonnawa, as she attempted to resolve disputes among mobs.
	He mentioned that late Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra was a reputed hoodlum who settled disputes among people in Kolonnawa.
	“It looks like the daughter has taken up the same task of solving people’s issues,” he said.
	Commenting on the recent incident where a man was allegedly abducted by six supporters of Ms. Premachandra, he said no one could take the law into their own hands.
	Prof. Karunaratne, a key activist of President Maithripala Sirisena’s election campaign, pointed out that it was solely the police who had the authority to take action against illegal activities. “We wonder if this government is too practicing the previous government’s habit of abducting people. We have a police department to deal with crimes, and today the department is more independent than what it was in the past,” he told a news conference.
