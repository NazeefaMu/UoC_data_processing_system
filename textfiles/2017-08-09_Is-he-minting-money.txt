Is he minting money?


	



 

A story that had gone viral says that there is a Buddhist monk who regularly deposits big money in a private vault in a leading commercial bank. 

 


Even the stalwarts of the political party that the monk actively supports have begun wondering from where this endless stream of money is flowing into his hands. 


Some opine that the monk could be the custodian of the liquidity assets of a controversial yahapalanaya politico. 


The monk had also been seen very often hanging around the premises of some state-owned business undertakings. 


This monk residing in a city suburb that reminds one of banyan trees was the main topic of lobby gossip of Diyawanna members the other day, they say.
