Are Trump-aide Bannon’s days numbered?


	



(Daily Mail, Australia), 17.04.2017 - While Donald Trump’s Chief Strategist Steve Bannon remains at the White House, there’s ample evidence that he’s been cast out of the president’s inner circle.  

‘Vanity Fair’ did a deep dive on Bannon’s rift with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and found that Trump was fed up that his top aide was casting Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump as liberals, taking credit for the president’s popularity and saying he had conservatives in Congress under control during the health care reform push – when Bannon really did not.More superficially, Frank Bruni in a New York Times column titled ‘Steve Bannon was doomed,’ noted that not only did the slobbish Bannon pick a fight with Trump’s kin, but he did so with the sharply-dressed and svelte Kushner.
