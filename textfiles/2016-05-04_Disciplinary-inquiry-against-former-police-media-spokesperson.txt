The Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development Sagala Rathnayake had informed the IGP yesterday to conduct a disciplinary inquiry at Department level against the former police spokesperson ASP Ruwan Gunasekera relating to his conduct.

The report of the disciplinary inquiry is to be forwarded to the Minister Rathnayake within three days.

The Ministry had further instructed that until the instructions of the Minister is received basing on the findings of the disciplinary inquiry ASP Gunasekera should not be deployed in any duties connected with the media.

IGP Pujith Jayasundera had taken steps to remove ASP Gunasekera from the post of police spokesperson as he had exceeded his duty by issuing statements to the newspapers.

The Ministry is hoping to establish the office of the police spokesperson after completely reorganizing and putting in place a new code of conduct. (Anjula Maheeka Weerarathne)
