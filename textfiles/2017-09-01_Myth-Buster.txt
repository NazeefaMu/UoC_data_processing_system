MYTH: Anyone and everyone can bleach their teeth.  

BUSTED: “When it comes to bleaching you have to first assess the patient. If the patient has a lot of fillings we advise them not to go for bleaching. Bleaching is described as giving a whiter colour or a good appearance to your teeth. How long it lasts depends on the material that you are using. It can last between 5 to 10 years. This is very popular among people who belong to the younger generation, but you have to have a very good set of teeth with less fillings, no periodontal diseases, no tooth decay and no root exposure if dental experts are to give the green light for bleaching,” explained Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District.
