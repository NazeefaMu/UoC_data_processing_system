Will review pacts made with foreign buyers: SLPP


	

All agreements entered into with foreign buyers by this government to sell valuable properties in Colombo would be reviewed under our government, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said yesterday.

SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris claimed the government was attempting to sell valuable real estate properties in Colombo, shares in banks and other commercial enterprises.

“Under a SLPP government all these agreements will be reviewed and any transaction which is detrimental to Sri Lanka will be suspended. As such prospective buyers must consider the risk involved in going ahead with these agreements. There is reason to believe that large scale corruption is taking place when finalising these agreements,” he told a news briefing.

Prof. Peiris said the Central Bank (CB) bond scam was being swept under the carpet but assured that an SLPP government would initiate fresh inquiries into this fraud.

“We will bring down Arjuna Mahendran within a month of forming a government and drastic action will be taken against not only primary dealers such as the PTL but also those involved in aiding and abetting in this fraud. We will do our best to recover the financial loss incurred,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
