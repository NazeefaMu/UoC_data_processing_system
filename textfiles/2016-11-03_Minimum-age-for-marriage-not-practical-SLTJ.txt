A group of Sri Lanka Thawheed Jama'ath (SLTJ) Organisation members today staged a protest march in Maligawatta, Maradana against the move to amend the Muslim Marriage Act as a requirement to regain GSP+ from the European Union. The protestors said as long as other customary laws such as Thesawalamai and Kandyan laws remained unchanged, Muslim law should also not be altered. Some of the placards said that setting up of a minimum age for marriage was not practical. Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana
