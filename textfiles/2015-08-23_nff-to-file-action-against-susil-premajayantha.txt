The National Freedom Front (NFF), a constituent party of the UPFA, today claimed that it would take legal action against former UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha for including defeated candidates in the party’s national list replacing the original nominees.
NFF central working committee member Piyasiri Wijenayake, addressing a news conference at Abhayaramaya, said Mr. Premajayantha had violated the people’s mandate given to the party at the general elections.
"We condemn this move and will file a lawsuit in court against Mr. Premajayantha," he said. Mr. Wijenayake was also nominated by the UPFA in their National List but was not given an opportunity to enter parliament.
