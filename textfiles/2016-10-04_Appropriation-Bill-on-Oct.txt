Appropriation Bill 2017 on Oct.19


	

The Government has sought a special parliamentary sitting on October 19 to present the 2017 Appropriation Bill ahead of the annual budget debate.

Earlier, the government had intended presenting it on October 12. However, at yesterday’s Business Committee Meeting, the Finance Ministry said it could be only presented only on October 19.

The Appropriation Bill outlining allocations to be made for each ministry and seeking parliamentary approval for its passage through the House is presented ahead of the Budget speech.

Informed sources said the postponement would result in timetable of the annual budget debate being altered. The government was initially expected to present the Budget on November 10 by the Finance Minister. (Kelum Bandara)
