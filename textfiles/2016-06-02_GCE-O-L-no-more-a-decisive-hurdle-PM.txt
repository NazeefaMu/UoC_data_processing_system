The GCE Ordinary Level Examination will no longer be an exam which makes students pass or fail but an exam which merely promotes students to the next class in accordance with the new education system which this government intends to introduce, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.

“The students will be able to move on to the next class after they sit for the ordinary level exam. But few subjects will be made compulsory for those who intend to enter university after the advanced level examination. Every student will remain in school after the ordinary level examination and move on to the next class,” the Prime Minister said speaking at a ceremony held to mark the bi-centenary of Newstead Balika MV in Nogombo today.

He said it was part of the government’s plan to reduce the burden of examinations on students.

“The US which is the most powerful county in the world does not have any examinations in their education system. We too have to adopt a similar system,” he said

While making a pledge to create a revolution in education, Mr. Wickremeisnghe - a one-time Education Minister said several changes will be introduced to the education system of the country within the next two years.

“The Education Ministry will be responsible for determining the reasons as to why certain children don’t attend school and provide a solution to it. Doctors will be made to visit the children frequently and treat them. Schools will be given the right to choose their own text books as it was in the past,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
