Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) central committee will be convened next  week to decide on disciplinary action against those party members who participated in the ‘Paada Yatra’ the joint opposition protest march and the rally, a government Minister said today.

Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera told a media briefing held at the Government Information Department that action will be taken against the SLFPers who participated in the Paada Yatra.

“SLFP central committee which will be convened in a day or two will decide on those who participated in the joint opposition protest,” he said. Asked whether action will be taken against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Minister said action will be taken against all who participated in it.

At the same time Mr. Jaysekera said ‘Paada Yatra’ is being held prematurely.

“Such a protest march is usually held as a last resort to topple a government and therefore it would have been acceptable if the protest was held sometime in 2020 when the next national elections are held,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
