Britain to expel 23 Russian diplomats, cancel visits over nerve agent


	



 

Britain will expel 23 Russian diplomats accused of engaging in intelligence activities and cancel an invitation for a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday.


The measures are part of a “full and robust” response to the use of a Russia-developed nerve agent to poison a former double agent and his daughter in Britain, and Moscow’s refusal to account for the presence of the toxin, May told parliament.


Britain will also send no senior officials or members of the royal family to this year’s football World Cup in Russia, suspending “all planned high-level contacts” between London and Moscow, she said.
The Russian embassy in London condemned the expulsion of the diplomats as a “hostile action” that is “totally unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted.”


“All the responsibility for the deterioration of the Russia-UK relationship lies with the current political leadership of Britain,” the embassy said in a statement on its website.


Britain has summoned Russian Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko to inform him that the 23 Russian diplomats were being declared personae non gratae, the statement said.
