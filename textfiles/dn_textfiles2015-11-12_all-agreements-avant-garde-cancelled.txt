All agreements with Avant Garde cancelled

The government yesterday decided to cancel all agreements with Avant Garde Maritime Services and to hand over the relevant operations back to the Sri Lanka Navy, Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Senarate said that according to a Presidential directive the maritime security services conducted by the Avant Garde will be taken over by the Navy.
“All the weapons found in the floating armoury too will be handed over to the Navy,” he added.
According to Senaratne, the President had also ordered the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Attorney General’s Department to continue with probes related to the Avant Garde.
“The President instructed to conduct a comprehensive probe and punish those responsible if any illegal activities has taken place in relation to the activities of the Avant Garde,” he added.
According to Senaratne during the meeting, the Navy Commander had given a detailed descriptions of activities carried out by the maritime security firm.
Senaratne said that it was transpired at the meeting that a number of activities carried out by the firm were highly suspicious.
Senaratne also praised the swift measures taken by the President to give viable solutions to the controversy surrounding the Avant Garde maritime security firm.
Parliamentarians and heads of defense and legal sectors and all other stake holders participated at the meeting.
Prior to the special meeting, the President and the Prime Minister had a discussion on the Avant Garde issue, the sources said.
The private security firm’s activities came under scrutiny when the container-carrying vessel “Mahanuwara” docked at the Galle Harbour with a haul of arms on January 18.
Avant-Garde Security Services which, according to the firm, provides security to ships against the Somali pirates.
Following the docking of a second floating armoury, carrying a consignment of unauthorized weapons in Galle Harbour on October 5, the investigations into the firm’s activities intensified. Meanwhile, Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana resigned from his ministerial portfolio over the controversy surrounding the Avant Garde security firm on Monday.
Marapana, who had represented the security firm as a legal consultant before becoming a minister, came under intense criticism for his remarks defending the firm during a recent parliamentary session.
Several cabinet ministers and a number of civil society organisations too condemned Marapana’s statement.
Marapana defended the security firm dismissing that there is anything illegal and said that lack of understanding about the floating armoury had created confusion.
In the backdrop of these issues a special cabinet meeting too was convened to discuss the issue. Meanwhile, courts recently granted permission to the CID to conduct investigations on the Avant Garde floating armoury under the Money Laundering Act.
A separate investigation too had been launched by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Into Serious Financial Frauds and Malpractices.
Sri Lanka Navy, which entered the second vessel found 816 T-56 and 84-S weapons along with 200,000 ammos in the ship. The ship, currently anchored off the Galle Harbour, is in the custody of the Navy.
However Avant Garde Maritime Services have maintained that the allegations made on its floating armoury are without any grounds.
The security services company in a statement recently said that it has always conformed to national and international laws.
