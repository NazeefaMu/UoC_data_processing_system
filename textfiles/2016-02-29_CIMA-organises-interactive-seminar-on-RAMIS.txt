The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) organised a seminar on Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) - the revolutionary change introduced by the Inland Revenue Department.

The interactive seminar included a knowledge dissemination session and a panel discussion. Inland Revenue Department Commissioner General Kalyani Dahanayake delivered the keynote address.

The presentation on the introduction to RAMIS was delivered by Inland Revenue Department Deputy Commissioner General ICT J.P.D.R. Jayasekara and was followed by an enlightening panel discussion, moderated by KPMG Principal Tax and Regulatory Suresh R.I. Perera. The panellists joining the discussion representing the Inland Revenue Department were Kalyani Dahanayake, J.P.D.R. Jayasekara and Commissioner Upul Jayawardena.

Representing the corporate sector were Aitken Spence Corporate Finance (Pvt.) Ltd Vice President and Aitken Spence Group Head of Tax Dilani Katipearachchi and Colombo Dockyard PLC Chief Financial Officer Gihan Ravinatha. RAMIS was introduced in Budget 2014 and the Inland Revenue Department, with the assistance of the Singaporean Institution, has successfully done the initial implementation. Jayasekara mentioned that there are three approaches of communicating and obtaining information from the Inland Revenue Department on RAMIS.

A tax payer can login to the E-Services on the Inland Revenue website, call a service agent at the call centre and/or directly approach the tax payer information services at the Inland Revenue Department.
