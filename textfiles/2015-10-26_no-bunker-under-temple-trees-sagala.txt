Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister Office and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake denied reports that there was an underground palace or bunker at Temple Trees.
“We were surprised after hearing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s claims that there was a bunker under Temple Trees. It is not true, no such things are found under Temple Trees. Anyway now we are checking whether former President Chandrika Kumaratunga had built a palace under Temple Trees,” he said referring to former President Rajapaksa’s claims.
He also said that when Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister in the previous occasions, he never built such an underground palace or bunker at Temple Trees. (Anjula Mahika Weeraratne)
