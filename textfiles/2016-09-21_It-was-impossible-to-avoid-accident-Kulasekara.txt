Giving evidence at the inquest held into the death of a motorcyclist at Kirillawala, who was struck by a car driven by the Sri Lankan cricket team's fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, Mr. Kulasekara said that he was driving home from Gampaha in his car,when he saw something emerge from the middle island of the road and strike his vehicle.

He said he had attempted to turn to the left and then applied his brakes. He added that there was much traffic on this stretch of road and, therefore, he was driving at the relatively low speed of 50 km per hour.

The inquest was held at the Ragama Hospital yesterday into the death of 28 year old Dinesh Aravinda Nissanka a resident of Maimbula, Nittambuwa -- a bachelor and an air conditioner technician. The Kadawatha Police had informed the inquirer into sudden deaths that on the day of the incident the deceased had been riding a motor cycle and proceeding from Colombo in the direction of Kandy. He had lost control of the motor cycle due to his speeding and, after striking the middle island of the road, had been thrown off and struck a motor car travelling on the Colombo -- Kandy Road and been killed.

Nuwan Kulasekara giving further evidence stated that immediately afterwards he had stopped his vehicle on the left side of the road. He had seen in his side mirror that a large crowd was collecting. He had hastened to the scene and seen the victim lying in a pool of blood and observed injuries on his head. As he feared a mob attack he had kept the car at the spot and waited near a shop awaiting the arrival of the police. He had later gone to the Kadawatha Police Station with the police officers and given a statement.

At the request of the police he had presented himself for the inquiry. He said the victim appeared so suddenly that he could not avoid hitting him.

Mr. Kulasekara also said that as a civic conscious person he felt duty bound to assist the family of the deceased and he would honour his obligations.

The post mortem was conducted by the JMO of the Ragama Hospital, Dr U.L.M. S Perera, who said death was due to the deceased sustaining severe injuries on his head when he struck a moving vehicle.(Devapriya Chandrasiri)
