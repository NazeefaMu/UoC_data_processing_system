An Amtrak passenger train derailed Monday morning, spilling multiple cars off an Interstate 5 overpass in Pierce County, Washington, according to the Washington state Department of Transportation's Twitter account.

Injuries and casualties have been reported, the Pierce County Sheriff's Office and Amtrak said.
All southbound lanes of the interstate are closed due to the derailment and the sight stunned motorists heading to work.

"I was traveling to work this morning along I-5 and we came to a sudden stop," Greg Mukai told CNN. "We all tried to stop quickly to avoid running into each other to be honest. Once we all came to a stop I was able to look up and see, unfortunately, this scary thing of ... a train hanging off of the overpass. Lots of military personnel and people ran to try to help the best they could."

Danae Orlob told CNN there was a semi and a crushed truck underneath the train cars.

"We came around the corner and it had to have just happened...there were no police there yet. There was one link of the train off to one side and the other on the other side of the freeway. There were crushed cars underneath. There was an insane amount of fire trucks and ambulances heading towards us."

Amtrak said it is aware of the incident involving the 501 train which travels from Seattle to Portland, Oregon.

According to an online schedule, the 501 train is one of Amtrak's Cascades trains, which they say "connect 18 cities along the I-5 corridor including Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, BC, and Eugene, Oregon."

The National Transportation Safety Board tweeted that the Amtrak train that derailed is a passenger train.

"NTSB is gathering information about an accident involving an Amtrak passenger train near Seattle, Washington. Additional information to follow when available."

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee tweeted, "Thank you to the first responders on the scene. We're praying for everyone on board the train, and ask everyone to hold them in your thoughts." (CNN)
