Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake yesterday informed court that another suspicious phone number used by former DIG Anura Senanayake to contact the Presidential Secretariat at the time that Wasim Thajudeen died was detected by the CID recently.

He said the CID was checking the phone calls taken on that number.

The CID sought court permission to check the details of Thajudeen's credit card details on May 16 and 17, 2012.
The detectives said they were also investigating the transactions carried out by eight individuals since 2012. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
