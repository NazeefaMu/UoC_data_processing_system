Choose the next move!

If you are wondering and pondering about the next move in your life after A/Ls and even the O/Ls (there are plenty of students who stop formal school education at this point), there is no cause for worry: there are plenty of courses to follow and things to do. Actually, there are a few courses which you can follow even if you have basically failed these examinations and the certificates issued by the course providers are generally recognized by the industry. In this respect, it is important not to despair if you have not done well at one examination or both examinations.
But before you do anything else, it is important to brush up on your knowledge of the Queen's Language which is essential for every subsequent step of your life, including a career move. There are plenty of courses and books which can point you in the right direction, but nothing beats speaking in English with your parents, teachers, friends and relatives. Do remember that formal English tests are required by some higher educational institutions and employers, so a grammatical and spelling knowledge too will not go waste. Moreover, do improve on your vernacular (Sinhala and/or Tamil) language knowledge as well because most employers look for excellent interpersonal skills. I will focus on foreign education in another column, so this column will essentially focus on the steps you can take before mulling a local course, some of which can help you to get a job abroad.
Having gained a working knowledge of English, you can next look for a suitable course. The English knowledge you acquired comes in handy here as well, because most courses are now taught in English. The course that you will select generally depends on what kind of person you are.
Are you a hands-on person ? Or would you rather work in an office ? Perhaps you like to travel around ? Or do you have a knack for a particular subject ? All these aspects must be considered before you sign on the dotted line for a course, which might cost a fair amount of money that will most probably be provided by your parents. So it pays to be wise here before shelling out cash.
There are many courses to select from in today's education scene. You will get a fair idea of the range available if you go to an education or job fair.
These are held fairly regularly, so you will be able to attend one near your place of residence. It is also advisable to go through the Education Pages of Sunday English newspapers, which will also give you a very good idea of the courses available locally, sometimes with foreign tie-ups.
First, select a few options before deciding on one course or stream straightaway. To cite an example, you may select accountancy, law and motor mechanism. Then you can do some research on the shortlisted courses and vocations. First, talk to your friends and relatives who have done these courses and perhaps even found good jobs by now.
They will be able to brief you on the pros and cons of each course - there is always no guarantee that you will get a job at the end of the day, but you can probably find one if you persevere. Ask them about the different stages that have to be completed, since it may not be necessary "to go the whole hog" to get a job. Remember that some employers allow and even encourage you to follow the rest of the course, once you are in. This way, you can learn while you earn and hopefully gain a promotion too.
The other great resource for research is, of course, the Internet. You should first study the websites of the relevant institutions, which are usually very reliable sources of information on everything from the duration to the costs (including exam fees) of their various courses. You will also be able to download course modules, past papers and study aids so that you can gain a knowledge what is in store if and when you finally join the course. Do look for student forums where the students discuss their concerns, problems and frustrations on various courses.
This will give you an idea of what kind of problems to expect as you go along. Finally, do check whether any institution offers remote learning via the Web, which means you can be more flexible with time. This way, you might even be able to learn two course streams at once.
Whatever you do, recognition is very important - if your certificate or qualification is not recognized worldwide, it may not be worth your time and money, especially if you are thinking of foreign employment or migration one day. After thoroughly researching all these aspects, you will most probably be ready to choose the next move of your life.
