SL doctor who killed husband, appeals to stay in Australia


	

A Sri Lankan-born doctor who bludgeoned her husband to death with a mallet after years of abuse is appealing to the Immigration Minister to allow her to stay in Australia after serving her sentence.

Dr Chamari Liyanage is serving a four-year prison term in Greenough Regional Prison after being convicted of the manslaughter of fellow doctor Dinendra Athukorala at their home in the West Australian town of Geraldton in June 2014.

She was acquitted of the more serious charge of murder and has been eligible to apply for parole since June.

Her application for parole is due to be heard early next year but if granted, she is likely to be moved into immigration detention and could be deported because her visa was cancelled whilst behind bars.

In an appeal to Peter Dutton obtained by 7.30, Liyanage said she took full responsibility for what had happened and there was little to no chance of her reoffending.

"I would also like you to consider my personal circumstances leading to the offence," she wrote.

"I was a victim of long term abusive and violent relationship and I believe that my judgement had been affected and considerably impaired at the time."

Liyanage said she feared for her safety if deported to Sri Lanka.

"I am afraid and concern (sic) about safety of my family in Sri Lanka if I have to return home," she wrote.

"My presence, media publicity and stigma associated with this case will bring hostilities towards my family … I am worried that will jeopardise the lives of my family."
