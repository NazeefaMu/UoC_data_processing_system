As a part of ongoing 150 years of celebrating the Mahatma, Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre will screen the Oscar winning Film (English) at its auditorium at 16/2 Gregory’s Road, Colombo 7. 


Gandhi is a 1982 epic historical drama film based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the leader of India’s non-violent, non-cooperative independence movement against British rule on India during the 20th century. 

 
The film, a British-Indian co-production, was written by John Briley and produced and directed by Richard Attenborough. It stars Ben Kingsley in the title role and Candice Bergen, Edward Fox, John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, John Mills and Martin Sheen.   


The film covers Gandhi’s life from a defining moment in 1893 as he is thrown off a South African train for being in a whites-only compartment and concludes with his assassination and funeral in 1948. Although a practising Hindu Gandhi’s embracing of other faiths particularly Christianity and Islam is also depicted in the film. 

 
Gandhi was nominated for Academy Awards in eleven categories, winning eight, including Best Picture and Best Director for Attenborough, Best Actor for Ben Kingsley, and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Briley. 

 
All are cordially invited.
