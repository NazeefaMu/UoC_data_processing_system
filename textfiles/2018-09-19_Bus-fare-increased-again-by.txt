Bus fare increased again by 4%


	

The Cabinet has approved a 4 per cent fare increase to bus tickets with effect from midnight tomorrow, the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry said.

However, it said the minimum bus fare of Rs. 12 would not be changed.

Earlier, the private bus unions demanded a 10 per cent fare increase considering the fuel price hike.

When the fares were increased in May 2018, the Cabinet approved the demand on the condition that there would be no fare increases for the next two years.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
