His pleadings have become a nuisance


	



Speculation is rife in political circles these days that a group of yahapalanaya backbenchers are set to quit the government and go independent in the council. 

 


Meanwhile, a senior purohita who frequently calls these members to plead with them not to leave the government has become a real nuisance to them, they say.


This purohita holding a high post in the party would often entreat, “Malli, please don’t go! If you have any problem, let me know; just tell me what you want, you will get it forthwith!”


Some of these members being ‘pestered’ by the powerful purohita has stopped answering his calls. “Ah! He is not at all worried about our problems. He is only keen on protecting his own perks and privileges,” these members say.
