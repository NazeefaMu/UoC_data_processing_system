According to a rumour making rounds these days a leading businessman with close connections to a very high political authority has planned to transfer the ownership of one of his business undertakings to the state to cover a massive payment he is required to make to the government. However, on being told that the value of the assets of his particular business undertaking falls far short of the amount of money he has been required to pay as a punitive measure, the business tycoon is said to have discussed with the political authority friend at a midnight tryst how to get over the problem.

 


The man now legally bound to pay a hefty amount of money in recompense is reportedly planning to make the full payment by a transfer of lesser important assets in a bid to retain his main business interests intact. After meeting with the high political authority, the business tycoon is said to have held council with a team of lawyers.
