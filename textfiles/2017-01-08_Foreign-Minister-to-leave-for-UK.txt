Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera will leave for the United Kingdom tomorrow on a five-day official visit (9-14), the Foreign Ministry said.

It said this is the first high-level visit from Sri Lanka to the UK, since the appointment of the new Government of Prime Minister Theresa May following the Brexit vote in July 2016.  

“The visit reflects the continuing dialogue between Sri Lanka and the UK since resetting bilateral ties in January 2015.  Minister Samaraweera is scheduled to meet with the Rt. Hon. Boris Johnson, UK’s Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and other key interlocutors. The discussions are expected to review developments in the bilateral relationship, including the way forward to further advance trade and investment between the two countries,” a statement by the Ministry said.

The Minister will apprise his counterpart on the milestones being achieved by the Sri Lankan Government in institutional building to strengthen democracy, reconciliation and inclusive development. 

During the visit, the Minister will also meet with the Rt. Hon. Patricia Scotland, Commonwealth Secretary General to discuss Sri Lanka’s shared interests and cooperation as an active member of the organization.  

The bilateral segment of the programme includes a speaking engagement by Minister Samaraweera at the Chatham House on the efforts of the Unity Government to move forward peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
