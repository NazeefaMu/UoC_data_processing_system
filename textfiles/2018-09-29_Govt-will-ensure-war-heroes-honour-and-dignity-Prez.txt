President Maithripala Sirisena said the government was fully committed to safeguarding the honour, dignity and respect of war heroes from the highest ranked generals to the ordinary soldier and they would be provided with all privileges.

He said this while addressing the Sri Lankans living in the United States in New York yesterday.

The President was warmly welcomed by the Sri Lankans comprising intellectuals, professionals, entrepreneurs, academics and university students.

He said there were some incidents war-time and post-war time incidents being investigated and they cannot be described as witch hunting.

The President said it should not be forgotten that one of the assurance given during the presidential election campaign was that these incidents should be investigations and those found guilty punished.

“If there were incidents outside the theatre of war they should be brought before the law and such actions will not in anyway mitigate the sacrifices made by the war heroes. Our soldiers are internationally recognized because such mistakes have been rectified,” he said.

The President pointed out that freedom and democracy were established in Sri Lanka and not a single journalist was attacked or compelled to leave the country during the past three and a half years.

"There have been some victories achieved by the government that are not so visible and the winning back the international support is one of them and that his visit to address the 73rd Session of the UN General assembly ensured the honour and respect for war heroes," he said.

The efforts made by the President in this regard was appreciated by the Sri Lankan community in the US. (SAJ)
