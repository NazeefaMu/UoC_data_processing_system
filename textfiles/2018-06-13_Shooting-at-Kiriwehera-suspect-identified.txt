Asela Lakshman Bandara, former Chief Kapu Mahathaya of the Mahasen Devalaya of the Kataragama Kirivehera Temple was identified as the suspect involved in the shooting in which Kiriwehera Chief Incumbent Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera and another monk were injured, the Police said today.

They said the suspect was identified following an investigation carried out by eight special police teams.

Kobawaka Damminda Thera and another monk were injured when three gunmen opened fire at them on Tuesday night. Ven. Kobawaka Damminda is undergoing treatment at a private Hospital in Colombo.

The Senior Police officer said a Honda Vezel registered as UP CAG 8531, which had been used in the shooting, was recovered from the former Kapu Mahathaya’s house.

He said the suspects involved with the shooting had been identified and that they had fled the area.

He said that according to investigations the shooting had taken place due to a dispute over the ownership of the Mahasen Devalaya in Kataragama.

Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera took over the management of the Mahasen Devalaya from the Kapu Mahathaya after the Thera detected misappropriation of funds at the Devalaya recently.

However, the Kapu Mahathaya had then filed a lawsuit in court claiming ownership of the Devalaya. But the court ruled that the Devalaya belongs to Ven. Kobawaka Damminda.

Meanwhile, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said that eight Police teams were investigating the incident under the direction of the Tangalle Division SP Laksiri Geethal.

Two Police personnel and four Civil Security Department personnel were with the Damminda Thera at the time of the shooting.

However, they were armed at the time of the incident.

The injured monks were admitted to the Kataragama District Hospital and were later transferred to the Hambantota Base Hospital. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
