UNHRC resolution
Govt trying to mislead public - Wimal

The investigative mechanism proposed by the resolution adopted by the UNHRC is a not a domestic mechanism, National Freedom Front leader Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday.
He said though the government claims that it is a domestic mechanism, it is better to describe it as a foreign mechanism as it is clearly mentioned about the participation of foreign investigators and judges.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Weerawansa said the government was trying to mislead the public by hiding the truth about the UNHRC resolution.
He said the US sponsored resolution adapted by the UNHRC on October 30 was co-sponsored by the Sri Lankan government with 25 additional co-sponsors allowing a domestic mechanism of investigation with foreign support.
Weerawansa said the main purpose of bringing foreign experts is to question and punish the heads of the security forces who gave orders during the war.
He challenged the government to reveal to the public that the proposed investigative mechanism is a domestic one and there was no foreign intervention.
