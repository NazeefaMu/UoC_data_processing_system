Mystery surrounding the dumping of the unairworthy airbus!


	



 

Our national airline had taken on lease an airbus from a foreign country about two years ago and had re-leased it soon after to a European country.

 


The lessee-airline had been required under the lease-agreement to return the craft in a good flying condition after effecting the necessary repairs if the need is upon the expiration of the lease period.


When the lease had expired, our engineers had flown to that European country to check its flight viability and had found its condition had deteriorated to the extent of being almost unairworthy. 


So, our engineers had told the foreign airline that our national airline was not prepared to accept the airbus unless it was restored to a sound flying condition.


However, a few days later, the engineers concerned had discovered to their horror that the airbus which they had condemned as not being airworthy had been brought back without effecting any repairs and parked in a hangar at our main airport and the pilots who had brought it had disappeared.


Meanwhile, informed sources say that there are one or two politicos behind dumping on us the unairworthy airbus which has already cost the taxpayers several millions of rupees.
