The Meteorology Department today announced that heavy showers, more than 100 mm could be expected at some places in the Southern, Western, Sabaragamuwa and the Central Provinces within the next 18 hours.

“’Due active clouds in the Southern sea area, the possibility of heavy showers and sudden roughness of the sea areas over the sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Pottuvil via Galle and Hambantota is possible,” the department said.

It said the wind speeds could reach up to 70-80kmph over the sea areas.

The Department requested the Naval and fishing communities to be vigilant in this regard.
