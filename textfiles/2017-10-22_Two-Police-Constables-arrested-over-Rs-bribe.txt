Two Police Constables were arrested on charges of having solicited a bribe of Rs. 2,000 from a lorry driver in Anuradhapura, the Police said.

They said the lorry driver had complained to the North Central Province DIG after he received notices on a traffic offence even after the two Police Constables accepted a bribe to prevent a legal action being filed against the driver.

The suspects were released on a surety of Rs. 100,000 each by the Anuradhapura Magistrate’s Court. (Dayaratne Embogama)
