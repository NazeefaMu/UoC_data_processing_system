(Daily Mail), 12 July 2018 -  
President Donald Trump’s claim to have wrung billions in additional commitments for defense contributions from European leaders is already being undercut by NATO leaders and members nations.  


Trump triumphantly told reporters before departing the NATO summit in Brussels said the ‘additional money that they will be putting up has been really amazing.’   


‘People have stepped up today like they’ve never stepped up before,’ Trump said, declaring victory. He attributed the change to his contentious whirlwind visit. ‘Yesterday I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening and they have substantially upped their commitment,’ Trump said.  


But there were no immediate specifics on what Trump said he had achieved, and French President Emmanuel Macron quickly disputed Trump’s claim that NATO allies have agreed to boost defense spending beyond 2 percent of gross domestic product.  Macron, in his own press conference, seemed to reject Trump’s claim that NATO powers had agreed to increases beyond previous targets. He said the allies had confirmed their intention to meet the goal of 2 percent by 2024 and no more.
