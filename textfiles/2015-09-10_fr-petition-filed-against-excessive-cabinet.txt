FR petition filed against excessive cabinet


	

A fundamental rights petition was filed in the Supreme Court today challenging President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to increase the number of cabinet ministers from 30 to 48.
The petition was filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri and he has cited President Sirisena and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner has stated that, according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a National Government should comprise the party that has obtained the highest number of seats and the other parties and independent groups in Parliament.
The petitioner maintains that the present government could not be described as a National Government merely because a couple of parties have entered into an agreement to form a government, and, therefore, it is a gross violation of the Constitution.
The petitioner is seeking interim relief preventing the president from appointing more than 30 ministers. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
