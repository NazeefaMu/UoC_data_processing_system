In the spirit of Christmas, a group of Buddhist monks, including Ven. Prof. Kamburugamuwa Vajira Thera and Ven. Prof. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera visited Rev. Fr. Sarath Hettiarachchi at his residence in Moratuwa this morning. The monks invoked blessings on the Fr. Hettiarachchi, who was unwell a few days ago. The Rev. Father offered alms to the monks as well.
