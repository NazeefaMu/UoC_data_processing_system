Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US, Jaliya Wickramasuriya was further remanded till February 9 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today.

He was arrested and remanded on charges of misappropriating USD 332,000 from state funds when purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington.

Prison Authority today did not produce the suspect in court due to his health condition. The suspect is currently being treated at Colombo National Hospital under the Prison custody.

His bail request on exceptional circumstance due to the illness was refused by the Magistrate and said it cannot be regarded as an extraordinary situation to grant bail since Colombo National hospital provides sufficient treatments for that particular illness.

The FCID filed charges under section 5 of the Public Property Act, where a suspect who has misappropriated public properties or assets for more than Rs. 25,000 has no bail relief unless granted due to exceptional circumstances or by a High Court Judge. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
