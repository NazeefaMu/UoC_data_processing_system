Do you seek your fortune in a foreign land?


	



 

It is our experience that one of the main reasons why people are keen on getting a reading of their horoscope is to ascertain whether they stand a chance of going abroad more for economic gains than for pleasure.

 

Main objectives
People generally seek to travel abroad for different reasons. However, it appears that there are two main reasons why people aspire to go overseas: either to secure a lucrative job in a developed country in the West or Far East or to take up residence in a foreign land where, they believe, life would be more comfortable and hassle-free.

 

Brain drain
In Sri Lanka, for years we have been lamenting a continuous `brain drain’ from the country. It is not only the brains – academics and professionals – that are seeking greener pastures abroad; there are hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers as well engaged in a mad scramble to get to a foreign country where they could earn an adequate pay to keep the wolf from the door and to give their children a good education.

 

Prosperity in native place or somewhere away from it
Maha Rishis in ancient India who studied the influences of planets on man and propounded the principles that formed the foundation for the great edifice of Astrology may have either foreseen or gathered from sources accessible to them the aspiration of certain people to seek their fortune in a foreign land.


In fact, ancient Rishis had obviously discovered that while some people achieve great success in life in their place of birth, some others prosper when they move away from their native place.

 

Reference to foreign travel in ancient works
Many ancient works on Astrology like Saravali, Chamatkara Chintamani, Brihat Parasara Hora, Jataka Parijata and Uttarakalamrita carry commentaries on foreign travel.


According to Astrological principles which have received wide acceptance among the competent astrologers, it is the third House in a Natal Chart that rules short journeys. The long journeys are indicated by the 9th House. The 7th House too predicts foreign travel. However, it is the 12th and 4th Houses that can say whether there is a possibility to settle down in a foreign land.

 

Rahu, Significator for everything foreign
Rahu is the Significator for all things foreign. However, there are other planets too contributing influence towards foreign travel.

 

Short journeys
According to Parasara, Rahu in the 3rd House gives a lot of foreign travel or short journeys. But such journeys could end in a mishap or a disaster. The Moon and Jupiter in the 3rd House too cause short journeys and the latter confers happiness, fortune and prosperity during such journeys.


The Moon in angles in movable signs or common signs gives a lot of foreign travel inside the country and outside it.


The Moon in watery signs of Pisces or Cancer bestows foreign travel. The Moon in the 12th, 8th and 9th signify prosperity and residence abroad. The Moon in the 11th House points to love marriage and residence abroad.

 

Rahu’s role
Rahu in the 4th House causes the subject to leave his birth place and live in a far off place. If Rahu or Ketu joins the 7th, 8th, 9th and 12th lords foreign travel would occur.


Rahu in the 1st, 7th, or 12th House also means foreign travel.


Difficulties one may come across while travelling abroad are to be judged from the 8th House.

 

Long journeys
If Rahu is in the 8th House, native would die during the journey.


The 9th House rules long journeys by air, foreign travel, pilgrimages and voyages, according to Parasara.


If the lord of the Lagna is in the 7th House with a benefic, the native would live in a foreign country, says Satyacharya.


If the 4th House is afflicted, the native would be compelled to leave the native place and seek residence in a foreign land.

 

Dasas influencing foreign travel
During the Dasa of a strong lord of the 9th House, a native may:
(1) Go abroad and gain prosperity and high recognition there.
(2) Do higher studies with great success in a foreign land.
(3) Go on a pilgrimage or on a voyage.
The Dasas of planets occupying the 9th House or aspecting the 9th, the 9th lord and planets posited in the 12th play an important role in giving foreign travel or residence abroad.
