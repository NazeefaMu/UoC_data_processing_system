A slight change in the prevailing hot and dry weather could be expected in the next few days, the Meteorology Department said today.

It said, showers or thundershowers would occur at several places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Uva and Central Provinces and in the Galle and Matara Districts after 4.00 p.m.

“There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The general public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity,” the Department said.
