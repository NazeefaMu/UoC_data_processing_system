RT.COM/15 Dec, 2016-   
Saudi Arabia will not tolerate any external “interference” in Yemen, King Salman has stated, as his forces continue to wage war against Houthi rebels, killing hundreds of civilians and leaving millions facing acute food shortages.   


“We will not accept any interference in the internal affairs of Yemen,” King Salman said in a televised address to the Shura Council on Wednesday, as quoted by AFP.   


Salman stated that his kingdom will not accept that neighbouring war-torn Yemen “becomes a base or a point of passage for whatever state or party to menace the security or the stability of the kingdom and of the region.”
