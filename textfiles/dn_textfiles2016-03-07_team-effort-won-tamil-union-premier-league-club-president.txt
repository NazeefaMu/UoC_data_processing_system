Team effort won Tamil Union the Premier league - club president

Tamil Union C&AC president Rasakanth Rasiah said that it was team effort that enabled his club to emerge champions in the Premier league tournament and end a 66-year barren run. Tamil Union crushed Galle CC by six wickets with a day to spare after trailing them by 152 runs in the first innings to win the title.

They went into this final league match holding onto a nine-point lead over Galle CC. When Tamil Union were shot out for 191 in their first innings in reply to Galle’s total of 348, it seemed the title that was well within their grasp would elude them. It was then that Tamil Union showed their fighting spirit that has been a feature of their success during the season. Led from the front by their captain Suranga Lakmal, the Sri Lanka fast bowler, Tamil Union shot out Galle CC for a mere 126 in the second innings with Lakmal leading the way with four wickets supported by another Sri Lanka fast bowler Shaminda Eranga with three.
But still Tamil Union had the challenging task of chasing 279 for victory. Dhananjaya de Silva, a prospective Sri Lankan cricketer made certain that there would be no hiccups during the chase by scoring a brilliant 124 that virtually brought Tamil Union to the door step of victory. Former Sri Lanka and SSC batsman Tharanga Paranavitana’s unbeaten half-century ensured they got there in style.

Tamil Union were the first holders of the division I inter-club Sara trophy in 1950 and since then they have twice come within touching distance of winning the title but luck was not with them. “This win certainly is a huge relief after winning and losing the first Lakspray trophy in 1982/83 and being deprived again in the Centenary Year by a stubborn last wicket stand,” recalled Rasiah. “It is all about team effort. The national players played whenever they could and all the other players adjusted and played together as a unit. They hit their peak in the Super Eight stage winning all the matches outright including a great one against traditional rivals SSC after 33 years. The team showed that they were not only winners but true champions,” he said. The Tamil Union president added that thanks are also due to officials of the club both present and past-for the many sacrifices they had undergone to mould this team - most of whom are from the outstation into a champion unit. “The club provides accommodation and even meals to certain players. It is certainly a very welcome reward which we are all proud of,” Rasiah said.
