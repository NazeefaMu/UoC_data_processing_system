Programme to send school dropouts back to school

A new programme to induce children of school-going age in the Anuradhapura district who have dropped out of school for economic and other reasons to re-start schooling has been drawn up by the Anuradhapura District Secretariat.
District Secretary D.P.G. Kumarasiri said surveys had revealed that a majority of children subjected to sexual and other abuse in the country fall into the category of school dropouts. The programme to send them back to school is launched at grass roots level to achieve the dual aim of ensuring education and safeguarding them against abuse and other problems.
