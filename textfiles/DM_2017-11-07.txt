Another forest destroyer in action
	
A close kinsman of a leading political authority is reportedly cutting down a forest reserve and he has already put up a paving slab factory on a cleared patch which is ringed by a 15-ft high parapet wall.
A large part of the forest reserve has already been cut down and huge trees felled are seen strewn all over, they say.
Guards posted around the place do not allow any outsider to come close to the factory or the area where the forest cover is being cleared.
Police and the forest conservation authorities have so far failed to take action against the offenders, they say.

BoI approval granted  indian company
	
ties local footwear industry in knots

Despite President Maithripala Sirisenas repeated assurances, its debatable as to why the BoI gave approval to an Indian Company
	According to Nimalasiri once the Indian investor commences operations a large percentage of local companies will have to give up on their businesses.
	The local footwear manufacturers produce over55 million pairs annually and they import over3.3 million pairs annually from various countries including India: BoI


The local footwear industry is now on the verge of collapse due to an arbitrary decision taken by the Board of Investment (BoI), it is learned.
Despite President Maithripala Sirisenas repeated assurances that he wouldnt allow local industries to suffer at the hands of foreign investors, its debatable as to why the BoI gave approval to an Indian Company to manufacture footwear for the local market, a decision which could have an adverse impact on local footwear manufacturers.
The BoI on September 25, 2017 had issued a letter of approval to M/s Veekesy Slippers Lanka Pvt Ltd for a project to manufacture footwear for the local market. This project is expected to operate under the normal laws of the country. The investor had been permitted to supply 2.145 million pairs of footwear annually to the local market which could lead to the closure of many footwear manufacturing companies in the island.
According to Sri Lanka Footwear and Leather Products Manufacturers Association (SLFLPMA) Chairman Dharmachandra Nimalasiri there are more than 300,000 employees directly and indirectly involved in the footwear manufacturing business in the country. According to Nimalasiri once the Indian investor commences operations a large percentage of local companies will have to give up on their businesses. This will raise the unemployment rate in the country.
Nimalasiri was critical of the Government regarding the decision which could negatively affect the local footwear manufacturers and give the Indians control over the countrys footwear market. What is the reason for the BoI to act arbitrarily when President Maithripala Sirisena had stated on many occasions that he will never allow the implementation of any detrimental proposal which will impact local Industries They will repatriate 100% profits to India while neglecting the local industrialists, who had saved foreign exchange in the country by manufacturing quality footwear for the local market over the years, Nimalasiri said.
Meanwhile an official of the BoI said that the application was initially submitted to the BoI, requesting approval to manufacture footwear to the local market. Such companies are approved under Section 16 of the BoI Act No: 4 of 1978. Letters of approval granted under Section 16 are authorized by a Director. The application by the Indian Investor V. Abdul Razak of Prabha, Kodinattumukku, Post Olavanna, Kozhikode, 673025, Kerala, India had been submitted on January 5, 2017 and the letter of approval had been issued on February 2, 2017 to manufacture footwear for the local market, informed sources who spoke to this newspaper on terms of anonymity said.
The sources further stated as to how the local manufacturers made a representation to the then BoI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya and informed him of what the detrimental consequences would be if the investor is allowed to manufacture footwear for the local market.
Once the impending impact that could be had on the local manufacturers was brought to the notice of then Chairman, the earlier letter of approval was cancelled, and Jayasuriya issued a letter dated July 7, 2017 to the investor that they have to export a minimum of 90% of the products manufactured by them and only a quantity not exceeding 10% of the manufactured goods could be sold in the local market. This gave some relief to the local industrialists until they were informed a few weeks ago that the present Board of Directors had reverted back to the letter of approval granted on February 2, 2017, the sources alleged.
Clause 3 of Jayasuriyas letter states, You are required to export a minimum of 90% of the products manufactured by this company and the income will be taxable under the prevailing tax rate applicable for export income. Clause 4 states that the investor is also permitted to sell a maximum quantity of 10% of exports in the local market subject to payment of Customs Duty, PAL, VAT, NBT, any applicable CESS or any other taxes levies including corporate income tax.
The letter further states,Please note that the letter of approval issued on February 2, 2017 is hereby withdrawn. Accordingly you are requested to amend the object
clause of the Articles of Association of the project company which is already incorporated under the name of Veekesy Slippers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd or any other name with reference to a previous letter of approval as manufacturer of footwear for export and local markets subject to a minimum of 90% export of manufactured footwear products.
You are hereby advised to forward your amended Articles of Association of Veekesy Slippers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd to the Legal Department of the BoI for approval and required to submit approved Articles to the Registrar of Companies to incorporate the amendments within a period of 14 days of the date of this letter failing which the BoI will be compelled to withdraw the all approval granted to your project please.
Despite the above conditions laid out by the BoI to safeguard the local footwear manufacturers, the Footwear Manufacturers Association queries as to why the present Chairman Dumindra Ratnayake by letter dated September 25, 2017 addressed to M/s Veekesy Slippers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, No: 41, Park Lane, Ethukala, Negombo had stated that having considered the various aspects and review the provisions applicable to the project and the discussion the BoI had with various stakeholders and authorities, it has been decided to amend the clause 3 and 4 of the letter of approval issued on July 7, 2017.
Clause 3 had been amended as thus,  You are required to confine your working production capacity to 2.1 million pairs per annum for the local market and to submit the production and local sales details quarterly to the Monitoring and the Investment Departments of the BoI.
If you wish to expand your working production capacity you are required to submit your proposal along with the export plan highlighting your total proposed production capacity for the prior approval of the BoI, prior to taking any action to expand beyond the committed production capacity in your project application.
Clause 4 has been amended as, You are required to pay customs duty PAL, VAT, NBT any applicable CESS and any other applicable levies for all imports and the income generated from the local sales referred to in clause no: 3, is taxable under the prevailing Inland Revenue Law of the country. Please ignore the proposed action to make amendment to the Articles of Association referred in page no: 4 of the letter of approval dated July 7, 2017.
Meanwhile, Nimalasiri further queried as to why the BoI failed to inform the Ministry of Industries and Commerce before presenting the approvals to the Indians on a platter. When the Ministry of Industries and Commerce has the mandate to look after the local industries what caused the BoI to take arbitrary decisions without consulting the Ministry that overseas the local industries BoI Chairman in his letter dated September 25 states that they (BoI) had several discussions with the stakeholders before the said settlements, which are inaccurate.We are clueless how the BoI has enforced a very high annual quota of 2.145 million production target which is much higher than the local existing market output. Did the BoI name the quota by considering the market potential and the current local production If so we are keen on having the statistics which led to this arbitrary decision, Nimalasiri claimed.
According to Nimalasiri, the Ministry of Industries and Commerce and the Export Development Board have considered the footwear industry as a thrust industry which is very much akin to the garment industry. BoIs unwise decision will have an adverse impact on the Industrial Development Boards plan to take this industry to villages, Nimalasiri further added.


There were many requests from Sri Lankans to export our brand of footwear to Sri Lanka
Abdul Razak, Chairman/Managing Director M/s Veekesy Slippers Lanka (Pvt) Limited
Meanwhile Chairman/Managing Director M/s Veekesy Slippers Lanka (Pvt) Limited Abdul Razak, speaking from India, told the Daily Mirror that they had decided to visit Sri Lanka because there were many requests from Sri Lankans to export VKC brand footwear to Sri Lanka.
We started exporting VKC footwear to Sri Lanka three years ago and the demand for our footwear is very healthy. We even received many calls from Sri Lankan dealers requesting our products. That was why we decided to have our manufacturing plant in Negombo and after we made the investment and received the necessary approvals we were surprised when our initial letter of approval was withdrawn and the authorities instructed us to export 90% of our products and that only 10% could be sold in the local market.
We do not want to export our production which is costly and that was why we came to Sri Lanka to invest on the local market. As we were given approvals under Section 16 of the BoI Act and like other local industrialists we too are not given any tax concessions.
Local industrialists assume that we are receiving tax concessions as we are a BoI company. We have brought foreign exchange to the country and will take only the profits to India. We will be generating more than 650 jobs for the locals and only few Indians will come to train the locals in how to operate the hi-tech machinery.
We dont have to have any dispute with the local manufacturers nor with the BoI. That was why we humbly requested the BoI to grant us the facility to supply the footwear to the local market when we were asked to export 90% of the goods we manufacture, Razak said.


Responsefrom BoI

QWhy did Dumindra Ratnayake amend the clause No: 3 and 4 and give permission to the investor to manufacture the footwear for the local market
The original letter of approval dated 02nd February 2017 was issued by the BoI to the investor to manufacture footwear for the local market in response to the application submitted on 05th January 2017. This letter of approval was issued under Section 16 of the BoI Law which doesnt grant any concessions to the investor. Accordingly the Investor is liable to pay Customs duty, VAT, PAL, NBT, Corporate Income Tax and any other taxes under the normal laws of the country.
This approval was based on Gazette No.1232/14 of 2002 issued under the Exchange Control Act (Chapter 423). The above Gazette refers to prohibitions and limitations of equity participation of foreign shareholding of business entities to be established in Sri Lanka. However, the shoe industry isnt subject to any restrictions or limitations under the above Gazette notification. Therefore, any foreign investor is free to set up a business entity to manufacture shoes for the domestic market with the approval of the Registrar of Companies. Obtaining approval from the BoI isnt required but companies go through BoI in order to obtain the facilitation provided by BoI specifically to obtain visa facilitation for Section 16 companies. There are no additional benefits for the investors other than the BoI facilitation.
When the Footwear Manufactures Association raised the initial protest for the original approval, BoI issued a new letter of approval on 07th July 2017 withdrawing the original letter requiring the investor to export 90% of the production.
However, by this time the investor had already invested to set up the factory building, installed machinery and hired staff. The Investor then sent a Notice of Litigation, citing that the withdrawal of the initial approval was illegal. BoI referred the matter to the Attorney General (AG), who advised the BoI to settle the matter amicably for the benefit of the Investor as well as the Country.
This matter was further discussed at the meeting held on 11th September 2017 at the Presidential Secretariat chaired by His Excellency the President. The meeting was attended by the representatives of the Footwear Manufacturers Association and other relevant line agency officials. At this meeting, the BoI explained the situation to the President, the AGs recommendation as well as the negative impact to the countrys image in case of litigation by the Investor. The President directed the BoI to settle this matter amicably with the investor without resorting to legal action. As a result, BoI amended the said letter dated 07th July 2017 and issued the letter dated 25th September 2017 by which the BoI limited the investors production to 175,000 pairs per month (2.1 million pairs per annum). Further the investor is required to obtain prior approval of BoI for any capacity expansions, which would be for export market.
QIsnt this a step taken to wipe out the local industry and give the opportunity to an Indian to supply the footwear the country requires
The local footwear manufacturers produce over 55 million pairs annually and they import over 3.3 million pairs annually (275,000 pairs per month) from various countries including India.
The amount of pairs approved for the manufacture by the investor is 2.1 million pairs annually (175,000 pairs per month).
Q Although the chairmans letter to Veekesy Slippers Lanka (Pvt) Limited states that he had discussions with various stake holders prior to issuing this letter of approval, the Sri Lanka Footwear and Products Manufactures Association refutes the claim and alleged that the decision had been taken arbitrary.
The minutes of the discussion at the meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat on 11th September 2017 chaired by His Excellency the President, written by Mr. Nalaka Kaluwewa, Actg. Additional Secretary to the President clearly confirms the BoI claim, that its letter of approval dated 25th September 2017 was issued based on the above discussion held at Presidential Secretariat for which all relevant line agencies and footwear and product manufacturers associations were present.
QWhat made the BoI issue such a detrimental letter which will no doubt adversely impact the local manufacturers
The BoI hasnt issued any letter that will adversely impact the local manufactures. The BoI has acted according to the prevailing laws and regulations of the country and has taken all precautionary measures to mitigate adverse impact if any.

Cannot blame LIOC for the shortage: PM
	
While saying that the current petrol crisis will be probed as to who caused it, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today he could not agree with the criticism heaped on the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) for the crisis.
The Prime Minister was referring to a statement made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene who earlier said the petrol shortage would not have taken place if LIOC was not allowed to get involved in the fuel distribution of the country.
The Premiersaid the current crisis was probably caused by others and that it would be probed.
The fuel supply was maintained to some extent during the recent strike action launched by petroleum workers, thanks to the LIOC," the Prime Minister said.
He said oil tanks in Trincomalee were given to LIOC because CPC was not able to make use of it for a long time due to the lack of financial resources.
"We inquired from India whether it was interested in investing in this and they agreed and an MOU was signed," the Prime Minister added.
Referring to the allegation that he sought Cabinet approval to acquire 10 oil tanks in Trincomalee of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) with another cabinet memorandum, the Prime Minister said the second memorandum which he submitted, only said that the government should look into the agreement before making a decision.
The Prime Minister said he and the President had already discussed with the Indian High Commissioner on getting another shipment of Petrol from India and that this would be in addition to the shipment due to arrive in Colombo tomorrow. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The International Symposium attended by more than 35 international faculties from countries worldwide
The event aims to explore through interdisciplinary approach the potential of Sri Lankan Traditional Medicine (TM) to cater to the rising demands for holistic medicine, by integrating the Medical Sciences, basic sciences and other disciplines with Sri Lankan TM, with an overall objective to share the expertise and novelties in evidence based practices of TM in disease prevention, diagnosis and management; to develop safe, efficacious, quality and standardized products using modern science and technology, as well as the diagnostic tools and bio-medical information systems in TM whilst instrumentalizing science through private- public partnerships, and novel product development. 
The International Symposium attended by more than 35 international faculties from USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, Norway, Japan, Singapore, India, Iran, S. Korea, Thailand, and China, will address on a wide range of disciplines including TM/IM, Medical Sciences, basic sciences, nanotechnology and molecular sciences.

The trade fair will showcase 120 stalls distributed among international and national business community engaged in the fields related to traditional/herbal medicine, nutraceuticals and functional foods. Further, the trade fair will facilitate Business to Business [B2B] and Business to Academic [B2A] interactions providing a common platform to discuss, communicate on Private-Public Partnerships [PPP]leading to novel product development through cutting edge research linking industry and academia. 
Interestingly, Sri Lanka has a unique biota of plants of which 12% is endemic to the country. Many of these plants are being used as raw materials for various concoctions and drug preparations in TM of Sri Lanka. However, less than 1% of these plants have been evaluated scientifically for their medicinal properties and few have reached to the product development stage.
TradMed International highlights timely requirement to tap into this goldmine opening pathway to novel product development throughvalue addition. 
Furthermore, the event will conclude with the signing of the Colombo Declaration; a Ministerial level commitment of the participating countries to implement the evidential outcome of the Symposium strengthening PPPs and academic collaborations between the countries.

Lathikka Niriella: Crazy about quizzing
	
Reflections on Sri Lankas Number One Quizzer


Quiz competitions are not just about questions and answers. They are not only about victories or even participation. They are about teams pitting their wits against each other and getting to know about each other after everything is done.
They are about teachers, students, and well-wishers exchanging pleasantries. And they are about relationships and commonalities rooted in the excitement of knowing the correct answer to the correct question. Unfortunately I have not been to many quizzes, I have not met many teachers, students, or well-wishers, and I have not exchanged (m)any pleasantries this way. But I have met Lathikka Niriella, the Number One Quizzer in this country. He had a story to tell. I badly wanted to write it down. So I met him again, this time at his residence.
Lathikka Asiri Niriella was born to a family that instilled in him an open, liberal attitude to the world. His father, Professor Chandrasiri Niriella, had been a forensic pathologist, while his mother Chitra Niriella had been a stickler for the arts (particularly music). Consequently young Lathikka grew up adoring the arts and the sciences, a point he attributes to another fact: that he was able to read, and understand, beyond his age. When I was eight, I went on reading more and more history and science books, all of which happened to be discernibly outside what had been prescribed. Compounding this, of course, was his education: firstly at Trinity College, Kandy, and later at Richmond College, Galle.
Curiously enough he had studied almost exclusively in Sinhala at Trinity, a problem given that he became probably the student in his class with the least amount of knowledge of English. But I picked it up, primarily because at Trinity, we were taught from textbooks that were far advanced for our age. So we ended up studying the Grade Four textbook in Grade Three. And it wasnt merely my schooling.
My two brothers and I were encouraged to listen to Western music, and not just Sinhala or Hindi melodies, and to read as much as we could in English by my parents. We soon became cosmopolitans. 
Things had been different at Richmond College, where he and his brothers were admitted to after the whole family moved to Galle in 1982. His fathers job had been the reason for the shift. That was a time when highly educated people were respected. We werent really rich, but people didnt bother with status. They were awed by my father and his profession, the result being that we were held in esteem by our new neighbourhood.
He quickly adapted to life at Richmond, not surprisingly, revelling in his favourite subject, Social Studies. It was at his new school, moreover, that this young reader, learner, and connoisseur of sorts engaged in his first real school activity: the Quiz Club, apparently Sri Lankas oldest such school club with a history going back to 1957. This had been supplemented by a TV series: the first local quiz show was the Do You Know Contest sponsored by a leading paint dealer and hosted by the man who had established the Club at Richmond, the redoubtable Shelton Wirasinha. Lathikka was impressed: All what my father and mother encouraged in me came out in the questions he asked. The Do You Know Contest would wrap up in 1985 (when Wirasinha sadly passed away), but its impact on him was monumental.
Lathikka did his O/Levels in 1988, gaining nine distinctions, and his A/Levels three years later, gaining less-than-expected results (three Cs and one S) that compelled him to sit for it again the following year (1992). His second attempt yielded a more favourable total (240 out of 400 marks), enough to secure him a placement at the University of Moratuwa. Meanwhile, he had joined the Quiz Club during his A/Levels, taking part in his first competition in January 1991 at the Master Mind Contest organised by the Lions Club (the Master Mind, back then open to only schools, would later open up to private teams and individuals). The Richmond team emerged third (I believe the Royal College team came first). After his A/Level years were up, however, he left the Club, which meant several years spent concentrating on his degree: a Bachelors in Built Environment.
Those years of study and concentration eventually gave way to his love for quizzing, when it was resuscitated by a series of foreign shows he began watching on local television, especially Jeopardy. About two years after that, in 1999, there was a quiz organised at the University inviting every Faculty to participate. I was strangely the only contestant from my department. Pitted against so many other students from other fields, I somehow finally emerged as the winner. The quiz had been organised by Dinesh Weeratunga (a veteran quizzer from Royal College), who, seeing the victor, asked him to consider joining his team. Thats how I got to meet my other quizzing partners, including Ruwan Senanayake and Nalaka Gunawardene. I joined them in 2001. By the time he completed his degree in 2003, he had let go of any desire to be an architect. I figured out that I didnt want to apply what I had learnt. So I became a journalist, starting out in 2000 with the Daily Mirror. Back then Lalith Alahakoon was the Editor. He had followed it up with teaching stints at Elizabeth Moir from September 2002 to July 2003, Colombo South for a few months in 2007, and a small school in Nugegoda called Southland from 2008 to 2011, before joining Royal Institute in January 2012. I teach Science and History, he tells me, And I enjoy it very, very much.
So how did this journalist and teacher pursue quizzing From 2001 to 2007 he and Ruwan Senanayake forged on ahead with more contests throughout the country. On his own accord, Lathikka went for pub quizzes, starting with the Echelon Pub Quiz at the Colombo Hilton, coming in at third or fourth place, and finally winning it in 2002. This latter victory opened him to another invitation, extended by Haren Fernando and a group of students from Elizabeth Moir (where he would soon be teaching). What happened thereafter was this: for Pub Quizzes, I would be in Harens team, for normal quizzes I would be in Ruwans team. Added to this was another landmark win: the 2006 World Quizzing Championship, where Lathikka came second (in Sri Lanka) after Haren.
He found himself in another team when, in 2011 after Ruwan had left for Australia, he was extended another invitation, this time by an enigmatic, almost larger-than-life artist who had returned from the United States with his brother: Vindana Ariyawansha. That was quite a team, to be honest. We were soon joined by Haren, Dilantha Gunawardana, and Dhammika Atapattu - all of whom have since become reckonable quizzers.

Lathikka Niriella: Mad about quizzing
I put to Lathikka that inasmuch as quizzing, like chess, inspires passion so much that ardent fans tend to take to it at the cost of nearly everything else, in Sri Lanka some balance must be struck between what you love and how you live. He agrees. I always tell my students to study what they do not just for quiz competitions but for their general education as well. Especially in private schools, there is an immense pressure for you to recover what your parents spent because of you by entering University. Quizzes are fun. They are exhilarating. They open you up. But by themselves, they are not enough.
Which brings me to my next question: what does it take to win at a quiz Memory Logic Common sense According to Lathikka, its a sleek combination of all three. In this field, all other things being what they are, having a good memory will immediately improve you and put you at an advantage. But a good memory alone wont do. You need to think logically, to deduct and to add. If three of four possible answers to a question about Pre-Raphaelite painters involve Picasso, Da Vinci, and Monet, you know the fourth answer has to be the correct one. That last point compels another question, incidentally: in an era where Google has overwhelmed memory and recall, do quizzes really matter
Lathikka is noticeably cautious in his reply: For one thing, quizzes are exciting. They oil your memory. I believe it was Niels Bohr, the physicist, who contended that the more you stretch your mind, the more it liberates itself. So yes, in answer to your question they do matter. Moreover, the point that the digital era makes quizzes obsolete is rather fallacious considering that this means you dont need to remember mathematical calculations and equations because of calculators. Todays children are interested less and less in recall than in resorting to Google. Theyve become dependent on technology, simply put.
What about the quality of the game in the country Inasmuch as those TV shows we have are competitive, and qualitatively better than they used to be, we are still very much behind our neighbours. For instance, this year I was ranked the 23rd top quizzer in the Asia-Pacific region. Of the other 22, 19 are from India, two from Australia, and one from New Zealand. This cannot be a coincidence. Even the Indian Quiz Shows are far better than ours, in terms of the level of difficulty. Which brings me to another point: the fact that none of the top 25 Asian Quizzers is from East Asia  including Japan and Singapore  indicates that their reputed preference for memorising facts hasnt helped them become major players in this field. That takes me to what I told you earlier: having a well oiled memory wont help you stay ahead all the time. You need to think logically as well.
Well oiled memory and logical thinking: it would seem that Lathikka Niriella has fortunately been blessed with both. That has doubtless helped him stay ahead, wherever he has been: as a teacher, as a journalist, as a raconteur. Surprisingly for me, though, he prefers to remain aloof, though when shared interests come into play he opens up and pours out one anecdote after another. Perhaps its that passion for reading he still has. Perhaps it was his mother and father. Perhaps it was Shelton Wirasinha, Richmond College, and all those fellow travellers from Ruwan Senanayake to Vindana Ariyawansha he has encountered. Or perhaps it was a combination of all these things. Whatever the answer, it does not matter. What matters is that I have done my job. I have taken down his story.

LIOC issue a precursor to ETCA repercussions: JO
	
The fuel crisis that resulted after co-opting the LIOC for fuel supply and distribution, is a sign of what will happen if Sri Lanka signs Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) with India, the joint opposition (JO) said today.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said India's influence was so deep that the government had even allowed an Indian footwear company to enter the Sri Lankan market impacting negatively on local footwear manufacturers.
If ETCA is signed against such a backdrop, the country will be destroyed. The government should learn lessons from the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) issue, he told a news briefing.
The MP said the Rajapaksa government had to spend at least US$5 billion annually when the world was going through a fuel crisis and the country through a war.
However, he said the fuel prices had dropped since 2015 and the new government had to spend only US$2.7 to 2.8 billion a year to import fuel.
This was a huge advantage to the new government. US$2.8 or 2.7 billion was only 12% of the entire import revenue. Because of this reduction of fuel prices, the government had saved more than US$5 billion so far. However, even with this advantage, the government had failed to ensure a sufficient fuel supply to the people, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

LIOC refutes all allegations
	
While rejecting allegations that LIOC was responsible for causing the petrol shortage in the country, the company said that delay of a CPC petrol shipment had led to the shortages of petrol across the country, particularly given that CPC catered to 84% of the Sri Lankan market.
It may be noted that LIOC caters to only 16% of the Sri Lankan market, while the remaining 84% relies on CPC supplies. Thus, large shortages across the country can only be caused by disruption in supplies of CPC.
An average daily sale of LIOC is 600 MT of petrol, the Lanka India Oil Corporation said in a media release.
It said that as on date, LIOC had a buffer stock of 3,500 MT of petrol at the Common User Facility (CUF), managed by CPSTL. 
It may be noted that LIOC has adequate stocks of diesel at both Trincomalee terminal and at CUF and normal daily diesel sales of 775 MT is continuously happening from all our sheds across the country, it said.
It is total misrepresentation of facts that diesel is not being sold by LIOC sheds, it said.
LIOC is a professionally managed subsidiary of Fortune 500 Global Company, and plans its product requirement well in advance and maintains necessary stocks, according to the statement.
The statement said:
LIOC has noted that consumers across the country have been facing some shortages of petrol over the last few days. As a reliable distributor of petroleum products in Sri Lanka over many years, LIOC is making all efforts to assist in the early resolution of this problem. However, attempts by some to blame LIOC for causing the shortage are mischievous and factually incorrect, and we categorically reject such allegations.
It may be noted that LIOC caters to only 16% of the Sri Lankan market, while the remaining 84% relies on CPC supplies. Thus, large shortages across the country can only be caused by disruption in supplies of CPC.
An average daily sale of LIOC is 600 MT of petrol. Against this, as on date, LIOC has a buffer stock of 3,500 MT of petrol at the Common User Facility (CUF), which is managed by CPSTL. It may be noted that LIOC has adequate stocks of diesel at both Trincomalee terminal and at CUF and normal daily diesel sales of 775 MT is continuously happening from all our sheds across the country.
It is total misrepresentation of facts that diesel is not being sold by LIOC sheds.
LIOC is a professionally managed subsidiary of Fortune 500 Global Company, and plans its product requirement well in advance and maintains necessary stocks.
LIOC had procured a shipment (parcel) of 35,000 MT of petrol from the French oil company M/s TOTAL on DAP basis, which arrived in Sri Lanka on 16 October 2017. As per routine procedure, the petrol was tested by CPC/CPSTL laboratory before being accepted by LIOC. It was found that while the parcel met the chemical properties specification, it contained some visible particles. CPC/CPSTL laboratory as well as LIOC refused to accept the parcel. LIOC maintains its own high quality standards, which it does not compromise at any cost.
LIOC immediately informed M/s TOTAL to replace the parcel. It may be noted that ownership of the product remains with M/s TOTAL till it satisfies the requirements of LIOC and CPC/CPSTL laboratory. Once a parcel is rejected, LIOC has no further role thereafter and it is the seller's own sole discretion/responsibility to decide when to take out the vessel from Sri Lankan waters.
As replacement cargo would have taken at least 25-30 days, M/s TOTAL offered to remove the particles through filtration process, which is a common industry practice, in order to enable expedited delivery by 3-4 November 2017 to manage the present crisis. For reasons unknown to us, this proposal was not acceptable to CPC officials.
Hence, LIOC asked M/s TOTAL to replace the parcel completely. Allegations that LIOC pressurised CPC to accept the original parcel without correction are totally false.
It is reiterated that LIOC always adheres to the quality parameters in totality and procures goods from reputed oil companies only. LIOCs quality track record bears this out. Further, the allegation that LIOC tried to sell sub-standard Diesel is totally malicious and frivolous. In fact the diesel proposed to be imported was of much better quality as per international standards. However, since the country is still having old specifications for diesel, CPC informed that they demand Sri Lankan specifications irrespective the quality of diesel and accordingly, LIOC decided not to procure.
Though LIOC had sufficient buffer stocks, in order to assist CPC (whose shipment has been delayed), we immediately contacted our global suppliers for an emergency delivery (in addition to the replacement delivery by M/s TOTAL). This is expected to reach Sri Lanka by 10 November 2017. It may be recalled that on various occasions in the past, LIOC has offered all its assistance to CPC to procure emergency shipments of petroleum products, and will continue to do so, whenever required. As a responsible petroleum company, at the times of strike, LIOC has always worked round the clock to make the product available to the citizens of the country.
We understand that a CPC petrol parcel, which was scheduled to reach Sri Lanka on 2 November 2017, has been delayed. While we are not aware of the reasons for this delay, such a disruption has led to shortages of petrol across the country, particularly given that CPC caters to 84% of the Sri Lankan market, it said.

Ravi urges action against ASG Kodagoda, media
	
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake today requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take action against Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda and the media for making false allegations against him and thus violating his parliamentary privileges.
Raising this matter of privilege, he said he had nothing to do with the alleged death threats on the penthouse owner Anika Wijesuriya.
A complaint was made by Ms. Wijesuriya's brother Victor Wijesuriya who had initially complained to the police while ASG Yasantha Kodagoda submitted a copy of that complaint to the Bond Commission on October 17.
Wide publicity was given to this incident in the media, but I have nothing to do with it," the MP said.
"According to the report, Ms. Wijesuriya has been threatened with death by Shanil Neththikumara, who was described as a relative of mine. However, I have no such relative and if it is proven that Neththikumara is a relative of mine I will resign from Parliament. I wonder how Mr. Kodagoda knew about a relative of mine whom I myself do not know about."
He said Ms. Wijesuriya had actually gone on a visit to Bali and had returned to Sri Lanka, after which she had attended to some matters pertaining to her family property. She had then left for Britain.
The MP said he had handed over a letter to the Bond Commission's Secretary on this matter and faulted him for not submitting it to the commission.
Even the judges in the Commission are confused with the activities of the Commission's officers. He therefore asked how the officers talk about a verdict even before it is given. The MP also blamed the Attorney Generals Department on their failure to conduct a proper investigation on this issue. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)

Reforms should be enduring and sustainable: US Under Sec.
	
Though everyone wants Sri Lanka to move on a fast pace in terms of reforms, a top US official yesterday said it was more important to make sure these reforms are enduring and sustainable.
US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas A. Shannon, who was in Sri Lanka for a brief visit, expressed these views at a joint news briefing together with Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam at the Ministry.
Responding to a question, Mr. Shannon said everyone wants things to move faster but they have to understand other aspects as well.
Obviously, we all want a fast pace. I think nobody wants it more than Sri Lankan people and the Sri Lankan government. We recognize Sri Lanka is emerging from a very complicated environment of a conflict. We always want to make things move faster but we want to make sure as they are completed and consolidated that they areenduring and sustainable. Thats why we are partners with Sri Lanka in this process as Sri Lankans themselves have to make this move, he said.
He said the whole world was watching Sri Lanka because of the incredible commitment it made overcoming the consequences of the conflict in the country to address the issue.
The rest of the world wants Sri Lanka to be successful because they realised that Sri Lanka could be an example or a model to many of the countries around the world, he said.
Meanwhile, he commended Sri Lanka for its decision to commit to a process of reforms that promotes greater prosperity of all Sri Lankans regardless of ethnicity or religion.
Mr. Shannon said the US fully supports Sri Lanka government's working to a reconcile Sri Lanka and commended the process of steps towards a new constitution.
Responding to a question, Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said Sri Lanka's partnership with the US was not an alliance as such but a partnership.
Having partnerships with many countries does not contradict Sri Lanka's policy of non-alignment in terms of our political approach to our political affairs. Sri Lanka is a country that believes in inclusive relations rather exclusive relations, so our partnership with the US we believe is a positive element in our approach towards international relations that is based on not having alliances, he said.
The meeting prior to the news briefing between officials of the two country was focused on next round of Sri Lanka and the USs Partnership Dialogue which demonstrates the consolidation of cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
