FCID seeks int'l warrant on Udayanga Weeratunga
	
The FCID today requested Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne to issue an arrest warrant, through Interpol, for the arrest of one-time Sri Lankan ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga and produce him in court on charges of causing a huge financial loss to the Government in the purchase of four Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft in 2006.
According to Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) Inspector Nihal Francis the deal amounted to US$14 million.
Mr. Weeratunga had been noticed to appear in court yesterday but he was not present.
The prosecution told the Magistrate that the police had taken all the appropriate steps to hand over the summons to Mr. Weeratunge.
The Police said they had handed it over to Mr. Weeratunges sister who lives in Nugegoda and had also informed the lawyer who holds his Power of Attorney. The copies of the summons were also sent to the email addresses of Mr. Weeratunge.
According to reports Mr. Weeratunga resides in Ukraine and was recently seen in a photograph taken with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The FCID also requested court to notice the Sri Lanka Airforce Legal Department Director to appear in court to clarify as to why the original contract of the MIG deal was not with them.

India, SL sign MoU to promote significance of Ramayana
	
In a move to develop infrastructure at the sites that form a part of the Ramayana circuit, the Indian Central government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Sri Lankan government, which says both the neighbouring nations will work jointly to promote mutual tourism interests.
Sources in the Ministry of Tourism (MoT) said the Lankans have offered 4-5 destinations to be included in the Ramayana circuit, to complete the religious trail.
These destinations would be Ravana's palaces, Ashok Vatika, Hanuman's entry point that is called 'Nagadeepa', 'Donara' where god king Ram first attacked Ravana and Yudagannawa- the main battle ground which is now stands as a wild life sanctuary, among others.
The MoU was inked on June 3 this year, in which it was agreed that Indian tourists visiting the Ram tourism circuit in Sri Lanka will be facilitated by the Lankan government, an official said.
Reciprocal smooth passage will be accorded to visitors from Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist country, while visiting various Buddhist circuits in India, he said.
The Buddhist circuits are Saravasti, Kushinagar, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, Nalanda and Lumbini located in southern Nepal, where queen Mayadevi gave birth to Prince Siddhartha.
The facilities exchanged will comprise easy transit, visa processing and security, the official said.
The groundwork for establishing a MoU on the Ramayana trail was laid when India's external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj led a ministerial delegation to Colombo in February this year, for the 9th session of the India-Sri Lanka Joint Commission, which she co-chaired with Sri Lankan foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Progress of and developments in bilateral relations, especially in the sector of tourism, were reviewed at that Joint Commission meeting. (India Today)

No nominations for betrayers: SLFP
	
The SLFP has identified those who have betrayed the party, criticized and insulted President Maithripala Sirisena and sabotaged the government and they will not be givean nominations to contest the local government polls, UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera told the Daily Mirror that the UPFA had begun conducting interviews to select candidates for the forthcoming local government polls and it will continue until July 30. Applicants from three districts will be interviewed on one day at the party head office at Darley Road by a panel of three party seniors comprising ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers.
Minister Amaraweera also said the same policy would be adopted in selecting candidates for the future Provincial and Parliamentary elections and added many who were unfaithful and treacherous to the party will be rejected nominations. 
The party head office has received nearly 10,000 applications to contest local government polls and we expect to field educated youths with unblemished records as our candidates. We have decided to refuse nominations who went against the party line and insulted party leader, President Sirisena on numerous occasions. By doing so, we expect to maintain the party discipline and show them that those who betray party and those who abuse and shame the party leadership do not have a place within the SLFP, Minister Amaraweera said. 
He added that the SLFP or the UPFA had sufficient young and fresh candidates with good track records to contest and win the local government polls. With them, the SLFP will be in a position to discard many a rotten egg in the party, he said. (Sandun Jayasekera)

Petition calls for 2/3rd majority, referendum
	
A public interest litigant lawyer yesterday filed a petition for the Special Determination of the Supreme Court on the Bill titled Value Added Tax (Amendment) 2016.
Petitioner P.Liyanaarachchi challenged that certain provisions of the Bill were inconsistent with the Constitution and required a 2/3rd approval of the Parliament and the approval of the people by referendum. He claims the said Bill as a whole or in part is in vehement infringement of may entrenched Articles of the Constitution namely sovereignty of the People, excercise of sovereignty, Right to Equality, Directive Principle of State Policy, the full realization of the fundamental rights and freedom of all persons as well as the inference with judiciary. 
He states the Bill placed on the Order Paper of the Parliament on July 8 also repeals the VAT exemption which was applicable to Telecom Services till May 2. 
He states the said Telecom Services are already and continue to subject to among other taxes to a 25% Telecommunication Levy. 
He states that the Telecommunication Levy Act was specially enacted to impose the said Levy for the existed taxes of VAT and NTB (Nation Building Tax). 
He laments accordingly the services are subject to double taxation which is contrary to law, ethics, reasonableness and government policy. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

SL religious centre where missing Kerala youths stayed identified
	
Intelligence agencies have reportedly spotted the religious centre in Sri Lanka, where the missing youths of Kerala are suspected to have stayed before they disappeared, the News Minute reported on Thursday. 
It is a centre run by one Nawaz ul-Hind who has connections with Kerala. He had studied at Darul Hadees at Dammaj in Yemen for 12 years before starting the centre at Nigombo in Sri Lanka, an intelligence officer has told The Times of India.
The report says Nawaz studied under Yasin Hajoori, the head of Darul Hadees in Dammaj, and he left Yemen after the centre was closed down following an attack.
Nawazs mother is reportedly from Thrissur and he used to conduct classes in some Salafi centres in north Kerala. Agencies got the information about this Sri Lankan institute from the Salafi centre at Athikkad in Malappuram. There were earlier reports that the missing youths had stayed in Athikkad also.
The ToI report further says that Nawaz had expelled Hafeesudheen - one of the missing youths hailing from Kasaragod - from the institute after the latter tried to lure some students into the Islamic State (IS). Hafeesudheen was the one who had sent messages to their parents informing that they had reached an Islamic country having Shariya rule.
Other members of the group, including Ashfaq, Rashid, Ezza and his wife from Palakkad, Eshia and his wife from Ernakulam, have also reportedly gone to the Sri Lankan centre, as per the statements of their parents.
