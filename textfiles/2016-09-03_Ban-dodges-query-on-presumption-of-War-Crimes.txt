Ban dodges query on presumption of War Crimes


	

Visiting United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon while evading the issue of a presumption of ‘War Crimes’ being committed in Sri Lanka, instead said the United Nations failed in its duty “particularly during the last stages of the conflict”.

Answering questions posed to him by the Daily Mirror at the concluding media briefing held at the Galle Face Hotel last evening, Moon evaded specifics and instead couched his answers with diplomatic jargon.

“Its true that there was a lack in the level of achievement or lack of involvement by the United Nations and that I admitted to in my statement. That’s what we have admitted to a long time ago. We really wanted to see why it had happened to that level and how. The United Nations could have done better in Sri Lanka particularly during the last stages of the war” he said instead.

Speaking further he also asserted to “terrible events of the time”.

“The UN has to address the legacy of its actions in Sri Lanka which did not meet the expectations of the people and the world. We reviewed our involvement of the terrible events of the time and continue to take steps to ensure that human rights are at the center of our decision making”

Speaking further Moon denied the assertion that the United Nations exerted “double standards” with regard to global superpowers and Sri Lanka.

“With due respect to all of you, I would not agree that there has been a double standard with regard to the actions of the United Nations. There has been one standard, one value and one vision with which we work with” he said.

Moon arrived at the podium in which he stood alone for close to half an hour just past 7 pm and immediately commenced the reading of a detailed statement. In it he addressed issues of accountability and commended the “ Unity Government headed by President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe” in the steps taken towards “reconciliation”.

When questioned as to why the UN did not agree to a ‘ homegrown solution’ with regard to the ethnic conflict, Moon said that although a ‘gap’ did exist between the present government and the International Community, it had improved from his previous visit in 2009.

“It has been rather difficult sometimes, even for me to talk with the government and the leadership. There was a gap between the expectations of the international community and the level of government help. Even though I think we are not fully there the level of gap can be reduced as soon as possible,” he said.

He further commended the progress in the North since his previous visit.

“Since my last visit in 2009, there has been great progress. I welcome the initiative that the president and premier has taken to undertaken to promote good governance. I visited Jaffna and saw an enormous contrast with my experience back in 2009. Great progress has been made in elevating the problems associated with mass displacement” he said.

He however asserted the need of expediting the process of reconciliation stating that the “ victims cant wait for ever”.

“Reconciliation will not be accomplished overnight. It is a complex process which needs continuous nurturing. I welcome the establishment of the office of missing persons and the process of constitutional amendment. These are positive steps but more needs to be done. The victims cant wait forever. They deserve credible transparent and solid transitional justice mechanism” he said.

The Secretary General also remained non committal on the issue of the participation of foreign judges in the proposed transitional justice mechanism.

“I think both the UN and the government is involved in this process. There may be some level of difference in the level of involvement, difference of advancement and progress in major issues” he said. (Hafeel Farisz and Nabeela Hussain)
