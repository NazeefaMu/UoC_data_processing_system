(Daily Mail, London), 27 March 2017 -
Hundreds of Russians including Progress  Party leader Alexei Navalny were arrested today as thousands defied  bans to stage anti-corruption protests across the country.


Navalny  called for the marches after publishing a detailed report this month  accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of controlling a property empire  through a shadowy network of nonprofit organisations.


The report has been viewed over 11 million times on YouTube but so far Medvedev has made no comment on the claims.Sunday’s march in Moscow was one of the  biggest unauthorised demonstrations in recent years, with police putting  turnout at 8,000 people. Police bundled Navalny into a minibus as he was walking to the protest.Police  said about 500 people had been arrested in Moscow, while OVD-Info, a  website that monitors the detention of activists, said at least 700 had  been detained, as well as dozens in other cities.
