New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), 27 Feb 2018 -  
Maldives has declined India’s invitation to participate in the biennial naval exercise Milan, which starts on March 6, Navy chief admiral Sunil Lanba said on Tuesday.  


Maldives has not given any reason for the decision, Lanba told reporters on the sidelines of an event in New Delhi.  Navy sources said over 16 countries have confirmed their participation in the exercise.   The biennial exercise ‘Milan’ is being organised at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the backdrop of China’s growing military posturing in the Indo-Pacific region and officials said the issue is likely to figure during deliberations among navy chiefs of the participating countries at the event.
