They decided to call it quits


	



 

A Blue purohita speaking on the annual budget the other day minced no words when he expressed his vehement opposition to a certain budget proposal. 

 


Raising his voice, the purohita declared that there were many others who shared his view and he would not allow the implementation of this proposal. 


It was a young Green member from the gem-rich district who immediately reacted to the Blue purohita’s statement. “You should have taken up this issue at the meeting of the top decision-making body. You kept your mouth shut there and now you are making a big noise here to become a big hero” This reply drew tumultuous approval from many government backbenchers.


The sittings were suspended soon afterwards for the lunch break and most members headed for the council canteen and the purohita and the young member from the gem-rich district were among them.
And at the canteen there was a face-face encounter between the two antagonists. And as their colleagues who feared a possible scuffle between them were looking on wide eyed and with bated breath, the Blue purohita walked up to his detractor and addressed the latter in a cordial tone: “Malli, why do you attack me like this openly in the House? You know that we two can settle any matter by talking to each other privately… If you have any problem, see me at the Ministry… Now let us have our lunch.”


The duo was later seen taking their lunch at the same table, they say.
