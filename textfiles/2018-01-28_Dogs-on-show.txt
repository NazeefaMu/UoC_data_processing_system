The 119th All Breeds Championship Dog Show of the Ceylon Kennel Club was held on Sunday. It was a day of fun for all pooches as they walked, ran and showed off their skills in front of a large crowd. Geoff Duffield, International Judge – Working/Pastoral Breeds judged them throughout the show.  Pics by Kithsiri De Mel
