In response to the news report published on a Tamil daily newspaper in Jaffna regarding a content of a meeting held between former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap, the US Embassy today remained non-committal.

When the Daily Mirror inquired about the meeting, the Embassy said that the Ambassador met political leaders as a routine.

“The Ambassador meets routinely with political leaders, civil society and community leaders. The Ambassador honours the confidence of private meetings and does not discuss the contents of such meetings publicly.”

The Daily Mirror asked whether Ambassador Keshap had said, during the meeting, that the US and Western nations didn’t welcome the prospects of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa contesting polls and becoming President of Sri Lanka.

The Daily Mirror also asked whether the Embassy sought a clarification from the Tamil daily on the news report.

The dbsjeyaraj.com said a news report had initially appeared on Jaffna based Tamil daily Kaalaikkathir edited by Senior Tamil Journalist Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, on June 12 about the said meeting, where Ambassador Keshap had reportedly said the US and the Western did not welcome the prospects of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa contesting and becoming the President of Sri Lanka.
