MSCA Convener Ryan Jayalath told the Daily Mirror that close to 4000 protestors will arrive in Colombo around 3.30 pm today and that they were in Kiribathgoda at the moment.

“The final destination of the protest march has not been confirmed yet,” he added.

The protest march commenced from Kandy on Monday (July 31). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
