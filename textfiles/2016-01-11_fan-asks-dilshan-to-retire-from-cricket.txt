A Sri Lankan cricket fan, who was at the Eden Park pavilion during the second T20 match against New Zealand yesterday, was overheard asking Sri Lanka cricketer T.M. Dilshan to retire from cricket immediately.
Dilshan, who was on his way to the pavilion after Sri Lanka lost the match asked the fan, “Are you going to replace me,” he responded.
New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by nine wickets, with ten overs to spare, at Eden Park on Sunday to win the two-match Twenty20 series 2-0.
