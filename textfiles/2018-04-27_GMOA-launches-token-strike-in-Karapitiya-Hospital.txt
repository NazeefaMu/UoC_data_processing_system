GMOA launches token strike in Karapitiya Hospital


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) launched a 24-hour-token strike at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital this morning against the British doctor who was performing heart surgeries at the hospital.

The temporary ban imposed on the British surgeon preventing him from conducting surgeries, was lifted last week on a recommendation made by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) when the GMOA claimed that the British doctor did not have a licence to practice in the United Kingdom (UK) as it needed to be renewed from time to time.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told Daily Mirror that the Director General of Health Services had ordered the hospital director to lift the temporary ban without a valid ground and without conducting an inquiry despite he had guaranteed to do so.

“When we inquired about the qualifications of this doctor, we found out that he only has the registration of General Medical Council (GMC) in UK and not practising rights. He was deprived of practising rights in UK in 2015 due to some reason and he had concealed it while he was producing his documents to the SLMC,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
