Sri Lanka remained committed to reform the minimum age of marriage for girls under the Muslim law, with the active participation of the concerned community, the government told the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in Geneva yesterday.

The Sri Lankan delegation expressed these views as a response to the concerns raised by the experts of the Committee which concluded its consideration of the fifth to sixth periodic report of Sri Lanka under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

When questioned about reforming the minimum age of marriage under the Muslim law, Sri Lanka said a committee had been set up under the aegis of the Justice Ministry to carry out the necessary legal reform.  

“The Government is following a two-pronged approach to the issue, namely sensitization of the concerned community and discussions with community leaders, while respecting the Convention’s provisions,” the delegation said.

In a statement, the UN said experts also voiced concern that the amendment to remove exception for Muslim girls to the statutory rape provision in the Penal Code seemed to be planned only after the amendment to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act was completed.  

They asked whether it would be possible for the Government to take a comprehensive approach to rectify all existing discriminatory laws against Muslim girls as a package.

Meanwhile, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Sri Lanka Kirsten Sandberg commended the positive steps taken by Sri Lanka with respect to children’s rights

However, she inquired about general measures of implementation of the Convention, noting that children were not really understood as rights holders and fully prioritized in Sri Lanka.

The Sri Lankan delegation was led by Women and Child Affairs Secretary Chandrani Senaratne. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
