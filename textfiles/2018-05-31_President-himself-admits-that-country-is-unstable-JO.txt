Referring to the speech delivered by President Maithripala Sirisena at the 76th Birth Anniversary of the Late Ven. Sobitha Thera yesterday, Joint Opposition said today the essence of the speech of the President was that he himself admitted the country was not stable.

Addressing a news briefing, JO member and MP Shehan Semasinghe said the President seemed to be frustrated with the way how the Good Governance had run the Government.

“The President admits that the Good Governance has been unable to fulfill promises given to the people in 2015. If the President admits that its Government has not met the aspirations of the citizens, he should give up his Presidency and hold the General Elections immediately,” Semasinghe said.

“The President accuses and criticizes the present Government. It seems the President is not getting the due support from its fellow MPs and hence he has been unable to execute his plans well,” Semasinghe added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
