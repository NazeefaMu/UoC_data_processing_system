The United National Party (UNP) can consider taking its former general secretary Tissa Attanayake back to the fold if he makes a formal request to re-join the party, his successor Kabir Hashim said today.

“Several UNPers have left the party and rejoined later and there is no obstacle for Mr. Attanayake doing the same,” Mr. Hashim told a media briefing in  response to a question asked by journalists about the speculation in political circles of the possibility of Mr. Attanayake rejoining the UNP.
