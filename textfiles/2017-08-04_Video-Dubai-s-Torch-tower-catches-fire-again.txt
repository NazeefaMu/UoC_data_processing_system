Video: Dubai's Torch tower catches fire again


	



Fire 'spread rapidly' through a skyscraper in Dubai's world-famous Marina in the early hours of this morning. Alarming footage showed flames climbing up the 79-storey Torch Tower, a residential building popular with expats in the United Arab Emirates tourism hotspot. Burning debris could be seen spiraling down to the ground below as firefighters desperately tackled the blaze. The same skyscraper was devastated by fire in 2015 and the building's flammable cladding, which was similar to that used in Grenfell Tower, was blamed for fuelling the flames.
