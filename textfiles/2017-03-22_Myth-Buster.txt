BUSTED: “This is not totally untrue. When you are young it does not really matter, it is older people who need to be careful. When you have eaten a very large meal, your blood supply gets transferred to your stomach, so if you do any form of exercise or go swimming you can cramp. If a person with a heart problem does this there can be an issue. For young people in general, there is no problem. Generally, we tell people to eat two hours before exercising but light meals are fine. In fact, when training, during pre-workout and post-work out, you have to eat as you need energy. The myth is true only if you have had a large meal” explained Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama.
