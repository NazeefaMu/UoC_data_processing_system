Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a botched interrogation - government insiders have revealed.  


According to CNN, the Saudi Arabian government is preparing a report which will say Khashoggi died in an interrogation that was intended to end with his abduction from Turkey.  


CNN said that two sources had leaked the report, which is said to be still in its preliminary stages, and it will say the interrogation ‘was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved will be held responsible’.  


One of the sources reportedly told the network that the report ‘could change’ and is ‘still being prepared’.   U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday he had seen the news about the Saudi report, but argued ‘nobody knows’ if it was an official report.  


‘I heard that report, but nobody knows if it’s an official report. So far, it’s just a rumor of a report coming out,’ The President said while visiting Georgia to inspect the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael.   


The revelation comes as team of Turkish and Saudi officials tonight entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for a joint inspection two weeks after the Washington Post journalist apparently vanished inside.  


The inspection was agreed after Saudi King Salman and Turkish President Erdogan spoke yesterday for the first time since Turkey accused the Saudis of killing and dismembering Jamal Khashoggi who criticised the Saudi crown prince.(Daily Mail), October 15, 2018
