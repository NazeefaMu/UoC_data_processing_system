Two opposing forces blocking new constitution: JVP


	

Two opposing forces are preventing the enacting of a new constitution which is more suitable for the country through a proper democratic process, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the government was trying to sweep important issues under the carpet by taking cover behind the new constitution while some forces in the opposition are opposing the enactment of a new constitution just to cover up criticism against them with regard to acts of large scale corruption committed by them when in power.
He accused Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of attempting to have his own way when enacting a new constitution by suppressing the other political parties.
Mr. Dissanayake said the issue was not with the provisions preventing rulers acting against the nation’s interests but doing things underhand.
Citing an example, he said the government was planning to give the chairpersons of district development committees’ similar perks given to cabinet ministers.
“This is an act which goes beyond the constitutional provisions of limiting the number of cabinet ministers, state and deputy ministers,” he said and added that national reconciliation could not be brought with constitutional provisions.
Mr. Dissanayake said the process of enacting the constitution should be one where the rights of all 225 members are respected unlike the resolution presented to Parliament.
However, he said his party was still positive that a new constitution which was most democratic could be enacted through a democratic process and that his party would make sure that unhealthy proposals would not come inside chocolate wrappers. (YP)
