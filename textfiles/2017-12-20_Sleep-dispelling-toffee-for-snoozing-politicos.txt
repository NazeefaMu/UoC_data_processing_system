Sleep-dispelling ‘toffee’ for snoozing politicos


	



 

There are several top team members in the Diyawanna council, who regularly slip into a soothing slumber when the sittings are on, they say. 

 


Meanwhile, a team member handling science and technology who decided to stop this catnap taking habit of his seniors once and for all, has got his Ministry experts to produce a sleep-dispelling toffee.
This toffee giving a pleasant sweet taste, perfected through a great deal of experimentation is a great success, they say.


Ingredients that have gone into making this toffee are readily available local products such as cinnamon, pepper and garlic. The purohita who initiated this novel experiment had given it to several Diyawanna white collar ones to test their efficacy. 


“Now we are ready to give this toffee to our napping Diyawanna seniors to keep them awake during the sittings,” the purohita had said.
