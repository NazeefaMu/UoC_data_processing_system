SriLankan Airlines today banned passengers and crew members from using and carrying Samsung Note 7 phones on board SriLankan and Mihin Lanka aircraft with immediate effect.

Issuing a statement, SriLankan Airlines said the ban comes into effect subsequent to the series of incident reported on explosions of the mobile device when connected to power.

“With the Airline's prime priority being the safety and well-being of passengers, the Airline took immediate action to advise the passengers against the carriage and usage of the device on board and prepared cabin crew members to assist passengers,” it said.

With the imposing of a complete ban the Airline has taken measures to educate the passengers through posters displayed at check-in counters and pre-boarding announcements.

The Airline said it has a procedure in place in case a device is found on-board.
