The Special Police Unit probing the abuse of public funds is expected to quiz several popular actresses who had opened beauty parlors and taken a hand in organizing reality shows in the recent past. 

 


These actresses are said to have acquired mansions and gone on foreign jaunts thanks to the patronage extended by some politicos.


A former Diyawanna member, a popular star proficient in Hindi and another prominent one who made an unsuccessful bid to enter a provincial council are among those to be grilled by Police.
