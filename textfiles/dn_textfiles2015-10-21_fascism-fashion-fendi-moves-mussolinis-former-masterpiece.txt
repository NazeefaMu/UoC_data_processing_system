From fascism to fashion: Fendi moves into Mussolini's former masterpiece

ITALY: It was built as the centrepiece of Mussolini's new Roman empire, a symbol of deluded grandeur that was abandoned during the Second World War and has lain empty ever since.
Now a striking Fascist building that Italians call "the Square Colosseum" has been given a new lease of life as the global headquarters of Fendi, the fashion company.
The firm has spent millions of dollars renovating the building, in the latest example of private corporations stepping in to save Italy's crumbling cultural heritage.
With its solid shape and symmetrical rows of arches, it imitates the form of the ancient Roman amphitheatre, but in a sleek, rationalist style.
Known officially as the Palazzo della Civilta Italiana, or the Palace of Italian Civilisation, it was built under "Il Duce" as the main focus of EUR, a new town on the outskirts of Rome conceived at the height of Fascist rule in the Thirties.
Designed as a permanent exhibition space, it was due to have been inaugurated in 1942 as part of a grandiose world fair intended to celebrate the achievements of 20 years of Fascism. But the Second World War put paid to all that.
Apart from a brief spell when one floor was used by a state labour institute, it has been empty ever since - a shining white monument perched on a hill, clearly visible to visitors as they drive into Rome from Leonardo da Vinci airport.
At the top of the building, a romantic vision of Italy is spelled out in giant letters: "A population of poets, of artists, of heroes, of saints, of thinkers, of scientists, of navigators and voyagers."
Around its base are 28 marble statues, allegories for sturdy Fascist virtues such as social order, labour, physics and military genius.
While the white travertine exterior was in good condition, and the Carrara marble stairways and floors were well preserved, the building had to be converted into offices for Fendi's 450 staff.
"It wasn't built as an office, and that was one of the biggest challenges for the architects and engineers," said Maria Sole Henny, Fendi's corporate affairs manager. "It was effectively a big white marble box. There was no plumbing and no electricity so we had to install all that."
For the first time in the building's history, the public will have access to the palazzo, as the ground floor will become a permanent exhibition space with free entrance. The inaugural exhibition, which opens on Friday, will examine the history of the building and the Fascist vision for EUR. There will be footage from Italian films in which the building has featured. The trend for fashion companies to be involved in restoration projects began with Tod's, the luxury goods maker, which in 2011 paid £22 million ($46 million) for the cleaning and restoration of the Colosseum. Diego Della Valle, the company's chairman, said he hoped that his example would encourage other wealthy businessmen to help rescue Italy's unrivalled cultural heritage. His appeal evidently struck a nerve.
In the past few years, some of the best-known names in Italian fashion have stepped forward to sponsor restoration projects, rather like powerful families during the Renaissance commissioned palaces, monuments and works of art as statements of their wealth.
In its first major foray into the area, Fendi paid for the restoration of the Trevi Fountain - the ornate monument in Rome in which Anita Ekberg famously cavorted for Fellini's La Dolce Vita, the 1960 black-and-white classic.
A few hundred yards away, work started this month on the Spanish Steps, where Gregory Peck once flirted with Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday, the 1953 romantic comedy. That clean-up is being paid for by Bulgari, the jewellers, which has its flagship store close by.
Meanwhile in Venice, the Diesel jeans company has footed the bill for the cleaning of the Rialto Bridge, which spans the Grand Canal.
With official data showing Italy's economy growing by just 0.2 per cent this year, the calls for public-private partnerships to save the country's cultural heritage are likely to grow.
The government has appealed for a private sponsor to stump up £25 million to preserve the Domus Aurea, a vast palace built by the Emperor Nero in Rome.
"This is an opportunity for a big company to sponsor an extraordinary project, which will capture the world's attention," said Dario Franceschini, the minister for cultural heritage.
