The Ministry of Prisons is to commence installing CCTV camera surveillance systems in selected prisons next week to ramp up security, a top ministry official said today.

Full HD (high-definition) cameras will be installed at prisons in Welikada, Angunakolapelessa, Pallekele, Mahara and Negombo.

The project will be initially implemented at the recently constructed ‘Super Prison’ in Angunakolapelessa, and is scheduled to be completed within an year.

“Most jails already have cameras set up at the entrance and we are looking at including the inside of the prison as well. The move is a part of a long-pending plan to minimize malpractice inside,” the official said.

According to prison authorities cell phone jammers were also set up in a few prisons but the project had not received the expected outcome.

Meanwhile, the ministry official said that some inmates from the Welikada prison will be transferred to Angunakolapelessa once it is open due to overcrowding. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
