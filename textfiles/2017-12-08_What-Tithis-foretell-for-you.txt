Lunar days and their significance

 

We in our previous article on the above subject explained what the Lunar calendar and the Lunar Day -Tithi are.  


According to Lunar calendar, a day is called ‘Tithi’. 28 days plus the New Moon day and the Full Moon day make a lunar month. 

 

 

Origin of Numerology


Although Numerology is looked on as a separate discipline today, it had been initially an integral part of Astrology in ancient India, Sumer, Babylonia and in several other ancient civilizations. However, it had later developed as a separate subject and it was known as Shabdha Shastra in Ancient India.  


 

Moon and its influence on man 


Although the Moon is a satellite of the earth, the ancient Indian seers have reckoned it as one of the nine planets or Navagraha for purposes of Astrological calculations.


In Astrology, the Moon is described as the Queen of the planetary system and as the ‘planet’ having the greatest influence on man and the terrestrial phenomena.


 

Rules over human mind
