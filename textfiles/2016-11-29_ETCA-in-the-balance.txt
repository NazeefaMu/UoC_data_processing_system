ETCA in the balance?


	

The Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India is unlikely to be signed this year though another round of talks is scheduled to take place soon.

So far there had been two rounds of discussions between the officials of the two countries.

Earlier, Indian Minister of Commerce Nirmala Sitharaman arrived in the country and said the matter should be pursued without any pressure on timelines. (Kelum Bandara)
