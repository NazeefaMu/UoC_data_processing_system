Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara today warned National Freedom Front (NFF) leader MP Wimal Weerawansa and MP Jayantha Samaraweera to present in court on time when their cases were heard.

The court case was to be taken up yesterday morning at the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.

MP Weerawansa said that he was unable to present at court because of the traffic.

However, the Magistrate had warned him to be punctual and be on time for cases.

The case was against the MPs on charges of causing disturbance to public by holding a demonstration outside the UN Office in Colombo.

The demonstration was held against the visit of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein on February 6, 2016. (Yoshitha Perera)
