Joint Opposition National Organizer and MP Dullas Alahapperuma today requested the UPFA and SLFP ministers in the government to withdraw from their portfolios as this is a UNP regime, while claiming that government will lose its two third majority of the parliament within two weeks.

he told a news conference that the government had lost its focus as to how it should tackle the shortcomings and issues prevailing currently in the country.

"It is useless to hold a portfolio in the government. It is full of chaos. That’s why we invite our dear SLFP and UPFA ministers to leave the scene and join us. But I don’t intend that they all should join hands with us; if anybody wishes to link with us, they are mostly welcome," he said.

Moreover, he discovered that this government deliberately postpones the provincial council elections as they know for sure that they will lose the election.

He further dismissed that Polonnaruwa District UPFA MP Roshan Ranasinghe withdrew from JO politics.

"It is categorically mentioned in the statement made by him that he had not terminated from JO politics or left the JO. Therefore don’t misinterpret it, "he insisted.

Meanwhile, Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena said this government was attempting to establish a federal system of government while demolishing the unity government.

He went on to say that rumours spreading with regard to the split of Joint Opposition were false and the media should not publish them in big letters.

"Although there are confrontations within the parties affiliated to JO, we have no idea in separating the unity of the party," he added. (Sheain Fernendopulle)
