The Cabinet on Tuesday has decided to appoint a committee to revisit the implementation of the earlier envisaged September 1 ban on the import, production, sale and use of polythene, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister, Gayantha Karunatilaka said yesterday.

He told the weekly news briefing that however, there was no change in the decision to implement the ban on the use of polythene from September 1.

The committee to review the ban on polythene and make recommendations before January 2018 comprises the Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance, Industries and Commerce, Environment and the Director General of the Central Environment Authority and a representative of the Industrial Technology Institute.

The spokesman said they would listen to the concerns expressed by polythene manufactures, people engaged in polythene-related packaging and wholesale merchants, affected by this decision and propose alternatives.

“However, the government will follow a lenient policy on those found violating the ban until January 2018 when the committee recommendations are expected,” he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
