Considering the revision bail application filed on behalf of Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and Former Director General of Divi Neguma Development Department Kithsiri Ranawaka, the Colombo High Court today ordered the Kaduwela Magistrate to revise the remand order made against the suspects.

Judge M.C.B.S. Morayas informed the High Court Registrar to send this revision order to the Kaduwela Magistrate via fax today.

The Judge observed that the suspects had been granted bail by the High Court over similar cases and that crucial investigations were completed.

The suspects were remanded by the Kaduwela Magistrate under the Public Property Act over the allegation of misappropriating Rs. 36.5 million allocated to the Divi Neguma Department by purchasing and distributing GI pipes during the last Presidential Election.

The matter is to be taken up in Kaduwela Magistrate today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
