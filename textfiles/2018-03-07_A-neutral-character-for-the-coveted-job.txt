A ‘neutral character’ for the coveted job?


	



 

Most Green party members favour the proposal to offer the controversial war hero the law and order portfolio now being held by the Green leader, they say.

 


However, a billionaire businessman with a blood tie to a very high authority has put his foot down that this portfolio should not go to the war hero under any circumstances. 


The kinsman’s strong objection has reportedly sent down the drain all efforts made by the doctor in the top team to put his soldier friend in charge of the key portfolio. 


The big boss who has the final say in the matter has now decided to offer the portfolio to a ‘neutral character’, they say.
