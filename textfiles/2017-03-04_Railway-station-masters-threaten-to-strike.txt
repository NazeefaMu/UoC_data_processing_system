Railway station masters have decided to stage a two-day token strike from March 7 midnight, the Railway Station Masters Association (RSMA) said yesterday.

RSMA Secretary Ruwan Pathirange said their main demand was to seek permanent appointments in higher ranks; especially railway station masters.

He said the authorities had failed to make permanent appointments for station masters in main railway stations since 2004.

“There are vacancies for railway station masters in more than 60 main railway stations in the country, including in Colombo Fort and Maradana railway stations,” he said.

Mr. Pathirange alleged such vacancies were filled with employees in acting capacities, while there were qualified people to fill such vacancies.He said the last examination to appoint railway station masters was held in 2002 and since then the government had not conduct an examination for the post.
