DSI 'Sithuvili' Sri Lanka 2015
Fine lines on canvass

The 25th annual awarding ceremony of the DSI Sithuvili' art competition was held at the BMICH recently under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. The President lauded the DSI Samson Group for coming forward and setting an example to the public via DSI 'Sithuvili' Sri Lanka by using its profits for the wellbeing of the country's future children of Sri Lanka. Students above Grade Two from across the country participated in the competition
The event was the climax of the three-day art exhibition held at the National Art Gallery where over a thousand entries that won merit awards and above were on show.
Welcoming the guests Managing Director, DSI Samson Group Kulatunga Rajapaksa, said that the project was intended as a service to the community by an indigenous corporate entity with an unblemished record for fifty three years. "Our firm was founded by D. Samson Rajapaksa and the achievements over the years are in keeping with his vision where we strive to serve the community as a truly Sri Lankan company," he stressed.
Pointing out that 'Sithuvili' project is held purely as a service to the upcoming generation by way of promoting their skills, he said that there is no financial or commercial gain at all from the competition.
He had a special word of thanks to President Sirisena for gracing the occasion in spite of the President's busy schedule to spend time with the children.
Chairman, D.Samson and Sons (Pvt) Ltd. Nandadasa Rajapaksa, reminded the audience that it was the 25th anniversary of 'Sithuvili', a project intended for the new generation to display their talent. "The mind of the child is like a heaven. By the time the child becomes an adult it becomes a jail. Who is responsible for this unfortunate situation? Is it the children? No - it's the adults," he said.
In addition to the prize-winning children, nine senior citizens received the 'Sithumina' Award for their contribution towards the promotion of arts in Sri Lanka. Among them were Ven. Egodamulle Amaramoli Thero who initiated the erection of the world's largest rock-cut seated Buddha statue in his temple off Kurunegala, Indian sculptor Sthapathi Muttiah, who, though a non-Buddhist, designed the statue and executed the entire operation and Devianayagampillai Easuwaran who contributed bulk of the funds and managed the project.
Other recipients included educationist Jezima Ismail, veteran media personality Dr Edwin Ariyadasa, longstanding songstress Latha Walpola, seasoned actress Irangani Serasinghe, the multi-talented, film director/script writer/lyricist Professor Sunil Ariyaratne and renowned musician Dr Victor Ratnayake.
The event was conceptualised and choreographed by Bandula Nanayakkarawasam.
The remarkably unique feature of the show was the promotion of local values especially through the memory of Professor Senerath Paranavitharena, whose life and service was celebrated by the composition of a song by Nanayakkarawasam. A key part of the entertainment of the ceremony was the total of 23 school children performing along with the expert orchestra with the objective of encouraging the development of skills among the new generation. The award-winning university students of the 'Kavitha' singing competition also performed.
This year's 'Sithuvili' attracted a record number of entries exceeding 100,000, most of which were of a high standard. The initial DSI Sithuvili Art Competition conducted in 1992 attracted 42,000 entries from schools around the island.
The total sum of gifts for participants this year was increased to Rs. 6,000,000/= with the best entries being awarded special certificates as well.
This is a major CSR project of the DSI Samson Group which is among the country's premier business conglomerates and is the leading manufacturer of footwear and bicycle tyres in Sri Lanka.
