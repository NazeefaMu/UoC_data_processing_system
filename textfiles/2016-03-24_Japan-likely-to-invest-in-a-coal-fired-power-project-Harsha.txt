Japan is expected to invest in a coal power project in Sri Lanka which was provided 600 megawatts of electricity to the national grid, a Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva said yesterday.

He is currently visiting Japan on the invitation of the Japanese Government and told Daily Mirror by phone that it would be a high efficiency coal-fired power generation project.

The deputy minister said the Japanese investment would be in addition to the proposed coal-fired project in Sampur on a joint venture with India.

However, he said he could not provide further details on the proposed project with Japan.

“We have to identify a suitable location for the project,” he said.

In January, Japan agreed with India to support the introduction of high-efficiency coal-fired power generation and renewable energy technology.

The deputy minister said Japan would invest heavily in the development of urban transportation in Sri Lanka.

“It is actually urban mass transportation. I cannot give exact details at the moment. In addition Japan will invest in the airport expansion project. Japan which has a positive attitude towards Sri Lanka will provide funding in a manner that will not be a burdan to the Sri Lankan Government,” he said.

The Norochcholai Coal-Fired power plant located in Puttalam generates 900 megawatts of electricity. (Kelum Bandara)
