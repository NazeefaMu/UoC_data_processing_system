Lumen Singers Singers to enlighten the season


	



The singers in this visually handicapped choir – “LUMEN SINGERS” -- come from poor and destitute backgrounds. They have been trained over the years and have been singing at leading hotels in and around Colombo and even in the outstations.   

This year at the request of these visually handicapped members, the Oblate Missions Centre has come forward to assist them in earning their living and will be hosting them at various venues.  



These singers are being trained by the renowned and dedicated musician Francis de Almeida. The singers will not only give light to others through their own darkness, but their singing will bring immense joy and happiness during the season.   

If you wish to do a good deed by assisting in this enlightened mission, you may contact Pat Benedict on 0777711044 / 0777560796 / 0714779226.
