Despite the beliefs of many, medicine isn’t all about drugs and surgeries. The subject of physiotherapy is one specialised area in medicine where medical miracles are performed using a minimum of invasive technologies. But’ the topic still remains obscure to many people. Is physiotherapy all about rehabilitation? Not so, according to the book ‘Suwabara diwiyai Bhauthachikithsawai’ (Physiotherapy for a healthy life), by Dr. Sujeewa Weerasinghe, an acclaimed physiotherapist with close to 20 years of experience in the field. The book is edited by Lankadeepa journalist Gayan Sooriyaarachchi, who is also a frequent contributor to the Dailymirror  Health Capsule.
