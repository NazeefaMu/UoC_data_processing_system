A protest organized by the Inland Revenue Trade Join Front was held today in front of the department premises against the new Inland Revenue Bill. The protestors charged that the bill is drafted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to slap higher taxes on people. The IMF has held back third tranche of Sri Lankan US $ 1.5bn bailout package until the draft is tabled in parliament. Pix by Nisal Baduge
