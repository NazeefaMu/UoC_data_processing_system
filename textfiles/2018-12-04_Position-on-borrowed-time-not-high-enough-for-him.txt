Position on borrowed time not high enough for him!


	

There are two Diyawanna members from Wayamba who function as co-organizers of a certain electorate. One of these Diyawanna members was elevated to the top team level while the other was offered a portfolio at state level.

 


The member who got a state level job has gone into a sulk over being denied a place in the top team despite holding equal status with his colleague as a co-organizer.


When his supporters call on him to congratulate him, the state level one would tell them angrily: “There’s no reason for you to congratulate me! I am only a state one when our friend has been raised to cabinet level!”


On hearing that his colleague is throwing a tantrum over being overlooked for a top team position, his colleague had called on him at his residence and consoled him telling him: “Machang, don’t be disappointed! Remember we are holding these positions on borrowed time!”
