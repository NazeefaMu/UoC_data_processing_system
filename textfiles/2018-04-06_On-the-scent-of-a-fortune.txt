A distillery owned by a business tycoon was sealed a few months ago for dodging tax payment over a period of time with the tax dues running into arrears amounting to Rs.700 million, they say.


Meanwhile, two leading politicos are said to be pressing a revenue collecting establishment to okay the re-opening of the distillery by accepting a part-payment in lieu of the full amount in default. 


This distillery is said to be a money-spinning venture and the two politicos are out to make a killing out of its going back into production, they say.
