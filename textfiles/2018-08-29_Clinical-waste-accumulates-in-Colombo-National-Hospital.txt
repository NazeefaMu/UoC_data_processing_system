Clinical waste were dumped behind the Epilepsy centre in Colombo National Hospital since last month causing health issues, Daily Mirror learned.

It was observed that among the clinical waste there were body fluids and surgical waste such as gauze and cotton filled with blood.

When contacted National Hospital Acting Director Dr. W.K Wickremesinghe said that a tender has been granted to a private firm by the Health Ministry to transport the waste and incinerate.

However, Dr. Wickremesinghe said that following a Court order the waste disposal site owned by the private firm was banned therefore the company had faced difficulties in finding a suitable location immediately.

“The company however, did not stop collecting the trash but their daily collecting quantity had reduced. So the waste is now accumulating in a larger quantity than the company takes away,” he said.

Dr. Wickremesinghe said the matter was already refered to the Health Ministry as the Hospital authorities does not have any link with the company.

He also explained that the matter was a common issue among the Government Hospitals in Colombo District as it was the same company which collects clinical waste from all the hospitals in the district.

However, Dr. Wickremesinghe added that the hospital authorities had found several temporary locations to store the waste to minimise the health hazardous caused by the waste until the company resolve the matter.

Meanwhile, Speaking to Daily Mirror, All Ceylon Nurses’ Union (ACNU) Acting President H. M. S. B. Madiwatte charged that the Health Ministry had not taken sufficient effort to resolve the matter.

He said that there is a risk of spreading severe diseases especially if these waste mix with the drainage water and contaminate with the river water.

“ACNU would like to convey our strong displeasure to the health authorities including the subject minister over the lethargic attitude to resolve the issue,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
