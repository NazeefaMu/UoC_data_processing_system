People who were personally benefitted by the public money were now trying to bring a no- confidence motion against him as they were no longer able to misappropriate the people’s money, Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake said in Colombo today.
He said that several privileges that people were deprived of for the last 11 years were restored by the new budget.
He further said the no-confidence motion was not a challenge for him.
He was speaking at the event of granting Rs. 50,000 donation for the development work of the Bodhi Samudrarama Temple in Modara yesterday (25) morning.
“Some say there is no flavor in the budget, while some others are planning the no-confidence motion. But people are aware of the relief they are enjoying from the day following the budget speech.
“We have increased the investment and strengthened the businessmen of small and medium level,” he said.
The Chief Incumbent of the temple Ven. Tumbe Upananda Thera received the cheque for the donation from the Minister.
