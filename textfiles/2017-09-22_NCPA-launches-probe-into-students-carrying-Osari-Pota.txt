NCPA launches probe into students carrying Osari Pota


	

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) today launched an investigation into the incident at Gannoruwa in Kandy on Thursday where 250 female students of a primary school were used to carry Osari pota (Saree bridal veil) of a bride.

The 3,200 meter-long piece of bridal clothing was created by a beautician, who is hopeful of setting a Guinness World Record for her work as the world’s longest Saree.

The students of Alwathugoda Sarath Ekanayake Primary School were seen lined up along the Gannoruwa–Kandy Road displaying the Osari Pota to the Guinness officials.

NCPA Chairperson Marini De Livera said the act was not only a clear violation of child rights, but also degrading.

“These children should stay at school and not carry a saree out in the sun during school hours. We don’t even know how many students fainted. This is an ill-treatment of the students,” she told the Daily Mirror.

She said once the students were handed over to the school, their protection and responsibility was with the Principal as they are under his custody.

“The Principal can’t send students to wedding functions. I have instructed the NCPA Police team to obtain a report from the area Police Station so we can continue with an investigation immediately,” she said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
