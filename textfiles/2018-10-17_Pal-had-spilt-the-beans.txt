Pal had spilt the beans!


	



 

It is public knowledge now that a secret meeting between the former strongman and Number One did take place despite an immediate denial by the peace-maker who played the host.

 


Both parties to this powwow, which was expected to remain a top secret, had got a jolt when the media reported the story the following day itself.


Number One on his part had used his intelligence arm to track down the person who had leaked the news to the media and he had found that an NGO man with a moniker meaning ‘new-gem’ – incidentally a close pal of the peace-maker had done the damage.


An irate Number One had sent for the peace-maker and given him a tongue-lashing. Chastised, the man had lost no time in rushing to the media to deny there had been such a meeting at his residence, they say.
