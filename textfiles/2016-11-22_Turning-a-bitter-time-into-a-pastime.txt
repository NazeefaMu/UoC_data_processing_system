Turning a bitter time into a pastime


	



 

Some Diyawanna backbenchers forced to be present in the House in view of the ongoing debate on the Budget 2017 have taken to playing cyber games to kill time.

 


These backbenchers – mostly newcomers – are said to be unhappy that they have been compelled to attend the debate on the Budget continuously for several days, and they have found cyber games a good pastime.


Party leaders have made it compulsory for the backbenchers to attend the sittings these days expecting them to familiarize themselves with the working of Parliament apart from ensuring a steady quorum in the House. But all indications are that these members are not interested in fulfilling either purpose, they say.
