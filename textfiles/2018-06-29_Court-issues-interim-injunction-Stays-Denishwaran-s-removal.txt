The Appeal Court today issued an interim injunction restraining Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran from removing Provincial Minister of Transport and Fisheries, B. Denishwaran from his post.

Mr. Denishwaran had filed a petition seeking a court order declaring the CM’s order null and void.

A two-member bench comprising Justice Kumudini Wickremesinghe and Justice Janath De Silva directed the minister to continue in his portfolio pending the determination of the petition. (Manopriya Gunasekara and Thilini De Silva)
