The government presented a supplementary estimate to seek parliamentary approval to spend rupees Rs.1 million for the Gamperaliya inauguration programme in Kurunegala.

Approval was also sought for the allocation of Rs.500,000 million for Gamperaliya projects.

JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake who asked a question said one million rupees was not the total amount spent for the Gamperaliya inauguration ceremony. He said the main issue is the absence of guidelines to curb spending for the state functions.

House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said the private sector had partly sponsored the Gamperaliya inauguration ceremony. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
