Claiming that there were more MPs who hold dual-citizenship certificates other than Geetha Kumarasinghe the joint opposition today said some embassies and countries were not willing to reveal these details.

Addressing a news briefing, MP Sisira Jayakody said some countries like Canada, Australia and Switzerland won’t give details of MPs especially that of TNA MPs.

He said the government has an obligation to obtain the details of the MPs and Ministers who hold dual-citizenship certificates.

“Even the Home Affairs Minister accepted that there could be such MPs. We urge the government to take legal action against them. The government can intervene and get information from foreign countries and embassies. However, it shows no interest in doing this,” he said.

The MP said had former MP Kumarasinghe joined the government accepting various invitations, she could have remained an MP.

When asked about the letter sent by the immigration controller informing the election observer PAFFREL that Ms. Kumarasinghe was the only MP who is a dual-citizen, MP Jayakody said it was not the case.

He reiterated the details should be obtained from embassies and not from Parliament as done by the Immigration Department.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
