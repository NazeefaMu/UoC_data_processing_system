Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh by six wickets to go 1-0 up in the two-match T20 series. After opting to bat, the hosts rode on fifties from Soumya Sarkar and Mushfiqur Rahim to post 193/5. In reply, fiery knocks from Kusal Mendis, Dasun Shanaka and Thisara Perera helped Sri Lanka seal the deal with 20 balls remaining.

At the halfway stage, Bangladesh would have felt that they have found their mojo back, having lost the Test series. However, all the good work done by their batsmen was undone in a jiffy through blistering knocks of Kusal Mendis and Danushka Gunathilaka - a 53-run stand inside five overs of play.

Then Dasun Shanaka and Thisara Perera came to party with a 65-run stand off 30 balls to seal the chase, and take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.The second and final T20 will be held in Sylhet on February 18.
