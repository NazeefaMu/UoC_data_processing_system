A story gone viral in the education sector about a bungalow for a school principal put up at a cost of Rs.20 million in the backwoods of the   paradise is said to be raising many an eyebrow. 

 


A sibling of a prominent politico hailing from this area had won the tender to construct this bungalow, they say. Although the documentation says that the bungalow had cost Rs. 20 million, not even one tenth of this amount had gone into its construction even in the estimation of an ordinary ‘mason baas’, they say. 


Meanwhile, the people in the area say that the Rs.20 million allocated would have sufficed to put up houses for 20 home-less families in the area in addition to constructing the bungalow for the school principal.
