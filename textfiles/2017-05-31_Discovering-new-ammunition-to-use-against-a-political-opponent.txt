Discovering new ammunition to use against a political opponent


	



 

A certain Diyawanna member had announced an interesting discovery he had made at an informal meeting of the JO recently.

 


 It concerned a vociferous purohita who had gone to Singapore for medical treatment in a hospital there in the recent past. 


The purohita had run a very high bill for the treatment given. But fortunately for him a certain establishment connected to both medical treatment and education at the centre of a raging controversy here these days had generously settled it. The JO leaders are yet to go public with this discovery.
