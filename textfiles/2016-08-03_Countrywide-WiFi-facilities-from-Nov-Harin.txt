Countrywide WiFi facilities from Nov: Harin


	

The government will set up WiFi hotspots at 400 locations by November 1, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said today.

“A procedure has been introduced to provide this facility, which can be accessed from any part of the country on a concessionary rate,” the minister said.“Previously there were problems with five service providers but the issues have been sorted out to some extent."

He said the government had seized high tech equipment with the capacity to tap any telephone conversation. The minister said it had been bought by the previous government at a cost of US$150,000 and that it was still in its original packing.

"We intend returning it to the company that sold it as we have nothing to do with such tapping machines. The members of the previous regime have imported such equipment to tap the telephone conversations of the then opposition UNP members,” the minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
