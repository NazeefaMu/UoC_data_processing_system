Sri Lanka and Australia shared a warm friendship and excellent cooperation on several areas of common interest, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said adding that he looked forward to working with newly elected Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to build on this friendship towards a more robust and mutually beneficial partnership.

Congratulating Scott Morrison on his election as Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and becoming the 30th Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Wickremesinghe said, the election was a manifestation of the confidence placed in his leadership qualities by his party colleagues.

“Being a former Minister of Immigration and Border Protection, who has visited Sri Lanka, you are personally aware of the close cooperation our two countries enjoy in this area,” PM Wickremesinghe said.

“It is timely that we diversify this excellent cooperation to other areas of mutual benefit, as both Governments have striven to do during recent high level contacts”, Mr Wickremesinghe in his congratulatory message to Scott Morrison said.
