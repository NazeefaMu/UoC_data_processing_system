The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry today said legal action would be taken against those misusing kerosene subsidies, which was a relief given by the President.

This would be done without considering positions of those involved and against filling stations which violate and misuse the kerosene relief given to them.

Speaking to the media, Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said an artificial increase was shown in the use of kerosene between 2014 and 2017.

About 1,38,505 kilo litres of kerosene had been used in 2014 and it was increased to 1,98,090 kilolitres in 2017, Minister Ranatunga said.

He said one litre of kerosene was selling in the market at a price of Rs.48 as a relief for the people following instructions of the President.

“The total loss for kerosene in 2017 was Rs. 5.4 billion and it had been increased by misusing the facility and furthermore the President had instructed to cancel the licence of the filling stations,”Minster said. (Chatruranga Samarawickrama)
