Double each for Samadhi and Krishan

 
Junior National Chmapions Samadhi Hettiarachchi (Mahamaya Girls College) and Krishan Wickremaratne (Vidyartha College) won a double each while Thanushi Rodrigo (Mahamaya Girls College) pocketed the Ladies Open Singles title at the first ever maiden Central Province Table Tennis Championship organized by Butterfly Table Tennis Club and sponsored by Kanumale Enterprise (Pvt) Limited and Udarata Kahata - a Tea Company based in Kandy and worked off at the Jagath Rajapakse International Table Tennis Stadium at Ganegoda off Peradeniya.
Despite the school vacation and the long weekend along with the Christmas vacation a large number of entries were received due to the efforts by the main organizing committee headed by former national coach Mahinda Ellepola (President). Ms Chandima Abeyratne (Secretary) and Induka Abeyratne (Treasurer). At the beginning this championship appeared to be a non-starter due to lack of funds to defray the expenses. Kanumale Enterprise headed by Vipul Kanumale and Udarata Kahata headed by Bimal Fernando along with other small sponsores came to their rescue.
Fourteen year old Thanushi hailing from a family known for their prowens in table tennis put up a sterling display to win the Ladies Open Singles Championship by defeating Sheshala Bandara by the convincing margin of 3-1. Sheshala Bandara who made her appearance after a lapse of nearly 18 months did impress but failed to win over her younger opponent Thanushi following a number of excellent displays has a national ranking outwitted her opponent with some smart serves and smashing the returns when necessary. Thanushi main event could not do in the age group events. She lost to Samadhi in the under 15 finals and in was pushed in the under 18 singles semi finals. But she displayed great guts to win the ladies open event. It was a great day for the family as the youngest Hasindu Rodrigo won the boys under 10 title by defeating Akesh Dimantha of Vidyartha College. Fourteen year old Samadhi at TT has come a long way since she got into the winning streak a few months back which culminated in their winning the junior national ladies title last month. A very talented paddler and many more titles are for her asking if she can only make good fight back through recoveries. At times she takes it easy and this little girl should be taught more of the game and other essentials. She won two titles here both the under 15 and under 18 events.
In the girls under 15 finals Samadhi scored a comfortable 3-1 win over the ladies Open winner Thanushi. Samadhi won the first set with ease 11/2 but Thanushi hit back with a 11/4 win in the second. Samadhi polished off the game with 12/10 wins in the next two sets.
In the girls under 18 singles Samadhi had an easy 3-0 passage over Dinithi Dissanayake. It was only in the second set that the loser put up a semblance of a fight before going down 12/10.
Krishan once again turned out to be a winner though often in the showdown of Udaya Ranasinghe. He won the boys under 18 title with a close 3-2 win over schoolmate Prasad de Silva. A grim battle was witnessed and at the end of the fourth set the scores were level at two all. But Krishan playing a cool game wrapped up the deciding fifth set with 11/4 win.
Then came the Men's Open Singles and once again it was a battle between Krishan and Prasad de Silva ad this time Krishan did one better by winning 3-1. Prasad de Silva won the first set 11/9 but Krishan won the next three sets in a row romp home with a double. The preserving Hasini Ikiriwatte of Mahamaya Girls College entered two finals but could not win both. But she looks a very promising paddler and should hear more of her in the future of 9 year old girl. In the under 10 finals she lost to Hasini Dullewa 2-1 and moving further up in the girls under 12 finals she lost to Samadhi Wedagedera also from Mahamaya Girls College.
The boys under 15 finals saw a titanic struggle between two top players in this age group between Disanka Tennakoon of Dharmaraja College and Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College, Kandy and the former scored a 3-1 win. The scores were equal by the end of the second set but Tennakooon rounded off the game by winning the next two sets. A better performance was expected from the enormously talented Chathura Gunasekera.
