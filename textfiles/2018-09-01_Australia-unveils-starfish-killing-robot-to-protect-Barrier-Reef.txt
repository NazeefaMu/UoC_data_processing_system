SYDNEY AFP Aug31, 2018- A robot submarine able to hunt and kill the predatory crown-of-thorns starfish devastating the Great Barrier Reef was unveiled by Australian researchers on Friday. 

 
Scientists at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) said the robot, named the RangerBot and developed with a grant from Google, would serve as a reef protector”for the vast World Heritage site off Australia’s northeastern coast.  


The RangerBot has an eight-hour battery life and computer vision capabilities allowing it to monitor and map reef areas at scales not previously possible.  


It is the world’s first underwater robotic system designed specifically for coral reef environments, using only robot-vision for real-time navigation, obstacle avoidance and complex science missions,”said Matthew Dunbabin, the QUT professor who unveiled the submarine.  


Multi-function ocean drone can monitor a wide range of issues facing coral reefs including coral bleaching, water quality, pest species, pollution and siltation.”Software will also enable the bot to detect crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat coral, and an injection which is fatal”to the predators, he said, adding that the injection is harmless for other reef creatures.
