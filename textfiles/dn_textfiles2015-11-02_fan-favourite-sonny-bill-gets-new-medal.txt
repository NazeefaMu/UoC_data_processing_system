Fan favourite Sonny Bill gets new medal

London: All Blacks centre Sonny Bill Williams was Sunday presented with a new World Cup winners' medal to replace the one he handed to a young fan after Saturday's final victory over Australia.
The boy, identified as 15-year-old Charlie Lines, was thrown to the ground by a security official after running on to the Twickenham pitch following New Zealand's 34-17 triumph. The 30-year-old Williams played down the incident which also saw teammate and flanker Liam Meesam give the teenager his black beanie hat. AFP
