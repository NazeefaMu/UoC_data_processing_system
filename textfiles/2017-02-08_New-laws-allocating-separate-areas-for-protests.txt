New laws will be introduced with regard to protests soon, Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake informed Parliament yesterday.

Minister Ratnayake who was speaking during an adjournment debate in the House said the government will introduce new laws while safeguarding the people’s right of association and expression which are guaranteed by the Constitution.

He said the police will be trained more professionally to handle protests and civil disturbances.

MP S. M. Marikkar who moved the adjournment debate earlier called for allocating separate areas for protests. “Continuous protests will discourage investors and will damage the reputation of the country. Therefore, arrangements should be made to allocate separate areas for protests while safeguarding the rights of the people,” he said while highlighting that several countries have implemented a system where separate areas are allocated for mass protests.

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said his party is opposed to this move as it is a violation of people’s rights. He said the Constitution have guaranteed the right of the people to convene in any location and express their ideas. He said allocation of special locations for protests will violate this right.(Yohan Perera)
