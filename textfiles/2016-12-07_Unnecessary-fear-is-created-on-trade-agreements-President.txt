Unnecessary fear is being created by interested persons on the trade agreements which Sri Lanka is planning to sign in the future, President Maithripala Sirisena told Parliament today.

Speaker during the committee stage of the budget the President said trade agreements would be signed only after disadvantageous clauses are taken away." All the trade agreements which the country intends signing will be presented to Parliament" the President said.

“We are saddened by the false statements made by some on the trade agreements including the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA)" the President added.

He said the situation is the same with military and on the national security.

“Especially false statements are being made on the Constitutional reforms even before a draft is compiled" he said.

The President who commented on yesterday's debate said it was disappointing to see MPs criticising about the way the government is dealing with the military, security and the sovereignty of the nation without coming up with alternative suggestions.

He stressed the support of the entire Parliament is essential for the country when it comes to facing internal and external challenges which the country is facing. (Yohan Perera)
