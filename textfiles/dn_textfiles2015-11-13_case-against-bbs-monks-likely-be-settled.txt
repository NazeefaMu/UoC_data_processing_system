Case against BBS monks likely to be settled

The case filed against a group of Buddhist monks attached to the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) organisation for allegedly trespassing into the Minister Rishad Bathiudeen's office in Colombo 3, is likely to be settled as the aggrieved party expressed willingness to do so.
The aggrieved party which lodged a complaint against the BBS yesterday, informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate that the complainant was willing to settle the case.
Accordingly, Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage fixed the matter for settlement on February 16. The group of Buddhist monks entered the ministry premisses in search of UPFA Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha Member Ven. Watareka Vijitha Thera. They said they had received a tip-off that Jathika Bala Sena (JBS) General Secretary Watareka Vijitha Thera was taking refuge inside the ministry building from early morning on April 23, 2014.
In a complaint to Kollupitiya Police, an additional secretary of the ministry said a group of monks had forcibly stormed the building without permission and searched the rooms for Ven. Watareka Thera.
