Mandela remembered


	



Sri Lanka today celebrated the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's birth and paid its tributes to the late anti-apartheid leader at the Independence Square, Colombo.

Mandela, who died in 2013, remains a global icon for his long fight against white-minority rule and for his message of peace and reconciliation when he was released from prison after 27 years.

His birthday on July 18 is marked annually around the world, and the Nelson Mandela Foundation called this year for people to "take action and inspire change" in Mandela's name. (Kithsiri de Mel)
