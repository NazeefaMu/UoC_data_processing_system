They haggled over the percentage!


	



 

A local investor and his foreign partner of a construction firm, which was awarded the contract for an ‘express’ project in the upcountry, the other day called at the office of a purohita on invitation.

 


Soon after their arrival, the purohita too made his appearance. 

Coming down to business straightaway, the purohita informed the investors that he expected a five per cent commission but did not mind settling for four. The investors said what they could really afford was only one per cent but they were prepared to go up to two per cent. 

The politico who looked ruffled by this reply, said: “I am prepared to give you time to reconsider my proposition.”


Having reconsidered the proposition, the investors have now decided not to go beyond the two per cent they had already conceded, they say.
