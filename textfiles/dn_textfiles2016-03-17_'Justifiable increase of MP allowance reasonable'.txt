'Justifiable increase of MP allowance reasonable'

We are against a 'thundering' increase of MPs' allowances but it is reasonable to increase them by a justifiable amount to match with the salary increase given to public servants, Health Services Trade Union Alliance President Saman Rathnapriya said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday he said however that the proposed increments had not even been presented to Parliament yet, and so there was nothing to worry about immediately. "At the moment the country is suffering from various burning issues - economic issues, farmers' issues, debt issues caused due to the conduct of the previous regime etc.," he said.
"It is unacceptable to increase MPs' allowance at this time," he said. "We request the Speaker to throw the proposal away."
