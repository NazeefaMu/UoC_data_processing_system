The police on a tip-off arrested a man called ‘Podi Bennett’ and his mother who had 400 grammes of heroin in their possession.
When questioned, Podi Bennett had told police that they were on their way to his brother- Thotalanga Bennett- described as the main heroine distributor in Wattala area.
Going by his statements, Narcotics police officers led by Inspector Rangajeewa raided the house belonging to Thotalanga Bennett and seized 2.6 kilogrammes of heroin together with cash amounting to Rs. 475,000.
Police said Thotalanga Bennett had thrown a parcel containing heroin out of the house after seeing the police storming his house. However, their escape bids failed and five suspects were arrested by the police.
