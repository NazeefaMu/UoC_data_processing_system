While claiming that good governance has now shattered, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said that they joined the government at the invitation of the President in order to serve the people of the country but it is not possible to give all what they want which is only practicable through miracles of Aladdin’s Wonder Lamp or with the presence of God Sakra.
 
"President Maithripala Sirisena’s intention of abolishing the Executive Presidency is appreciable," he said addressing an event in Ella, Badulla.
 
He also said they cannot leave the SLFP to dilute for the sake of National Government and we should determine to win the on-coming local government election. During the last election period people were duped through Face Book and presenting tinsels but they have all vanished today.
 
"The Face Book miracles and good governance has shattered.Those who spoke of good governance and corruption today oppress the people in the name of good governance," he said.
