Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the USA, Jaliya Wickramasuriya, who was charged with misappropriating USD 332,000 from state funds when purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan embassy in Washington, was re-remanded till January 13 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today.

However, the suspect was not presented to court today due to bad health. The Prisons Authority has  submitted a medical report on the suspect’s health condition.

Meanwhile, the defence counsel informed court that a written bail application would be submitted  soon on behalf of the suspect, seeking bail on exceptional circumstances.

The FCID filed charges under section 5 of the Public Property Act, where a suspect who has misappropriated public properties or assets for more than Rs. 25,000 has no bail relief unless granted for exceptional circumstances or by a High Court Judge. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
