Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the government was aiming to achieve a 9% growth by 2030 and though the task could be termed difficult it was not an impossible task.
“We have to achieve this by 2030. We must become a high income country. All our efforts have to be mobilized to achieve this goal. With the mini budget 2015, we increased the aggregate demand so that there is surplus in the hands of ordinary people. It is already seen in the increase in consumer goods. But there is still a lot of available and untapped consumable income in the economy, especially in the balance sheets of some of our companies,” he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said they wanted to ensure that a strong middle class exists in this country. “A lot of what happens in the coming years cannot be controlled by us. It is going to be in the hands of actors outside this country,” he said.
He said the country would have a high deficit initially but as investments grow and as revenue grows and we bring more and more people into the net, the government should be able to achieve its target for 2020.
