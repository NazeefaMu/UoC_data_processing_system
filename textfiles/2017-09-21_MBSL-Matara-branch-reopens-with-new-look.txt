Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL) recently extended its new design and look to its Matara branch to provide customers a redefined financing experience. 


The upgraded and relocated branch at Anagarika Dharmapala Mawatha, Nupe, Matara was formally inaugurated by MBSL Chairman Dr Sujeewa Lokuhewa in the presence of the company’s management, staff, invitees, customers and well-wishers. 


The new premises is strategically located to ensure easier access to the branch for customers in the locality and persons passing through the area,  making it much more convenient for existing customers and potential customers to access the full range of finance expertise provided by MBSL. The premises are also more spacious and equipped to provide a comfortable ambiance for customers. The relocated Matara branch is the second in MBSL’s model branch concept, the first being the Gampaha branch, which was upgraded last month.


“MBSL has assets valued at over Rs.35 billion and deposits which exceed Rs.20 billion and serves over 200,000 customers through a network of 48 branches and business places. It is with pride that I inform you that while providing optimum service to our customers we were able to increase our profits by 209% last year. In keeping with our vision to be the most innovative business solution provider to the nation, MBSL has decided to upgrade its branch network to serve the public more efficiently,” said the MBSL Chairman Dr. Sujeewa Lokuhewa at the opening ceremony.


“As an innovative financial solution provider in the country, MBSL has always represented quality of life improvements for the people of this country, and as we pursue our growth objectives this will continue to be a primary focus through new products and services and improvements to existing facilities and services,” said the MBSL CEO Nishaman Karunapala.


“The new location of the Matara branch will enhance customer convenience significantly and will contribute towards our growth drive by supporting market expansion within the region. As always, our highly trained staff is dedicated towards the highest quality of services, and I believe the combination of convenience, range of services and quality of personnel, will result in improved performance,” he further said.
