A rumour doing rounds in political circles says that a purohita who happens to be a leader of a minority party on the political fringe has acquired a TV channel and a Radio channel. 

 


This purohita whose name is closely linked to Vilpattu has planned to use the two electronic media outfits for the propaganda of a new opposition political alliance now in the making and he is in constant touch with the political sibling of the former strongman who is described as the ‘master brain’ behind the new political alliance, they say.
