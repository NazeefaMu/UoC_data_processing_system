The Ministry of Law and Order had now completed the exercise of identifying locations that can be permanently allocated for protests, sources from the Prime Minister’s office said yesterday.

Sources said they had been instructed to do so by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“The locations chosen would be ones that do not inconvenience the public and are easily accessible by the those who want to carry out protests,” the sources added. However, the sources did not divulge the locations that had been selected. (Yohan Perera)
