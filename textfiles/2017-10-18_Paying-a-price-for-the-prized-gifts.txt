A story making rounds in political circles these days says that a group of Diyawanna members who had received ‘gratifications’ from the Bondman now down and out will soon be called upon to submit their explanations. 

 


Meanwhile, the FICD has received a complaint that five Diyawanna members had got vehicles as gifts from the Bondman. The complainants also had provided documentary evidence in this regard. 


By the way, the FICD has received an order from above that the complaint be looked into.  So the people will soon come to know who the thick chums of the Bondman are, they say.
