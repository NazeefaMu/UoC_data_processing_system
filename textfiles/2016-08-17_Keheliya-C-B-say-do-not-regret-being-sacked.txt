Keheliya, C.B. say do not regret being 'sacked'


	

Joint Opposition MPs Keheliya Rambukwella and C.B. Ratnayake, who were removed from their posts as SLFP organisers, said they did not regret being ousted from their posts.

MP Rambukwella said he was very happy about being removed as the SLFP organiser of the Kundasale Electorate and added that it should have been done earlier.

He said people were not ready to accept the organisers appointed by SLFP Chairman and President Maithripala Sirisena. “I see this as a personnel victory as I can now work without any fear as an Opposition MP to protest against the undemocratic actions of the government,” he said.

C. B. Ratnayake, who was removed as the organiser of the Walapane Electorate in the Nuwara Eliya District, said he too had no regrets about the decision taken by the SLFP Chairman and President Maithripala Sirisena to oust him.

He said the removal of Joint Opposition members as SLFP organisers would lead to further divisions within the party and that it would have a negative affect on the party in the future.

He said most of the organisers who were removed had strong voter bases and deeply rooted family ties in their respective areas. “I have been the organiser of the Nuwara Eliya District since 1992. I have no regrets about being removed. I will continue to work for the people in my district as a MP. Family politics also play a major role in politics as in the case of the Senanayakes, the Bandaranaikes and the Rajapaksas. People still rally round such families, he said.
