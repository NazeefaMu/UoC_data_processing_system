He avoided defending the appointment


	



 

An appointment made to a high judicial office recently triggered a big controversy in the country. 

 


Contradictory statements made by the government high-ups and the Bar association created much confusion about the issue later. 


While the controversy was raging, a big-mouthed deputy hailing from the Kalutara area received a message from the palace asking him to hold a media briefing without delay to show cause to justify the appointment. 


However, the deputy, a member from the black-coated gentry himself, had kept on dodging complying with the request giving some excuse or other. 


Livid over the deputy’s callous disregard for his request, an authority in the highest echelons has now given some specific instructions to the purohita handling the power and energy subject, they say.
