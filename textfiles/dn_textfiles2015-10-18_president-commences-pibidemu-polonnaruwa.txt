President commences Pibidemu Polonnaruwa

Pibidemu Polonnaruwa (Awakening of Polonnaruwa) District Development Project commenced on Saturday, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President, symbolizing the commencement of the project, laid the foundation stone to a new class room building at Aralaganvila, Vilayaya Madya Maha Vidyalaya.
Under the five year development project “Siya Vasaka Dura Dakina Pas Vasaka Diga Heruma (Five Year Plan of Hundred Year Vision)”, implemented under the concept of President Sirisena, all sectors in Polonnaruwa, including roads, electricity, agriculture, education, health and environment will be comprehensively developed.
“When some areas in Sri Lanka were marching towards a rapid transformation during the last decade, I was lamenting as the representative of the people of Polonnaruwa due to the inability to make the relevant transformation for Polonnaruwa,” he said. “Polonnaruwa will be taken to a rapid development through ‘Pibidemu Polonnaruwa’, giving the benefits of the development to the people there,” he said.
The President stated that the government has started the programme to uplift all people economically by developing not only Polonnaruwa, but also the entire country. He said some people are trying to create a dissatisfaction about the government among the people by spreading misinformation.
He mentioned the new government has decided to increase the funds for education by four folds than the amount allocated so far, in the next budget. “It will be provided from 2016,” the president said.
Development plan of the SiyaVasaka Dura Dakina Pas Vasaka Diga Heruma was presented to the President at the function.
President Sirisena opened the newly built technological building at the Aralaganvila, Vilayaya Madya Maha Vidyalaya.
People in Mahaweli ‘B’ and ‘C’ Zones were presented land licenses at this occasion. The President presented few land licenses symbolizing the handing over of more than 2,500 licenses among the people.
