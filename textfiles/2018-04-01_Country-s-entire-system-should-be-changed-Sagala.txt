Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said that the country’s entire system should be reshaped in terms of safeguarding the future of the youth.

He said so while attending the closing ceremony of the ‘Yowun Puraya 2018’, the national youth programme which was held at the Livestock Development Centre in Nikaweratiya on Saturday.

“Youthfulness is a radical fraction and as a government, we have a responsibility to guide such radicalism in the correct path. It was this radicalism supported to make a huge political turn in January and August 2015,” he said.

He said ‘Yowun Puraya’ was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s concept and he had a future vision for these youths.

The Minister said that the time had come to stop family politics and everyone, including the youth, should be given an equal opportunity.

He added that despite the political situation in the country its entire system should be changed in order to create a better future for the youth. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
