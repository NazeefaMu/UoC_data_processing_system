Halloween fun

Leading local dramatists and puppeteers Power of Play return this month with a weekend of fun and excitement in celebration of Halloween.
"We are celebrating Halloween in our signature style of allowing imaginations to run riot to empower young participants" explains Power of Play Founder and Artistic Director, Sulochana Dissanayake in a press release issued by Power of Play. "We have put together two events that will not only cater to everything that is fun, exciting and spooky about the day, but will also link in with unique elements central to our approach of allowing safe and nurturing spaces for youngsters - to create and experiment to their hearts content, free of competition and pressures of performance."
Telling Tales, an interactive performance workshop designed to allow children to express themselves via improvisation, movement, music, props, puppetry and more, will take place on Friday, October 30 from 5.30 to 6.30pm at Cargills Bookcity, 3rd floor, Majestic City. The workshop is ideal for 6-12 year olds to improve their communication skills and build confidence for dynamic self-expression.
Those interested can join Power of Play and Craftshowk at Milk for a morning of stories, craft and yummy treats on Saturday October 31 from 9.30am to 12.30pm. Participants are invited to dress up in the Halloween costume of their choice and prepare for a morning of improvisation followed by a chance to create something beautiful using recycled materials. The mornings' activity will be followed by scarily delicious goodies courtesy the Milk and Honey cafe. The event is for children between the ages of 6 and 12. However, younger participants are also welcome if chaperoned.
Both events will be conducted primarily in English with brief translations into Sinhala as required. For information on both events visit www.powerofplay.lk
