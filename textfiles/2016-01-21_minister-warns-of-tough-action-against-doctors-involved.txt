Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today warned that the names of any Sri Lankan surgeon found to be involved in the controversial kidney transplant scam would be struck off the Medical Register despite his or her social or professional status and added the findings of the report he had ordered would be forwarded to the CID for legal action.
Addressing the media at the weekly cabinet news briefing yesterday he said he called for a a thorough inquiry into the controversy from Director General Health Services within a week.
Responding to a journalist whether the Health Ministry had identified any Sri Lankan doctor connected to the alleged scam, Minister Senaratne said the Health Ministry was awaiting more information on those allegedly involved but names of Sri Lankan doctors had been exposed by the Indian media.
Answering to another query he said the purchase and sale of human organs was illegal in Sri Lanka and the procedure in organ transplant was to find a donor to donate the organ free.
Meanwhile, the Health and Nutrition Ministry yesterday suspended kidney transplants on foreign nationals at government and private hospitals with immediate effect.
Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has given instructions to suspend kidney transplants on foreigners in the wake of media reports in India and Sri Lanka that six Sri Lankan doctors had been involved in a scam to transplant Kidneys on foreigners who had been recommended for transplants with kidneys purchased from Indians of low income groups.
The Indian Police has launched an inquiry on the racket and four doctors have already been apprehended for their alleged involvement.
Meanwhile, Director General, Health Services Dr. Palitha Mahipala said the Health Ministry has also ordered a thorough investigation into the scam and added there would be no restrictions at all for kidney transplant surgeries performed in state or private hospitals in Sri Lanka for Sri Lankans.
