As the world of commerce becomes increasingly connected, consumers are continually seeking faster, more seamless and secure commerce solutions. This is putting the payments ecosystem under greater pressure to develop and deploy innovative payment solutions at a faster rate than ever before. To meet this challenge, MasterCard announced the launch of MasterCard Integrated, the payments processing services platform that powers MasterCard payment transaction services. The platform enables issuers and acquirers to launch secure payment programmes to their customers with greater speed and convenience. 
MasterCard will now offer fully-integrated hosted processing services, supporting all payment brands. This further expands the role of MasterCard during the payments process, extending beyond its traditional network-branded switching services. In addition to traditional issuers and acquirers, MasterCard now also enables governments to build and manage entire payments ecosystems as they look to create better, smarter payment options.
“We are excited to be able to offer fully-integrated processing services for all payment brands through MasterCard Integrated in Sri Lanka now. Being a market where issuers and acquirers truly appreciate the convenience and security offered by electronic payment solutions, I look forward to seeing our customers adopt this solution and expedite their time to market, offering ever more innovative, secure payment programmes,” said MasterCard Executive Director South Asia Vikas Varma. “In today’s world of rapid technology and regulatory changes, those in the payments ecosystem need to be nimbler in order to keep up. In order to do so, our customers - issuing and acquiring banks and governments - seek best-in-class technology platforms and services that are reliable and more secure so they can focus on growth and providing greater value to their consumers,” said MasterCard Senior Vice President Network, Processing and Security Solutions Asia/Pacific Rama Sridhar.
“The launch of MasterCard Integrated is our effort to help our customers bring payment products integrated with the digital innovations to consumers in a secure, efficient and speedy manner. Our payments processing platforms have been deployed in multiple MasterCard data centres around the world and will provide truly seamless global connectivity that only MasterCard can,” Sridhar added.
