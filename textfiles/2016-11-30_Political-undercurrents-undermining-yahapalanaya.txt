A betel leaf Diyawanna member from the gem-rich district, a die-hard loyalist of the former strongman had a heart-to-heart chat with another Betel leaf member now holding a high office in yahapalanaya.

 


 Niceties over, their conversation had turned to the current political situation. Asked as to how long the political marriage underpinning yahapalanaya would last, the high political authority had confessed that he himself had no love for the Green ones. Later they had exchanged their candid views on a series of possible political changes and crossovers in the offing and the Ratnapura politico had confided that their former boss was privy to many more “secrets” which could make an impact on the country’s political scenario in the near future.
