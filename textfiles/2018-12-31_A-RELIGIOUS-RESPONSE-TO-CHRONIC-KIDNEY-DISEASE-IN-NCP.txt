A RELIGIOUS RESPONSE TO CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE IN NCP


	

he pathetic situation of the people who are becoming victims of the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the North Central Province has drawn the attention of the Consecrated persons – the Religious – ministering in the diocese of Anuradhapura. For the Religious, there are different possible ways of concretising the one vocation to follow Christ. Nevertheless, what is most significant about each is not that which is distinctive but that which they share in common: love of God, living in Christ and serving the people who are in pain and need, with compassionate love. 


The Regional Religious Unit (RRU), composed of priests and nuns belonging to ten Religious Congregations, headed by Rev. Fr. Felix Mellawarachchi, SDB, is finding ways and means to provide some relief to those who are prone to this disease (CKD) and also temporary shelter to the relatives who come from distant places to see the sick persons in the government hospital and other medical facilities at Anuradhapura. The decision for such a commitment originated in RRU at a special Day of Prayer held at the Holy Family Convent, Talawa on February 17, 2018. 

Knowing more about the Situation

At a workshop organized by the Regional Religious Unit (RRU), on May 9, 2018 at Rajabima Oblate Centre, Anuradhapura, Prof. Channa Jayasumana, MBBS, PhD, FRCP Edin, Head, Dept. of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Allied Sciences, Rajarata University, Anuradhapura, said according to Prof. S.A.M. Kularatne who had been a consultant physician in the General Hospital, Anuradhapura in the 1990s, it was only in 1995 that he had come across sporadic cases of CKD inviting his attention. 


He had discovered that number of CKD was increasing and in 1996 more than 100 CKD patients were from Medawachchiya, Padaviya and Kebithigollawa in NCP Medical research has proved that this situation has been caused by excessive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and weedicides for the cultivation of paddy, vegetables and fruits during the past several years and also through occupational exposure of the agricultural communities to herbicides. As a result, many have become victims of CKD. Their findings show that this disease is festering at a frightening speed. According to hospital sources, more than 650 kidney patients visit the main Anuradhapura Hospital OPD daily and about 350 are for dialysis. Dialysis is given to kidney patients in the hospitals but many patients are unable to find financial resources to obtain this help. Many families therefore are compelled to pawn their jewellery and mortgage their property. 


According to Prof. Channa Jayasumana there is a dramatic increase of chronic kidney disease and diabetes in NCP. He says that there are 44,000 CKD patients in the district of Anuradhapura and 18,000 in the district of Polonnaruwa (Lankadeepa, Sept., 16, 2018). Recently a team of specialists of the Rajarata University under the leadership of Prof. Jayasumana, had conducted a survey in the schools and had discovered that 10% of the 5000 school children were suffering due to CKD in the district of Anuradhapura. What will be the situation of the children in the future – their survival and livelihood?
Prof. Jayasumana says the situation has been aggravated by using multiple chemical fertilisers without proper personal protective equipment, living in areas with low elevation, eating rice, vegetables and fruits and drinking water from the same area and being subjected to dehydration. Non-availability of safe drinking water and for the preparation of food is one of the main problems affecting the vast majority of the people living in the North Central Province (NCP). 

Follow-up of workshop: A special Committee 

As a follow-up of the workshop conducted by Prof. Jayasumana on May 9, the RRU set up a special committee composed of Rev. Fr. Felix Mellawarachchi,SDB,Rev. Fr. Dileepa Jayamaha, OMI,Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Fernando OMI,Rev. Sr. Alexia P.C. and Rev. Sr. Helen Fernando HF to propose concrete measures.  Besides creating awareness among the people in NCP regarding CKD, the special committee decided to raise funds to provide water filters (purifiers) and help control the spread of kidney related disease.
