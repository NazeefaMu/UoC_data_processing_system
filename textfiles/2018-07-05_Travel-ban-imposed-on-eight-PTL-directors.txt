Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today restricted eight directors of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd from travelling abroad without the permission of the Court.

Geoffrey Aloysius, Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Anton, Chitra Ranjan Hulugalle, Pushya Mithra Gunawardena, Muthuraja Surendran, Ajan Punchihewa and Sanjeewa Fernando who were directors of PTL have been restricted by the Court over traveling abroad.

Allowing the prosecution's request to partially ban the travel abroad, the Magistrate observed the fact that PTL as the company is a suspect into the inquiry and in the event if the company is found guilty the directors of the company may be also held liable on behalf of the company.
