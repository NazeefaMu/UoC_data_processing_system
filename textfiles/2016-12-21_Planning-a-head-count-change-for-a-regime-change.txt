Planning a head count change for a regime change?


	



 

It was the former strongman who said the other day that a regime change could be brought about by a change in the head count in the Diyawanna council. 

 


It appears that the Greens have taken a cue from the proposition made by the war horse. For there is talk that an enthusiastic group of Greens bent on forming a government of their own is busy trying all means of raising their present head count of 106 to 115.


Duggie from the North and the cockerels from the hills are said to be quite willing and are waiting for the Green signal, but the objections coming from the ones ruling the roost in the North-East now backing the government from the opposition have become a stumbling block to such a coalition.


By the way, moves by the Greens to go it alone have sent the former powerful madam into a flutter and she is marshalling all the wit and wisdom gained during her long career in politics to keep the unity government in one piece, they say.  Meanwhile, all main political parties have decided to put on hold all their important political moves and manipulations pending the Shani Graha Maruwa, astrologically significant event of Saturn’s entry into a new zodiacal house on January 26 next year.
