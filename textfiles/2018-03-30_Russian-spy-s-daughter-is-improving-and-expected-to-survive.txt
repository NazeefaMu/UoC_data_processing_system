Russian spy’s daughter is improving and expected to survive


	



 

The daughter of poisoned spy Sergei Skripal is ‘improving rapidly’ in hospital and her condition is now ‘stable’, doctors have said.  


In a statement, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust said Yulia Skripal is ‘improving rapidly and is no longer in a critical condition’.  


The development could prove key to the investigation into the chemical weapons attack - as it may mean Ms Skripal could soon be able to tell police about the moments before she and her father collapsed in a park.  


She could also potentially identify whoever carried out the attack - which is now thought to have taken place at Mr Skripal’s suburban home.  


Her father remains in a ‘critical but stable’ condition after the nerve attack three and a half weeks ago, the NHS trust said.  


Dr Christine Blanshard, medical director for Salisbury District Hospital, said: ‘I’m pleased to be able to report an improvement in the condition of Yulia Skripal.  


‘She has responded well to treatment but continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day.  
‘I want to take this opportunity to once again thank the staff of Salisbury District Hospital for delivering such high quality care to these patients over the last few weeks. I am very proud both of our front-line staff and all those who support them.’  


The NHS trust has not said whether Ms Skripal is conscious or speaking.
