New vistas at Vista Lite

 
Man's imagination knows no bounds. Millions of films have gripped the world with its creativity and it keeps on growing. It creates change and it creates a thought revolution. It has transformed the lives of so many through fiction and non -fiction. Every year thousands of films come out in almost every region of the world. It is one of humanity's greatest achievements. Great minds like Stan Lee have created their own brand of films, like Stan Lee's hugely successful marvel comics. People are crazy about marvel comic movies because they bring excitement. The Daily News visited Ja-Ela to check out the hype generated with the opening of Vista Lite.
"I believe the opening of a cinema is a worthwhile effort. From what I can remember in 2014, five cinema halls mushroomed. However, last year, only one cinema hall opened. We have great expectations this year because this being the month of January, we have already opened up Vista Lite. New cinema halls entering the cinema system in Sri Lanka is important to the industry. One factor that has to be taken into consideration is the quality of the cinema hall. That is of vital importance," said Secretary Exhibitors Association, Nishantha Pradeep Mohittige.
"Here we are using state-of-the-art technology. Vista Lite is equipped with the latest 4K digital projection systems coupled with 7.1 digital surround sounds and 'eye popping' 3D to give our patrons the ultimate movie going experience," Mohittige added.
Movie Works is an entertainment based company involved in building and operating state-of-the-art luxury mini cinemas. The Cinemas are Liberty Lite (Colombo 3), Amity Lite (Maharagama), Sky Lite (Matara) and the latest addition is Vista Lite at K Zone Ja-Ela.

The brains behind the company are the duo Palitha Perera - Director Technology and Anura Jasenthuliyana - Managing Director.
"These two sometimes work night and day to bring quality to the cinema industry. Their contribution to the enjoyment of their patrons is commendable. So they have brought all of this forward. Their companionship has been the pillars of movie works. So we must strengthen our effort to provide quality entertainment to patrons of this country and for this we appeal to the media. This is also for those who are in the industry right now and for future generations," Perera said.
Vista Lite was originally intended as a shopping space with K-Zone being a shopping complex but the open space was later converted to the cinema.
"After much deliberation, we were able to build this cinema which is comfortable and fulfills all expectations. So this cinema hall has 200 seats. We want the patrons to have an 'out of this world' experience with the best technology and draw audiences from Ja-Ela," said Perera.
The ceremonial opening of the Vista Lite 3D Cinema was held on January 22 with the screening of the Star Wars in 3D.
"We intend to offer the magical creations of Hollywood and Bollywood at a very reasonable rate of Rs. 300 along with the worldwide release in a luxurious and true cinematic environment. The ticket purchase is facilitated via online with www.tickets.lk. Vista Lite project partners are John Keells Holdings. Their initiative is to include a modern cinema in one of the most sought after shopping malls in Sri Lanka," said Jasenthuliyana.
K- Zone Ja-Ela is a modern day shopper's dream which has been modeled on the image of Wal- Mart Stores in America. It has a food court, Gymnasium, banks and supermarket.
"Vista Lite wants to go to the crowds in Ja-Ela and get them on board so they can experience some quality stuff. The screen we are using must be specially mentioned because it is one of the best. It is a new screen type," pointed out Perera.
It has been seven years since the day when Anura Jasenthuliyana and Palitha Perera started their endeavour.
"It has been a long journey. Liberty Lite, Kollupitiya was our 'first born'. We have been friends for a long time as schoolmates and boarders for almost 10 years. Our passion was film. We would watch as many films as possible. Once we were caught by our warden when we were watching a film in the hall! We had a close relationship with cinema even though at that time we had no understanding of the technology used. Even today in the world the number one entertainment are movies. This will never leave or become outdated. It is forever. So this endeavor of ours is a labour of love. So we have been able to do all of this because of that chemistry. We also believed in ourselves and in each other. So it has been an eventful journey starting from Liberty Lite. So this gives me genuine pleasure to see all of you here to view this cinema before its opening. So now it is finally complete and has come to fruition. And I am very satisfied about this," said Jasenthuliyana.
Jasenthuliyana emphasized that we must keep up with the development of cinema all over the world. This includes technology and latest releases.
"So we want to capture the essence of Hollywood and Bollywood. Our plan is to release the films in Sri Lanka as soon as they have been released in other parts of the world. So we want to give this opportunity to our filmgoers."
