Every sport will be developed, says Minister

We want to amend the sports act to achieve common goals by developing every sport in the country and there are no personal gains at all, said the Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara on Wednesday.
Although there were instances of direct involvement of politicians in sports in the past I would not intervene in the matters of sports associations particularly in AGMs, he added.
Speaking at a press conference held at CR and FC auditorium regarding the South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) sponsorship for the women's national rugby team the minister also highlighted that all sports associations will be functioning independently in the future keeping their goal as the development of sports.
I will appoint a tribunal consisting of retired judges to solve problems of sports associations, issues regarding AGMs and problems of athletes so that any party do not want to go to courts, he added.
The minister also said it is best that each sports association form an independent committee to hold elections.
The minister also added that there will be amendments in the sports act regarding the period of terms of officials in sports associations in order to get the service of experienced officials and also to give opportunity for new comers. SAGT's sponsorship ensures Sri Lankan Women's rugby team will secure its opportunity to compete in Japan and Hong Kong later this year as part of the Olympic qualifiers for Brazil 2016 where women's rugby will be included as an Olympic sport for the first time.
Women's rugby in Sri Lanka started in the early 1970s and the first international competitions was held in 2000 against visiting Griffins from the USA. Sri Lankan women won both encounters.
Since then Sri Lankan women's 7's team has been a regular participant in the Asian 7s circuit and continues to emerge as a regional powerhouse successively winning the plate championship in 2013 and 2014.
The current women's rugby national team primarily consists of representatives from the forces. Furthermore over 20 schools teams and 12 clubs with registered women's rugby teams, the sport continues to draw grass roots interest in a game traditionally belonging to male domain.
World Rugby (WR) views the development of women's rugby as a priority with an edict to rugby administrations around the globe to promote it as part of the overall growth of rugby in their country.
The Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) has already secured the services of a full time international women's rugby development manager with a mandate to build a sustainable development structure to promote the game islandwide.
Commenting on the partnership SAGT's Chief Commercial Officer Ted Muttiah said women in rugby just as women in our industry, the maritime industry have been trailblazers in a traditionally male dominant arena. Gender diversity continues to present enormous unrealized potential for just about any industry and indeed sport.
He further said team SAGT is very pleased to partner with the SLRFU in taking Sri Lanka's best women rugby players onto the international stage. Sri Lanka women's rugby at the Olympics will be a proud occasion for all.
SLRFU president Asanga Seneviratne commented that Women's team has not lived upto expectations in the past so they decided to get the support of SAGT and work according to a plan to reach higher standards.
He also stressed the importance of finding rural talent and bring them to the national pool to strengthen national squad.
Sri Lanka Women's rugby coach Miss Kat Merchant, SAGT Commercial and Marketing Manager Ms Dashma Karunaratne were also present.
