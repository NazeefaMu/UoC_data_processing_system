Referring to the incident where an eagle had attempted to grab a child at Sucharithagama in Anuradhapura on Wednesday, the Wildlife Conservation Department denied it, saying it was difficult to find such huge eagles in Sri Lanka.

The Park Ranger in the Wildlife Health Management Division, Pandulagama, Anuradhapura, K.B Dahanayaka said there were no eagles in Sri Lanka that were capable of carrying a weight similar to that of a baby.

“These types of eagles belong to the category of White Bellied Sea Eagles that can be frequently seen in the coastal areas and around large tanks. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
